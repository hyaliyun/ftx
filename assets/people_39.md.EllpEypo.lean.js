It features an original story based on the Ghostbusters films, and is unrelated to a 1984 Ghostbusters game by Activision. The game was released in the United States in August 1990, and was released in the United Kingdom later that year. A Brazilian version by Tec Toy was released for the console in 1991. Gameplay Ghostbusters is a platform shoot 'em up with side-scrolling gameplay. The game's story involves ghosts terrorizing a city after an earthquake. The game features a choice of three playable Ghostbuster characters from the films: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler. The Ghostbusters each have their own traits relating to speed and shooting strength, and they are each animated with oversized heads meant to resemble their respective actor's likeness. The player can crouch, jump, and is equipped with a positron gun, which can be shot in all directions and is used to eliminate ghosts. The player earns money by eliminating ghosts, and can use the funds to buy upgraded weapons through shops that appear in between levels. Upgraded weapons include a bomb and a gun that emits flames. The player can also purchase a shield that provides temporary invincibility. Money is also used to buy food for health replenishment. Ghostbusters includes six levels, including four which are set in haunted residential buildings and can be played in any order. The objective of the Ghostbusters is to retrieve pieces of a stone tablet from each of the four initial levels by ridding the areas of ghosts. \\"Middle ghosts\\" appear during the middle portion of a level and must be eliminated to progress to the main boss enemy at the end. Middle ghosts include Slimer from the films, while boss enemies include the first film's Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. The player must capture each boss enemy after its defeat. The fifth level, set in a medieval castle, only becomes available upon completion of the other levels, and is followed by a final battle. The game features 22 selectable musical scores, including Ray Parker Jr.'s song \\"Ghostbusters\\". Reception Mean Machines praised the introduction sequence, the graphics, and the variety of options, but stated that it \\"won't keep you occupied for months.\\" The magazine concluded that the game was \\"fairly enjoyable\\" and that it would likely appeal most to people who enjoy platform games. Julian Boardman of Raze liked the graphics, but criticized the gameplay as repetitive and average. The Games Machine praised the playable character sprites for resembling their film counterparts, but criticized the simple and repetitive backgrounds. The magazine stated that it was one of the better platform games available for the Genesis, but that it \\"doesn't really capture the spirit of the film\\". Robert Swan of Computer and Video Games praised the graphics, including the playable character sprites. He also praised the in-game music, but criticized the game's version of Parker's \\"Ghostbusters\\" song, considering it a \\"major let- down\\". Swan considered the game addictive despite its difficulty. Eugene Lacey of ACE praised the design of the game's ghosts, but believed that Parker's song had been rendered better in other Ghostbusters games. In 2004, Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 stated that it was one of the better movie-licensed games of its time, although he was disappointed by the minimum amount of visual effects, and stated that the opening theme music \\"has to be the worst rendition of Ray Parker Jr.'s classic that has ever been recorded and will quickly poison your enthusiasm.\\" Horowitz stated that the game had good graphics upon its release, but that it \\"may not look all that appealing by today's standards\\". In 2008, Levi Buchanan of IGN stated that the game was \\"pretty cool\\" upon its release, especially for Ghostbusters fans, but wrote that it was now \\"something of a mediocre side-scroller,\\" stating that the graphics were still adequate but that the gameplay was \\"fairly tame compared to what would come later\\" on the Genesis. Buchanan also questioned the absence of the Ghostbuster character Winston Zeddemore. In 2014, Robert Workman of Shacknews ranked it among the top three best Ghostbusters games. Although Workman believed that there were superior Sega platform games available at the time of its release, he stated that the game had an \\"innocuous charm to it\\". In 2016, Luke McKinney of Den of Geek called the game \\"pretty decent\\" but ranked it among the weirdest Ghostbusters games, for its \\"macrocephalic\\" Ghostbuster characters and its absence of Winston.

Life  Clague was born in c.1880, the son of Henry Clague, a Douglas draper. After leaving the Douglas Higher Grade School (later the Douglas High School), Clague entered the main Douglas Post Office as a probationer, where he served until transferring to Liverpool at the opening of the new General Post Office there. After about 11 years in Liverpool, he returned to the Isle of Man in 1910, when he entered the controlling staff on the Main Post Office in Douglas. He remained in this position until retiring in October 1939, having reached the retiring age limit. Whilst in Liverpool, Clague became a qualified signaller attached to the Liverpool Scottish Territorial Battalion. Upon returning to Douglas, he became honorary instructor of signalling to the Isle of Man Volunteer Battalion. At the outbreak of the First World War, Clague was called up and attached to the Royal Engineers, but was soon brought back to the Isle of Man after protestations by the Island's Head Postmaster. Throughout the rest of the war Clague was in charge of the post office at Knockaloe Internment Camp. At the outbreak of the Second World War Clague became employed by the Military Service Division of Government Office but later joined the Food Control Division. He came to be Food Controller before falling ill in around June 1946. He died about a month later, at his home, 30 Alexandra Drive, Douglas, on Sunday 28 July 1946.  Manx dialect  From at least 1922 Clague was performing in Manx dialect theatre, being commended for his part in a play by W. B. Meyrick for his having 'provided many humorous incidents.' As well his performances, Clague also wrote a number of poems in Manx dialect. One of these, The Peel Manx Tea Party, became popular as a performance piece during his lifetime, including among Manx emigrants to North America. The poem continues to be performed today, despite never having been published in either the Manx newspapers or in book form. because it today has no single written source, the poem is known by a number of titles, including 'The Peel Tay Fight' and 'The Tay Fight at Peel.' The poem can also be heard in a number of small variants, but one version of its opening stanza is as follows: > :Have thou aver been to a tay fight in the counthry of oul Mona‚Äôs Isle? > :Thou haven‚Äôt! ‚Äì well then jus‚Äô listen a minute, sit down and res‚Äô a while, > :And I‚Äôll do me bes‚Äô to tell yer, of a do that was given in Peel, :Aw, them > Peel gals are the boys, they‚Äôre sayin‚Äô, to provide a tremenjous good meal.

It takes place each April on a college campus. Unlike the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl, which debates cases across the curriculum from agricultural and engineering ethics to issues of grade inflation and communications, the Bioethics Bowl focuses exclusively on ethical issues in the health and biological sciences.  Format  In late January or early February, the competing teams, judges, and moderators receive 15 case studies which represent controversial bioethical issues. The goals for each team is both to do research on the cases and to formulate well-structured, logical analyses pertaining to 3 questions posed (in advance) about each case. In each round, the first team gets one of the 12-15 cases randomly assigned plus one of the 3 questions from the moderator. The first team then has 10 minutes to present: (1) the central moral issues of the cases, and (2) alternative points of view. The responding team then comments for 5 minutes on the first team's analysis, and the first team then responds for 5 more minutes to these comments. Finally, a panel of 3 judges asks questions for 10 minutes to the presenting team. The judges then pause to evaluate the first teams' response and the second team's comments. The round then repeats this format with the second team receiving a question about a different case.  History  It began in 2008 at Union College in Schenectady, New York in connection with the 11th National Undergraduate Bioethics Conference, (which consisted of outside speakers for students‚Äô and poster presentations by students). Michael Mathias, who coached Union‚Äôs Ethics Bowl team from 2003-2007, organized the first Bioethics Bowl at Union College, with the help of Bob Baker. It had 11 cases and six teams. Bob Ladenson and Patrick Croskery, founders of the Ethics Bowl, enthusiastically supported this new Bowl. The following year, Harvard University hosted in Cambridge, MA. Bioethicist Peter Singer then gave the keynote address and 12 teams participated. By 2017, the burden of supporting NUBC as a conference organized by undergraduates grew too much, when the Bioethics Bowl also almost collapsed. In 2017, to keep something going, Richard Greene and Rachel Robinson of Weber State University in Ogden, UT, agreed to keep the Bioethics Bowl alone going. Fifteen teams participated that year. Ann Jeffrey of the University of South Alabama then stepped forward and kept the Bowl going for two more years there. Since 2017, the Bioethics Bowl has existed on its own and is governed by a small executive committee. In 2019, the Prindle Institute for Ethics in Greencastle, IN became an official sponsor of the Bioethics Bowl, hosting its web site, registration and other administrative details.

Historians of different backgrounds provide different historiographical interpretations of the genocide. Initial Armenian historians largely consist of those who lived through the massacres of 1915, and later historians of the Armenian diaspora have contributed greatly to western academic understanding of the genocide. Nationalist interpretations of the event tend to downplay the experiences of the Anatolian Armenians as part of a broader narrative of Turkish superiority. Meanwhile, liberal Turkish authors reject this narrative and instead place emphasis on the genocide as being a product of a broader cultural context in the later years of the Ottoman Empire, particularly focusing on the ideas of Armenian nationalism, economic forces and migration patterns.  Armenian Historiography  Armenian Historian Vahakn Dadrian The first sources dealing with the genocide were the first-hand accounts written by the Armenians who lived through it. These sources, however, have often been avoided by academic historians due to them being part of the victim group and as such being accused of lacking objectivity. Armenian accounts of the genocide also appear in the history books of the Armenian diaspora during the Cold War. The former category of works composed by Armenians who lived through the genocide includes the memoirs of Abraham Hartunian. Hartunian had lived in Maras throughout the genocide, and World War II, witnessing the massacres first hand. His account, however, is largely unbalanced, describing the \\"bloodthirsty and savage Moslems\\" and that the Armenians were innocent victims.Dyer, Gwynne. ‚ÄúTurkish ‚ÄòFalsifiers‚Äô and Armenian ‚ÄòDeceivers‚Äô: Historiography and the Armenian Massacres‚Äù. Middle Eastern Studies 12, no. 1. (January 1976). pp 102-103. The historian Gwynne Dyer has criticised much Armenian historiography, including this early era. He writes that \\"the Armenians [do not] approach the subject as historians.\\" Supporting this, he describes the work of Soviet Armenian historians E. K. Sarkisian and R. G. Sahakian, writing that they propagandise too much within their work. The Armenian historian Marjorie Housepian Dobkin has also been subject of criticism. In her book Smyrna 1922 she states that the massacres of Armenians in Izmir by Turkish soldiers was a deliberate policy set out by the nationalist Turkish government. However, Dyer also criticises this work, stating that Housepian does not adequately support this claim. Rather, he believes that there was no distinct policy for the massacre of Armenians, but rather this emerged from the loose control the Turks had over their soldiers. A recent Armenian historian of note is Vahakn Dadrian, an Armenian-American. Dadrian argues that the events of 1915 were merely an extension of attitudes, which included violence, of the Turkish majority in the Ottoman Empire toward the Armenians in the decades prior. However, this view is challenged by the French-Armenian historian Raymond K√©vorkian. Rather, K√©vorkian argues that the 1915 genocide emerged from the goal of the Committee of Union and Progress to create a Turkish nation state after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution.  Nationalist Interpretation  The nationalist interpretation of the genocide has emerged from the overarching historiographical narrative established with the proclamation of the Turkish Republic by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in 1923.G√∂√ßek, Fatma M√ºge. ‚ÄúTurkish Historiography and the Unbearable Weight of 1915‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp 339-340. Proponents of this historiographical school express the moral superiority of the Turks over the minorities in the Ottoman Empire. On the opposite side, the minorities of the Empire, which included Armenians, were portrayed as lacking morals and therefore provided legitimacy to the actions of the Ottoman government in undertaking the genocide. Further, nationalist historiography tends to downplay the suffering of minorities during the World War One period, during which the genocide occurred, and instead focuses on the suffering of ethnic Turks in the empire whilst fighting in the war.G√∂√ßek, Fatma M√ºge. ‚ÄúTurkish Historiography and the Unbearable Weight of 1915‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp 340-341 The Turkish historian Salah√Æ R. Sonyel writes that the massacres of 1915 were a justified response of the Ottoman state to an Armenian uprising: > A French investigation carried out in 1920 came to the conclusion that the > Turkish people and soldiers behaved generally in a correct way towards the > deported [Armenians], but that some 500,000 perished as a result of their > armed rebellion against the Ottoman state, of the war in which they took > part, of privation caused by the war in primitive regions, of sickness, > exhaustion following long marches, immediate changes of climate, and of > attacks by marauders upon rich convoys . . . The Turks are estimated to have > lost over 1,000,000 people owing to similar causes.  Turkish Liberal Interpretation  Important considerations taken into account in the construction of the narrative of Turkish liberal historians are the reformation of the Ottoman Empire into the Turkish republic, the economic disparity between Armenians and Turks and the nationalism that emerged from this, the immigration of Muslims from outside the Empire into areas primarily populated by Armenians, and the oppression of Armenians in the second half of the nineteenth century.Der Matossian, Bedross. ‚ÄúVenturing into the Minefield: Turkish Liberal Historiography and the Armenian Genocide‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp 371-376. Liberal historiography puts emphasis on causal chains in between these events, and can risk failing to address the wider context of the genocide due to a desire to avoid minimising the scale of the event. This is elucidated by the Turkish historian Fatma M√ºge G√∂√ßek: > If I contextualize the massacres of 1915 in my historiography, as I have, > within a long Turkish nationalist period that ends up normalizing 1915 and > thereby, by implication, mitigating and obliterating the trauma associated > with 1915, then I need to critically discuss the location of 1915 in and > itself to address this possibility. For I am doubly implicated, not only as > a scholar but also as a Turk. It is therefore particularly imperative for me > to acknowledge that I as a Turkish scholar convey the critical stand I take > in relation to 1915 in the historical narrative I construct.Cited in: Der > Matossian, Bedross. ‚ÄúVenturing into the Minefield: Turkish Liberal > Historiography and the Armenian Genocide‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural > and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction > Publishers, 2007. p 377. Fatma M√ºge G√∂√ßek, along with Ronald Grigor Suny and Gerard Libaridian, led the Workshop for Armenian and Turkish Scholarship (WATS), founded in 2000. The group has been part of a larger movement within Turkey to view the Armenian genocide with more nuance and overcome official Turkish historiography. In 2011, the group was responsible for the publication of a collection of essays entitled A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire which analyses the socio-political context of the Ottoman state before, during and after the genocide. Turkish historian Fuat D√ºndar argues that the CUP pursued a deliberate policy of displacing Armenians in order to create an easier population to govern. This view is supported by Uƒüur √úmit √úng√∂r, a Turkish-Dutch historian, who states that the deportations of Armenians was undertaken by the CUP with the goal of economy building and increasing control over the minority populations in Eastern Anatolia. √úng√∂r also argues that the policies of enforced homogenisation of minority groups in eastern Anatolia were continued by the Republican People's Party up until 1950. The Turkish historian S√ºkr√º Hanioƒülu has analysed the relationship between the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (also known as the Dashnaktsutiun) and the Young Turks political parties. In this investigation, Hanioƒülu states that, in opposition to official Turkish historiography, that the two parties had, to an extent, cooperated to overthrow the sultan Abdul Hamid II and reinstate the 1876 Ottoman Constitution. In contrast, official Turkish historiography describes the Armenian party as working toward the establishment of an independent Armenia, while in his work Hanioƒülu expresses that the Turks and Armenians worked together toward the same goal. However, Hanioƒülu also expresses that the relationship between these two groups deteriorated due to the Armenians favouring a decentralised kingdom, while the Young Turks desired more centralisation, which resulted in the formation of the Committee of Union and Progress. Therefore, Hanioƒülu writes, in the post-revolutionary period, the CUP lost its need for cooperation with the Dashnaktsutiun and it was in this period that the hostilities which led to the genocide emerged.Der Matossian, Bedross. ‚ÄúVenturing into the Minefield: Turkish Liberal Historiography and the Armenian Genocide‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp 377 - 379. Another interpretation presented by liberal historians is that the relations between the Turkish and Armenian political parties did not begin to break down until the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. Amongst the advocates for this interpretation is Taner Ak√ßam. He states that the CUP began to see a homogenous Turkish state as an ideal in the wake of numerous territorial losses within this time period. He says that this was also done in response to Armenian pressure for reform, and the worry that the empire would collapse as result.Der Matossian, Bedross. ‚ÄúVenturing into the Minefield: Turkish Liberal Historiography and the Armenian Genocide‚Äù. The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard Hovannisian. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2007. pp 379 - 381. Ak√ßam, like the aforementioned members of WATS, also believes that the genocide was a deliberate policy undertaken by the CUP. Supporting this conclusion, he points to the desire of the CUP to reduce the percentage of the Armenian population in any given area to no more than 10%. This could not occur, he states, without large scale massacres and deportations.  Historiography in the West  The interpretations of the genocide in the West have been prominently shaped by the work of Armenian historians, such as Vahakn Dadrian, particularly his 1995 work The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus. In this work, Dadrian explains that the genocide emerged from religious tensions in the Ottoman Empire, between the Islamic Turks and the Christian Armenians, and the threads of nationalism which came from this. Some historians in the west argue that the genocide was a result of a desire for the Ottoman Empire to modernise rather than as a product of religious and demographic tensions in the late eighteenth century. One proponent of this narrative is Ronald Grigor Suny who argues that the genocide originated as a suppression of Armenians who came to be characterised as \\"a deadly threat to the empire\\". Then, under the struggles of the First World War, in particular the confrontation with the Russian and British Empires, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) embarked on a series of mass killings of Armenians. In his 2005 work, The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians, Donald Bloxham, a British historian, argues against the idea of the genocide being premeditated. Rather, he states that the nationalist policies of the CUP were radicalised during the First World War, which led to the genocide. Bloxham's work, however, has been criticised for the sources used, particularly due to his method lacking a systematic approach to the use of Armenian and Turkish sources. Hilmar Kaiser, a German-American historian, in his book The Extermination of Armenians in the Diarbekir Region, states that the genocide was not governed by an overall predetermined policy initiated by the CUP. Rather, it was often undertaken at a local level, with the specific methods used being left largely unplanned. He reaches this conclusion through the consultation of correspondence between provincial and national authorities. One contentious issue put forward by historians in the west is the narrative that the genocide was only triggered by the First World War, rather than being as a result of a history of anti-Armenian policies. The American historian Stanford Shaw is a proponent of this view and believes that the blame for the genocide should be placed on the Armenians themselves. He states that the massacres were in direct response to the Armenian revolts, for example the Van revolt, which occurred at the same time as the war. Justin McCarthy, and American historian, has also contributed to this interpretation. In his work, he examines the Van uprising and comes to the conclusion that the uprising was the culmination of years of ineffective countermeasures to Armenian Revolutionary activity by the Ottoman state. McCarthy also states that the Armenians committed atrocities against the Turkish Muslim population. He therefore concludes, like Shaw, that the Armenian revolters were to blame for the eventual massacres. With the turn of the millennium, the historiography concerning the Armenian genocide has become much more in depth. A facilitator of this is the non-profit organisation Houshamadyan. Founded in Berlin, this organisation aims to depict Armenian life which was lost during the genocide. The organisation's website provides a view into the stories and lives of Armenians who lived under Ottoman rule in Eastern Anatolia. In the context of genocide historiography, this contributes to providing a more detailed understanding of the context of the genocide and encourages historians to overcome political sensitivities surrounding the genocide.

It is located north of Marblemount and Logger Butte, within North Cascades National Park. Its nearest higher peak is Canadian Bacon, to the north, with Bacon Peak, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from Electric Butte drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Electric Butte is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Panorama from Oakes Peak with Diobsud Buttes to left, Logger Butte centered, and Electric Butte to right The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She was one of the first Moroccan women to write and direct theater performances, and one of the few to incorporate elements of traditional theatrical heritage in her productions. Chebchoub used her platform to discuss issues such as corruption, gender equality, women's literacy, and injustice.  Personal life  Chebchoub was born in 1952. Her parents, both performers of the Moroccan form of popular performance known as Hlaqa, which is a kind of public storytelling, died while she was very young. Chebchoub never married and lived alone. Her frequent travels and her bohemian lifestyle earned her the nickname \\"al-Roumi\\" or \\"the Westerner\\" from her extended family.  Work  Chebchoub began acting as a child in the 1960s and directed her first production in the 1980s. She later moved on to writing and performing one-woman shows. She was the only trained female Hlaqia, the central figure in a traditional form of public story-telling performance known as the Hlaqa. She performed her Hlaqas either as solo acts or with her troop which was known as ASYAS. The Hlaqa genre bears a relation to the idea of the halaqa, which comes from the Arabic word for a ring or circle, and which is also used to describe religious gatherings for Islamic study and Qur'an reading (when people often sit in a circle). Chebchoub's Hlaqa works included performances called Chkouf al-Gars, Al- Matmora, Al-Abbacia and Moulat Sserr. Moulat Sserr, later renamed Tamawayt, is her most famous work. She toured internationally to perform it in countries such as Australia, the United States, and Syria. Chebchoub also worked in television, writing a 30-episode TV series for the Moroccan channel Al Aoula which she directed and starred in, and creating a film production company. In addition to her theater work, Chebchoub was an academic. She began by teaching French in a primary school, and later taught theater in the humanities department at Moulay Ismail University in Meknes. She was pursuing her PhD on stage sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, at the time of her passing. During her time at the University of Pennsylvania, Fatema Chebchoub worked for the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), an international collaborative research endeavor that creates, collects, and shares linguistic data. Drawing upon her deep knowledge of Arabic syntax and grammar, Chebchoub served as an annotator for the POS (part-of-speech) tagging that helped in the categorization of the Arabic grammatical tag set that the LDC used for the Penn Arabic TreeBank project, version 3.0 (later published in 2008 by Mohamed Maamouri et al.). While living in Philadelphia, Chebchoub also worked extensively with Jewish artists in the community. She presented a memorial service at the University of Pennsylvania held for the Israeli poet Dahlia Ravikovitch, where she translated and performed Ravikovitch's poem a A Dress of Fire. In 2002, with a grant from the Greenfield Intercultural Center at the University of Pennsylvania, Chebchoub produced a documentary film, entitled From Heart to Heart: A Documentary of Feelings and Attitudes towards the Incidents of Sept. 11, 2001, from Arab-Americans in the Philadelphia area.Chebchoub, F., & Cruz, V.

Gameplay Photographs is composed of five narrative-driven stories that each involve a decision that the story's lead character comes to regret. Each story iterates between two phases: first, focusing a virtual camera viewfinder on the object in the given scene that matches a text description, and then once located, performing a mini-game with rules that are unique to each story. After completing the mini-game, additional story elements are given via way of photographs and changing scene elements before the player seeks out the next photo to locate. Once they reach the end of the story, they may then start on another character's story; the first time through the game, the player must complete the characters in a specific order, but afterwards can revisit any character's story. Each story's puzzle elements do change along with the story, reflecting the difficulty of the lead character of the story; for example in the Alchemist, the player has to figure out how to simultaneously move figures representing the grandfather and his granddaughter around the board, but as she becomes ill within the narrative, her movement becomes much more limited in the puzzle. Once the player has completed all five stories, the five characters that made hard decisions pleads to a mirror, which shows the player via the device's camera or webcam, each begging to be allowed to go back in time to change their decision. The player is given two of the characters and must decide which one they feel deserves a second chance. After several of these questions, one character will have been chosen by the player the most frequently, and the game's credits are shown alongside the narrative of the character if they had made a different decision. One of \\"The Alchemist\\" puzzle games, requiring the player to slide both the grandfather and granddaughter into their specific slots while avoiding obstacles * The Alchemist involves an elderly potion maker living with his granddaughter. One day, his granddaughter as well as her cat is infected by a toxic plant that dulls her senses and makes her seemingly lifeless. He finds a potential antidote which his gives to the cat first, finding its life coming back, physically healthy but mentally acting strange, but proceeds to give it to his granddaughter. The granddaughter's health is restored but soon becomes delusional and commits suicide. * The Athlete is one of three girls on a dive team. They help each other to improve but seem to reach a ceiling. The main character realizes that it is her diving performance that is dragging the others down. When she sees that the others have taken performance-enhancing drugs, she decides to do the same, and soon surpasses and reaches exceptional high scores. This only draws attention to her, and her use of drugs is soon discovered. She is kicked off the team, and her life is ruined. * The Jailor is a member of a native tribe. The tribe soon meet settlers who are initially pleased to her their stories and help them learn new technologies. However, the seattlers soon decide to take the land, crops and other resources of the tribe as their own. Those members of the tribe that fight back are jailed. The lead character, who has not challenged the settlers, is presented with the opportunity to be the jailor for their prisoners, which he accepts. While the position gives him an opportunity to free his tribe and end their suffering, he becomes to complicate in his duties since the settlers also feed them. With a major drought, the settlers force the tribeman to shoot and kill his former tribemembers or otherwise be killed himself. Too late to save everyone, he kills one of the settlers before they turn and kill him and his former leader. * The Writer is the editor of a newspaper started by his grandfather that aimed to publish only uplifting stories. However, in the decades since, the newspaper's subscribers have tumbled, and the son has to let nearly all of his staff go and sell other assets to keep some business afloat. Observing that papers that tell more negative news sell far more than his, he starts to write more heated, negative stories. This does help to revitalize the paper, but it also angers a lot of its readers. Events led to a disgruntled reader to blow up the newspaper building, killing the editor. * The Protector is a member of a special group of wizards that can travel through time to stop certain bad things from happening. As it is a difficult job, only she and one other Protector remain after training before the current Protector retires. The two become close and eventually decide to have a child. Before their child is born, the main character ends up seeing the death of their son by a drunk driver some years in the future; she does not tell her partner about this. After their son is born, the main character goes to stop people dying in a burning building and sees the driver that will kill their son as one of those; she traps him in the building to die. Her actions are discovered, and she and her partner are dismissed and imprisoned, while their son is stripped from them.

He is the current head of Chronobiology at Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin in Berlin, Germany. Kramer's primary research interests include post- translational modifications of circadian clock proteins and the function of the circadian clock in the immune system. Some of his work includes identifying phosphorylation regions on mPER2 (mammalian PER2) and their implications for familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), identifying circadian rhythms in macrophages, and investigating the necessity of heme degradation for circadian rhythms. Kramer's current projects include improving BodyTime (a method for identifying an individual's chronotype with a single blood sample), analyzing the coupling between peripheral circadian oscillators, and live cell imaging of circadian clock proteins. Along with being an important contributor to the field of chronobiology, he is also a certified piano teacher.  Background  = Education = Kramer completed his undergraduate degrees in Biochemistry from Free University of Berlin in 1993 and in Piano from Berlin University of the Arts in 1994. Kramer wrote his undergraduate thesis on peptide libraries used to identify tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±) antagonists under the tutelage of Jens Schneider- Mergener. In 1996, Kramer completed his Ph.D summa cum laude in Biochemistry at Humboldt University of Berlin, again working under Schneider-Mergener. His dissertation research focused on identifying peptides for studying antibody- antigen interactions. = Academic career = After graduating from Humboldt University of Berlin, Kramer held several postdoctoral positions. From 1996 to 1998, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Medical Immunology at Charit√©. During this time, he investigated the structural basis of cross- reactivity and polyspecificity of anti-p24 (HIV-1) antibody to attempt to better understand the mechanisms of molecular recognition events. He then was a postdoctoral fellow under Riccardo Cortese in 1998 at the Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare (IRBM) in Rome, Italy. During this year, he learned phase-display library technology, a technique that complemented his work on cross-reactivity and polyspecificity.Kramer, Achim. E-mail interview. 25 April 2019 From 1999 through 2001, Kramer also completed a postdoctoral position at the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School under Charles Weitz, where he showed how rhythmic secretion of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-Œ±) by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) could encourage sleep via epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathways. TGF-Œ± binding to its epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was shown to decrease locomotor activity in hamsters. Hamsters lacking EGFRs were shown to have increased activity during daytime, which indicated that TGF-Œ± could be a possible inhibitor of locomotion. Kramer became an Assistant Professor of Chronobiology at Charit√© in 2002 and has been a full tenured Professor of Chronobiology at Charit√© since 2007. He has also held several editorial positions. He serves as the associate editor of PLoS Genetics Journal since 2013, an Editorial Board member of the Journal of Biological Rhythms since 2013, and the editor of the Circadian Clocks: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Kramer has also served on the executive board of the European Biological Rhythms Society.  Research interests  Kramer's undergraduate and Ph.D research was primarily biochemistry focused. Kramer became interested in chronobiology after reading about Chuck Weitz's discovery of the partnership of BMAL1 and CLOCK. He read about Weitz's work in a Berlin newspaper, Der Tagesspiegel, and soon after applied to work as a postdoc in Weitz's lab, joining in 1999.Kramer, Achim. E-mail interview. 24 April 2019 Since then, Kramer has worked mostly in the field of chronobiology. = Post-translational modifications of the circadian clock = Kramer and his lab currently investigate how post-translational and post-transcriptional mechanisms can affect oscillations in the mammalian circadian clock. This has led his team to discover some of the underlying molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for FASPS in humans, namely a defect in PER2. They found PER2 to be less stable and more easily degraded in the cytoplasm in FASPS but could become stabilized when phosphorylated at Serine 662 (S662). Out of the 247 serine or threonine sites on PER2, Kramer and his lab were able to identify 21 of them as phosphorylation sites (including S662). Mutation of S662 to glycine (S662G) showed PER2 could export out of the nucleus more easily and get degraded in the cytoplasm, suggesting that changing phosphorylation of PER2 can prevent it from remaining in the nucleus. This finding not only led to a better understanding of the biochemical basis for the PER2 defect in FASPS, but also demonstrated how the half-lives of circadian genes can vary based on phosphorylation of proteins. Kramer has examined the role of casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the mammalian circadian clock, specifically in its ability to phosphorylate PER2. He found that down-regulation of either CK2Œ± or CK2Œ≤ lengthened circadian period while knockdown of both CK2Œ± and CK2Œ≤ caused mice to be arrhythmic, indicating CK2 has a role in the circadian clock. Furthermore, inhibition of CK2Œ± caused a delay in PER2 accumulation in the nucleus, suggesting that CK2Œ± has a regulatory role in allowing PER2 to enter the nucleus. Kramer has also investigated how CRY1 binding to PER2 can be modulated by zinc to form the CRY1:PER2 heterodimer. In 2014, his lab, in collaboration with Eva Wolf's lab, published a paper that revealed an X-ray crystal structure of CRY1:PER2 with a Zn2+ ion thought to be stabilizing the complex. Specifically, Kramer and his collaborators found that CRY1 had a zinc and PER2 binding site at Cysteine 414 (C414) and was unable to bind as effectively to PER2 when mutated to an alanine (C414A). The findings suggest that the Zn2+ ion facilitates the reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond on CRY1 so that it can bind PER2 more effectively, which would make the circadian clock zinc sensitive. = Circadian clock in the immune system = In addition to researching post- translation modifications of clock proteins, Kramer has also studied the function of the circadian clock in the immune system. He has shown how TNF-Œ± and IL-6 secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine splenic macrophages display circadian rhythms that are not dependent on either variations in glucocorticoid concentrations or the circadian changes that occur in the cellular constitution of the spleen. This exhibits how the molecular clock in immune cells can remain functional regardless of systemic cues. Kramer was also able to show that approximately 8% of the macrophage transcriptome in mice exhibits circadian oscillation, including genes (such as JUN and FOS) that are involved in LPS-induced responses. = Chronomedicine = Kramer's work has advanced sleep health and medicine. In response to Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael Young winning the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on investigating the molecular mechanisms of the biological clock, Kramer noted that \\"Without this, we couldn't argue for later school times on evidence-based grounds; we couldn't look for the best time to take your medicine; we couldn't find an interrelation between metabolic disorders and clock disorders.\\" In 2018, Kramer and his colleagues developed a method to determine an individual's circadian rhythm using transcriptomics of blood monocytes taken from a single blood sample. The method identifies transcript biomarkers for internal time in the blood samples. This blood test provides information about an individual's chronotype. This personal chronotype identification method, what Kramer and colleagues call BodyTime, is currently being used to improve patients‚Äô quality of sleep. The project is ongoing, aiming to advance chronomedicine. Along with optimizing the BodyTime project, Kramer is currently investigating coupling between peripheral circadian oscillators and is working on live cell imaging of circadian clock proteins. = Summary of selected publications = * 2001 ‚Äì Identified transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-Œ±) as an inhibitor of locomotion via the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors * 2006 ‚Äì Identified phosphorylation regions of mPER2 that stabilized it or led to its degradation, explaining the phenotype of familial advanced sleep phase syndrome(FASPS) * 2009 ‚Äì Discovered the protein casein kinase 2 (CK2) as being an important component in the cellular clock as a phosphorylating agent of PER2 * 2009 ‚Äì Found that spleen, lymph node, and peritoneal macrophages exhibit circadian rhythms in and ex vivo in mice, impacting the oscillations of the immune system * 2014 ‚Äì Discovered a zinc ion on the mCRY1-mPER2 dimer and suggested importance of zinc and disulfide bond formation to the interaction of the two clock proteins * 2017 ‚Äì Showed that heme degradation is necessary for circadian rhythms through its generation of carbon monoxide (CO).

Its flagships Oppo Reno, Reno 10x Zoom, and Reno 5G were officially announced on April 10, 2019, while the midrange Reno Z was on May 30, 2019. The Reno was launched on April 24, 2019 in Zurich, Switzerland. The Oppo Reno lineup was followed by the Reno2, which was launched in India on August 28, 2019, and the Reno Ace which was released in October 2019. History Oppo previewed the 10x Zoom's camera system in February. After the announcement on 10 April 2019, Oppo also revealed a 5G variant at Swisscom's 5G network media event. It shares its battery and chipset with the 10x Zoom, costs around US$1000 and uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon X50 modem. The 5G model is also the first smartphone officially compatible with the NReal Light AR glasses. Design The Reno and the Reno 10x Zoom both utilize a metal/glass construction, with Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. Both phones sport a distinctive wedge or fin-like pop-up camera mechanism that opens in 0.8 seconds. Oppo calls it a Pivot Rising camera, and it also houses the earpiece and flash, allowing for a full-screen display. Oppo claims that it can withstand up to 200,000 actuations before failing and will last for over 5 years, and has added fall detection to automatically close and protect the camera. The Reno Z lacks this mechanism and has a traditional selfie camera with a small notch instead. Additionally, all four have a small ceramic bump centered on the back to protect the glass from scratches. The 10x Zoom is available in black and blue finishes, while the Reno and Reno Z offer additional pink, purple, orange and white finishes. The Reno has an exclusive Inspiration Edition with drawings on the back and stickers in the retail box. Specifications =Hardware= While the regular and 10x zoom variants are similar externally, the 10x Zoom features upgraded internals. Compared to the standard Reno, the 10x Zoom uses a more powerful Snapdragon 855/Adreno 640 chipset opposed to the Snapdragon 710/Adreno 616 chipset on the normal model. Being a lower cost model, the Reno Z uses a MediaTek/PowerVR chipset instead. The 10x Zoom also has a 4065 mAh battery and a 6.6 inch screen, while the regular model has a 3765 mAh battery and a 6.4 inch screen. Some features are exclusive to one variant: the 10x Zoom lacks the audio jack found on the regular model, but has a microSD card slot. The 10x Zoom's camera is also upgraded over the standard model; it replaces the depth sensor with a periscope telephoto lens and a wide-angle lens, and offers 5x optical zoom with laser autofocus. However, only 6x hybrid zoom and 10x hybrid zoom toggles are offered in the camera viewfinder. Both have an under-display fingerprint sensor, unlike the Find X which relied on the pop-up camera for both selfies and biometric unlocking. The 10x Zoom is larger and heavier than the standard Reno as well. Oppo also claims that the phone uses Nokia OZO audio recording technology. =Software= The 1Ox runs on Android 10 with Oppo's ColorOS 7 skin.

The game was created by √âric Chahi, who previously worked on Another World. In the game, players are tasked to navigate a world inhabited by various digital lifeforms. It received generally positive reviews upon release. Paper Beast: Folded Edition, a non-VR version of the game, is set to be released in October 20, 2020. Gameplay Paper Beast is an adventure game played from a first-person perspective. In the game, players explore a large ecosystem composed of various digital life forms originating from lost Internet codes and algorithms deep inside the Internet. In the adventure mode, the player assumes control of the first explorer and must navigate the world through manipulating the environment and interacting with the wildlife. Players are tasked to rescue them from dangers and predators, assist them in various ways, and use their abilities in order to progress in the game. The artificial intelligence, which governs the behaviors of these animals, will react to the player's actions accordingly. Each species in the game also behaves differently and they have their own unique goals. The player can also modify the terrain so as to overcome environmental obstacles. The game also features a sandbox mode, which has elements of a god game. This mode allows players to experiment with different actions, such as modifying the terrain by adding water, rocks, and sand, changing the weather, and growing vegetation. The game's physics system and AI will respond to these decisions, allowing players the observe the impacts of these actions. Animals also interact with each other in the world, and their interactions will also modify the terrain and leave behind imprints. Players can also add items into the world to further disrupt the ecosystem. For instance, players can be use an anti-gravity capsule to levitate the animals near it. Development √âric Chahi, the game's creative director. The game was directed by √âric Chahi, who previously worked as the creator for Another World. After working on From Dust (2011), Chahi went to work with a volcano museum on Reunion Island to create a virtual simulation for the island's Piton de la Fournaise. When the project was completed, Chahi developed ideas around the volcano work for a virtual reality game, where the landscape and creatures within it, represented by origami-like forms purported created out of the landscape of Big Data, with procedural behavior. The creatures in the game have an origami-like form as the team felt that they fit naturally with VR's \\"low-poly designs\\". Chahi founded Pixel Reefs in 2016 and started the game's production with four people. The development for Paper Beast lasted for approximately four years, and as of 2019, the team was composed of a total of 16 members. Like Another World, the story was conveyed to the players non- verbally, and it relied entirely on players' interaction with the wildlife. According to Chahi, this approach \\"empowers the players‚Äô imagination and can impact their emotions more directly\\". Chahi added that the game was \\"poetic\\", and that the game world was created to showcase the \\"miracles of life\\". While the game utilizes Unity, the team created its own engine to make the game compatible with VR systems. The team also used the engine to create its game physics. Japanese punk rock band TsuShiMaMiRe and Roly Porter were the composers for the game's original soundtrack. The audio team, which included 3 full-time staff, recorded sounds inspired by \\"papers, cardboard, adhesive tape, wifi waves, radio noises and natural tones\\" to create audio that is both \\"natural\\" and \\"artificial\\" at the same time. Announced on April 10, 2019, it was released for PlayStation VR on March 24, 2020. The game was also released for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, and Valve Index in July 2020. Compared to the PSVR version, the PC version was released with improved visuals, a continuous movement option and a new species for the sandbox mode.

Prelude  The victory of the Chouans at the Battle of Saint James had brought them a reprieve, quickly Republican troops came in support to occupy massively the country of Foug√®res and the country of Avranches. On January 24, 1,200 men arrived in reinforcement from Rennes, at Saint James General Dumoulin also received reinforcements from Avranches. Aim√© du Boisguy therefore decided to evacuate the country of Foug√®res, leaving only four companies responsible for guerrilla warfare. Boisguy did not know at this time the submission of Anjou, he decided to go south to gather the troops of Vitr√©, La Guerche-de-Bretagne and Bas-Maine, he sent letters to the officers of these divisions, asking them to gather all their troops.  The battle  On the 26th January, Boisguy's army assembled to set out. There was, however, a clash between 4 Chouan companies going to the rally and a Republican detachment who retreated to Foug√®res after losing 18 men. 4,500 men according to Pontbriand then went out of the city and repulsed the four companies, then arrived at the sight of the troops of Boisguy who came in reinforcement, however the two troops retreated without fighting. To their surprise, the Chouans, however, continued to hear Republican fire long after their departure. But Boisguy did not attach importance to these actions: he planned to go to Vitr√© bypassing the east, but he had to go to Parign√© first, where he had ammunition made lacking his soldiers because of too many skirmishes. Boisguy therefore decided to postpone his departure until the next day and to camp at Parign√© for the night. The chouans took the road to Vieuville for Parign√© and arrived at the place called Tombettes. The Republicans commanded by General Dumoulin awaited them in excellent training and well positioned. Dumoulin, who was going to Foug√®res, had heard the shooting earlier in the day and had guessed the retreat of the Chouans. Soon, the Republicans began encirclement maneuvers. Boisguy judged that it was impossible to avoid the fight and decided to try a breakthrough. The chouans launched the attack and the chouane avant-garde commanded by Bertrand de Saint-Gilles managed to push back the front lines of the Republicans and make their way. But the cartridges were missing from the Chouans and attacked on the flanks and behind, they were dislocated and routed, 50 of them were killed, hundreds scattered on all sides. According to the Republicans, the losses of the Chouans were 800 dead. However, Dumoulin chose not to pursue them and left for Foug√®res. Boisguy managed to get to Parign√©, but could only gather 1,000 to 1,200 of his men.  Consequences  Boisguy's plan had almost no chance of success, especially when, the day after the battle, he was made aware of the surrender of Anjou. Hoping for help from the English and the Emigrants, Boisguy remained under arms until February 17, when he learned that the Morbihan and Cadoudal had stopped the fight. The next day he signed his surrender with General Brune at Rennes. The war was over.

Combining traditional Jewish liturgical music with Hebrew chant, she has worked to cultivate Jewish gratitude practice.

I felt how powerful music is in opening hearts.\\" Gold was ordained as a rabbi by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College as well as by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. She is a leader within Aleph: the Alliance for Jewish Renewal. Through a program called Kol Zimra, Gold has trained rabbis, cantors, and lay leaders in Hebrew chant practices. According to one Jewish Telegraphic Agency article, nearly all interest in Jewish chanting today can be traced back to Gold.

She wrote a picture book every week, waiting six months for responses when she realized that she needed to work on her craft and decided to attend UCLA Extension in 1991, a writing class specializing on writing books for children. Inspired by the speaker, renowned poetry author Myra Cohn Livingston, Wong studied with her to become a better writer, despite having no intentions of ever writing poetry herself at first.

Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for a unanimous court that the Secretary of Health and Human Services had exceeded his rulemaking authority under the Medicare Act in promulgating a wage index rule in 1984 under which he would recoup Medicare reimbursements paid to hospitals, including Georgetown University Hospital, that had been disbursed since 1981 according to the pre-1984 rule. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the judgment, writing separately that, in addition to the particular language of the Medicare Act, the Administrative Procedure Act more broadly prohibits retroactive rulemaking because it defines rules as having exclusively future effect, as opposed to adjudicative orders.  Background  = Wage index rule = Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended in 1965 by the \\"Medicare Act,\\" established Medicare,, codified at et seq. in which the federal government reimburses medical providers for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. Section 223(b) of the 1972 amendment to the Social Security Act authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create \\"cost-limit\\" rules, and the first such rules were promulgated in 1974, in the form of a schedule for hospital services; thereafter, an updated schedule was issued annually. On June 30, 1981, the cost-limit schedule was modified to exclude wages paid by federally-owned hospitals when calculating the \\"wage index.\\"-39 The wage index was used to reflect the varying hospital employee salaries in different parts of the country. Prior to the 1981 modification, all hospitals' employee salaries, including federal government hospitals, were included in calculating the wage index. Several Washington hospitals challenged the new rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the grounds that the Secretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in promulgating the rule by not first providing notice of proposed rulemaking and allowing an opportunity for public comment. The district court held in favor of the plaintiff hospitals on April 29, 1983.District of Columbia Hospital Ass'n. v. Heckler, No. 82-2520 (D.D.C. 1987) The court found that it did not have the power to enjoin the rule because the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies. Rather than appeal, the Secretary reimbursed the hospitals according to the pre-1981 schedule. = Retroactive reinstatement of the rule = In February 1984, the Secretary issued a notice seeking public comment on a proposal to re-institute the 1981 rule, which would apply retroactively to July 1, 1981. Following the comment period, the Secretary issued the rule on November 26, 1984, and began recouping monies it disbursed to hospitals in accordance with the District Court's ruling during the period of July 1, 1981 to November 26, 1984, including $2 million from seven particular hospitals. These seven hospitals, one of which was Georgetown University Hospital, exhausted their available administrative remedies and commenced a challenge to the retroactive rule in the District Court for the District of Columbia on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Medicare Act. The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, finding that the circumstances did not justify a retroactively effective rule. The 1984 rule being invalidated, the Secretary‚Äîby then Otis Bowen‚Äîwas ordered to recompute the reimbursements due to the hospitals under the pre-1981 rule. The Secretary appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the lower court, but instead reasoned that the APA generally prohibits retroactive rulemaking and that the Medicare Act specifically prohibits retroactive cost-limit rules. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on February 29, 1988..  Opinion of the Court  On October 11, 1988, the case was argued before the court, and a decision was issued on December 12. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for a unanimous court, holding that unless Congress expressly authorizes an agency to promulgate retroactive rules, its rulemaking power will not be understood to encompass retroactivity. Even if there is a sound justification for the retroactive rule, courts should be reluctant to find a permissible basis. The court affirmed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit. The Court rejected the Secretary's argument that clause (ii) of (¬ß 223(b) of the Medicare Act), which allows for \\"retroactive corrective adjustments,\\" authorizes the retroactive cost-limit rule. Rather than allowing the Secretary to promulgate cost-limit rules, the statutory provision allows for \\"case-by-case adjustments\\" when the normal formula for calculating reimbursements does not reach the correct result \\"in individual cases\\". Retroactivity is statutorily permitted in individual adjudications, rather than in rulemaking. The court reached this determination by finding that past agency practice, the Medicare statute, and its legislative history do not indicate that Congress intended to grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services retroactive rulemaking power. = Concurrence = Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the court's judgment, writing separately that the Court must consider not only whether the Medicare Act permits the Secretary to promulgate retroactive rules, but also whether the Administrative Procedure Act permits it. Agreeing with the circuit court, he wrote that \\"general principles of administrative law\\" prohibit the retroactivity, as well as both specific statutes. The APA's definition of a \\"rule\\" is an agency statement with \\"future effect.\\" Therefore, rules must have legal consequences of only future effect. On the other hand, \\"orders\\" under the APA can have legal consequences for the past. Further, the Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the \\"Government's own most authoritative interpretation of the APA\\", instructs that rules under the APA have only future effect. Nonetheless, a rule that has only future effect can be secondarily retroactive by \\"affect[ing] past transactions\\" by, e.g. causing previously established trusts to be less desirable in the future; yet, it continues to be a rule under the APA because it does not alter past legal consequences. However, rules with unreasonable secondary retroactivity can be invalid under for being arbitrary or capricious.

Author J.

With History Joseph Bown, a farmer from Waterloo, Iowa, arrived in Idaho Territory in 1863, briefly settling in Idaho City. Later in 1863, he settled east of Boise City, and he brought his family from Waterloo to Boise City in 1865. The Bowns received a deed to their 131-acre homestead in 1869. They and their seven children lived in a cabin at the site of the Bown ranch until construction of the Joseph Bown House in 1879. During construction, smaller blocks of sandstone from Table Rock were ferried across the Boise River to the Bown ranch, about one mile from the quarry, but larger blocks were loaded onto a wagon and driven to the Morris Bridge,The Morris Bridge was constructed after 1876 at the site of the H.C. Isaacs Bridge and near the present Ninth Street Bridge. a roundtrip journey of about sixteen miles. Walls in the house are 22 inches thick, and sandstone casements surround the windows and doors. A center cupola was constructed of wood above the pyramid roof, but the cupola had been removed prior to 1941, and it had not been restored before preparation of the nomination form for NRHP listing in 1979. The Bowns occupied the house until 1893. It was owned by W.T. Booth until 1927, when ownership passed to J.R. Bright. The Bown ranch, not including the house, was purchased by Thomas J. Killen in 1917. Later, the house became part of the Tate Dairy property. In 1988 the house was purchased by the Boise School District, and it was restored in the 1990s.

Several dozen drawings, mainly baptismal greetings, have been identified as being by this artist, whose name comes from a depiction of George and Martha Washington in the collection of Arthur Sussel. The artist is considered among the most important among the Pennsylvania Germans, and much has been gleaned from the drawings which he, or she, left behind. Texts included in the artist's pieces are the same as those used in European Goettlebriefe, which are souvenirs of baptism given to the child by its sponsors. The imagery of the pictures is unique in American fraktur, including such things as women in \\"bee-bonnet\\"-type hats. Relatively few works by the artist are known, but they have been found all over Pennsylvania, with examples known from Berks, Lebanon, Dauphin, Lancaster, York, and Schuylkill Counties. They speak to an artist who traveled a great deal, a fact which has hampered the process of identification; a similar case is that of the Ehre Vater Artist. None of the artist's surviving work is signed or initialed. Surviving images, besides baptismal records, include drawings for animals and of children, and images of people on horseback, including depictions of the Washingtons, the Princess of Sudbury, and Adam and Eve; these pieces are especially fine in their execution. Some images include birds carrying cherries; another includes a possible depiction of wallpaper in the background. Sources of the artist's designs are unknown, but the work of Johann Conrad Gilbert suggests their influence. Examples of work by the artist survive in which the outlines have been filled in by another hand, suggesting the presence at death of a collection of blank forms that continued in use. A group of the artist's frakturs is associated with Bethel Township in Berks County. A depiction of Martha Washington by the Sussel-Washington Artist is owned by the American Folk Art Museum, while an image of her and her husband is held by the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum.

She is included in the Oral History Program of the Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art.

Life and Work Rabinovich was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Russian and Romanian Jewish parents, and grew up in C√≥rdoba. From 1950 to 1952 she studied at the University of C√≥rdoba. Some of her earliest influences were Argentinian artists H√©ctor Basald√∫a, Vicente Forte and Ernesto Farina, whose studios Rabinovich would visit. She would go on to study art under Farina in Cordoba. In the late 1950s she spent six years in Europe, studying art history at the Sorbonne and studio art with Andre Lhote. In 1956 Rabinovich married Jose Luis Reissig and had three children together; they divorced in 1980. After many years apart, they resumed their partnership in 1987. She returned to Argentina in the early 1960s, where she initiated a period of contemplation and reflection that led to a series of paintings titled The Dark is Light Enough. These works were exhibited in Buenos Aires in 1963. The series marked the beginning of her lifelong investigation into the nature of existence through the exploration of what she calls the \\"dark source\\". The dark source, for Rabinovich embodies the concealed aspects of existence that seem to be invisible, which are behind the appearance of things, thoughts, language, and the world. Due to a military coup in Argentina in 1966, she moved to the United States in 1967 with her family and became an American citizen in 1973. In the early 70s Rabinovich had a dream in which her paintings became transparent and free-standing, so she began creating sculptures using glass. These were first exhibited in 1973. In 1979 she visited Machu Picchu. She stayed in the ruins overnight and before dawn Machu Picchu disappeared from view, then very slowly appeared, as the clouds lifted in the morning. Many years later, influenced by this experience she would create stone sculptural installations Emergences. along the shores of the Hudson River. Like Machu Picchu, these stone sculptures also disappear from view and gradually emerge into view, only this time the stones are concealed by the tides.Raquel Rabinovich In 1987, her fascination with ancient cultures took her to Egypt, India, Nepal, Indonesia, and Thailand. These travels had a profound impact on her work.

Snowgrass Mountain is situated northeast of Frosty Pass and within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Snowgrass Mountain is the second-highest peak in the Chiwaukum Mountains, a subset of the Cascade Range. Its nearest higher peak is Big Chiwaukum, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Snowgrass drains into tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology Snowgrass Mountain The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Snowgrass Mountain is composed of schist, part of the Nason terrane laid down 210 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Big Chiwaukum is situated northeast of Frosty Pass, and within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Big Chiwaukum is the highest peak in the Chiwaukum Mountains, a subset of the Cascade Range. In the Wenatchee dialect, Chiwaukum means many little creeks running into one big one. Day Hiking Central Cascades, Craig Romano, The Mountaineers Books, 2013. Its nearest higher peak is Cashmere Mountain, to the south-southeast. Precipitation runoff from Big Chiwaukum drains into tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Big Chiwaukum Big Chiwaukum is composed of schist, part of the Nason terrane laid down 210 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The Jrk mutation disrupts the transcription cycling of per and tim and manifests dominant effects.  Discovery  Discovered at Brandeis University in 1998, cloning the mutant Jrk led to the identification of the drosophila homolog of the mammalian Clock gene in DNA. Jrk mutation  Jrk is a mutation of a gene (not to be confused with JRKL ) discovered by Michael Rosbash and his colleagues in 1998. A common misconception is that the Jrk mutant gene is the Drosophila homolog of CLOCK (mClock), which disrupts cycling transcription of the per and tim genes. The Jrk mutation was discovered before dClock, but it is a mutation of dClock. Jrk is a semi-dominant third chromosome mutant displaying arrhythmic, or not rhythmic, locomotor behavior in constant darkness. It's been found that Jrk mutant flies are less robust to changes in the environment, such as temperature increases, than animals with the wild type dClock gene. The mutant flies also have differing light sensitivity and behavior patterns, suggesting that dClock is important in controlling coupled oscillators. The mutation in dClock that makes Jrk is from a premature stop codon that truncates the protein, deleting most of the putative C-terminal activation domain of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor. This is consistent with the mammalian clock mutant phenotype.  Structure  Through complementation testing of Jrk with various deletions done by Allada et al., Jrk was found to be located on the left arm of chromosome 3, specifically at location 66A10-22. Start site: 7,763,233 Stop site: 7,775,603 The dClock gene has a PAS domain between positions 90-156, and positions 255-321. These regions are important for allowing proteins to recognize and associate with one another, forming dimers. This is followed by a C-terminal PAC motif starting at position 327 and ending at 370. PAC motifs have been proposed to contribute to the PAS domain fold. The gene also has a bHLH domain starting at position 21 and ending at position 71. This means that it binds specific DNA sequences, the E-box consensus sequence in this case, that regulate transcription. This domain is a 60 amino acid region with a DNA binding domain, which is followed by two amphipathic alpha-helices which are connected by a loop, forming the HLH motif. This region is also important in protein dimerization, which is necessary for DNA binding. The gene has 5 transcripts, which encode for 4 unique polypeptides. It has 9 exons. The transcript of the gene is about 5000kB long, as determined through utilization of northern blot techniques. The polypeptide that the transcript encodes for has a reported size between 1015 and 1027 amino acids, and a molecular weight between 130 and 150kD.  Function  = Circadian clock = In Drosophila, there are two main players in the generation of circadian rhythms: the period (per) gene and timeless (tim). These two genes are responsible for the oscillations in protein levels, RNA levels, and transcription rates that occur in flies. Another essential component of this circadian clock mechanism is that the PER protein contains a PAS domain, which has been demonstrated to mediate the interactions between transcription factors. These transcription factors also contain the well-characterized basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding domains. Furthermore, in mice an E box (CACGTG) was discovered, which acts a binding site for some of the bHLH transcription factors, which includes bHLH-PAS transcription factors. =Jrk mutant phenotypes = The mutant Jrk allele is a consequence of a point mutation, which is simply the insertion, deletion, or swapping of one nucleotide base in an mRNA sequence for another. This mutation exhibits a dominant negative effect, meaning that just one copy of it is enough to produce phenotypic deviation. The Jrk mutation deletes much of the gene that encodes for the glutamine (Q)-rich C terminus of the protein. This region is involved in transcriptional activation, which is necessary to allow mRNA to be transcribed from DNA in the nucleus. It can be achieved by utilizing ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) as a mutagen. The mutation results in a cytosine being swapped for a thymine at the 7764959 position (C7764959T). This substitution causes what was initially encoded as a glutamine to be swapped for a premature stop codon, preventing further translation of the gene. Jrk was identified as a homozygous mutant with completely arrhythmic locomotor behavior in constant darkness. Approximately half of all of the Jrk heterozygotes were arrhythmic, and those that did manifest a rhythm had a slightly longer period than the wild-type controls. Researchers also observed that both PER and TIM levels are extremely low and non-cycling in homozygous Jrk flies, approximately equivalent to the trough levels of wild-type flies. In heterozygotes, PER and TIM cycle well, but the amplitude is reduced by approximately 50%, consistent with the clear effects on behavioral rhythmicity in these flies.  Mammalian homologs of dClock  The Jrk gene has a myriad of homologs throughout the natural world, with 642 orthologs and 3 paralogs. Mammal circadian systems contain the Clock gene which has been shown to be closely related to dClock. Both have strikingly similar bHLH domains, which suggests that they associate with similar, if not identical, DNA targets. The PAS region is also highly conserved between drosophila and mice. This suggests that both Jrk and its mouse homolog have conserved heterodimeric partners. Mammalian mutations in the Clock gene have been found to result in autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention‚Äêdeficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder.

Within manufacturing, production processes may be fully manual, semi-automated, or fully automated. In this case, semi-automation may vary in its degree of manual and automated steps. Semi-automated manufacturing processes are typically orchestrated by a computer controller which sends messages to the worker at the time in which he should perform a step. The controller typically waits for feedback that the human performed step has been completed via either a human-machine interface or via electronic sensors distributed within the process. Controllers within semi-automated processes may either directly control machinery or send signals to machinery distributed within the process. Centralized computer controllers within semi-automated processes orchestrate processes by instructing the worker, providing electronic communication and control to process equipment, tools, or machines, as well as perform data management to record and ensure that the process meets established process criteria. Many manufacturers choose not to fully automate a process, and instead implement semi-automation due to the complexity of the task, or the number of products produced is too low to justify the investment in full automation. Other processes may not be fully automated because it may reduce the flexibility to easily adapt the processes to reflect production needs.

For any position \\\\vec x in space and any time t, the value of such a field can be written as :F(\\\\vec x, t)=A \\\\cos\\\\left(2\\\\pi u (\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n - c t) + \\\\varphi\\\\right)\\\\, where \\\\vec n is a unit-length vector, the direction of propagation of the wave, and \\"\\\\cdot\\" denotes the dot product of two vectors. The parameter A, which may be a scalar or a vector, is called the amplitude of the wave; the coefficient u, a positive scalar, its spatial frequency; and the adimensional scalar \\\\varphi, an angle in radians, is its initial phase or phase shift. The scalar quantity d = \\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n gives the (signed) displacement of the point \\\\vec x from the plane that is perpendicular to \\\\vec n and goes through the origin of the coordinate system. This quantity is constant over each plane perpendicular to \\\\vec n. At time t = 0, the field F varies with the displacement d as a sinusoidal function :F(\\\\vec x, 0)=A \\\\cos\\\\left(2\\\\pi u (\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n) + \\\\varphi\\\\right)\\\\, The spatial frequency u is the number of full cycles per unit of length along the direction \\\\vec n. For any other value of t, the field values are displaced by the distance c t in the direction \\\\vec n. That is, the whole field seems to travel in that direction with velocity c. For each displacement d, the moving plane perpendicular to \\\\vec n at distance d + c t from the origin is called a wavefront. This plane lies at distance d from the origin when t=0, and travels in the direction \\\\vec n also with speed c; and the value of the field is then the same, and constant in time, at every one of its points. A sinusoidal plane wave could be a suitable model for a sound wave within a volume of air that is small compared to the distance of the source (provided that there are no echos from nearly objects). In that case, F(\\\\vec x,t)\\\\, would be a scalar field, the deviation of air pressure at point \\\\vec x and time t, away from its normal level. At any fixed point \\\\vec x, the field will also vary sinusoidally with time; it will be a scalar multiple of the amplitude A, between +A and -A When the amplitude A is a vector orthogonal to \\\\vec n, the wave is said to be transverse. Such waves may exhibit polarization, if A can be oriented along two non-collinear directions. When A is a vector collinear with \\\\vec n, the wave is said to be longitudinal. These two possibilities are exemplifiec by the S (shear) waves and P (pressure) waves studied in seismology. The formula above gives a purely \\"kinematic\\" description of the wave, without reference to whatever physical process may be causing its motion. In a mechanical or electromagnetic wave that is propagating through an isotropic medium, the vector \\\\vec n of the apparent propagation of the wave is also the direction in which energy or momentum is actually flowing. However, the two directions may be different in an anisotropic medium.This Wikipedia section has references.

Thus the value and meaning of the phase shift depends on whether the wave is defined in terms of sine or co-sine. Adding any integer multiple of 2\\\\pi to the initial phase \\\\varphi has no effect on the field. Adding an odd multiple of \\\\pi has the same effect as negating the amplitude A. Assigning a negative value for the spatial frequency u has the effect of reversing the direction of propagation, with a suitable adjustment of the initial phase. At time equals zero a positive phase shift results in the wave being shifted toward the left. sinusoidally. phase of the wave. The formula of a sinusoidal plane wave can be written in several other ways: *: F(\\\\vec x,t)=A \\\\cos (2\\\\pi[(\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n)/\\\\lambda - t/T] + \\\\varphi) :Here \\\\lambda = 1/ u is the wavelength, the distance between two wavefronts where the field is equal to the amplitude A; and T = \\\\lambda/c is the period of the field's variation over time, seen at any fixed point in space. Its reciprocal f = 1/T is the temporal frequency of the wave measured in full cycles per unit of time. *: F(\\\\vec x,t)=A \\\\cos (k (\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n) - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi) :Here k = 2\\\\pi u = 2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda is a parameter called the angular wave number (measured in radians per unit of length), and \\\\omega = 2\\\\pi/T is angular frequency of the variation at a fixed point (in radians per unit of time). *: F(\\\\vec x,t)=A \\\\cos (2\\\\pi(\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec v) - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi) :where \\\\vec v = u \\\\vec n = \\\\vec n/\\\\lambda is the spatial frequency vector or wave vector, a three-dimensional vector \\\\vec v = (v_1,v_2,v_3) where v_i is the number of full cycles that occur per unit of length, at any fixed time, along any straight line parallel to coordinate axis i. = Complex exponential form = A plane sinusoidal wave may also be expressed in terms of the complex exponential function :e^{\\\\boldsymbol{i} z} = \\\\exp(\\\\boldsymbol{i}z) = \\\\cos z + \\\\boldsymbol{i}\\\\sin z where e is the base of the natural exponential function, and \\\\boldsymbol{i}\\\\, is the imaginary unit, defined by the equation \\\\boldsymbol{i}^2 = -1. With those tools, one defines the complex exponential plane wave as :U(\\\\vec x,t)\\\\;=\\\\; A \\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi u(\\\\vec x\\\\cdot\\\\vec n - c t) +\\\\varphi)]\\\\;=\\\\; A \\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec v - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi)] where A, u,\\\\vec n,c,\\\\vec v,\\\\omega, \\\\varphi are as defined for the (real) sinusoidal plane wave. This equation gives a field U(\\\\vec x,t) whose value is a complex number, or a vector with complex coordinates. To obtain the :F(\\\\vec x,t) = \\\\text{Re}[U(\\\\vec x,t)] To appreciate this equation's relationship to the earlier ones, below is this same equation expressed using sines and cosines. Observe that the first term equals the real form of the plane wave just discussed. :U (\\\\vec x, t ) = A \\\\cos (2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n \\\\cdot \\\\vec x - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi ) + \\\\boldsymbol{i} A \\\\sin (2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n \\\\cdot \\\\vec x - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi ) :U (\\\\vec x, t ) = \\\\qquad \\\\ \\\\ F (\\\\vec x, t ) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad + \\\\boldsymbol{i} A \\\\sin (2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n \\\\cdot \\\\vec x - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi ) The introduced complex form of the plane wave can be simplified by using a complex-valued amplitude C\\\\, substitute the real valued amplitude A\\\\,. Specifically, since the complex form :\\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec v - \\\\omega t +\\\\varphi)] \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\cdot\\\\vec x - \\\\omega t )]\\\\,e^{\\\\boldsymbol{i} \\\\varphi} one can absorb the phase factor e^{\\\\boldsymbol{i} \\\\varphi} into a complex amplitude by letting C=A e^{\\\\boldsymbol{i} \\\\varphi}, resulting in the more compact equation :U(\\\\vec x,t)= C \\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi\\\\vec x\\\\cdot\\\\vec v - \\\\omega t)] While the complex form has an imaginary component, after the necessary calculations are performed in the complex plane, its real value can be extracted giving a real valued equation representing an actual plane wave. :\\\\operatorname{Re}[U(\\\\vec x,t)]= F (\\\\vec x, t ) = A \\\\cos (2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n \\\\cdot \\\\vec x - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi ) The main reason one would choose to work with complex exponential form of plane waves is that complex exponentials are often algebraically easier to handle than the trigonometric sines and cosines. Specifically, the angle-addition rules are extremely simple for exponentials. Additionally, when using Fourier analysis techniques for waves in a lossy medium, the resulting attenuation is easier to deal with using complex Fourier coefficients. If a wave is traveling through a lossy medium, the amplitude of the wave is no longer constant, and therefore the wave is strictly speaking no longer a true plane wave. In quantum mechanics the solutions of the Schr√∂dinger wave equation are by their very nature complex-valued and in the simplest instance take a form identical to the complex plane wave representation above. The imaginary component in that instance however has not been introduced for the purpose of mathematical expediency but is in fact an inherent part of the ‚Äúwave‚Äù. In special relativity, one can utilize an even more compact expression by using four-vectors. :The four-position \\\\vec x = (ct,\\\\vec x) :The four- wavevector 2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c},2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\right) :The scalar product 2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\cdot\\\\vec x = \\\\omega t - 2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\cdot\\\\vec x Thus, :U(\\\\vec x,t)= C \\\\exp[\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\cdot\\\\vec x - \\\\omega t )] becomes :U(\\\\vec x)= C \\\\exp[-\\\\boldsymbol{i}(2\\\\pi u \\\\vec n\\\\cdot\\\\vec x)] = Applications = The equations describing electromagnetic radiation in a homogeneous dielectric medium admit as special solutions that are sinusoidal plane waves. In electromagnetism, the field F is typically the electric field, magnetic field, or vector potential, which in an isotropic medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation \\\\vec n. The amplitude A is then a vector of the same nature, equal to the maximum-strength field. The propagation speed c will be the speed of light in the medium. The equations that describe vibrations in a homogeneous elastic solid also admit solutions that are sinusoidal plane waves, both transverse and longitudinal. These two types have different propagation speeds, that depend on the density and the Lam√© parameters of the medium. The fact that the medium imposes a propagation speed means that the parameters \\\\omega and k must satisfy a dispersion relation characteristic of the medium. The dispersion relation is often expressed as a function, \\\\omega(k). The ratio \\\\omega/k gives the magnitude of the phase velocity, and the derivative \\\\partial\\\\omega/\\\\partial k gives the group velocity. For electromagnetism in an isotropic medium with index of refraction r, the phase velocity is c/r, which equals the group velocity if the index is not frequency-dependent. In linear uniform media, a general solution to the wave equation can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoidal plane waves. This approach is known as the angular spectrum method. The form of the planewave solution is actually a general consequence of translational symmetry. More generally, for periodic structures having discrete translational symmetry, the solutions take the form of Bloch waves, most famously in crystalline atomic materials but also in photonic crystals and other periodic wave equations. As another generalization, for structures that are only uniform along one direction x (such as a waveguide along the x direction), the solutions (waveguide modes) are of the form exp[i(kx-œât)] multiplied by some amplitude function a(y,z). This is a special case of a separable partial differential equation.  Polarized electromagnetic plane waves  Represented in the first illustration toward the right is a linearly polarized, electromagnetic wave. Because this is a plane wave, each blue vector, indicating the perpendicular displacement from a point on the axis out to the sine wave, represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Represented in the second illustration is a circularly polarized, electromagnetic plane wave. Each blue vector indicating the perpendicular displacement from a point on the axis out to the helix, also represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane perpendicular to the axis. In both illustrations, along the axes is a series of shorter blue vectors which are scaled down versions of the longer blue vectors. These shorter blue vectors are extrapolated out into the block of black vectors which fill a volume of space. Notice that for a given plane, the black vectors are identical, indicating that the magnitude and direction of the electric field is constant along that plane. In the case of the linearly polarized light, the field strength from plane to plane varies from a maximum in one direction, down to zero, and then back up to a maximum in the opposite direction. In the case of the circularly polarized light, the field strength remains constant from plane to plane but its direction steadily changes in a rotary type manner. Not indicated in either illustration is the electric field‚Äôs corresponding magnetic field which is proportional in strength to the electric field at each point in space but is at a right angle to it. Illustrations of the magnetic field vectors would be virtually identical to these except all the vectors would be rotated 90 degrees about the axis of propagation so that they were perpendicular to both the direction of propagation and the electric field vector. The ratio of the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic field components of a plane wave in free space is known as the free-space wave- impedance, equal to 376.730313 ohms.

The term ma, used to describe medical marijuana by 2700 BCE, is the oldest recorded name for the hemp plant. History and migration of the word ma The word ma has been used to describe the cannabis plant since before the invention of writing five-thousand years ago. Ma might share a common root with the Proto-Semitic word mrr, meaning \\"bitter.\\" Evidence of the earliest human cultivation of ma was found off the coast of mainland China, on the island of Taiwan. Chinese travelers who moved west carrying seeds of the ma plant also brought the plant's name with them, the word then becoming integrated into the neighboring languages. Ma in poetry and song Ancient Chinese prose and poems, including poetry in the Shi jing (Book of Odes), mention the word ma many times. An early song refers to young women weaving ma into clothing. Use of the word ma in other languages The term ma is commonly used to describe cannabis throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. The same character is used in kanji (Â§ßÈ∫ª) to represent taima (cannabis) in Japan. In the West, the word is used by scholars and journalists when discussing Chinese cannabis law. =Root of Mexican Spanish word marijuana= The term marihuana or marijuana is thought to have originated, at the end of the 19th Century, with Mexican immigrants to the United States who began using the word after hearing Chinese-American immigrants calling marijuana ma ren hua, an expression which translated literally means \\"hemp-seed-flower\\". An exact origin of the word marijuana is uncertain. Possible explanations include other terms that can be traced to the Chinese word ma.Alan Piper, \\"The Mysterious Origins of the Word 'Marijuana'\\", Sino-Platonic Papers, 153 (July 2005) Variations The word ma is often paired with the Chinese word for \\"big\\" or \\"great\\" to form the compound word dama or Â§ßÈ∫ª (d√†m√°). Dama is sometimes used to describe industrial hemp, as there is a negative connotation meaning \\"numbness\\" associated with the word ma by itself. Historical Chinese medical texts (c. 200 CE) through contemporary twentieth century Chinese medical literature discuss individual terms for ma, including mafen (È∫ªËï°), mahua (È∫ªËä±), and mabo (È∫ªÂãÉ), referring to specific parts of the male and female flowers of a cannabis plant with differing cannabinoid ratios.

Work by this artist has been traced in almost every county in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and Ontario that saw the settlement of German immigrants; it is the prolific nature of the artist's career that has made identification difficult, similar to the case of the Sussel-Washington Artist. Evidence suggests that the artist lived among the Moravians of Salem, North Carolina, but accepted patrons from among other religious groups, such as Roman Catholics, that practiced the baptism of infants. The artist's work includes aspects of Moravian hymnody, and evinces a particular skill in its cursive penmanship; it is also drawn on special paper with engraved scenes, unique in the work of known fraktur creators. The designs favored by this artist are bold, frequently geometric, and dominated by the use of green and red. Other common symbols include pilasters, used as portions of borers; large, geometric balls, sometimes surrounded by a piece of verse; and snakes twined with texts such as hymn lyrics. The name given to the artist comes from the German phrase meaning \\"honor father and mother\\", frequently found in pieces attributed to the painter. Four pieces by the Ehre Vater Artist are in the collection of the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts. Other works are owned by the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum and the Winterthur Museum.

There were two epicenters for this outbreak within the area: The Faith Tabernacle Congregation and the First Century Gospel Church. Both churches discouraged the use of not only vaccinations, but also all other forms of medical treatment, instead relying solely on faith healing. Following an investigation into the death of the first victim of the outbreak, a court order was obtained to forcibly treat and vaccinate children whose parents would not agree to seeking medical care. Nine children eventually died as a result of this outbreak. History The outbreak began in October 1990, but the bulk of incidences of illness, and all of the related deaths and responses to them, occurred in 1991. From November 4, 1990 to March 24, 1991, 486 cases and 6 measles-associated deaths were reported to the Philadelphia Health Department. By June 1991, an additional 938 measles were reported to the department. During this period, \\"the University of Pennsylvania also reported seven cases of measles among its students\\". Over the course of the outbreak, \\"[n]ine children would die, six of them associated with two fundamentalist churches which preach a reliance on prayer, not medical care, to cure disease\\". In February 1991, it was reported that \\"Health workers are now going to the homes of all students in a frantic effort to monitor their conditions to prevent further deaths\\", and that local officials were \\"prepared to seek court orders to force the families to accept medical care if the children are in serious condition\\". Later analysis noted that \\"although measles is normally fatal in about 1 of every 300 cases, the fatality rate in Philadelphia was much higher, because only 1 child in the congregations received treatment for pneumonia and encephalitis among the children\\". Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that forced vaccination was used in response to the outbreak. With respect to the parents who had initially refused vaccination, Offit said: \\"They were a peaceful lot. Once it was the law of the city, they realized it and they were pretty placid about it\\".

The artist's name is derived from the repeated use of an angel with crossed legs as a decorative element in his, or her, work; similar figures are encountered in Baroque church decoration in Europe from the eighteenth century and earlier. The artist's handwriting was poor, judging by surviving certificates, some of which were printed before being completed by hand. Surviving pieces suggest the artist was active in northeastern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and adjoining Berks County, and it has been posited that the artist was a schoolteacher in the area.

A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he became a member of the Reformed Church, whose congregational school he attended. He served in the American Revolution and worked as a shoemaker before, in 1787, moving to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and taking up work as an apothecary. He died in Chambersburg. Denig is remembered for a 200-page illuminated manuscript he produced in 1784. The book, filled with spiritual texts and sermons and illustrated in watercolor, contains mainly scenes from the New Testament, including images from the passion of Jesus and the martyrdoms of the apostles. Also incorporated into its pages are pictures of symbolic flowers and other items, as well as twenty hymns. The pages measure six-and-one-half by eight-and-one-half inches, and the whole is bound in leather. The book contains a family register recording births, marriages, and deaths; his own death was noted in the ledger by one of his children. Denig's illustrations depict their subjects dressed in the costume of contemporary Pennsylvania German people. They were painted when the fraktur tradition in Pennsylvania was at its height, and accordingly they bear its imprint, as well as the influence of Christian devotional prints and illustrated Bibles popular during the period. Theologically, the book contains moralistic texts and illustrations of sacrifice, reflective of the Pietism then in vogue among some members of the Pennsylvania German Community. Denig's book was published in 1990 as The Picture-Bible of Ludwig Denig: A Pennsylvania German Emblem Book. At the time it was owned by Esther Ipp Schwartz, who had offered it to folklorist Don Yoder for study.

The wavefronts of a traveling plane wave in three- dimensional space. Such a field can be written as :F(\\\\vec x, t)=G\\\\left(\\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n - c t\\\\right)\\\\, where G(u) is a function of a single real parameter u = d - c t. The function G describes the profile of the wave, namely the value of the field at time t = 0, for each displacement d = \\\\vec x \\\\cdot \\\\vec n. For each displacement d, the moving plane perpendicular to \\\\vec n at distance d + c t from the origin is called a wavefront. This plane too travels along the direction of propagation \\\\vec n with velocity c; and the value of the field is then the same, and constant in time, at every one of its points. The wave F may be a scalar or vector field; its values are the values of G. A sinusoidal plane wave is a special case, when G(u) is a sinusoidal function of u. Properties A traveling plane wave can be studied by ignoring the dimensions of space perpendicular to the vector \\\\vec n; that is, by considering the wave F(z\\\\vec n,t) = G(z - ct) on a one-dimensional medium, with a single position coordinate z.

It is claimed to be the first underground game show, filmed entirely in the Llechwedd Slate Caverns of Blaenau Ffestiniog, North Wales. Format The programmes are presented by Aeron Pughe (who said he was \\"shaking with fear\\" when he first saw the location). In each programme two teams of three players compete to win challenges on the four levels of caverns, via netted cages and zip wires suspended inside the caves. Examples of the challenges include: * Members of the opposing teams may be attached to one another with a bungee rope. Each has to try to clear their coloured balls from the trampoline floor of the set. * A member from each team racing from room to room to strike illuminated buttons. The quickest to strike their coloured button on each occasion gives their remaining team members a few seconds of screen time to solve a puzzle. * The entire team climb along the wall of the cavern 150 feet above the floor of the cave. The team that reaches and holds down two groups of six illuminated buttons simultaneously for five seconds, in the fastest time, wins the round. * Round four sees two members of each team trying to be first to answer general knowledge questions. The third member of the team can then use zip lines inside the cavern to slide down to the next level. The first team member to reach the bottom wins the game for their team. The losers leave the game. After reaching the bottom of the cave, the winning team has to solve puzzles to crack a code, to be able to escape to the daylight. Production The programme is produced by Boom Cymru and the idea was first conceived after one of the executive producers and his family visited Bounce Below's deep cave trampoline centre, at the Llechwedd Slate Caverns in Blaenau Ffestiniog. The concept took two years to come to fruition. Each level of the caverns was rigged with equipment and cameras. With mainly unstable trampoline floors, camera crew were required to hang from the ceilings to get a steady footage. The slate caverns were closed from 18 January 2019, with the production team and contestants filming the whole series from 25 to 29 January.

He was an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, fellow of Royal Institute of Architects, and honorary secretary to the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects. Martin was probably the most popular architect amongst the wealthy Toorak establishment in Melbourne, Australia during the interwar period and produced many buildings that exhibited his hallmark of restrained modernism. Martin was a Lieutenant in World War I where he suffered a gun shot wound in France; Martin also enlisted in World War II. Early life and career Martin was born in 1893 in Launceston, Tasmania. He and his family moved from Tasmania to Melbourne in 1908. Martin then attended Melbourne Grammar School before serving his articles with A & K Henderson architects. Martin completed an architectural diploma course at the University of Melbourne. Martin was considered a 'society' architect, designing houses for people such as; * Hollywood silent film star Claire Adams * Oil magnate Sir Hamilton Sleigh * Parents of Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser * Sir William Irvine, GCMG KC, former Lieutenant-Governor, Attorney-General, Premier of Victoria, and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. * Walter Murray Buntine, founder of Caulfield Grammar, see Buntine oration * Sir Henry Gullet * Captain Keppel Palmer, aides-de-camp to the Earl of Stradbroke and Governor of Victoria * Major Edric Henty, from the pioneering Henty family * Major General Harold Grimwade CMG CB * Sir Thomas Nettlefold, businessman and Lord Mayor of Melbourne * Lauchlan (\\"L.K.S.\\") MacKinnon, former Chairman of the Victoria Racing Club * Colonel Sir George Stevenson CMG, ANZAC commander * Sir Stanley Argyle, Premier of Victoria 1932-35, and Lady Argyle * Sir Rupert Clarke, 2nd Baronet of Rupertswood * Commodore Alvord Rosenthal OBE Martin also completed works at Ormond College, University of Melbourne Studio Martin had a number of business enterprises and partners, being; * Alsop & Martin (1920-1921) * A & K Henderson, Alsop & Martin (1921-1924) * Marcus W Martin (1924-1926) * W & R Butler & Martin (1926-1931) * Marcus W Martin (1932-1938) * Marcus Martin & Tribe (1938-1949) * Marcus W Martin (1949-1958) Martin was prolific as an architect, he designed no fewer than 17 houses in Domain Road, South Yarra. =Influences= While Martin had visited Egypt and France through his war service, he was introduced to Modern architecture during his 11 months in Europe in 1931, where he also represented the RVIA at the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in Berlin which was hosted by Mies van der Rohe. During this study tour, Martin was impressed by the work of Dutch modernist Willem Marinus Dudok, and the National Romantic style of Ragnar √ñstberg's Stockholm City Hall. Melbourne's T-Square Club Martin was concerned about architecture that groaned under the weight of irrelevant classic detail and was impressed by modern architecture that was free from artificiality. He believed that the welfare of mankind should be an architect's first consideration, as well as building and planning for the future. Robin Boyd later reflected that \\"all the founders of modern architecture disparaged the terrible buildings that were done in the name of art and creativity throughout the nineteenth century. They had to fight the ornament, the contrived symmetry and fakery of popular buildings to clear the way for a true architecture.\\" Martin and his peers were also influenced by the economic privations of the time. The Great Depression in Australia lasted from 1928 to 1934, a period where building completions fell by 95%, with austerity measures prior to of WW2 further hampering economic recovery. It was not until the mid-1950s that civilian building returned to the levels seen in the 1920s. Martin was president of the T-Square Club which included members such as Rodney Howard Alsop, Keith Cheetham, Lindsay Bernard Hall, Robert Bell Hamilton, James Stuart MacDonald, William Beckwith McInnes, and Percy Hayman Meldrum. The club met for lunch bi-monthly at the Melbourne Savage Club where most of them were Members; Martin was also a member of the Melbourne Club. =Style= Primarily a residential architect, Martin was well known for his Georgian Revival and Spanish Mission design prior to the Great Depression. However, by the early 1930s, Martin's oeuvre mostly comprised the use of a restrained Moderne approach over an essentially Georgian building form. Martin specialised in a quietly historicist mode that achieved a compromise between the prevailing period revival styles, and a more modern architectural expression. Martin was known for his attention to detail, external facades were white stucco with generous square windows, including wrought iron (internal & external) by the important firm Caslake, and gardens by Edna Walling, one of Australia's most influential landscape designers. Notable examples of Martin's style include 5 Linlithgow Road, Toorak, and 2 Lascelles Avenue, Toorak, both of which are listed (with others) as being of State significance by the Victorian Heritage Register. Linlithgow Road, which included one of Melbourne's first private swimming pools, is described by Heritage Victoria as being \\"One of the most refined and elegant Art Deco influenced mansions in Melbourne, representing the high point of the work of Marcus Martin, and a building of obvious influence. There are few equivalent houses in Victoria that demonstrate the abundant attributes of this property.\\" In the late 1930s and post-war period he also became involved in institutional design, most importantly the design of some 20 kindergartens. Martin's designs ushered in a whole new range of features, such as low roofs, and materials previously unused in such buildings, such as hardwood walls and concrete floors almost level to outside areas. =Legacy= It was residential architecture in post-war Australia where international modern architecture was most eloquently and skilfully expressed, creating a central expression of Australian culture. These architects considered what Modernism might mean in an Australian setting; earlier examples in Australia of experimental and functional architecture that engaged regional concerns had a significant influence on Modernist post war houses designed for the new suburbs of Australian cities. According to Barry Humphries, Melbourne's inner suburbs are amongst the most congenial and attractive residential areas in the world and it may be that the real heroes of Australian architecture are the designers of these 'inter-war' houses. Martin influenced the next generation of pioneer modernists such as Geoffrey Mewton and Sir Roy Grounds, leading to what Robin Boyd described as 'the Victorian type'. By the 1950s Martin was training the next generation of Australian architects, such as Neil Clerehan, who trained under him at Martin & Tribe in 1946 and is considered one of Melbourne's great architectural figures. Clerehan and Martin worked together on the Gordon Homes project on the Nepean Highway. David Godsell also worked for Martin while still an architecture student, and later went on to design important houses such as The Godsell House, \\"a notable example of postwar Modern residential architecture.\\" Godsell also worked for Guilford Bell who at one stage was in partnership with Neil Clerehan. Martin's legacy establishes a link in the Australian design vernacular from the early 20th Century through Mid-century modern to contemporary architects such as Sean Godsell, son of David Godsell.

The organisation has managed more than 175 partnerships and project across the globe. In 2012, AIHA obtained the support of President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] project to strengthen the blood service in Central Asia, Ukraine, and Cambodia. Due to its structure based on the programmatic modal and dynamic condition, this organisation is suitable to assist the community or worldwide countries which have limited resources, and it is beneficial for sustainable evolution. AIHA is contributing to improve the worldwide health conditions. This organisation has been associated and largely contributed in the HIV-related area since 2000.  AIHA History  AIHA established in 1992, which provides the healthcare services and supporting professional medical education organisation. The initial purpose is assisting the nations of the former Soviet Union to build a more complete healthcare system. It is the first organisation that forming the cooperative agreements with the countries which are equivalent with US, those countries are Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. In 1993, this program expanded to more area such as Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and it dabbled the broader area, including infection control, nursing, women's health and so on. In 2000, to cope with the increasing HIV/AIDS epidemic in some areas, AIHA set up a pilot program to control and prevent the mother-to-child transmission of HIV in those suffered countries. In 2016, AIHA established two biomedical partnerships to enhance the local capability of cadre in Uganda and Kenya. According to the management of the aids intervention plan, this project and new partnership can improve the treatment for the local in Zambia.  Organisation  = Leadership = The AIHA is led by the Mr. Greeley, He succeeded the founder of AIHA James P. Smith since 1992, Greeley has more than 30 years of experience working for international development and nonprofit health organisations, as well as for the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., Inc. The director concentrated on improving the medication supplies of developed and emerging countries. = Funding = The funding of AIHA is supported by a unique collaboration between the U.S. government and the private sector. AIHA has constructed 200 partnerships and projects in 34 countries since 2004, it was funded by over $361 million from U.S. Government grants and awards, U.S. twinning partners donated more than $292 million simultaneously. One of the donors is the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] which is the US organisation focus on dealing HIV diseases, it regards the AIHA as the primary implementing partners.  Volga River AIDS Alliance  The corporation between AIHA and USAID is based on the investment from USAID. This public-private partnership aims to improve prime level care and treatment for those people living with HIV/AIDS in the Samara and Saratov regions of Russia. AIHA focus on the training, monitoring and evaluation parts with the financial support by USAID and AIDS Healthcare Foundation [AHF]. The result is optimistic that the health care of AIDS had been strengthened and the local patients symptom were improved during this corporation.  The partnership model  = HIV/AIDS Twining Model = The partnership model of AIHA are developing among 14 countries such as Africa, Asia, Eurasia, and the Caribbean formed twinning partnerships and they leverage $110 million in US government funds, and US partners contributes $41 million. The organisation seeks the foreign partner and government with positive participation and interesting in investment to ensure to satisfy the specific demand.  CSO Initiative  Civil society organisations [CSOs] fully participated in, and planned the each stage of the program, from advertising to providing the services, it is crucial for the succeed and sustainability of PEPFAR and the accomplishment of preventing the AIDS. The goals of the CSO initiative are both expanding the capacity of PEPFAR team to make society participate the successful planning for Country Operational Plans [COP] plan meaningfully and enabling the worldwide PEPFAR team to join in. AIHA and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors [NASTAD] started up a data use package which spreading up to the worldwide PEPFAR team and a series of techniques support and intervention measure to enhance the more meaningful interaction between national team and CSOs. = Accomplishments = These organisations represented the professionals with different experiences. Some may be informed in the strategy decisions, others might be not conversant. PEFAR played a role of constructing a simplified framework, to achieve that promoting progress of censorship and present the epidemiology and planned data. As a result, that the CSO workers could analysis and inform the PEPFAR plans. = Partnerships of Sarov in Russia = The partnership model of AIHA demonstrates that host community should develop the recognition of ownership for both the programs and the methodology in order to have a sustainable outcome. AIHA improved Russian health care plan by sponsoring the programs in a partnership between US and Russian communities since 1992. Due to the deterioration of health condition in Russia since the 1960s, and the fall of Soviet Union caused the failure of supporting health service which resulted with the shortage of medications, decreasing life span and increasing mortality. Russian health system was lack of the clinical practice, centralised management structure, and a compartmentalised specialist-based system. In 1996, a new partnership between Los Alamos, NM, and its sister city, Sarov, Russia began. AIHA granted the partnership with the goal of boosting the health of children and improving the treatment of chronic diseases in Savor community oriented primary care(COPC), which is summarised to the Los Alamos-Sarov medical partnership. AIHA implemented the health-care model in accordance with guidelines for asthma and diabetes that evidently resulted in clinic improvements. They began to implement collection of data system to provide the information recycle for detecting the quality of result. The initial activity changed the dangerous behaviour of teenagers, and the paediatric and adult dental health and breastfeeding. These activities could be developed and replicated in other places. The cultural and historical factors influence the Russian health system, the primary step for Sarov is to construct trusting relationship with America.Dividing health service and professional-orientation system may impede the participation of multi-projects and communities. It is hard to describe the local health needs due to the lack of information. AIHA and Sarov had challenged during monitoring and calculating process.  Nursing programme  With the corporation from USAId in USA, the Orenburg AIDS Centre accepted more Russian traditional nurses who had few experiences in looking after the patients, and they had become more professional. They changed those patients with wrong cognition who claimed that it was no necessary to take medication, because Aids are uncured. Antiretroviral drugs kept the HIV bacteria in a very low level to improve the health and living standards of patients. These positive changes had proved that the nursing is essentially important in improving the quality of health care.  Asthma programme  One of the project is Asthma Self-Care. 85 adults and 30 paediatric patients with persistent symptom participated a project in 6 months. All had attended the asthma school and showed awareness of diseases and techniques of the self-assistance. The initial feedback reveals that the emergency time had decreased. The program has been expanded to 195 patients.  Summary of priorities and campaigns  AIHA is aiming to consolidate the health system and human resources locally, the vision of this organisation is providing the superior health care for everyone in the world. The mission is to enhance the health systems and workforce capacity worldwide Medical Support by collaborating with local partnership which could prove methods of technical assistance and support.  Medical Support  = HIV prevention program = AIHA started to implement HIV-related prevention programs, awareness strengthening activities, and treatment services in Eastern Europe. The infection rates of some communities had been increased to more than 200% at that time by several years. In 2004, due to the funding support by US President's emergency plan for AIDS Relief, AIHA initiated a new project relating HIV/AIDS, and it shared the unique partnership model and professional knowledge to those countries that need technical assistance and support. AIHA's flagship HIV project is established since 2004, and it utilised the effective and low-cost partnership model by the cooperative agreement of HRSA, the main targeted countries are low-income which have been overloaded by HIV and other health problem. To support the PEPFAR priorities and global 90-90-90 targets, AIHA has constructed more than 55 intervention program in 14 countries under the twinning center. These method provided the in-service training and graduated more than 10,000 people. AIHA arranged 105 professionals in long-term mission in African countries, these professionals contributed more than 23,545 working days that enhancing the healthcare system all around the world. = Biomedical Technology Program = This program targets to satisfy the demand of current techniques and medical system in each country, especially providing high quality diagnostic, treatment and nursing services for HIV. AIHA established the first Biomedical Technology program in sub-Saharan AfricaÔºåwith the support of the PEPFAR. AIHA provided the twinning model to Ethiopian partners at Jimma Institute of Technology and US counterpart institutions linked to TegbarId Polytechnic for rapidly training and distributing skilled biomedical technicians and providing consistent in- service training for improving professionals. Blood safety experiment = Blood safety = AIHA supported the consistent between national transfusion centre of health department and professionals of Australian Red Cross. They enhanced the essential infrastructure of blood safety including constituting the national blood policies and transfusion clinic guidelines and the support of laboratory training in capital areas. By training and guidance, tech team improved the clinic practise. =Clinical Pharmacy Program= The program established the relationship to enhance local institution capability, in response to train the pharmacists and middle level of pharmacy professionals to achieve the domestic health care demand and priority item . = Infection Control Program = The program provides the technical guidance, clinic training and guidance, and specialist advice, in order to avoid the transmission of the medical infection which used low-cost and simple measure to change the program and behaviour including basic health care. AIHA and partners have been trying to developing healthcare practices and patient outcomes since the establishment of the first hospital-to-hospital partnerships in 1992. Those countries which AIHA regarded as a primary activity were resulting successfully due to the efforts in accordance with the regulatory changes at both regional and national levels. Russian had published the first infection control project since constructing the hospital, which including the establishment of physician-nurse hospital epidemiology teams to administrate its related policies and methods. Other countries used Russian example to control the domestic infection by integrating the policies and methods. = Tuberculosis Program = TB laboratory AIHA's Tuberculosis [TB] and TB-HIV activities assist to build health system capability, and tuberculosis can be prevented and diagnosed effectively. AIHA and SIDA (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), USAID (United States Agency for International Development) assisted to implement The National Programme for Tuberculosis Control. AIHA launched the Moldova's national TB laboratory network, remoulding four laboratories, modifying the methods of guideline, and the quality control and feedback programme was framing. The most significant contribution after improving laboratory capability was that the DOTS-Plus for MDR-TB treatment in Moldova approved by WHO's Green Light Committee (February 2005). = Maternal & Child Health = AIHA Maternal & Child Hearth targeted to construct a more comprehensive, consumer-oriented centre which could enhance health, education of patient, earlier diagnosis and therapy to help those women who are low income and middle income facing health problem and assist them for follow-up healthcare.  Background  AIHA constructed the sustainable human resources capacity in order to provide consumer-oriented female health and health care. After the collapse of Soviet, the previous women health care was incomplete and separate, around 0.18 billion women faced the challenge of health care, more cancer and sexual violence happened, more than 15,000 women died due to the violence behaviour.  Contribution  AIHA incorporated with local stakeholders to assist women for the more comprehensive services, including model interference implement, and the built the networks of Women's Wellness Centres [WWCs] among 30 communities in Eurasia. AIHA established the hotlines for those women in Eurasia, as a result of educating young girls about Human trafficking and providing the services and support for victim. = Hospital Strengthening Program = The subsidiary hospital of AIHA plan established the twining partnership to focus on constructing institutions and human resources capability, in order to respond the local health care demand and senior education priority item. AIHA has constructed 41 partnerships named hospital- to-hospital among 20 countries. 90 hospitals have been involved by twinning partnerships in the United States and approximately 100 in Africa and Eurasia. = AIHA‚Äôs Knowledge Management Program = This program is promoting the evidence-based practises and using updated application software to make the decisions. The knowledge management program plan originated from the USAID-supported Learning Resource Centre [LRC] Project since the 1990s.It is aimed to enlarge the use of information and technology techniques to improve the middle and eastern European and Russian health care services.  Result  AIHA established 140 LRC which is a pivot for the communication centre, at hospital, university, clinic and hygiene department by PubMed, Cochrane library and HINARI online database that provided the interview of clinic resources. AIHA trained coordinator to manage the centre by acknowledging LRC information, and gave response of request and taught other related professionals how to search the evidence-based resources to be the propellent of the evolution.

It is different from full dresses, such as evening dresses, dress suits, and wedding dresses due to having a skirt length of five centimetres below the knee. The demi-toilet style is suitable for a simple, casual look. For example, lace could be added to the bottom of the dress when attending banquets or decorated with flowers for an afternoon tea. The dress is lightweight and comfortable, and it is suitable for many ceremonial occasions, including cocktail parties, birthday parties, business meetings, dates, vacations, and weddings. The style used to serve as a symbol of reputation when well-designed dresses and luxurious accessories directly represented one's elevated status and authority.  Evolution  In the 1920s, the demi-toilet first appeared at wine tastings. At that time, the dress was described as a skirt. It was a fashionable daytime outfit with long, loose, gem-coloured skirt straight to the knee and collocated by a small-cap, gloves and a small handbag. In 1926, Coco Chanel first displayed this skirt in Vogue and caught public attention with a black dress. This dress had only a small amount of diagonal decoration. Vogue magazine called it Chanel's \\"Ford T model car\\" and predicted the prototype of this modest dress would become essential clothing for all women. At the end of the 1920s, the demi-toilet dress was still modelled after the daytime outfit, yet it had begun to enter its evolution. During the 1930s and 1940s, all-day dresses became popular, and the demi-toilet reappeared. The dress was most often black, but other colours were also available. Silk and satin were the most commonly used fabrics, and the length was generally only to the knee. The rise of black dresses was mainly due to their straightforward appearance, making it a good office dress. Black dresses were also frequently embellished with various accessories, such as brooches and sequins. The dress was suitable enough to appear in evening activities like dance and cocktail parties. Moreover, as they were limited to the black-and-white photography techniques of the time, female stars usually wore black dresses in the movies to avoid the colour distortion of the dress in the film imaging. All of these factors enabled the demi-toilet dress to quickly become a symbol of women's freedom of movement, mind, and body at that time, giving people a carefree feeling. After World War II, the return of soldiers from foreign countries caused the clothing of other nationalities and different fabrics to enter into Western society. The fashion scene changed considerably. The style of dress became more open, the length of the dress became shorter, the neckline became lower, the body was tighter, and the sleeves were removed. The post-war dresses became more eye-catching and glamorous with more reflective sequins and shiny embroidery. The mindset at the time was that a shiny dress was better. In the late 1940s, Christian Dior introduced the word 'demi-toilet' to describe the dress. A slightly exaggerated hat, along with long elbow gloves, a small chain bag with a flash powder box, and shoes that matched the colour of the handbag were the most popular style at cocktail parties. This tradition continued into the 1960s. In the 1960s, the colour became relatively lighter, and pastel, silver, and gold replaced black as the main colour of the dress. The decorations on the dress were reduced. Many people stayed home at night due to the decreasing popularity of cocktail parties, and by the end of the 1960s, more women started to wear a simple dress in daily life. Home-made dresses started to replace demi-toilet dresses with fancy decorations. However, the design of the dresses still followed the trend of the time. In the 1970s, the casual style was born, and loose jumpsuits and pants replaced the dresses. In the 1980s, after the casual trend, the demi-toilet once again became popular, usually with satin as the fabric and decorated with lace. In the 1990s, the demi- toilet style increased in popularity. People started to wear it on formal occasions. For example, some Hollywood actresses wore it on the red carpet, and leaders wore it to give speeches to the public. Since then, fashion designers of various brands had re-launched a collection of demi-toilet dresses that had been ignored for several decades.  Modern characteristics  Today, demi-toilet dresses are a must-have for many fashion brands. Significant changes in the style of the dress through history have evolved into a variety of styles that are emerging today. These kinds of dresses lead the fashion trend and allow girls to have many different dresses. The demi- toilet brings women not only noble temperament and elegant femininity, but also a symbol of taste and status, which is popular among women. Nowadays, the style of the demi-toilet is very diverse. Some styles include court retro, ethnic style, rock style, and civilian fashion. These styles are all novel and unique. The type of skirt on the dress also varies widely, with suspender skirts, slanted skirts, mini skirts, fishtail skirts, and pleated skirts all making appearances, along with many others. Materials such as chiffon, cotton, lace, silk, wool, linen, satin, denim, and leather may be used.  Style categories  = Princess pattern = The princess dress has many different styles, such as a tube top and a sling. These dresses are closely fitted to the waistline, which is unbroken by a seam. The dress gets its name from its resemblance to the stereotypical dress of a princess. Layers of chiffon and pettiskirts are the main characteristics. The high-waist design and fashionable details of the princess dress fit the proportions of many girls' bodies, especially petite and thin women. Nowadays, to keep simplicity, the princess dress eliminates the cumbersome feeling of layered skirts and brings a sense of ease and romance. Different necklines are also popular, giving a full-bodied bride a choice between a deep neckline or V-neck to make the neck look slimmer. Princess Dagmar of Denmark = Crinoline pattern = This type of dress is representative of decent elegance and strays from fashion trends. A tight waist, proper upper body, and cotton dress lining are the main characteristics. The exquisite design of the crinoline dress reflects the feeling of the nobility, and the large skirt makes women seem more solemn. In the British royal family, some dresses have had a history of several hundred years and were passed down from generation to generation Many may even be treated as a cultural relic. =Personal pattern= The personal dress is often simple, using draping fabric and a narrow design tailored to the body curve. Among all the patterns, it can best reflect the body shape of women and the modern style of cutting. The personal pattern dress may be the most similar to the types of skirts people wear today. It has many characteristics dependent on different designs, such as highlighting the neckline and adding glamour, femininity, and elongating the proportions of the upper body and legs. Unique tailoring methods make women high and thin visually and enable them to show their figures more confidently.  Colour  = Beige= The beige demi-toilet is a perfect interpretation of classical and modern, considered to be elegant and fashionable as well as holding aristocratic traits. In addition, beige can give others a gentle and benignant feeling. This kind of dress is excellently designed, with attention to detail, unique materials, and high quality. Its design concept incorporates neoclassicism and expresses noble tastes with simplicity. = Black= Black is probably the most suitable colour for all to wear on every occasion. It uses a simple and elegant style to convey feelings of solemnity, stability, seriousness, loneliness and seniority. The black demi-toilet presents a charming, style‚Äînoble, self-cultivating, capable and generous. An example of a blue demi-toilet dress = Blue = Blue demi-toilets give an impression of nobility and maturity. Blue is often considered a universal colour and may represent a calm demeanour. At the same time, the many shades of blue allow these dresses to take on several other meanings, such as vitality or success. = Green = Green dresses can give off a mysterious, confident air. These dresses are often elegant and somewhat bold, as green is an eye-catching colour. However, green is also considered to be a neutral colour, making it popular among those who want to wear a unique dress without being too distracting. = Pink = Pink is the most popular dress colour among girls and teenagers. It represents a cute, gentle, innocent, elegant and noble demeanour. Deep pink shows kindness and gratitude, while light pink shows a more tender and beautiful image. Pink also reminds many of love, which contributes to its popularity among younger girls. = Purple = After 1862, when Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with purple to the Royal Exhibition, the purple dress quickly became fashionable. However, at that time, only the aristocracy and the wealthy could afford to wear purple clothing because of the expensive dye. Purple is a mysterious and impressive dress colour. It may give a sense of oppression or inspiration. Dark purple dresses give a sense of terror, whereas dresses in light purple can leave others with an impression of a calm and modest individual. The vast differences between shades make purple a very unique dress colour. An elegant, white demi-toilet dress = White= When first meeting someone, a white demi-toilet may not be the preferred choice, as it may convey an impression of indifference. However, some specialists think that white has a calming effect on irritability. A pure white dress is different from those that are a more ordinary shade of white. A high-quality, bright white dress can be elegant and eye-catching. It has smooth lines, a simple style, and no exaggerated natural shape. The sophisticated craftsmanship, decent cuts, and precious fabrics of the white demi-toilet bring charm to many women. With different neckline designs, this dress can give a stylish, positive, transcendental, and progressive image, reflecting that of a romantic lady. = Yellow = Yellow is a bright and light colour and shows clear, refreshed, innocent and friendly characteristics. A yellow dress might be chosen by a girl who is very optimistic about life, always looks forward, likes new things, and is eager to change her life frequently. Wearing yellow can also be a manifestation of spoiled psychology and a strong desire to win the favour of others. Yellow can represent frankness, straightforwardness and enterprise.

The most prominent of these donations include the tula-purusha ‚Äî weighing of a person and the donation of equivalent weight in gold, and hiranya-garbha ‚Äî the donation of a golden pot.  History  The earliest inscriptions that mention the sixteen great gifts as a category date from the 8th century onward, but these great gifts have been described in the earlier literature, such as the Matsya Purana. Some of these donations included in the category pre-date the concept of sixteen great gifts. For example, the Atharvaveda-parishishta, composed in the 1st millennium BCE, describes tula-purusha, hiranya-garbha, and gosahasra. The section of the Matsya Purana that mentions the sixteen great gifts appears to have been composed during 550-650 CE. It states that several ancient kings performed the great gifts. The Linga Purana also mentions the sixteen great donations; according to R. C. Hazara, the relevant portion of the text was composed during c. 600-1000 CE, most probably after 800 CE. The great gifts are also described in the later digests devoted to the topic of charity (dƒÅna), such as Ballala's Dana-sagara, and the Danakhanda section of Hemadri's Chaturvarga- chintamani (13th century). The Chalukya king Pulakeshin I (c. 540-567) is known to have performed the hiranyagarbha ritual (although not mentioned as a Great Gift) to proclaim his sovereignty. The earliest known epigraphically- attested donations called the \\"great gifts\\" were made by the 7th century Pandya king Jayantavarman (alias Cendan). According to his inscription, the king performed three of the great gifts: hiranya-garbha, go-sahasra, and tula- pursuha. The Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga (c. 753 CE) performed a Great Gift (mahadana) ceremony, apparently as a replacement for the Vedic shrauta rituals. By the time of the imperial Cholas (c. 10th century), the Great Gift ceremony had become the principal sign of a king's beneficence, overlordship, and independence. The inscriptions of the Gahadavala dynasty (11th-12th century) mention three of the great gifts: tulapurusha, gosahasra, and pancha- langala (or pancha-langalaka). The Chandela king Dhanga (r. c. 950-999 CE) and the Kalachuri king Yashahkarna (r. c. 1073-1123 CE) are known to have performed tulapurusha. The Sena king Lakshmana Sena (r. c. 1178-1206) performed the great gift of Hemashva-ratha, otherwise called Hiranyashva- ratha. In the Vijayanagara Empire of the 14th-16th centuries, the Great Gift ceremonies were used to proclaim the rulers' beneficence and independence. For example, the Nallur inscription of king Harihara II of Vijayanagara Empire mentions that he performed the sixteen great gifts.  List of the great gifts  The sixteen great gifts, according to the Matsya Purana, are as follows: (names in IAST) # TulƒÅ-puru·π£a (Tula-purusha), the gift of the man on the scales (weighing of a person and donation of equivalent weight in gold) # Hira·πáya-garbha, the gift of the golden embryo (pot) # BrahmƒÅ·πá·∏ça, the gift of the Brahma-egg # Kalpa-pƒÅdapa, the gift of the wish-granting tree # Go- sahasra, the gift of a thousand cows # Hira·πáya-kƒÅmadhenu, the gift of the wish-granting cow # Hira·πáyƒÅ≈õva (Hiranyashva), the gift of the golden horse # Pa√±ca-lƒÅ·πÖgala (Pancha-langala), the gift of the five ploughshares # DhƒÅrƒÅ (or Prithvi), the gift of the earth # Hira·πáyƒÅ≈õva-ratha (Hiranyashva-ratha), the gift of the golden horse chariot # Hema-hasti-ratha, the gift of the golden elephant chariot # Vi·π£·πáu-cakra (Vishnu-chakra), the gift of the universal wheel # Kalpa-latƒÅ, the gift of the wish-granting vines # Sapta-sƒÅgara, the gift of the seven seas # Ratna-dhenu, the gift of the jewel-cow # MahƒÅ-bh≈´ta- gha·π≠a, the gift of the pot of elements The two most-frequently mentioned great gifts in the historical records are tula-purusha and hiranya-garbha.

Very few pregnant teens keep the child because, along with stigma, it is very difficult for them to get help. The stigma can result in isolation from friends and family, expulsion from school, homelessness, and more. Teenagers are not legally allowed to make the decision of what to do with the pregnancy because the majority are underage and need their parents consent. Nineteen is the legal age of adulthood where they could decide for themselves. Parents often choose abortion or adoption rather than keeping the child even if the teenager wanted. Some who want to keep the child often end up hiding it or planning to run away to avoid the stigma and opinions of those around them.  Education  The education about pregnancy was at first virginity education which was taught for a few hours throughout elementary school. It was targeting primarily girls to ensure they do not have intercourse before marriage. A large emphasis was put on marriage and family values. There was a gap in the sex education about safe sex then but now it is in the middle school curriculum. School was a very isolating place for pregnant teenagers because friends isolate them and they faced discrimination from the teachers. When teachers and principals found out about pregnancies they would either tell the student to voluntarily drop out or they would be expelled. After this they were not allowed back into schools and therefore could not further their education. Factors have been put in place by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea to prevent punishment of pregnant students in schools. There was also a push to educate pregnant teenagers by allowing them to continue school as well as attend classes in shelters.  Abortion and Adoption  Abortion was criminalized in South Korea except for two occasions: assault and health risk. With this 79% of teenage pregnancies still ended in abortion. Upon finding out the age or unwed status many healthcare providers would suggest choosing abortion or adoption. As compensation there was also aid for women when they chose adoptions.  Jobs  There is stigma in the workplace around pregnancy. Pregnant teenagers are more likely to come from low income families and are not typically financially stable. Pregnant women are often fired and replaced with someone else. Birth- mothers have a hard time finding work because there is not readily access to childcare for single mothers. This can result in the family living in shelters. One form of assistance is from the government but it is not much. It is a living wage but has strict requirements for who is accepted.

It is mentioned as one of the sixteen great gifts in the historical texts.  Ritual  The word hiranyagarbha literally means \\"golden womb\\": it signifies a golden pot (kunda) donated to a brahmana, and also refers to the god Vishnu. The donor performs an archana (worship ritual), and utters a mantra praising the lord Hiranyagarbha, that is, Vishnu. The performer then enters into the \\"golden womb\\", as the priests perform the rites usually performed for a pregnant woman: garbhadhana, pumsavana, and simantonnayana. Next, the donor is taken out of the \\"golden womb\\", and the priests perform jatakarma and other rites usually performed for a newborn. The donor utters a mantra announcing a \\"rebirth\\" from the divine womb, and is called \\"born of the hiranyagarbha\\". After the ceremony, the donor gives away the \\"golden womb\\" and other gifts to the priests.  History  The Atharvaveda-parishishta, composed in the 1st millennium BCE, describes hiranyagarbha, besides tulapurusha and gosahasra donations. These three donations are included among the sixteen great gifts in the later text Matsya Purana; the relevant section of the text appears to have been composed during 550-650 CE. It states that several ancient kings performed the great gifts. The Linga Purana also mentions the sixteen great donations; according to R. C. Hazara, the relevant portion of the text was composed during c. 600-1000 CE, most probably after 800 CE. The great gifts are also described in the later digests devoted to the topic of charity (dƒÅna), such as Ballala's Dana-sagara, and the Danakhanda section of Hemadri's Chaturvarga-chintamani (13th century). The Chalukya king Pulakeshin I (c. 540-567) is known to have performed the hiranyagarbha ritual (although not mentioned as a great gift) to proclaim his sovereignty. The 7th century Pandya king Jayantavarman (alias Cendan), according to one of his inscriptions, performed three of the great gifts: hiranyagarbha, gosahasra, and tulapursuha. The great gifts went on to become the principal sign of a king's beneficence, overlordship, and independence in the subsequent centuries. In particular, hiranyagarbha finds a mention in multiple historical inscriptions of Indian kings, including: * King Attivarman (c. 4th century) of Ananda dynasty, who is called hiranyagarbha-prasava (\\"born of the golden womb\\") in the Gorantala inscription. * Damodaravarman of Ananda dynasty. * Vishnukundin king Madhavarman I, who is called hiranyagarbha- prasuta (\\"born of the golden womb\\") in the Ipur and Polamuru inscriptions. * Mangalesha (r. c. 592-610 CE), who is called hiranyagarbha-sambhuta (\\"produced from the golden womb\\") in the Mahakuta Pillar inscription * Dantidurga (r. c. 735-756) of Rashtrakuta dynasty * Yashahkarna (r. c. 1073-1123) of Kalachuri dynasty of Tripuri * Jaya Pala (r. c. 1075-1110)  References  = Bibliography =  Rituals in Hindu worship Donation ","title":"Hiranyagarbha (donation)"},{"id":"60466886","text":"Linarang, also known as larang or nilarang, is a Filipino fish stew originating from the Central Visayas islands. It is made with fish in a spicy and sour coconut milk-based broth with garlic, red onions, tomatoes, fermented black beans (tausi), chilis, and sour fruits. Etymology The name linarang or nilarang (lit. \\"done as larang\\"), is the affixed form of the Cebuano verb larang, meaning \\"to stew with coconut milk and spices\\". The word is originally a synonym of the ginataan cooking process (ginat-an or tinunoan in Cebuano), but has come to refer exclusively to this particular dish. Description Linarang is prepared by first saut√©ing the fish with garlic, red onions, and tomatoes. It is then added to a broth with fermented black beans (tausi), chilis, and a souring agent. The souring agent is usually unripe mangoes, tamarind (sambag), or bilimbi (iba), but can also be any sour fruit. Variations Linarang can vary depending on the type of fish used. The most commonly used are parrotfish (molmol or isda sa bato), stingrays (pagi), marlin (malasugui), snakehead (tasik), and Spanish mackerel (tanguigue). A notable variant from Cordova, Cebu is linarang na bakasi or nilarang bakasi, which is made from moray eels (bakasi); specifically the little moray (Gymnothorax richardsonii), which is abundant in the waters around the city.

Little information about Van Minian is known, and he remains an obscure figure despite continued efforts to develop a biography for him. He was initially identified by his signature on a birth record in the collection of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, which has aided in the identification of a body of birth, baptismal, marriage, and family records and decorated religious texts. Examples of his art are known from Berks and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore County, Maryland; a marriage and family record for a couple in Dorset, Vermont, dated 1826, is also his. The bride listed on the Vermont fraktur, Sidanna Shannon, was actually Sidney Shannon of Northampton, PA and was the daughter of Mary Ammerman, of German or Dutch heritage, which may explain the connection. The latest work ascribed to him, of around twenty in total, dates to 1835. Stylistically, Van Minian divided his compositions into carefully ruled sections in which he depicted figures in profile. Men are often seen looking through spyglasses. Other elements of his pictures include stylized floral designs, symbolic, and patriotic elements, such as eagles. Texts are in English or German, often written in an ornate Gothic calligraphy but sometimes in cursive. The drawing is precise, as is the application of watercolor. A family register by Van Minian sold at auction in 2011 for $36,250. One of his religious pieces is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum.

The cold fire also promotes a diversity of new growth, especially plant types that have a high food value, which in turn attracts animals to these areas. Additionally the cold fire is used to maintain large tracts of grazing habitat which need to be coordinated in a mosaic pattern every two years.

Industrial oil degassing system and method.. Gas content is usually measured and monitored by volume, expressed as percentage (%) J.G. Webster (1999). The Measurement, Instrumentation, and Sensors: Handbook: CRC Press-Springer-IEEE Press. .. The influence of gas on industrial oils The content of gas in oil at atmospheric pressure is 10%, but can increase with the temperature of the oil. While ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in the atmosphere is 78% to 21%, the ratio in oil, such as transformer oil, is 69.8% to 30.2% Best Way to Transformer oil degassing? Oxygen is the cause of oil oxidation and reduction of its dielectric properties. This is also related to the fact the gas inclusions often become the centers of electric discharge development. Operational factors which contribute to growth of gas content in oil The following factors increase the concentration of gas solved in oil: * increased loads; * mixing of new oil with used gas saturated oil; * adding used oil with high solved gas content; * oil pump damage; * overheating due to cooling system failure etc. Industrial oil degassing The most efficient method of industrial oil degassing is vacuum processing, which removes air and water solved in the oil D.J. Hucknall (1991). Vacuum Technology and Applications. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd. .. This can be achieved by: * spraying of oil in large vacuum chambers; * distributing the oil into a thin layer over special surfaces (spiral rings, Raschig rings etc) in vacuum chambers. Under vacuum, an equilibrium between the content of moisture and air (solved gases) in the liquid and gaseous phase is achieved. The equilibrium depends on the temperature and the residual pressure. The lower that pressure, the faster and more efficiently are water and gas are removed. Gas content control methods Gas content control is essential for equipment which can be negatively influenced by gas content in the oil (such as power transformers) J.H. Harlow (2012). Electric Power Transformer Engineering. Boca Raton: CRC Press. .. Gas content can be measured by devices which measure the changing residual pressure in an oil sample container. Such tests offer quantitative indications of gas content, but no qualitative analysis. There is a method which allows diagnosing the equipment the oil is used in by analysis of its gas content. This is referred to as dissolved gas analysis (DGA), and is based on gas chromatography Standard Test Method for Analysis of Gases Dissolved in Electrical Insulating Oil by Gas Chromatography.. DGA can help detect a developing problem or determine the cause of a malfunction. Prevalence of a specific gas in the oil corresponds to certain defects, i.e. carbon monoxide and dioxide indicate aging of oil and high water content, ethylene indicates that the oil reaches temperatures in excess of 600¬∞–°, methane indicates oil temperatures between 400-600¬∞–° etc.  References  Oils Recycling ","title":"Oil degassing"},{"id":"60467273","text":"Kaleb McGary (born February 22, 1995) is an American football offensive tackle for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL).

Its first edition took place in 2008 in Cologne, where it was co-hosted by the Central Council of Ex-Muslims and the Giordano Bruno Foundation.Kritische Islamkonferenz zu Ende gegangen: Giordano gegen \\"falsche Toleranz\\", Die Tageszeitung, 2 June 2008 The second edition was held in Berlin in 2013.  Background  According to the self-conception of the organisers, the second Kritische Islamkonferenz (2013) was an \\"alternative dialogue forum\\" to the Deutsche Islamkonferenz (held annually from 2006 to 2009). They considered efforts to \\"improve the integration of migrants\\" by \\"strengthening religious identity\\" to have been a \\"failure\\". Whoever reduces \\"the individual to a single religious group identity\\", obstructs the \\"emancipation of individuals\\" and stimulates the \\"development of parallel societies\\". By contrast, they should rely on the \\"model of transcultural society\\" in which \\"each individual, on the basis of secular values, has the opportunity\\" to \\"shape their lives autonomously\\", and thus experience \\"a cultural diversity that is actually an enrichment, rather than a threat\\". Instead of the integration policy, an \\"emancipation policy\\" should be followed, in the midst of which stands the \\"individual\\" and not the \\"construct of a supposedly homogenous social group\\". On this basis, society should be further developed in the sense of human rights.  History  = 2008 edition = On 31 May and 1 June 2008 in Cologne, the following speakers held lectures: Mina Ahadi, Michael Schmidt-Salomon, Ralph Giordano, Hartmut Krauss, Philippe Witzmann, Stephan Grigat and Klaus Blees. Aside from them, there were several panel discussions. The following speakers contributed to these panels: Maryam Namazie (Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain, UK), Ehsan Jami (Central Committee for Ex-Muslims, Netherlands), Afsane Vahdat (Central Council for Ex- Muslims in Scandinavia, Sweden), Shahnaz Moratab (Central Council of Ex- Muslims, Germany), Mina Ahadi, Sonja Fatma Bl√§ser, Thomas Maul, Arzu Gazi, Assia Maria Harwazinski, Margalith Kleijwegt and G√ºnter Wallraff. The slogan of the first Kritische Islamkonferenz was \\"Aufkl√§ren statt verschleiern\\" (loosely translated: \\"Enlightening instead of disguising\\"; the latter can both mean \\"to obscure\\" and \\"to cover oneself (with a veil)\\"). = 2013 edition = In 2013, the second Kritische Islamkonferenz took place on 11 and 12 May in the af Auditorium Friedrichstra√üe in Berlin.

According to an announcement by the organisers, unlike the 2008 conference, the 2013 conference would also feature liberal and progressive Muslims. This resulted from a supposed need for an alliance between secularist and liberal religious forces to defend the \\"open society\\" against the \\"double threat of political Islam and chauvinistic xenophobia\\". For example, it was during this conference that reformist Muslim Seyran Ate≈ü presented her vision of a liberal mosque for the first time. The theme was \\"Selbstbestimming statt Gruppenzwang. Gegen Islamismus und Fremdenfeindlichkeit.\\" (\\"Self-determination instead of peer pressure. Against Islamism and xenophobia\\").  External links  ‚ÄûKritische Islamkonferenz‚Äú.

Much of his work was done in Austria. Biography He initially trained in Augsburg from 1701 to 1706 with . Little is known of his next few years, but he apparently spent most of them in Styria and, by 1720, he was in the employ of Ignaz Maria Graf Attems (?-1732). His work involved painting canvases and frescoes for the Graf's manors at Slovenska Bistrica, Bre≈æice and G√∂sting (now part of Graz); work with which he was occupied until 1729. Biographical notes @ the National Gallery The paintings at G√∂sting have since been destroyed. In the early 1730s, he executed frescoes for the casino at Haselsdorf-Tobelbad and the garden pavilion at Schloss Brunnsee in Mureck. He also painted religious works, primarily in Graz. These include a portrait of Saint Giles for the altar in Graz Cathedral. In 1733, he was able to purchase a large home and settle in Graz. His compositional style was heavily influenced by the works of Annibale Carracci and Pietro da Cortona and his general style derives from the Venetian painters Marco Ricci and Luca Carlevaris. Certain resemblances to the works of Gaspard Dughet and Pieter Mulier have also been pointed out. Although they were French and Dutch, respectively, they spent most of their careers in Italy, which suggests that Flurer spent some time there as well, most likely after studying with Rieger.

She is a professor in the Department of Neuroscience and a Distinguished Scholar in Neuroscience at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She is the former president of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR), as well as a satellite member of the International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Her research involves the circadian clock and how it controls rhythmic processes within the cell using molecular mechanisms. The general focus of the Green Lab is to understand the molecular mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock and how it mediates rhythmicity within the physiology, biochemistry, and behavior of an organism. Her lab currently has three main projects: identifying targets and mechanisms of expression regulation of the Nocturnin gene; identifying the mechanism of metabolic control of Nocturnin knockout lean mice; and defining structural components of the repressor protein Cryptochrome and how regulation of the nuclear entry of the protein contributes to circadian period length. Green has formal training in cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology, which has given her a broad skill set to further expand her areas of study such as genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and metabolic studies over the course of her career. Aside from her scientific focuses, she also contributes to the greater science community. At the June 23‚Äì28, 2019 Gordon Research Conference, ‚ÄúClocks in Model Organisms: Circadian Networks, Physiology and Health,‚Äù she is organizing the ‚ÄúGRC Power Hour,‚Äù a panel designed to promote diversity and inclusion for women and minorities in the STEM field as well as encourage the professional growth of all members from all communities by providing a space for discussion and mentorship.  Background  Green was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming on May 14, 1962. After spending some time in Wyoming with her mother during her early years, Green's family moved frequently‚Äîfirst to Denver, Colorado; then to Saint Paul, Minnesota; and finally to Springfield, Missouri when she was in first grade. She remained in Springfield throughout her adolescence before attending Southwest Missouri State University, where she graduated in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in biology. Remaining at Southwest Missouri State, she also received her master's degree in biology in 1986. After receiving her master's, Green left Springfield to attend the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, where she received her Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology working with Simon Kwok. From 1991-1996, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Joseph Besharse in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Kansas Medical Center, where she worked on the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity in the retinal photoreceptors of Xenopus laevis. In 1997 she joined the faculty in the Department of Biology at the University of Virginia, continuing her work on circadian rhythms in both Xenopus and mammals. More specifically, she studied the molecular and cellular mechanisms that comprise and regulate the circadian oscillator in vertebrates. Green was first exposed to chronobiology when she was a graduate student at the University of Kansas Medical Center. At the time, she had not been working on the subject, but heard a seminar by Joseph Besharse, who had just been recruited to the University as the new Chair of Cell Biology in 1989. She had been finishing up her Ph.D. degree and was looking for postdoctoral positions in Kansas City. When Green heard about the novel field of circadian clocks, this intrigued her. Besharse had been speaking about his work on the endogenous clock in the retinas of Xenopus. In those days, nothing was known about the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks in any system. She had been trained as a biochemist and molecular biologist, and thought that this field would be a perfect place to use her skills to work on such a fascinating biological anomaly. Besharse hired her as a postdoctoral student in his lab and she has been studying circadian clocks ever since. Green is married to Joseph Takahashi, who is the current chair of the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Her lab studies the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in mammals, with a specific interest in the regulatory mechanisms that modulate translational and post-transcriptional processes. The Green Lab is currently focused on understanding the circadian function of Nocturnin, the circadian regulation of metabolism, and the circadian structure and function of Cryptochrome‚Äôs core components.  Nocturnin  A major focus in the Green lab has been on a protein encoded by the Nocturnin gene, named for its high-level nighttime expression. Nocturnin is a deadenylase thought to be involved in the degradation of mRNA polyA tails, suggesting that it plays a role in post- transcriptional stability and regulation of circadian gene expression, which is most beneficial to the metabolism and ultimately, survival of an organism. In 1996, Green discovered nocturnin (Noc) in the retinal photoreceptors of Xenopus laevis, where Noc mRNA displayed rhythmic expression in an isolated Xenopus eye in light/dark and constant conditions. They isolated this gene by using a high stringency differential display screen for rhythmic genes in the Xenopus retina. In 2001, Green found Noc homologues in other species such as mice with a high degree coding sequence similarity. Since expanding these studies into mice, they have shown that mouse Nocturnin mRNA is also rhythmic and expressed in many circadian clock-containing tissues. Interestingly, Green's group has shown that though Noc is not directly involved in regulating the master clock gene expression, it is required for oscillator output functions thereby contributing to circadian physiology. The rhythmic expression of nocturnin (Noc) is seen throughout the body, notably in tissues crucial for metabolism like the liver and intestine. In 2011, Green, Douris, and others were able to show differing Noc phenotypes have emerged implicating involvement of this gene in osteogenesis, lipogenesis, and adipogenesis. Her lab's current research focuses on identifying Nocturnin's circadian-relevant mRNA targets and understanding how it goes about regulating their expression.  Post-transcriptional control of circadian rhythms  In 2011, Green's lab concluded that transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes are necessary to generate robust circadian rhythms of mRNA expression, but understandings of circadian post-transcriptional mechanisms lag far behind understandings of clock regulation at the transcriptional level. This was found to be due to the lack of well-developed methodologies to find post- transcriptionally regulated genes on a large scale. The authors believe that development of such methods is likely to lead to the discovery of many more genes and mechanisms that are under post-transcriptional control. Green's findings are cited in more recent developments on post-transcriptional control of the mammalian circadian clock. Recent findings in 2016 inspired by Green's research contribute to post-transcriptional control of human circadian systems in relation to chronomedicine and sleep disorders.  Cryptochrome  Green's lab has focused heavily on a class of proteins known as cryptochromes, which are blue light receptor proteins found in both plants and animals. Cryptochrome proteins are essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock in insects and mammals, and for proper development in plants. Cryptoproteins regulate the circadian clocks of plants, insects, and mammals in different ways. Green has worked extensively with an amphibian, the African clawed frog (or Xenopus laevis), as well as mammalian CRY1 and CRY2, to try and uncover the mysteries of these essential transcriptional repressors. Green's research on cryptochromes began in 2003, when she and colleagues investigated the role of cryptochrome in suppressing the activation of other circadian clock genes such as CLOCK and BMAL1. They revealed that the deletion of Cryptochrome's C-terminal domain resulted in proteins unable to suppress activation of these genes. This result indicates that the C-terminal is not the domain of suppression of CLOCK/BMAL1, but is essential only for nuclear localization. Green has also studied the relationship between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral circadian oscillators, in which cryptochrome plays a key role. The regulatory region of Cry1, for instance, contains a response region for the Glucocorticoid hormone , such that input of this hormone can activate transcription of Cry1. In Cry1/Cry2 null mice, regular feeding at 24 hour intervals can induce circadian expression of many transcripts, especially those related to metabolism. This shows how peripheral oscillators can bypass the usual circadian feedback loops of the central oscillator. More recently, in 2018, Green contributed to the discovery of a new co-factor which mediates regulation through direct interaction with CLOCK and BMAL1. This study provides a model for the evolutionary mechanism by which the structure of cryptochromes, and thus clock regulatory mechanisms, varies.  Awards and honors  * 1990 Joe R.

Dodeka musical staff and pitch representations  Staff and pitch  Unlike conventional musical notation, the Dodeka music notation system uses a chromatic scale of 12 pitches and follows an equal pitch intervals configuration, with 4 lines per octave. In this configuration, the 12 notes of an octave appear in four positions vis-√†-vis the staff lines, that is, either on, between, above and below the lines. Each pitch has its own unique place on the staff. And while conventional music notation may alter notes using accidental signs or key signatures, notes in the Dodeka notation appear as they are. There are no more key signatures or accidental signs in this musical system. Dodeka musical note duration compared to conventional symbols  Note duration  The Dodeka notation system represents note duration in a visual manner. Note lengths are represented through the notes graphical shapes, similar to what can be found in sequencer programmes. The reference time unit or time value being the quarter note (or crotchet), all durations are expressed as visual ratios from this reference point. For example, a whole note is the representation of four quarter note lengths. At the opposite, an eighth note (or quaver) is twice as short as a quarter note.  Octaves and clefs  While traditional music notation represents the whole musical spectrum with different clefs, such as the treble or bass clefs, in the Dodeka notation the staff configuration is consistent throughout the octaves. This means that each pitch has its own unique position on the staff regardless of the octaves. For example, a C always keeps its position in every octave.  Relationship with keyboard layout  The Dodeka music notation was developed together with the Dodeka keyboard: an alternative keyboard layout that reflects the notation system. With this keyboard, the relationship between the notes on the sheet music and the keys on the keyboard are direct and consistent thanks to colour references.

It must be requested by the immigrant to be allowed to reside in the countryIl rilascio del permesso di soggiorno for more than eight days, or more than ninety days if having a travel visa (visto d'ingresso) for tourism. It is not required for European citizens. Permessos are governed by the legislative decree 25 July 1998 n. 286 and the related implementation regulation pursuant to Presidential Decree no. 179 of 14 September 2011. Duration A permesso must be requested within eight working days of the foreigner's entry into Italy. The duration of the residence permit is different depending on the reasons for the stay. A permesso can also have an unlimited duration in the case of a permit for domicile in Italy, obtainable by demonstrating that the applicant has a constant and sufficient source of income to be able to live comfortably in Italy, for example a pension or relevant real estate. The limited duration is foreseen for the following types: *reasons of subordinate employment , the duration is that of the relative employment contract (which from 2002, under the law of Bossi-Fini , takes the name of residence contract), with a maximum of two years, renewable until the foreigner retains that or another job (with a maximum of six months of unemployment status); *reasons of seasonal work, the duration varies from twenty days to nine months (depending on the type of work performed); *self-employment lasts two years; *family reunification has a duration of two years if the family member to whom one rejoins has a two-year permit, otherwise the shorter duration of the permit of the family source of support; *for study or training purposes may last up to one year. Obtention According to Italian legislation, the permesso must be requested from the immigration office of the Italian province police headquarters where the foreigner resides. At the aforementioned office, the official complies with the requirement to take the applicant's fingerprints, performing the photo-fingerprint surveys required by law. The office also issues a copy of the request, which is stamped with an indication of the date and the day on which the residence permit can be withdrawn; up to this event, the regularity of the stay is attested by the receipt of the application, which must be shown to the Questura of residence when the document is collected. The following types of residence permits can be presented at post offices: *Residence permit for adoption; *Residence permit for custody; *Updating the Charter or residence permit; *Residence permit for Waiting Occupation; *Residence permit for Expected repurchase citizenship; *Residence permit for political renewal; *Residence card for foreigners; *Conversion of residence permit; *Duplicate card or residence permit; *Residence permit for family reasons; *Residence permit for self-employment; *Residence permit for subordinate work; *Residence permit for scientific research; *Residence permit for study; *Residence permit for professional training Internship; *Residence permit for Tourism. Renewal The expiring residence permit must be renewed, with a special request, at least 60 days before the expiry. The validity of the residence permit is the same as the entry visa, but it can be renewed. In any case, currently (after the Bossi-Fini law comes into force - 2002) the permit has a maximum duration of two years and is linked to the existence of an employment contract (so much so that it is also defined as a residence contract) or for self-employment. One-year or shorter permits can be issued for study, training, illness, pregnancy, unemployment, etc. =Motives for non-renewal= If the applicant has a criminal record, for certain crimes established by law and deemed particularly serious or related to the request of the permit itself (such as for example murders, drug or human trafficking), the permesso may not be renewed. Likewise if he loses his job or last studies for which the permit was issued (except for the possibility of issuing a short permit for unemployment and job search).

The city of Mecca in 2011, a major place of pilgrimage for the Muslim people. The Andalusi thinker exposes his spiritual journey, his theology, his metaphysics and his mysticism, using sometimes prose, sometimes poetry. The book contains autobiographical elements: encounters, events, and spiritual illuminations.  Structure  The Revelations is a book of 37 volumes, divided into 560 chapters.Constant Ham√®s, Ibn Arab√Æ, Les Illuminations de La Mecque (compte rendu), Archives de sciences sociales des religions, 1990, Vol. 72, N¬∞1, .  Content  The book takes its title from the holy city of Mecca, to which Ibn Arabi travelled on pilgrimage in 1202, and in which he received a number of revelations of divine origin. In the Illuminations Ibn Arabi develops a theory of the imagination and the imaginary world explained by Henry Corbin.Henry Corbin, L'imagination cr√©atrice dans le soufisme d'Ibn Arabi. There is also a psychological and religious description of the effects of Allah's Love (in both the subjective and objective sense of expression). According to Michel Chodkiewicz, this book occupies a particularly important place in Ibn Arabi's work because it represents \\"the ultimate state of his teaching in its most complete form\\"..  Women, poetry, religious love  Women are prominently featured in the book, particularly in Chapter 178 on love. Ibn Arabi is initiated into religious experience by a spiritual woman called Nizham, a young Iranian woman whose name means \\"Harmony\\". He quotes the poems of the writer Rabia of Basra, who according to him is \\"the most prestigious interpreter\\" of love.Treaty of Love, . Ibn Arabi also recounts his encounter and service to mystic , with whom he recites Al FƒÅti·∏•ah (the first surah of the Quran) and whose degree of spiritual elevation he admires.Trait√© de l'amour, .  Legacy  The Illuminations are a classic of Sufism, theology and Islamic philosophy. They influenced the \\"Spiritual Writings\\" of the emir Abd el-Kader, who published the book in 1857, and perhaps Dante.The hypothesis of Ibn Arabi's influence on Dante comes from Miguel Asin Palacios See ¬´ After Ibn Arabi ¬ª.. Henry Corbin compared Dante's B√©atrice, which leads the poet to paradise in the Divine Comedy and awakens him to love in the Vita Nuova, to Ibn Arabi's Nizh√¢m, a mystical woman who initiates the Andalusian philosopher to the experience of God's love.Florian Besson, \\"Ibn Arab√Æ\\", Les Cl√©s du Moyen Orient, 1 April 2013.

Zhou was a firm believer of Daoism as he mimicked the style of Yuan Dynasty administrators through his paintings. He was the earliest and one of the most prominent examples of artistic style originating from the Wu School teachings. He excelled in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. Zhou had many paintings that showed the concern and importance of nature, especially landscapes. This is clearly displayed in Poet on a Mountaintop, a painting portraying a beautiful mountainous landscape. On the left side of the painting, Zhou included a poem describing the magnificence of the nature being displayed. The entire work attempts to display man's insignificance in comparison to the brilliance of nature. Poet on a Mountaintop and Zhou's apparent value for nature connects directly to the deep values of Ming Dynasty China.  Meaning behind the painting  During the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese stressed their connection to nature. They viewed nature as a part of one's intellectual and spiritual growth. Man and nature worked together as a team. The views portrayed in this painting are meant to undermine anthropocentrism, which sees humans as the most important piece of our universe. When an artist created a painting surrounding this concept, they were creating an escape from the city life of China. The landscape paired with a small visual of one human symbolizes man's insignificance in comparison to the powerful force of nature. Examining the words in the poem, it is clear that Shen Zhou is purposely shining a light on the magnificent views around the man in the painting. The poem translates to: :White clouds sash-like :wrap mountain waists, :the rock terrace flies in space :distant, a narrow path. :Leaning on a bramble staff :far and free I gaze, :To the warble of valley brook :I will reply, whistling. Shen Zhou has projected himself onto the painting and can be viewed as an extension of the viewer. Poet on a Mountaintop is one of the earliest examples of an artist using inscription as part of the work. = Posthumanism = Poet on a Mountaintop is a strong example of concepts of posthumanism being exemplified in art before the term was ever established. The poetry found in the painting makes observations that undermine concepts of Anthropocentrism, which views humans as the primary and/or only dictators of morality. Posthumanism in modern and contemporary art today focuses on the impact of technological advances in modern society and how it is changing philosophical and scientific perspectives of humans and their relationship with the world. During a time period before such technological advances, Poet on a Mountain Top expresses a separation between meaning distilled in established society and the wisdom found in nature, which pushes a posthumanist ideology in its spirit.  History  This is an example of the topography Shen Zhou experienced during his travels locally around Suzhou. It's likely Shen Zhou was depicting mountains very similar to these in Poet on a Mountaintop. Shen Zhou's ancestors experienced the end of the Yuan Dynasty otherwise known as the period of Mongol rule over China. His great- grandfather, Shen Liangchen (1340‚Äì1409) acquired property for the family estate at Xiangcheng, a decision that would transition Shen Liangchen's family into economic prosperity. This translated directly into the life of Shen Zhou who lived a life wealthy with money, knowledge, and culture. Shen Zhou's grandfather, Shen Cheng, was a famous art collector who hosted famous Chinese artists at the estate for most of his life. Shen Zhou's father, Shen Hengji (1409‚Äì77), along with his uncle, Shen Zhenji (1400 ‚Äì c. 1482), also spent their entire lives creating works of art. Although the work of Shen Hengji and Shen Zhenji has not been maintained through history, their lives clearly had a direct effect on the ambitions of Shen Zhou. Due to the level of wealth this family experienced, Shen Zhou had a significant length of time to practice his craft. It was in young adulthood when Shen Zhou was introduced to the Wu School style of art. Shen Zhou's father and uncle had been taught by Chen Kuan (1398 ‚Äì c. 1467), a teacher who was principal in demonstrating the style of the Wu School. Du Qiong (1397‚Äì1474) who had been a student to Chen Ji, the father of Chen Kuan, taught Shen Zhou everything he knows. This deep intermingling of family and scholars is what eventually formed Shen Zhou into the model student, referenced throughout history as an exemplification of the Wu School style. It is projected that c. 1471 is when Shen Zhou began creating Poet on a Mountaintop because this is when Shen Zhou began experiencing true independence. He found much of his inspiration for his works traveling locally around Suzhou. It is believed that the scene portrayed in Poet on a Mountaintop is a similar representation of a view Shen Zhou experienced during these travels.  Connections to the time period  This is an example of the light brushstrokes used by many artists during the Yuan Dynasty. Shen Zhou used a similar technique when creating his works. Poet on a Mountaintop is in the style of the Wu School, which sought to emphasize a close relationship between poetry, calligraphy, and painting. In Poet on a Mountaintop, a poet stands at the top of a mountain, seemingly gazing at the poem written in calligraphy. All three forms of art are incorporated into this painting, each uniquely related to another, in the style of the Wu School. Shen Zhou drew on the work of artists from the Yuan Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, incorporating different aspects of each into his style. Much of his landscape art was based heavily on Yuan artists, borrowing their simplicity and intricate texture strokes to make a pure and refined style. Similarly, the influence of the Song Dynasty on Shen Zhou's art can be seen in the de-emphasis of humans by drawing them as a small part of the painting instead of at the center. This is can be seen in Poet on a Mountaintop with its strong emphasis on landscape and lack of emphasis on the poet. The poet seems to be gazing off towards a poem that focuses on his surroundings, ensuring that nature is the focus of this painting.  Influence  Poet on a Mountaintop is currently being held on display at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. The Daoist/Taoist ideologies that influenced Poet on a Mountaintop are still distilled in much of modern art. The emphasis of nature and smallness or insignificance of human-made structures can be seen in many modern artists. An example of this kind of art being practiced today can be found in the work of Xiao Ping, who uses similar traditional landscape and calligraphy techniques (below) that are found in Shen Zhou's paintings.

The game is about white water rafting, and players must race against the clock, passing through checkpoints to extend the time they have to complete the level. The game is notable for its unique player controls that aim to replicate oars. The game is one of only two known games to run on Namco Gorgon hardware, an early revision of the Namco System 23 hardware. A virtual reality remake was released by Bandai Namco Amusement in 2018 for its VR Zone arcade centers. Gameplay The cabinet includes a pneumatic system which jolts the raft seat whenever the player(s) collide into rocks and/or crash into big swells and a 50-inch screen. The raft seat accommodates up to two players who can act as a team to combine their strength and paddle away from hungry dinosaurs, deadly whirlpools and so on. Several branches or forks in the river allow players to choose their own course through the game and navigate to different areas. This aims to provide similar non-liner gameplay popularised by titles such as Sega's Outrun. There total 6 different themed areas of gameplay, including Dinosaur Land (in which you are chased by a T-Rex), Evening Along the Nile, and The Big Canyon. If players successfully reach one of three different endings in time, they are given a special bonus stage.

It is a traditional Japanese craft technique, using natural materials.. to plaster buildings such as tea houses and storehouses. Recently it has become a contemporary art form, with modern artists using traditional sakan (plasterwork) techniques in new styles. One of the most prominent contemporary sakan (plasterwork) artists is Naoki Kusumi. He is the 3rd generation of a sakan (plasterwork) artisan family. He started learning the art of plasterwork from the age of 3. He apprenticed with many master plaster craftsmen and formed his own plasterwork business at the age of 23. He has vast experience in plastering both interior and exterior walls. His works are unique as they combine traditional sakan (plasterwork) techniques with his own unique style. As his craft is traditional, he is often involved in restoration projects, such as the world-famous Kinkaku-ji Golden Pavilion in Kyoto. As a testament to his versatility, he often creates works in modern establishments, including high-end commercial spaces such as the Tokyu Plaza shopping mall in Ginza, and bars and restaurants in luxury Tokyo hotels such as the Palace Hotel, Tokyo.

Background Blake played his junior rugby league for Forestville and St. Augustines. Blake is the older brother of former professional rugby league footballer; Phil Blake. Playing career Blake made his first grade debut for Manly against the Balmain in Round 18 1979 at the Brookvale Oval. It wasn't until the 1982 season that Blake began to establish himself in the starting side. Blake scored 11 tries in 25 games for Manly as they reached the 1982 NSWRL grand final against the Parramatta Eels. Blake played at centre in the match as Manly were beaten 21-8 after trailing 16-3 at halftime. In 1983, Blake made 17 appearances as Manly reached the 1983 NSWRL grand final in a rematch against Parramatta. Blake played from the bench as Manly were defeated for a second time in the decider 18-6. At the end of 1984, Blake was released by Manly and he joined the Canberra Raiders. Blake only managed 7 appearances over 2 seasons at Canberra before he was released. Blake then went on to join South Sydney where his brother Phil was playing. Blake became a regular starter for Souths as the club finished 5th in 1987 before suffering an embarrassing 46-12 loss against his former club Canberra in the finals series. The match is remembered for the poor performance of Steve Mavin who made a number of errors and was taken off at half time. Mavin later claimed that he left the ground after being substituted and watched the second half from the Cauliflower Hotel in Redfern. Blake played one final season in 1988 before retiring. The following year, Souths would go on to win the minor premiership in 1989.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.

Mindful Yoga or Mindfulness Yoga combines Buddhist-style mindfulness practice with yoga as exercise to provide a means of exercise that is also meditative and useful for reducing stress. Buddhism and Hinduism have since ancient times shared many aspects of philosophy and practice including mindfulness, understanding the suffering caused by an erroneous view of reality, and using concentrated and meditative states to address such suffering. The use of a hybrid of yoga and mindfulness for stress was pioneered by Jon Kabat-Zinn in America in 1990. It has since been advocated in differing forms by yoga and meditation teachers and authors from many backgrounds, such as Anne Cushman, Frank Jude Boccio, Stephen Cope, Janice Gates, Cyndi Lee, Phillip Moffitt, and Sarah Powers. Courses in Mindful Yoga are provided in Buddhist meditation centres, yoga studios, and stress clinics around the world. Origins =Ancient= Hinduism and Buddhism share many of the concepts behind Mindful Yoga, such as karma, the endless chain of cause-and-effect, symbolised by the endless knot at the centre of this Nepalese prayer wheel. The teacher of Mindful Yoga Anne Cushman notes that Hatha yoga and Buddhist meditation are branches of the same Indian contemplative tradition. In her view, asanas are both objects of meditation, and useful for preparing mind and body for sitting meditation, while Buddhism offers a formal structure of meditation techniques and philosophy that can exploit the \\"sensitivity, concentration, discipline and energy cultivated during asana practice.\\" In his 2006 book The Wisdom of Yoga, the psychotherapist and yoga scholar Stephen Cope examines the overlap of Patanjali's raja yoga and Buddhism. He notes that both were mainly concerned with \\"the problem of suffering, and the problem of seeing reality clearly.\\" Both traditions provided three sets of tools: techniques for cultivating skilful behaviour to reduce suffering; techniques to develop intense states of concentration; and ways of investigating how the \\"self\\" is constructed by the mind. Both recognise \\"ordinary reality\\" as a confusing mental construction, as modern constructivism does, Cope writes. They agree that abolishing such confusion of thought permanently ends suffering. They agree, too, he states, on numerous \\"pillars\\" of their accounts of reality, with the concepts of nirodha (stilling the mind), klesha (afflictions), karma (cause and effect), samvega (urgent desire to change), samadhi (concentration), prajna (insight into reality), and samskara (impressions on consciousness). However, Cope writes, the meditation and \\"insight\\" practices described by Patanjali are missing from the mainstream Western tradition of yoga, though they are taught within Buddhism. =Modern= The professor of medicine and pioneer of Mindful Yoga Jon Kabat-Zinn wrote in 1990 that \\"Mindful hatha yoga is the third major formal meditation technique that we practice in the stress clinic [at the University of Massachusetts Medical School], along with the body scan and sitting meditation‚Ä¶\\" excerpted from Kabat-Zinn developed the original course in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction including sitting meditation and Mindful Yoga. yoga asanas such as Virabhadrasana I as an opportunity to observe their thoughts and sensations. In 2008, the yoga teacher and editor of Yoga Journal Nora Isaacs wrote a feature on bringing \\"Mindfulness onto the Mat\\", noting that teachers from many backgrounds, such as Frank Jude Boccio, Cope, Janice Gates, Cyndi Lee, Phillip Moffitt, and Sarah Powers, had \\"each, independently, discovered the benefits of merging mindfulness with asana\\", leading to \\"something we might call 'Mindful Yoga'.\\" Isaacs described the benefit of not reacting to the discomfort that one might feel in a standing asana such as Virabhadrasana I, instead just observing one's thoughts and sensations in the pose. She commented that the noble eightfold path of Buddhism and the Patanjali's eight-limbed yoga have similarities, both going from \\"ethical practices and conduct and include training in concentration and awareness.\\" She quotes Cope as saying that he sees \\"Buddha and Patanjali as brothers, using different languages, but speaking about and pointing to the same thing\\". Isaacs writes that yoga stresses concentration on a single object such as the breath, whereas Buddhism calls for mindfulness of all events as they come to one's consciousness. She quotes Boccio as saying that he does not just practice asanas mindfully; \\"I teach and practice mindfulness through the form of asana.\\" Isaacs reports, too, that Cushman finds that mindfulness practice can enliven yoga for people who find sitting meditation difficult. Practice The yoga teacher Michelle Ribeiro writes that Mindful Yoga \\"applies traditional Buddhist mindfulness teachings to the physical practice of yoga; it is the holistic approach of connecting your mind to your breath.\\" For her, the key point is to be open to and interested in sensations in the body, so each one can be investigated fully and then released. Cope notes in addition that yoga's asanas and pranayama \\"have found their way into many Buddhist meditation retreats\\", just as Buddhist meditation practices have appeared in yoga studios, so the \\"sister traditions\\" are beginning a \\"rapprochement\\", or a continuation of the exchange of practices and thinking that has carried on for two millennia. Cushman writes that when she first taught yoga on a meditation retreat, her pupils told her that doing yoga gave them a fresh way to connect to \\"mindful presence\\", and made it easier to bring what they had discovered in meditation back into daily life. The practice of Mindful Yoga has spread to meditation centres and stress clinics, with drop-in classes and courses available around the world, for example in the West London Buddhist Centre. The Vice President of India, Venkaiah Naidu, releasing Mansi Gulati's book Yoga and Mindfulness, New Delhi, 2018 Books In 2004, Boccio published Mindfulness Yoga, relating Buddhism, the Yoga Sutras, and asanas. This has been followed by other books such as Charlotte Bell's 2005 Mindful Yoga, Mindful Life: A Guide for Everyday Practice, structured around the eight limbs of Patanjali's yoga, Anne Cushman's Moving into Meditation with awareness of the body, Hannah Moss's 2018 The Practice of Mindful Yoga: A Connected Path to Awareness, which argues that \\"Yoga is only safe and effective when it has mindfulness at its heart\\", and Robert Butera's 2018 Body Mindful Yoga: Create a Powerful and Affirming Relationship with Your Body.

The corps was amalgamated into the Medical Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1969. History The Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps was organized in 1902 and included the military physicians of the Swedish Navy and the Swedish Coastal Artillery. Prior to that, the navy's physicians were subordinate to the National Swedish Board of Health. The navy has, as far as the healthcare is concerned, an identical history as the Swedish Army. As early as 1535, so-called bardsk√§rer (\\"barbers\\") are mentioned in the navy; they were usually hired for each sea expeditions, after which they were dismissed. There was no initial healthcare at the shipyards, but the sick were usually sent to the respective home towns to be cared for there. Incidentally, these bardsk√§rer or f√§ltsk√§rer were difficult to obtain (the 1567 sea-going fleet of 47 ships had only 17 f√§ltsk√§rer). Moreover, since they would be rather ignorant and the hygienic devices aboard were particularly deficient, great morbidity and mortality ruled the navy and the army, paralyzing military operations. With the arrangement of medical education in Sweden and the formation of the Swedish Army Medical Corps (F√§ltl√§kark√•ren) in the early 1800s, the conditions improved. However, in the context of the navy's renewal and expansion towards the end of the 1800s, the need for more independent orderly healthcare for the same appeared. The same was also true of the other European navies. The sea duty also required more specifically educated physicians. According to the decision of the state authorities in 1902, the Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps was established. Except for the chief (the Surgeon General of the Swedish Navy, Marin√∂verl√§kare) with Captain's (N) rank, there were: 3 first naval surgeons with Commander's rank, 12 naval surgeons of the 1st class with Lieutenant's (N) rank, or possibly with Commander 2nd Class' rank, 20 naval surgeons of the 2nd class with Sub- Lieutenant's rank, or possibly Lieutenant's (N) rank, 12 naval surgeon exhibitioners with Sub-Lieutenant's rank, as well as a reserve with corresponding positions. In 1925, the Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps consisted of the Surgeon General of the Swedish Navy, 3 first naval surgeons (1 physicians each at Karlskrona and Stockholm naval stations, and 1 fortress physician at Vaxholm Fortress), 13 naval surgeon of the 1st rank (could after 10 years of well-attended service be appointed first naval surgeon), 20 naval surgeons of the 2nd rank (could after 3 years be appointed naval surgeon exhibitioner of the 1st rank), 10 naval surgeon exhibitioners as well as 10 active duty naval surgeon exhibitioners of military age with a Bachelor of Medical Sciences degree or Licentiate of Medical Sciences degree who thus fulfilled their military service. In addition, there was a reserve of physicians. In 1969, the Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps was amalgamated with the Swedish Army Medical Corps (F√§ltl√§kark√•ren) and the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps, which formed the Medical Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. Chiefs Herbert Westermark, chief of the corps from 1937 to 1956. The chief of the Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps was the Surgeon General of the Swedish Navy (Marin√∂verl√§karen) and he was commander of the corps and its reserve as well as head of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration's Sanitation Department. He was to assist the National Swedish Board of Health in dealing with matters concerning the health and medical care in the Swedish Navy and in the Swedish Coastal Artillery, with the right to participate in the deliberations of the Board of Directors on these questions. *1902‚Äì1917: Karl Leonard Rudberg *1917‚Äì1937: Gunnar Nilson *1937‚Äì1956: Herbert Westermark *1956‚Äì1969: Lars Troell Footnotes References =Notes= =Print=  * Further reading * Military administrative corps of Sweden Naval units and formations of Sweden Medical units and formations of Sweden Military units and formations established in 1902 Military units and formations disestablished in 1969 ","title":"Swedish Naval Medical Officers' Corps"},{"id":"60468702","text":"Bret Hart vs. Tom Magee was a professional wrestling match between Bret Hart and Tom Magee, of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

In October 2016, a formal alliance between the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, the Sudanese Journalists Network, and the Democratic Lawyers Association was created on the basis of a written charter. 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests After the 19 December 2018 Atbara protests started during the 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests, the SPA initially decided to coordinate with the protestors, by adding a call for an increased minimum wage. After discussing with the protestors, they decided to support the calls for \\"regime change\\". Following the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre, the SPA called for \\"complete civil disobedience and open political strike\\" on the grounds that the Transitional Military Council (TMC) was responsible for two days of mass murder, pillage, rape and violent repression of workers' strikes. The SPA described the TMC members as \\"deep to their knees in the blood of the innocent in Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, in addition to Khartoum and other cities and towns.\\" The SPA called for the Sudanese to follow the method of nonviolent resistance \\"in all [their] direct actions, towards change\\". In August 2019, the SPA announced that it would not take part in the cabinet of the transitional government but would instead participate in the Legislative Council in order to oversee the transition to democracy. SPA member Mohammed Hassan Osman al-Ta'ishi (or Mohamed El Taayshi) became one of the eleven members of the Sovereignty Council, the collective head of state of Sudan for a planned 39-month transitional period, on 20 August 2019.

They have received critical attention for their unique blend of Jamaican genres such as reggae and dub, as well as jazz, afrobeat, funk, soul, and psychedelic, with traditional Korean music, especially pansori. Members of the band have also been part of reggae band Windy City, retro rock band Kiha and the Faces, Kingston Rudieska, and I&I; Djangdan, qualifying them for \\"supergroup\\" status. They received international attention at Fuji Rock Festival for their song dedicated to late great trombonist Rico Rodriguez. The NST stands for initials of Noh Sun-teck, band leader, who started the project off solo before recruiting other members. He recorded his first solo album \\"Low and Steady\\" which led to the creation of the band. Previously he performed with gypsy trio Surisurimahasuri and reggae band Windy City, with which he performed at SXSW, Canadian Music Week, and Sierra Nevada World Music Festival. They have performed in China, Japan, the US, Colombia, and Chile. In the US, they opened for legendary Jamaican producer Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. They also performed at an impeachment rally against President Park Geun-hye in 2016. Pansori project In 2017, NST & the Soul Sauce paired up with multi-award-winning pansori vocalist Kim Yul-hee. Her status in the band is unclear but she has joined them on most overseas tours. They had been connected when director Kim Tae- yong, known for experimenting with traditional Korean music, invited them to perform a piece called \\"Reggae Inna Film, Heungbu\\" at Muju Film Festival. Kim Yul-hee appeared on \\"Red Tiger\\" on their 2017 release \\"Back When Tigers Smoked,\\" but the 2019 album \\"Version\\" put her more at the vocal center of the band, with multiple pansori entries including \\"Bbaengdeok\\" from the pansori play \\"Simcheongga\\" and \\"Joong Taryeong\\" (Monk Song), which uses verses from \\"Simcheongga\\" and \\"Heungboga.\\" Also included are \\"Bak Taryeong\\" (Gourd Song) from \\"Heungboga\\" and the folk song \\"Heung Taryeong.\\" The album was mixed by Naoyuki Uchida. Kim said it was difficult but rewarding to combine reggae and gugak rhythms. She has over 20 years of pansori experience from a young age, and studied under Sung Woo-hyang, Park Ae-ri and Han Seung-suk. She also sings a more modern style with the jazz fusion group NEQ, whose album \\"Passing of Illusion\\" won a Korean Music Award in 2016 for Best Crossover Album. They are not actually the first reggae band to perform with a pansori singer, which was previously accomplished by dub-reggae band I&I; Djangdan with pansori singer Jang Goon, who also formed the future pansori dub duo Ninano Nanda. Jang Goon also had collaborated with ska band Kingston Rudieska. However, this collaboration was the first that mixed in authentic pansori songs, rather than pansori vocal style. Critical response Their debut EP was selected as Album of the Week on Naver Music. Korean Indie said of their first album, \\"This is a trailblazing album for the Korean reggae scene and a new level of cultural intermixture. I was perplexed at the existence of a reggae scene in Korea, but Back When Tigers Smoked articulates the ways in which the Korean psyche can be embraced by the Jamaican genre.\\" Notable appearances =International tours= * [2016] Fuji Rock Festival (Japan) * [2016] Hong Kong International Reggae Ska Festival * [2017] Sierra Nevada World Music Festival (USA) * [2017] Tour Opening for Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry (USA) * [2017] Circulart (Colombia) * [2018] En Orbita (Chile) * [2019] Ear HUB (Hong Kong) * [2019] Fuji Rock Festival (Japan) * [2019] Zudrangma Records Presents Thailand Tour (Thailand) * [2019] WOMEX (Finland) * [2019] Mundial Montreal (Canada) * [2019] Rencontres Trans Musicales (France) =Local festivals, other= * [2016] Pentaport Rock Festival * [2016] Jarasum International Jazz Festival * [2016] Hwaeom Spiritual Music Ritual * [2016] Impeachment protests against Park Geun-hye * [2017] Ulsan World Music Festival * [2018] DMZ Peace Train Music Festival * [2018] Pentaport Rock Festival * [2018] House of Vans * [2018] Jeju Folk Village Festival * [2019] Do-ol Ah-in Going All Directions (KBS) * [2019] Pentaport Rock Festival * [2019] Playground Picnic Festival * [2019] Gangwon Rock Festival Discography =Albums= * [2016.6 ] 'Back When Tiger Smoked (International edition.)'

At that time the army led by Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf, toppled the government and National Legislature and declared a state of emergency in the country for a period of 3 months, followed by a transitional period of two years before an agreement was reached later. Background Protests have been ongoing in Sudan since 19 December 2018 when a series of demonstrations broke out in several cities due to dramatically rising costs of living and the deterioration of the country's economy. In January 2019, the protests shifted attention from economic matters to calls of resignation for the long time President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir. By February 2019, Bashir had declared the first state of national emergency in twenty years amidst increasing unrest. Coup d'√©tat and aftermath On 11 April, the Sudanese military removed Omar al-Bashir from his position as President of Sudan, dissolved the cabinet and the National Legislature, and announced a three-month state of emergency, to be followed by a two-year transition period. Lt. Gen. Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf, who was both the defense minister of Sudan and the Vice President of Sudan, declared himself the de facto Head of State, announced the suspension of the country's constitution, and imposed a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am, effectively ordering the dissolution of the ongoing protests. Along with the National Legislature and national government, state governments and legislative councils in Sudan were dissolved as well. State media reported that all political prisoners, including anti-Bashir protest leaders, were being released from jail. Al-Bashir's National Congress Party responded by announcing that they would hold a rally supporting the ousted president. Soldiers also raided the offices of the Islamic Movement, the main ideological wing of the National Congress, in Khartoum. On 12 April, the ruling military government agreed to shorten the length of its rule to \\"as early as a month\\" and transfer control to a civilian government if negotiations could result in a new government being formed. That evening, Auf stepped down as head of the military council and made Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, who serves as general inspector of the armed forces, his successor. This came following protests over his decision not to extradite Bashir to the International Criminal Court. The resignation was regarded as a \\"triumph\\" by the protestors, who were overjoyed. Burhan is considered to have a cleaner record than the rest of al-Bashir's generals and is not wanted or implicated for war crimes by any international court. He was one of the generals who had reached out to protesters during their week-long encampment near the military headquarters, meeting with them face to face and listening to their views. Anti-Omar al- Bashir revolutionary street stencil in Khartoum. Despite the imposed curfew, protesters remained on the streets. On 13 April, Burhan announced in his first televised address that the curfew which had been imposed by Auf was now lifted and that an order was issued to complete the release of all prisoners jailed under emergency laws ordered by Bashir. Hours beforehand, members of the ruling military council released a statement to Sudanese television which stated that Burhan had accepted the resignation of intelligence and security chief Salah Gosh. Gosh had overseen the crackdown of protestors who opposed al-Bashir. Following these announcements, talks between the protestors and the military to transition to a civilian government officially started. In a statement, several Sudanese activists, including those of the Sudanese Professionals Association and the Sudanese Communist Party, denounced the Transitional Military Council as a government of \\"the same faces and entities that our great people have revolted against\\". The activists demanded that power be handed over to a civilian government. On 12 April, Col. General Omar Zein al-Abideen, a member of the Transitional Military Council, announced that the transfer of Sudanese government to civilian rule would take place in \\"as early as a month if a government is formed\\" and offered to start talks with protestors to start this transition. On 14 April 2019, it was announced that council had agreed to have the protestors nominate a civilian Prime Minister and have civilians run every Government ministry outside the Defense and Interior Ministries. The same day, military council spokesman Shams El Din Kabbashi Shinto announced that Auf had been removed as Defense Minister and Lt. General Abu Bakr Mustafa was named to succeed Gosh as chief of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). On 15 April 2019, Shams al- Din Kabbashi announced that \\"The former ruling National Congress Party (NCP) will not participate in any transitional government\\". Despite being barred from the transitional government, the NCP has not been barred from taking part in future elections. Prominent activist Mohammed Naji al-Asam announced that trust was also growing between the military and the protestors following more talks and the release of more political prisoners, despite a poorly organized attempt by the army to disperse the sit-in. It was also announced that the military council was restructuring, which began with the appointments of Colonel General Hashem Abdel Muttalib Ahmed Babakr as army chief of staff and Colonel General Mohamed Othman al-Hussein as deputy chief of staff. On 15 April, the African Union gave Sudan 15 days to install a civilian government. If the ruling military council does not comply, Sudan will be suspended as a member of the AU. On 16 April, the military council announced that Burhan had again cooperated with the demands of the protestors and sacked the nation's three top prosecutors, including chief prosecutor Omar Ahmed Mohamed Abdelsalam, public prosecutor Amer Ibrahim Majid, and deputy public prosecutor Hesham Othman Ibrahim Saleh. The same day, two sources with direct knowledge told CNN that Bashir, his former interior minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein, and Ahmed Haroun, the former head of the ruling party, will be charged with corruption and the death of protesters. On 23 April, the AU agreed to extend the transition deadline from 15 days to three months. On 24 April, three members of the Transitional Military Council submitted their resignations. Those who resigned included political committee chair Lieutenant-General Omar Zain al-Abideen, Lieutenant-General Jalal al-Deen al-Sheikh and Lieutenant- General Al-Tayeb Babakr Ali Fadeel. On 27 April, an agreement was reached to form a transitional council made up jointly of civilians and military, though the exact details of the power-sharing arrangement were not yet agreed upon, as both sides wanted to have a majority. The military also announced the resignation of the three military council generals. Dozens of women were raped on 3 June 2019 by Sudanese security forces and at least 87 people were killed by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and other troops tore apart a sit-in camp Khartoum. Fate of al-Bashir and his allies After being detained, al-Bashir was initially placed under house arrest under heavy guard; his personal bodyguard was dismissed.Farai Sevenzo, Sarah El Sirgany and Nima Elbagir, Sudan will prosecute Bashir but won't hand him over, military says, CNN (13 April 2019). Lt. General Omar Zain al-Abideen, who at the time also served as head of the Transitional Military Council's political committee, said that the military government would not extradite al-Bashir to The Hague to face charges in the International Criminal Court (ICC), where al-Bashir is the subject of an arrest warrant on counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Darfur genocide between 2003 and 2008. Al-Abideen said, however, that the military government would seek to prosecute al-Bashir in Sudan. More than 100 of al-Bashir's allies, including Prime Minister Mohamed Taher Ayala, National Congress Party leader and ICC fugitive for war crimes and crimes against humanity Ahmed Haroun, member of the National Congress Awad Al-Jaz, and former vice presidents Bakri Hassan Saleh and Ali Othman Taha were also arrested. Former defense minister and Khartoum state Governor Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, also subject to an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, was also arrested. More people who had served in al- Bashir's government were reported to have been arrested on 14 April 2019, as well. Among the people arrested on 14 April included the head of the party's political sector Abdel Rahman al-Khidir, former Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud, former Presidential Affairs Minister Fadl Abdallah, and head of the party's youth sector Mohamed al-Amin. On 17 April 2019, two prison officials, as well as members of al-Bashir's family, confirmed that al-Bashir was transferred from the presidential palace, where he had been under house arrest, to Khartoum's Kobar maximum security prison.Sudan crisis: Ex-President Omar al-Bashir moved to prison, BBC News (17 April 2019). Al-Bashir was reported to be surrounded by tight security and held in solitary confinement, in the same prison where he had held political prisoners during his time in power. This came a day after Uganda's Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello considered offering the former Sudan President asylum in Uganda. Several other allies of al-Bashir are being held at the prison as well. The reports of al-Bashir's transfer were later confirmed to Al Jazeera by a prison guard. Military council spokesman Shams Eldin Kabashi added that two of al- Bashir's brothers, Abdullah al-Bashir and Alabas al-Bashir, were arrested as well.

A related problem is to decide whether the graph has a cycle in which the sum of weights is less than 0. This related problem can be solved in polynomial time using the Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm. In contrast, detecting a cycle of weight exactly 0 is an NP-complete problem. The problem is in NP since, given a cycle, it is easy to verify that its weight is 0. The proof of NP-hardness is by reduction from the subset sum problem. In this problem we are given a set of numbers, positive and some negative, and have to decide whether there exists a subset whose sum is exactly 0. Given an instance of subset-sum with n numbers, construct an instance of zero-weight-cycle as follows. Construct a graph with 2n vertices. For each number ai the graph contains two vertices: ui and vi. From each ui, there is only one outgoing edge, which goes to vi and has weight ai. From each vi, there are n outgoing edges, which go to each uj and have weights 0. Any cycle in this graph have the form u1-v1-u2-v2-...-uk-vk. The weight of a cycle is 0, iff the sum of all weights between each ui and its corresponding vi is 0, iff the sum of all corresponding ai is 0, iff there is a subset with a sum of 0\\\\.

She then went down into the castle courtyard and invited the other women of the garrison to join her, they were very reluctant to do fear of punishment in the afterlife. Tsuruhime assured them, that they should not fear death because death on the battlefield would lead to the Western Paradise of Amida Buddha in the Pure Land. At this the castle gate was opened and Tsuruhime led a suicidal charge into the midst of the enemy, accompanied by 34 other women whom she had inspired. The first reaction from the Mori troops was one of surprise and disbelief, she advanced against the huge army and after much resistance arrived at the enemy main camp. Ueno Tsuruhime spotted Nomi Munekatsu, the commander of M≈çri army and tried to challenge him to a single combat, but Munekatsu said he would not be able to fight a woman and politely declined this request saying she was a woman of honor. The victory was already decided, Ueno Tsuruhime returned to the castle and killed herself along with the thirty-four women, the last act of honor as a samurai.

Across several different media her work often displayed innovative elements of design and also showed her interest in Indian and Eastern forms of sculpture. Biography Sculpture panel at the former St Martin's School of Art by Ryland Ryland was born in Windsor, where her father was a solicitor and where she would settle later in life. She studied at the Heatherley School of Fine Art from 1920 to 1925 and then at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art where she was taught linocut and woodcut techniques by Iain Macnab and Claude Flight. In 1927 she began exhibiting with the Women's International Art Club, WIAC, which became her main exhibition venue throughout her career. In 1936 Ryland became a member of WIAC and remained so for many years until the late 1950s. In 1931, she exhibited at the Ward and Albany Galleries and later at both the Wertheim and Bloomsbury Galleries. During the 1930s, Ryland undertook a number of sculpture commissions and also worked for the London County Council, producing sculptured stonework panels for a number of public buildings. These included the School of Butchers building and, possibly her best known work, the panels surrounding the four entrance ways to the former St Martin's School of Art and College of Distributive Trades building on the Charing Cross Road in central London, which has been the Foyles bookshop since 2014. For the School of Art, Ryland produced two sets of sculptured low-relief stone panels, eight showing students and shop workers at work, for example at a sawing machine or unrolling a bolt of fabric, and four portraits of dramatic figures. Ryland worked on the panels from 1937 to 1939 and the following year the Tate acquired her 1933 sculpture panel Isaac Blesses Jacob, which displays her interest in Indian and Eastern forms, for its collection. In 1987 the Michael Parkins Gallery hosted the exhibition Printmakers of the 20s and 30s and Adolfine Ryland which featured her prints and drawings plus two posters, Home from the Office and Out of the fog, into the sunshine which she had produced for London Underground. Ryland sometimes signed her work \\"Koncelik\\", which had been her mother's maiden name.

Historically, he was a descendant of Gerashi thanes (Khan in Persian). In his youth, he traveled on foot along the coasts of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea and began mapping and documenting their topography. Jalal Ale Ahmad, the famous writer, described the friendship between Ahmad Eghtedari, Iraj Afshar and Manuchehr Sotudeh as \\"three musketeers\\" and \\"gravestone-graphers\\", alluding to the fact that these three managed to introduce a lot of Iran's historical documents and ancient monuments. The Pearl of The Persian Gulf is a book that documents his Iranian Studies researches, and the documentary film, To Iran, My Eternal, is made based on his life and works. Ahmad Eghtedari died on 16 April 2019 in Tehran.  Life and education  Ahmad Eghtedari was born Ahmad Khan Eqtedari Gerashi in 1925 in Gerash, a small city in the south of Fars, Iran. Both his parents, Mortaza Qoli Khan Eghtedari and Aniss Eghtedari, were Gerashi descendants of thanes (Khan in Persian) of Gerash. He started his education in Lar and Shiraz. He returned to Lar to work as a teacher in elementary school, which he continued to do for 30 years. Meanwhile, in 1949, he was accepted in the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences of the University of Tehran and graduated as a lawyer in 1955. He worked as a lawyer for 40 years. At the same time, he started his researches about the history of Larestan. Due to these prominent studies, he was invited to teach history to graduate students of the University of Tehran. Later, he received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Tehran for his outstanding works and researches.  Explorations in the Persian Gulf  His explorations along the coast of the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea between 1966 and 1977 (from Bandar Deilam, Jask, Bandar Rig, Zahedan, Chabahar and Tis) resulted in the composition of such books as The Land of the Princes and also more than 4000 photos from historical sites. These documents are massively significant in the introduction of the history and culture of the southern regions of Iran and the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Eghtedari filled his resume with vast studies in the works of the ancient times and also field studies. Due to these researches, he was invited to teach history to PhD students of history in the University of Tehran, from which he later received an honorary doctorate degree. Mohammad Reza Shafiee Kadkani, the writer and researcher, praises Eghtedari's works in these words: ‚ÄúThe Persian Gulf is the heart of Iran, and Dr. Ahmad Eghtedari, the heart of the Persian Gulf.‚Äù Mohammad Bagher Vosoughi, professor of history in the University of Tehran, also comments on Eghtedari: ‚ÄúIn the recent 60 years, one cannot read about the Persian Gulf and ignore the works of Ahmad Eghtedari. Linguists, archeologists and historians make significant references to Eghtedari‚Äôs works.‚Äù  Bibliography  Funeral of Eghtedari in Gerash Eghtedari's works are not limited to a single discipline. He has written books and articles in the fields of geography, folklore, linguistics, Iran's classic literature and bibliography. Eghtedari wrote 40 books and more than 100 scholarly papers. These works cover a wide range of topics, including the correction and publication of poetry collections written by previous poets, translations of the research works of non-Iranian scholars and writers, tales of Mathnavi, Manteq-o-Tair (Assembly of Birds) and One Thousand and One Nights, and also scientific researches in the fields of the language and the culture of different regions of Iran.

In 1973, Cronulla reached their first ever grand final against Manly-Warringah. Archer played at centre in the grand final which is often remembered as one of the most brutal grand finals due to the solid defense of both teams. Manly would go on to defeat Cronulla 10-7 in front of 52,044 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In the following seasons, Cronulla fell back down the ladder after the grand final defeat but Archer remained a regular starter in the team and switched positions from centre to second-row. In 1978, Cronulla finished 2nd on the table and qualified for the finals. Cronulla defeated Manly in the opening week of the finals series 17-12 with Archer scoring a try. Cronulla then defeated minor premiers Western Suburbs to reach their second grand final against Manly. In the Grand Final, Archer played at second-row as Cronulla went to a 9-4 lead in the second half before Manly came back to hit the front 11-9.

The plot involves military aircraft being stolen by \\"hot plane\\" thieves, to be re-sold to new owners, with most of the world at war, presumably to war- torn countries. With location filming done at Alhambra Airport, California, the film features numerous aircraft models, including the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior as the \\"Mercy Plane\\". Lead actor Dunn, a licensed pilot, did his own flying in the film. Plot Speed Leslie is known as the best pilot on the air racing circuit, but he begins to lose to aviatrix Brenda Gordon when his plane keeps malfunctioning during races. Unbeknownst to Speed and Brenda, her older brother, Big Jim Gordon, is behind the sabotage efforts. Big Jim and his partner, Rocco Wolf, an ace pilot, are in the business of stealing aircraft, and purchase the Criterion Aircraft factory as a front. Meanwhile, Speed, looking for extra cash to support his flying hobby, applies for a job as a test pilot at the Benson aircraft factory. Benson needs Speed to test his new, top-secret hospital aircraft model called the Mercy Plane, which is said to be able to \\"land on a dime\\". Returning to his own hangar, Speed runs into Brenda again, who tries to flirt with him while he remains suspicious of her. Brenda gets Speed to take her out to eat at a hamburger joint. Rocco and his protege, Skid, follow them, and after Speed drops off Brenda at her house, they run Speed's jalopy off the road and report the accident as that of a drunk driver. The next day, Brenda comes to bail Speed out of jail, but he refuses to accept her help. Big Jim gives Curly, Speed's mechanic, the money to bail Speed out. Meanwhile, at five o'clock that morning when Speed was due to test-drive the Mercy Plane, Rocco jumps into the cockpit instead and flies the plane off to a secret location. Speed is accused of the robbery and is stripped of his pilot's license. Determined to clear his name, Speed sneaks into Big Jim's office to search his sales records and also searches the factory premises at night, discovering boxes of aircraft parts waiting for shipment. Rocco and Skid find him there but he manages to outwit them and leaves the two bound and gagged. Speed convinces Brenda to join him for a test drive and takes the plane far off-course, crashing it in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The two are unhurt, but Speed pretends that the radio has been damaged and continually cuts off communication with air traffic controllers attempting to pinpoint his location. Brenda wonders why Speed obviously planned the crash, having brought along plenty of food and blankets, and refuses to trust him. After five days during which all search efforts have failed and the pair is assumed dead, Speed finally tells her that his plan is to get her brother to bring the Mercy Plane out of hiding to rescue her. Brenda doesn't believe him, but indeed, Big Jim sends Rocco out to rescue his sister when Speed claims over the \\"broken\\" radio that she is badly injured. Big Jim, Rocco, and Skid all arrive at the crash site and land the Mercy Plane easily. When they find out Speed has tricked them, Rocco fatally shoots Big Jim and Big Jim fires back, wounding Rocco. Speed is the only one left who can fly the Mercy Plane back to Los Angeles, where he is removed from all suspicion and his pilot's license restored.

Dunn, a licensed pilot, did his own flying in the film. Production on Mercy Plane began in mid-November 1939, with location photography taking place at Alhambra Airport, California. Aircraft used in the production are: * Travel Air 4000-Waco RNF c/n 3263, NC853V * Fisk 11 (archive footage) * Emsco B7 C c/n 1, NC969Y * Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior c/n 1216, NC17342 * Fairchild 24C-8C c/n 2664, NC14792 * Ryan STA c/n 129, NC16040 (in a hangar) * Aeronca K c/n 209, NC19341 Newsreel footage from the National Air Races of 1933, 1934, and 1936 was used to portray Brenda's races in the film. Aeromovies notes that Mercy Plane appeared just two years after the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. Gifford's character, who hopes to make a round-the-world flight, remotely resembles that of the lost aviatrix. Aeromovies adds that the Mercy Plane itself, a Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior, \\"looks very conventional, but nevertheless has some surprising flight characteristics: barely taken off, it climbs vertically like an F-15 or a Rafale, and lands like a Harrier\\". Release The film was released in 1939. A home video was issued in July 1995. Critical reception The Boston Globe called Dunn's performance \\"a first rate portrayal of an ingratiating pilot who becomes involved, innocently of course, with a murderous gang who steal planes as other thieves steal automobiles...\\" Miller called Gifford \\"stylishly attractive\\". Hischak wrote that \\"the romantic scenes are as awkward as the plot but some of the aerial sequences are worth seeing\\". Parish and Pitts said the film is \\"hampered by shoddy special effects\\".

It currently bears the name of Major General M√°ximo G√≥mez, who was a 19th century Cuban independence fighter. It was founded in 1963 and is under the orbit of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (vMINFAR), whose employees are trained by the school. The command academy has been decorated with many military and state awards such as the Order of Antonio Maceo and the Order Carlos J. Finlay.  Overview  which was The command academy was founded in July 1963 in the western La Habana Province as the successor to the El Morro Academy, which operated under the former Bastista regime. In the 1980s, attendance at the school became an exclusive for those who were preparing to be assigned to the FAR General Staff. In the 1990s, a period when the FAR increased its influence in the management of Cuba's economy, the academy introduced civilian economists who were hired by the MINFAR to spread and teach the economic reforms that they favored. During that same period, the academy also grew increasingly in importance, eventually becoming second in precedence next to the recently established National Defense College, which was modeled on the Canadian RMC. Although organized for senior MINFAR officials, civilians who work for the government and/or the Communist Party of Cuba also are invited to attend the courses. Curriculum The school's curriculum is comparable to courses offered by the United States Army Command and General Staff College or the United States Army War College.

Mike Hobart of Financial Times stated \\"Redman has been touring with Aaron Goldberg, Reuben Rogers and Gregory Hutchinson on piano, bass and drums for over 20 years though, surprisingly, this is their first joint release since 2001‚Äôs Passage of Time. Now, the improvisations are more closely argued, narratives unfold at speed and swing rhythms have all but disappeared. And the band have developed a mutual empathy and trust that make the ensemble playing relaxed and free\\".

Jane's life illustrates a bigger picture regarding slavery and violence in the early eighteenth century. Jane was captured in West Africa and brought over through the Middle Passage to Barbados. She was described by her markings in her runaway ad which made Jane‚Äôs body seem vulnerable. The exact date of Jane‚Äôs self-liberation from her owner is unsure but we are able to assume it was a few days prior to January 13, 1789 when Jane's master, John Wright, had sent in a runaway advertisement for Jane in the Barbados Mercury. John Wright offered a 20 shilling reward for the person who would return Jane to him.  Country Marks vs Enslaved punishment marks  Marisa J. Fuentes discusses the life of Jane in her first chapter of her book.\\"Left only with the newspaper trace of her scarred body, we lose her alongside 'all the lives that are outside of history.'\\" \\"Jan. 13, 1789 \\"RUNAWAY: A short black skin negro women named JANE, speaks broken English, has her country marks in [sic] her forehead and a fire brand on one of her breasts, likewise a large mark of her country behind her shoulder almost to the small of her back, and a [stab] of a knife in her neck. Whoever will bring said negro to the subscriber in Bridge Town shall receive 20 shillings... John Wright.\\" -Barbados Mercury. The ad was intended to make the public aware of an enslaved woman who ran away so that she would be returned to her owners. Fuentes discusses the scars that were inflicted on enslaved people‚Äôs bodies to show who they belonged to. Jane‚Äôs scars included a mark on her forehead, a firebrand on her breast, on her shoulder, as well as a stab of a knife on her neck. Some of these marks would be a constant reminder of ‚Äúpain and unfreedom;‚Äù historians believe Jane's \\"country marks\\" on her forehead and a few other places on her body were ritual marks or scars given to her in Africa. The rest of the marks inflicted on Jane were punishment scars, showing a key fact of ownership: someone is able to abuse you.  Enslaved Sexual Vulnerability  Thomas Jeffery 1750: map of Barbados Enslaved women were subjected to the power and control of their owners in multiple spaces, such as work and living spaces. These enslaved women were vulnerable to any kind of treatment from the privileged white men in the household or even within the community. The primary work of the enslaved women in Barbados was agricultural labor on sugar cane plantations but some enslaved women also did domestic work inside the homes of the British colonists, especially in cities like Bridge Town. Domestic work for an enslaved woman included cooking, cleaning, as well as sewing. This kind of work could mean sexual danger for these urban women since they were so close to the colonists that could possibly inflict violence. As a runaway in Bridge Town, Jane could have possibly experienced the fear of being a woman alone in the town surrounded by white and Black free men. Rape was a constant fear for the enslaved black women. Enslaved women were not able to resist sexual assaults on their bodies. Jane could have possibly experienced these same fears as a runaway slave in Bridge Town. There was no easy direct way off the island so Jane would have had to survive concealed in the busy midst of the town. Being generally vulnerable to sexual relations, enslaved women in Barbados might conceive of a pregnancy. Any children bore from the maternal side of an enslaved would result in the offspring being enslaved as well. This exploitation of the enslaved women's bodies was a statement that their bodies and anything that came from them was owned and enslaved. The control of an enslaved women's body was also profit and more control for the slave owners. Pregnancy generally made it more difficult for enslaved women to escape. Sometimes slave owners tried to get their female slaves pregnant, as it was a profit to the owners. This exploitation of an enslaved women's bodies with forced sex, reminded these Black women that they had no control, not even over their own bodies or reproductive system.  Concubinage and Sexual Exploitation  Rachel Pringle Polgreen Bridge Town, Barbados in the late eighteenth century was a busy trade port for the island. The free Black population in Bridge Town was small but eventually grew. Even though some Black men and women were free from slavery, there was still no escape from the social, political, and economic oppression. Fuentes believes that Jane would have run to Bridge Town to look for work to blend in with the rest of the community. Most of the work opportunities for the free Black women were small trades, domestic work in homes, store keeping, and prostitution. The main occupation for enslaved women was prostitution. Slave owners could profit from enslaved women bodies not only by encouraging pregnancy, but also by selling sexual access to white men, violating these women's bodies. Rachael Pringle Polgreen was a freed, elite, Black woman in Bridge Town, Barbados in the late eighteenth century. Polgreen owned slaves and a brothel to sustain herself economically. She was well known all over Bridge Town to the newspaper, the Royal Navy, to white elites, as well as to other freed black elites in the community. Polgreen's brothel was to serve the sexual desires of those willing to pay for the services. Polgreen's enslaved women were available and disposable in the sexual labor. This forced \\"hiring- out\\" of enslaved women's bodies made them vulnerable to violence and reinforced their status as sexual objects. Historian Fuentes is unsure of the ultimate fate of Jane and whether she might have experienced these violent action by the British colonists and the Royal Navy. Fuentes hypothesizes that Jane possibly experienced this sexual abuse at some point or another. Jane's story and life is a part of the bigger picture of the inflicted sexual and physical violence done to the enslaved women of Barbados.
