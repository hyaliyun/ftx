If infection occurs 0‚Äì28 days before conception, the infant has a 43% risk of being affected. If the infection occurs 0‚Äì12 weeks after conception, the risk increases to 81%. If the infection occurs 13‚Äì26 weeks after conception, the risk is 54% of the infant being affected by the disease. Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester, or 26‚Äì40 weeks after conception. Problems rarely occur when rubella is contracted by the mother after 20 weeks of gestation and continues to disseminate the virus after birth. It was discovered in 1941 by Australian Norman McAlister Gregg. Signs and symptoms Infant with skin lesions from congenital rubella \\"Salt-and-pepper\\" retinopathy is characteristic of congenital rubella. Congenital rubella serology time-line The classic triad for congenital rubella syndrome is: *Sensorineural deafness (58% of patients) *Eye abnormalities‚Äîespecially retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and microphthalmia (43% of patients) *Congenital heart disease‚Äîespecially pulmonary artery stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus (50% of patients) Other manifestations of CRS may include: *Spleen, liver, or bone marrow problems (some of which may disappear shortly after birth) *Intellectual disability *Small head size (microcephaly) *Low birth weight *Thrombocytopenic purpura *Extramedullary hematopoiesis (presents as a characteristic blueberry muffin rash) *Enlarged liver *Small jaw size *Skin lesions Children who have been exposed to rubella in the womb should also be watched closely as they age for any indication of: *Developmental delay *Autism *Schizophrenia *Growth retardation *Learning disabilities *Diabetes mellitus Prevention Vaccinating the majority of the population is effective at preventing congenital rubella syndrome. For women who plan to become pregnant, the MMR (measles mumps, rubella) vaccination is highly recommended, at least 28 days prior to conception. The vaccine should not be given to women who are already pregnant as it contains a live version of the virus. Other preventative actions can include the screening and vaccinations of high-risk personnel, such as medical and child care professions.

He is also professor of poetry at the University of Leeds and succeeded Geoffrey Hill as Oxford Professor of Poetry when he was elected to the four-year part-time appointment from 2015‚Äì2019. Early life and education Armitage was born in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and grew up in the village of Marsden, where his family still live. He has an older sister, Hilary. His father Peter is a former electrician, probation officer and firefighter who is well known locally for writing plays and pantomimes for his all-male panto group, The Avalanche Dodgers. He wrote his first poem aged 10 as a school assignment. Armitage first studied at Colne Valley High School, Linthwaite, and went on to study geography at Portsmouth Polytechnic. He was a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester, where his MA thesis concerned the effects of television violence on young offenders. Finding himself jobless after graduation, he decided to train as a probation officer, like his father before him. Around this time he began writing poetry more seriously. He worked as a probation officer in Greater Manchester until 1994. Career His first poetry collection was called Human Geography (1988). He published Zoom! in 1989. He has lectured on creative writing at the University of Leeds, the University of Iowa, and was senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University. He has made literary, history and travel programmes for BBC Radio 3 and 4; and since 1992 he has written and presented a number of TV documentaries. From 2009 to 2012 he was Artist in Residence at London's South Bank, and in February 2011 he became Professor of Poetry at the University of Sheffield. In October 2017 he was appointed as the first Professor of Poetry at the University of Leeds. In 2019 he was appointed Poet Laureate for ten years, following Carol Ann Duffy. =Writing= Armitage's poetry collections include Book of Matches (1993) and The Dead Sea Poems (1995). He has written two novels, Little Green Man (2001) and The White Stuff (2004), as well as All Points North (1998), a collection of essays on Northern England. He produced a dramatised version of Homer's Odyssey and a collection of poetry entitled Tyrannosaurus Rex Versus The Corduroy Kid (which was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize), both of which were published in July 2006. Many of Armitage's poems appear in the AQA (Assessment and Qualifications Alliance) GCSE syllabus for English Literature in the United Kingdom. These include \\"Homecoming\\", \\"Extract from Out of the Blue\\", \\"November\\", \\"Kid\\", \\"Hitcher\\", \\"Remains\\", and a selection of poems from Book of Matches, most notably of these \\"Mother any distance...\\". His work also appears on CCEA's GCSE English Literature course. He is characterised by a dry Yorkshire wit combined with \\"an accessible, realist style and critical seriousness.\\" His translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (2007) was adopted for the ninth edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature, and he was the narrator of a 2010 BBC documentary about the poem and its use of landscape. Armitage in 2015 Armitage also writes for radio, television, film and stage. He is the author of five stage plays, including Mister Heracles, a version of Euripides' The Madness of Heracles. The Last Days of Troy premiered at Shakespeare's Globe in June 2014. He was commissioned in 1996 by the National Theatre in London to write Eclipse for the National Connections series, a play inspired by the real-life disappearance of a girl in Hebden Bridge, and set at the time of the 1999 solar eclipse in Cornwall. Most recently Armitage wrote the libretto for an opera scored by Scottish composer Stuart MacRae, The Assassin Tree, based on a Greek myth recounted in The Golden Bough.

Saturday Night (Century Films, BBC2, 1996) ‚Äì wrote and narrated a fifty-minute poetic commentary to a documentary about night-life in Leeds, directed by Brian Hill. In 2010, Armitage walked the 264-mile Pennine Way, walking south from Scotland to Derbyshire. Along the route he stopped to give poetry readings, often in exchange for donations of money, food or accommodation, despite the rejection of the free life seen in his 1993 poem \\"Hitcher\\", and has written a book about his journey, called Walking Home. He has received numerous awards for his poetry, including The Sunday Times Author of the Year, a Forward Prize, a Lannan Award, and an Ivor Novello Award for his song lyrics in the Channel 4 film Feltham Sings. Kid and CloudCuckooLand were short-listed for the Whitbread poetry prize. The Dead Sea Poems was short-listed for the Whitbread, the Forward Poetry Prize and the T. S. Eliot Prize.

The libraries are to be selected in alphabetical order: in March 2020 he is to visit places or libraries with names starting with \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" (including the British Library), and so on until \\"W\\", \\"X\\", \\"Y\\" and \\"Z\\" in 2029. He comments: \\"The letter X will be interesting ‚Äì does anywhere in the UK begin with X?

In May 2020 Armitage was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His choice of music (eight pieces to take to an imaginary desert island) was wide-ranging but the track he would save from a flood was David Bowie's \\"Moonage Daydream\\"; his chosen book was the Oxford English Dictionary, and his luxury a tennis ball. In April 2020, in a short interview on the BBC 6 Music show Guy Garvey's Finest Hour, Armitage chose the track \\"Stanlow\\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, taken from their 1980 album Organisation. The song is a homage to the Stanlow Oil Refinery. Personal life Armitage lives in the Holme Valley, West Yorkshire, close to his family home in Marsden. He is married to radio producer Sue Roberts.

Music Armitage is the first poet laureate who is also a DJ. He is a massive music fan, especially of The Smiths. During what his wife Sue described as \\"a bit of a mid-life crisis\\", Armitage and his college friend Craig Smith founded the band The Scaremongers.

Description  A large gene pool indicates extensive genetic diversity, which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) can cause reduced biological fitness and an increased chance of extinction, although as explained by genetic drift new genetic variants, that may cause an increase in the fitness of organisms, are more likely to fix in the population if it is rather small. When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait, the population is said to be 'monomorphic'. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are said to be polymorphic.  History  The Russian geneticist Alexander Sergeevich Serebrovsky first formulated the concept in the 1920s as genofond (gene fund), a word that was imported to the United States from the Soviet Union by Theodosius Dobzhansky, who translated it into English as ‚Äúgene pool.‚Äù  Gene pool concept in crop breeding  Harlan and de Wet (1971) proposed classifying each crop and its related species by gene pools rather than by formal taxonomy. #Primary gene pool (GP-1): Members of this gene pool are probably in the same \\"species\\" (in conventional biological usage) and can intermate freely. Harlan and de Wet wrote, \\"Among forms of this gene pool, crossing is easy; hybrids are generally fertile with good chromosome pairing; gene segregation is approximately normal and gene transfer is generally easy.\\". They also advised subdividing each crop gene pool in two: #*Subspecies A: Cultivated races #*Subspecies B: Spontaneous races (wild or weedy) #Secondary gene pool (GP-2): Members of this pool are probably normally classified as different species than the crop species under consideration (the primary gene pool). However, these species are closely related and can cross and produce at least some fertile hybrids. As would be expected by members of different species, there are some reproductive barriers between members of the primary and secondary gene pools: #*hybrids may be weak #*hybrids may be partially sterile #*chromosomes may pair poorly or not at all #*recovery of desired phenotypes may be difficult in subsequent generations #*However, \\"The gene pool is available to be utilized, however, if the plant breeder or geneticist is willing to put out the effort required.\\" #Tertiary gene pool (GP-3): Members of this gene pool are more distantly related to the members of the primary gene pool. The primary and tertiary gene pools can be intermated, but gene transfer between them is impossible without the use of \\"rather extreme or radical measures\\" such as: #*embryo rescue (or embryo culture, a form of plant organ culture) #*induced polyploidy (chromosome doubling) #*bridging crosses (e.g., with members of the secondary gene pool).  Gene pool centres  Gene pool centres refers to areas on the earth where important crop plants and domestic animals originated. They have an extraordinary range of the wild counterparts of cultivated plant species and useful tropical plants. Gene pool centres also contain different sub tropical and temperate region species.

Napier & Son Limited was a British engineering company best known for its luxury motor cars in the Edwardian era and for its aero engines throughout the early to mid-20th century. Napier was founded as a precision engineering company in 1808 and for nearly a century produced machinery for the financial, print and munitions industries. In the early 20th century it moved for a time into internal combustion engines and road vehicles before turning to aero engines. Its powerful Lion dominated the UK market in the 1920s and the Second World War era Sabre produced 3500 hp (2,600 kW) in its later versions. Many world speed records on land and water, as well as the Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighter planes, were powered by Napier engines. During the Second World War the company was taken over by English Electric, and engine manufacture eventually ceased. Today, Napier Turbochargers is a subsidiary of the American company Wabtec.  History  = Early years and precision engineering = Steam engine built by D. Napier & Son in 1859 1909 Napier T23 Roadster David Napier, second son of the blacksmith to the Duke of Argyll, was born in 1785. While cousins became shipbuilders, he took engineering training in Scotland before coming to London. There in 1808 he founded the firm that was to become D. Napier & Son in Lloyds Court, St Giles, London.Wilson & Reader (1958). He designed a steam-powered printing press, some of which went to Hansard (the printer and publisher of proceedings of the Houses of Parliament), as well as newspapers. The company moved to Lambeth, South London in 1830. Between 1840 and 1860, Napier was prosperous, with a well-outfitted factory and between 200 and 300 workers. Napier made a wide variety of products, including a centrifuge for sugar manufacturing, lathes and drills, ammunition-making equipment for the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and railway cranes.Hull (1974), p. 1438 David's younger son James Murdoch, born 1823, joined the firm in 1837 and became a partner in 1847, resulting in a change in the private company's name to D. Napier & Son. James succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1867, and after his father's death in 1873, specialized in crafted precision machinery for making coins, printing stamps and banknotes. James proved an excellent engineer, but a poor businessman, considering salesmanship undignified. His company's fortunes went so bad that there were as few as seven employees in 1895, and James attempted to sell the business, but failed.Hull (1974), p. 1484 = Montague Napier and high- performance vehicles = James' son Montague, born 1870, inherited the business in 1895, along with his father's engineering talents. Montague was a hobby racing cyclist, and at the Bath Road Club, he met \\"ebullient Australian\\" S. F. Edge (then a manager at Dunlop Rubber and colleague of H. J. Lawson in London, and amateur racer of motor tricycles.) Edge persuaded Napier to improve his Panhard \\"Old Number 8\\" ( which had won the 1896 Paris‚ÄìMarseille‚ÄìParis), converting from a tiller to a steering wheel and improving the oiling. Dissatisfied, Napier offered to fit an engine of his own design, an 8 hp vertical twin, with electric ignition, superior to the Panhard's hot tube type.Hull (1974), p. 1485 Edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage Napier to make his own car and collaborated with Harvey du Cros, his former boss at Dunlop, to form the Motor Power Company, based in London, which agreed to buy Napier's entire output. The first of an initial order of six, three each two-cylinder 8 hp and four-cylinder 16 hp, all with aluminum bodies by Arthur Mulliner of Northampton and chain drive, was delivered 31 March 1900; Edge paid ¬£400 and sold at ¬£500. In 1903 the manufacturing business moved from Lambeth to larger premises in Acton and in 1906 it became a limited liability company, D. Napier & Son Limited, although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years. Outside the racing program, Napier also gained fame in 1904 by being the first car to cross the Canadian Rockies: Mr and Mrs Charles Glidden, sponsors of the Glidden Tours, covered from Boston to Vancouver.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877‚Äì1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p. 30.  Racing  Recognizing the value of publicity gained from racing, which no other British marque did,Wise (1974) p. 589. in spring, Edge entered an 8 hp (6 kW) Napier in the Thousand Miles (1,600 km) Trial of the Automobile Club on behalf of Mary Eliza Kennard; driven by Edge, with Kennard along, on a circuit from Newbury to Edinburgh and back, it won its class, being one of only thirty-five finishers (of sixty-four startersWise (1974) ) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12 mph (19 km/h) in England and 10 mph (16 km/h) in Scotland.Wise (1974) p. 1486. By June 1900, eight \\"16 hp\\"s had been ordered, and Edge entered one in the 837 mi (1,350 km) Paris-Toulouse-Paris race, with Charles S. Rolls (co-founder of Rolls-Royce) as riding mechanic. The 301.6 cu in (4.94 L) (101.6√ó152.4 mm, 4x6 in) sidevalve suffered problems with its ignition coils and cooling system, and failed to finish.Wise (1974) For 1901, Montague designed a car sure not to lack speed, having a 16.3-litre (995.5 cu in) (165.1√ó190.5 mm, 6.5√ó7.5 in) sidevalve four capable of at 800 rpm, on a wheelbase of 115 inches (2.921 m)Wise (1974) with four-speed gearbox and chain drive. Called the \\"50 hp\\", only two or three were completed, including one for Rolls. Edge entered one in the 1901 Gordon Bennett Cup, only able to test it en route (it was completed 25 May, only four days before the event), Montague serving as his riding mechanic; it overpowered its Dunlops, and fitting new (French) tires led to disqualification, since they were not of the same nation of origin.Wise (1974) pp. 1486‚Äì7. In the concurrent Paris-Bordeaux rally, it retired with clutch trouble.Hull (1974), p. 1487. For the 1902 Gordon Bennett, three entrants (the Charron-Girardot-Voigt, a Mors and a Panhard) contested for France, with Edge in a Napier and two Wolseleys. The Napier was a three- speed, shaft-drive 6.44-litre (392.7 cu in) four (127√ó127 mm, 5x5 in) of 44.5 hp (33 kW) (though described as a 30 hp). Piloted by Edge and his cousin, Cecil, it wore what would become known as British racing green, and won at an average 31.8 mph (51.2 km/h); although by default, since all other entrants retired during the race. It was the first British victory in international motorsport, and would not be repeated until Henry Segrave took the French Grand Prix in 1923. Charles J. Glidden on his world tour of 1902 Napiers also inspired Charles J. Glidden to create the Glidden Tours in upstate New York, which in turn persuaded Napier to build a factory in Boston. It, along with the Genoa factory (managed by Arthur McDonald), which built Napiers under license as San Giorgios from 1906‚Äì9, was not a success.Wise (1974), p.1488. Annual production reached 250 cars in 1903, overwhelming the Lambeth factory, so a move was made to a new plant at Acton, in west London. On 16 October of that year, Napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six, a \\"remarkably smooth and flexible\\" vehicle 18 hp 301 cu in (4.9-litre) (101.6√ó101.6 mm, 4√ó4 in) with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive. Within five years, there were 62 makers of six-cylinder cars in Britain alone, including the Ford Motor Company's 1906 Model K.G. N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886‚Äì1930. (London: Grange- Universal, 1985) 1904 Napier 6-cylinder race car Napier's 1902 win brought the Gordon Bennett hosting duties to the United Kingdom, and the 1903 event was held south of Dublin, with three shaft-driven Napiers defending the British and Irish honor, all in the (later famous) racing green: two 470 cubic inch (7708 cc) 45 horsepower (33.5 kW) fours for Charles Jarrott and J. W. Stocks, with McDonald, the Genoa plant manager, his riding mechanic, and an 80-horsepower (838 cubic inch, 13,726 cc), the Type K5, for Edge. Jarrott and Stocks crashed, and Edge was disqualified.Hull (1974) It was a bad year for Napier's racing program; a 35 hp in the hands of Colonel Mark Mayhew in the Paris-Madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree. Edge, again with McDonald, fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany, but a new 920 cubic inch (15-litre; 158.7√ó127 mm, 6.25√ó5-inch) six, the L48, with an external radiator reminiscent of the Cord 810, set the fastest time at the Velvet Strand speed trials at Portmarnock, Ireland, in September, piloted by McDonald.Wise (1974) p. 1,489 In January 1905, the L48, again with McDonald in the seat, took the mile (1.6 km) record at Ormonde Beach at 104.65 mph (168.41 km/h); although this was shortly broken by Bowden's Mercedes, the run was disallowed. The versatile McDonald ran the L48 in the 1905 Gordon Bennett qualifying event at the Isle of Man, taken over for the race by works driver Clifford Earp, who placed ninth. Edge's secretary, Dorothy Levitt, drove a 100 hp (74.6 kW) development of the K5 at the Blackpool and Brighton Speed Trials in 1905, and the next year ran the L48 at the Blackpool Speed Trials, showing talent by equalling Edge's speed and setting a women's record in the flying kilometre of 90.88 mph (146.25 km/h). By 1907, 1200 people were employed by Napier and were making about a hundred cars a year, aided by continuing racing success. Brooklands opened that year, where Napier engineer H. C. Tryon won the first ever event in a , and Edge made a famous 24-hour run in June, covering 1,581 miles (2,544 km) at an average 65.905 mph (106.06 km/h) in a 60-horsepower 589 cubic inch (9,652 cc) (127√ó127 mm, 5√ó5-inch) six, a record which stood for 18 years.Hull (1974), p. 1,489. The L48, nicknamed Samson, became famous there in the venue's first two years; in 1908, Napier's Frank Newton covered half a mile (800 m) at 119.34 mph (190.05 km/h) in a stroked (178 mm, 7-inch) L48. The company's last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 Tourist Trophy, using an alias, Hutton, to preserve the reputation of the sixes, in the hands of Willy Watson.Hull (1974), p. 1490. At the French Grand Prix, officials showed the perverse reasoning for which they later became notorious by claiming that removable wire wheels were an unfair advantage. When Napier was no longer in racing, its Lion aero engine was used by several land speed record contestants: Malcolm Campbell's Napier-Campbell Blue Bird of 1927 and Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931, Segrave's Golden Arrow of 1929, and John Cobb's Napier-Railton and Railton Mobil Special, which held the record from 1939‚Äì64.

Edge's Napier launch won the inaugural British International Harmsworth Trophy for speedboats at Cork Harbour in Ireland, driven by Dorothy Levitt. She achieved in a steel-hulled, speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, \\"S. F. Edge\\" is engraved on the trophy as the winner. The third crew member, Campbell Muir, may also have taken the controls. On 8 August 1903 Levitt drove the Napier at Cowes and won the race. She was then commanded to the Royal yacht by King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill, and they discussed the performance of the boat and its potential for British government despatch work.\\"The Sensational Adventures of Miss Dorothy Levitt, ‚Äì Champion Lady Motorist of the World\\", The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times (London, England), Saturday, 17 November 1906; p. 309; Issue 2373.Autosport, The Nostalgia Forum, Historical Research, Dorothy Levitt ‚Äì early motoring Later in August Levitt won the Gaston Menier Cup at Trouville, France.

In October 1903 Levitt won the Championship of the Seas at Trouville, and the French government bought the boat for ¬£1,000. The 1905 boat Napier II set the world water speed record for a mile at almost 30 knots (56 km/h). = Public limited company and WWI = Napier Lion engine In 1912, following a dispute with Edge, the business was restructured. D. Napier & Son Limited went public and bought out Edge's distribution and sales company, S.F. Edge (1907) Limited. The latter soon went into voluntary liquidation and thus the manufacture and marketing of Napier cars were united under a single organization. Production rose to around 700 cars a year with many supplied to the London taxi trade. That year, only six models were produced. On the outbreak of war sales of private vehicles collapsed and Napier turned to military orders. Vehicle production continued for a time on this basis and 2,000 trucks and ambulances were supplied to the War Office. Montague Napier's health declined and in 1917 he moved to Cannes, France, but continued to take an active involvement in the company until his death in 1931. Early in the war, Napier was contracted to build engines from other companies' designs: initially the model RAF 3, a V-12 by Royal Aircraft Factory, and then the V-8 Sunbeam Arab. Both proved to be rather unreliable, and in 1916 Napier decided to design its own instead, an effort that led to the superb W-block 12-cylinder Lion.Gunston, W.; World Encyclopaedia of Aero Engines, 4th Edn., Patrick Stephens, 1998, p.121; \\"The result was the Lion, a masterpiece.\\" The Lion came into service shortly before the end of the war. During the First World War the company was also contracted to build 600 aircraft at the Acton factory (50 Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.7, 400 Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 and 150 Sopwith Snipes). Together with the engine work, this required enormous expansion of the company. = Interwar period = 1920 Type 75 TT By the end of the war, military production had tailed off and the Lion was still barely in use. In 1919 civilian car production was recommenced. The T75 motor car would be Napier's last. Designed by A. J. Rowledge (who left for Rolls-Royce in 1921), its engine was a 40‚Äì50 hp () alloy six with detachable cylinder head, single overhead camshaft, seven-bearing crankshaft, dual magneto and coil ignition, dual plugs, and Napier-SU Carburettor. Coachwork was by Cunard, by then a subsidiary. 187 were built in all by 1924, and Napier quit car production with a total of 4,258 built. The car was very expensive, costing about the same as a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and in the early 1920s sales were slow. The last car was sold in 1924. The Lion was by now becoming a best-seller for the company, which eventually dropped all the other aero-engines. The Lion went on to be adapted for land and water, to set the Land Speed Record in Malcolm Campbell's Napier-Campbell Blue Bird of 1927 and Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird 0f 1931 and Henry Segrave's Golden Arrow of 1931 and later in John Cobb's Napier-Railton and Railton Mobil Special, which held the record from 1939‚Äì64. In the 1930s the introduction of much larger and more powerful aero-engines from other companies ended sales of the Lion. Napier quickly started work on newer designs, building on experience gained on the X style 16-cylinder, 1,000 hp (746 kW) Cub, used in the Blackburn Cubaroo single-engined bomber of the 1920s, and the resulting later 16-cylinder Rapier and 24-cylinder Dagger were both air-cooled H-block designs. Neither the Rapier nor the Dagger proved very reliable, due to poor cooling of the rearmost cylinders, and even the Dagger's was less than its competitors' offerings when shipped. As Lion sales faded, an attempt was also made to buy the bankrupt Bentley company in 1931 but Napier was outbid at the last minute by Rolls-Royce. The last vehicle project was a three-wheeled tractor-trailer goods vehicle, but rather than produce this itself, the design was sold to Scammell, which made several thousand. = Second World War = Napier Sabre engine Starting from scratch, Napier decided to use the new sleeve valve design in a much larger H-block 24-cylinder engine, soon to be known as the Sabre. Designed under Frank Halford, the engine was very advanced and proved to be difficult to adapt to assembly line production. Therefore, although the engine was ready by 1940, it was not until 1944 that production versions were considered reliable. At that point efforts were made to improve it, leading eventually to the Sabre VII delivering 3,500 hp (2,600 kW), making it the most powerful engine in the world, from an engine much smaller than its competition. Napier also worked on diesel aircraft engines. In the 1930s it licensed the Junkers Jumo 204 for production in England, which it called the Culverin. It also planned to produce a smaller version of the same basic design as the Cutlass, but work on both was cancelled at the outbreak of War in 1939. Napier developed a marine engine from the Lion aero engine, the petrol-driven Sea Lion, which could deliver and was used in the \\"Whaleback\\" Air Sea Rescue Launches. Napier Deltic engine, cut away for display During the war (1944) Napier was asked by the Royal Navy to supply a diesel engine for use in its patrol boats, but the Culverin's 720 hp (537 kW) was not nearly enough for its needs. Napier then designed under the leadership of Ernest Edward Chatterton, Chief Engineer, the Deltic, essentially three Culverins arranged in a large triangle. Considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day, the Deltic was nevertheless very reliable, and was taken into service after the war as a locomotive powerplant (in British Rail's Class 55) in addition to the torpedo boats, minesweepers and other small naval vessels for which it was designed. Also during the Second World War a six- cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government, but this design was sold to Leyland Motors by 1945. = Post-war =  English Electric  Napier had been taken over by English Electric on 23 November 1942.Sharp, Dan: British Secret Projects 5: Britain's Space Shuttle, Cr√©cy, 2016, p.11. Last of the great Napier internal combustion engines was the Nomad, a complicated \\"turbo-compound\\" design that combined a diesel engine with a turbine to recover energy otherwise lost in the exhaust. The advantage of this complex design was fuel economy: it had the best specific fuel consumption of any aircraft engine, even to this day. However, even better fuel economy could be had by flying a normal jet engine at much higher altitudes, while existing designs filled the \\"low end\\" of the market fairly well. First run in 1949, the Nomad I underwent radical redesign for the Nomad II but was largely ignored by the market and was cancelled in 1955. Along with every major aero engine company in the post-war era, Napier turned to the jet turbine. Seeing a niche not yet adopted up by the larger vendors, Napier developed a number of turboshaft designs which saw some use, notably in helicopters. Its first design, the Naiad and Double Naiad was developed for various Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm projects, but did not enter production. The smaller models developed later, the 3,000-hp-class Eland and 1,500-hp-class Gazelle did somewhat better, notably the Gazelle which powered several models of the popular Westland Wessex helicopter. Production ceased when a deal was struck with Rolls-Royce in 1961. At the same time, the ramjet was showing promise for high-speed supersonic flight. From 1951 Napier developed a successful large-diameter experimental engine, the Napier Ram Jet (NRJ). Napier continued in ramjet development for several years, typically working alongside the English Electric aircraft design team.Sharp, Dan; British Secret Projects 5: Britain's Space Shuttle, Cr√©cy, 2016, pp. 18‚Äì19. = Napier Aero Engines Limited = In 1961 a new company Napier Aero Engines Limited was formed by D. Napier & Son and Rolls-Royce, to take over the Napier aero-engine business and the Acton engine factory. It was to continue to market the Gazelle, while the completion of existing Gazelle contracts and the Eland remained the financial responsibility of the old company. But it closed only two years later, in 1963. Following the move of the aero engine business, D. Napier & Son continued as a subsidiary of English Electric. With the ending of Deltic sales in the 1960s it had no new modern engine designs to offer. Today Napier is no longer in the engine business. = Napier Turbochargers = GEC bought English Electric in the late 1960s. The GEC operation, now part of Ruston Gas Turbines, later moved to GEC-Alsthom and then Alstom, before being sold to Siemens in March 2003. Napier Turbochargers was bought from Siemens in June 2008 in a management buyout. The buyout was funded by the private equity company Primary Capital for around ¬£100 million. Early in 2013 Napier Turbochargers became part of Wabtec. Napier Turbochargers currently produces turbochargers for the marine, power and rail industries, employing around 150 people.

Both durable and resilient, mohair is notable for its high luster and sheen, and is often used in fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair takes dye exceptionally well. It feels warm in winter as it has excellent insulating properties, while its moisture-wicking properties allow it to remain cool in summer. It is durable, naturally elastic, flame-resistant and crease-resistant. It is considered a luxury fiber, like cashmere, angora, and silk, and can be more expensive than most sheep's wool. Mohair is composed mostly of keratin, a protein found in the hair, wool, horns and skin of all mammals, but mohair's special properties are unique to the Angora goat. While it has scales like wool, the scales are not fully developed, merely indicated. Thus, mohair does not feel the same way common or standard wool does. Mohair fiber is approximately 25‚Äì45 microns in diameter. It increases in diameter with the age of the goat, growing along with the animal. Finer, softer hair from younger animals is used (for example) in scarves and shawls; the thicker, coarser hair from older animals is more often used for carpets and in heavy fabrics intended for outerwear. The term mohair is sometimes used to describe a type of material used for the folding roof on convertible cars. In this instance, mohair refers to a form of denim- like canvas. Production Mohair is vital to the economy of the Texas Hill Country, including the Real County community of Camp Wood. Shearing is done twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. One goat will produce of mohair a year. Shearing is done on a cleanly-swept floor and extra care is taken to keep the hair clean and free of debris. The hair is then processed to remove natural grease, dirt and vegetable matter. Mohair grows in uniform locks. The Angora goat is a single-coat breed, and unlike pygora or cashmere, there is no need to dehair a mohair fleece to separate the coarse hair from the down hair. South Africa is the world's largest mohair producer as of 2013, supplying around 50% of the total world production. Due to animal cruelty in the South African farms, Zara, H&M;, Gap, Topshop, Lacoste, and many more will no longer sell mohair clothing. History Lynval Golding of The Specials wearing a two-tone suit, so called because the mohair fabric changes color from grey to purple Mohair is one of the oldest textile fibers in use. The Angora goat is thought to originate from the mountains of Tibet, reaching Turkey in the 16th century. However, fabric made of mohair was known in England as early as the 8th century. The word \\"mohair\\" was adopted into English sometime before 1570 from the Arabic: mukhayyar,\\"Mohaire\\". The Oxford English Dictionary. a type of haircloth, literally \\"choice\\", from khayyara, \\"he chose\\".\\"Mohair\\". The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 11th ed. 1911. In about 1820, raw mohair was first exported from Turkey to England, which then became the leading manufacturer of mohair products. The Yorkshire mills spun yarn that was exported to Russia, Germany, Austria, etc., as well as woven directly in Yorkshire. Until 1849, the Turkish province of Ankara was the sole producer of Angora goats. Charles V is believed to be the first to bring Angora goats to Europe. Due to the great demand for mohair fiber, throughout the 1800s there was a great deal of crossbreeding between Angora goats and common goats. The growing demand for mohair further resulted in attempts on a commercial scale to introduce the goat into South Africa (where it was crossed with the native goat) in 1838, the United States in 1849, Australia from 1856 to 1875, and later still New Zealand. In 1849, Angora goats made their way to America as a gift from Turkey. During the 1960s, a blend of mohair and wool suiting fabric known as Tonik or Tonic was developed in England. This had a shiny, color changing appearance and was popular among rude boys and the mod subculture.Gentlemans Gazette Similar suits were worn by mod revivalists, skinheads, and fans of ska punk and two tone music during the early to mid-1980s.Chanting down BabylonAmerican counterculture Today, South Africa is the largest mohair producer in the world, with the majority of South African mohair being produced in the Eastern Cape. The United States is the second-largest producer, with the majority of American mohair being produced in Texas. Turkey also produces good-quality mohair. Because the goats are sheared once a year (different than South Africa), Turkey produces the longest mohair of the world. In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of mohair and other natural fibers. Uses A Merrythought teddy bear made using mohair Mohair lace scarf, knitted with crochet trim on the ends Mohair is used in scarves, winter hats, suits, sweaters, coats, socks and home furnishing. Mohair fiber is also found in carpets, wall fabrics, craft yarns, and many other fabrics, and may be used as a substitute for fur. Because its texture resembles fine human hair, mohair is often used in making high grade doll wigs or in rooting customized dolls. Mohair is a very soft yarn when compared with other natural and synthetic fibers. Due to mohair's lacking prominent, protruding scales along the hair's surface, it is often blended with wool or alpaca. Blending the heavily scaled wool helps the smooth mohair fibers hold their shape and stick together when spun into yarn. Mohair is also valued for certain other unique characteristics: it is warmer than other fibers, even when used to make a light-weight garment, and is often blended with wool for this reason; and mohair fibers have a distinctive luster created by the way they reflect light. Combined with mohair's ability to absorb dyes exceptionally well, pure mohair yarns are usually recognizable for their vivid saturated colours. Fibers from young goats are softest and are used to manufacture yarn for clothing. Fibers from mature goats are used to produce such things as rugs and carpets. Mohair is also used in 'climbing skins' for randonn√©e skiing and ski touring. The mohair is used in a carpet allowing the skier an appropriate ascension method without sliding downhill. Mohair industry worldwide As of 2009, world output of mohair was estimated at around 5,000 tonnes a year, down from a high of 25,000 tonnes in the 1990s. South Africa accounts for 60% of total production. South African mohair is generally exported raw or semi-processed to textile makers in Europe, the UK and the Far East. Prices for adult mohair declined in 2010 while prices for kid mohair remained the same. An emerging market for mohair producers has been China. US subsidies for mohair production During World War II, U.S. soldiers wore uniforms made of wool. Worried that domestic producers could not supply enough for future wars, Congress enacted loan and price support programs for wool and mohair in the National Wool Act of 1954 as part of the 1954 Farm Bill. Despite these subsidies, wool and mohair production declined. The strategic importance declined as well; the US military adopted uniforms made of synthetic fibers, such as dacron, and officially removed wool from the list of strategic materials in 1960. Nevertheless, the U.S. government continued to provide subsidies to mohair producers until 1995, when the subsidies were \\"eliminated effective with the marketing year ending December 31, 1995\\". In The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad Fareed Zakaria points out that the subsidies were reinstated a few years later, due in large part to the lobbying on behalf of the special interests of the subsidy recipients. By 2000, Congress had appropriated US$20 million for goat and sheep producers. As of 2002, mohair producers were still able to receive special assistance loans from the U.S. government, after an amendment to eliminate the subsidy was defeated. The U.S. currently subsidizes mohair production under the Marketing Assistance Loan Program of the 2014 Farm Act.

It was the first Western European combat aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in horizontal flight.\\"Mirage III.\\" Dassault Aviation, 18 December 2015. In 1952, the French government issued its specification, calling for a lightweight, all-weather interceptor. Amongst the respondents were Dassault with their design, initially known as the Mirage I. Following favourable flight testing held over the course of 1954, in which speeds of up to Mach 1.6 were attained, it was decided that a larger follow-on aircraft would be required to bear the necessary equipment and payloads. An enlarged Mirage II proposal was considered, as well as MD 610 Cavalier (3 versions), but was discarded in favour of a further-developed design, powered by the newly developed Snecma Atar afterburning turbojet engine, designated as the Mirage III. In October 1960, the first major production model, designated as the Mirage IIIC, performed its maiden flight. Initial operational deliveries of this model commenced in July 1961; a total of 95 Mirage IIICs were obtained by the French Air Force (Arm√©e de l'Air, AdA). The Mirage IIIC was rapidly followed by numerous other variants. The Mirage III was produced in large numbers for both the French Air Force and a wide number of export customers. Prominent overseas operators of the fighter included Argentina, Australia, South Africa, Pakistan and Israel, as well as a number of non-aligned nations. Often considered to be a second-generation fighter aircraft, the Mirage III experienced a lengthy service life with several of these operators; for some time, the type remained a fairly maneuverable aircraft and an effective opponent when engaged in close-range dogfighting.Duchateau, Philippe & Huertas, Salvador Mafe. Mirage! Dassault's Mach 2 Warriors. Osprey Publishing, 1990. . pp. 1‚Äì7. During its service with the French Air Force, the Mirage III was normally armed with assorted air-to-ground ordnance or R.550 Magic air-to- air missiles. Its design proved to be relatively versatile, allowing the fighter model to have been readily adapted to serve in a variety of roles, including trainer, reconnaissance and ground-attack versions, along with several more extensive derivatives of the aircraft, including the Dassault Mirage 5, Dassault Mirage IIIV and Atlas Cheetah.Wheeler 1992, p. 117. Some operators have undertaken extensive modification and upgrade programmes of their flights, such as Project ROSE of the Pakistan Air Force. The Mirage III has been used in active combat roles in multiple conflicts by a number of operators. The Israeli Air Force was perhaps the most prolific operator of the fighter outside of France itself; Israel deployed their Mirage IIIs in both the Six-Day War, where it was used as both an air superiority and strike aircraft, and the Yom Kippur War, during which it was used exclusively in air- to-air combat in conjunction with the IAI Nesher, an Israeli-built derivative of the Mirage 5. Ace of aces Giora Epstein achieved all of his kills flying either the Mirage III or the Nesher. During the South African Border War, the Mirage III formed the bulk of the South African Air Force's fleet, comprising a cluster of Mirage IIICZ interceptors, Mirage IIIEZ fighter-bombers and Mirage IIIRZ reconnaissance fighters; following the introduction of the newer Mirage F1, the type was dedicated to secondary roles in the conflict, such as daytime interception, base security, reconnaissance and training. The Argentine Air Force used the Mirage IIIEA during the Falklands War, but their lack of an aerial refueling capability limited the aircraft's usefulness in the conflict. Even using drop tanks, the Mirages only had an endurance of five minutes within the combat area around the British fleet. Development =Origins= The Mirage III family has its origins within a series of studies conducted by the French Defence Ministry which had commenced in 1952. At the time, several nations had taken an interest in the prospects of a light fighter, which had been motivated by combat experiences acquired during the Korean War, specifically the Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet- propelled fighter aircraft which had drawn considerable attention internationally. Western nations were keen to explore the performance of a relatively uncomplicated and heavily armed jet-powered swept wing fighter, inspired by the rapid advances in aircraft capabilities that had been made by the Soviet Union. France was one of the quickest governments of several nations, including the United Kingdom (resulting in the Folland Gnat), the United States (leading to the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk), and Italy (which became the Fiat G.91), to embark on encouraging the development of such an aircraft.Brindley 1971, p. 173. The tailless 1955 Mirage delta-wing prototype with the very large vertical stabilizer and no horizontal stabilizer and no flaps In 1952, the French government issued its specification, calling for a lightweight, all-weather interceptor, capable of climbing to in 6 minutes along with the ability to reach Mach 1.3 in level flight. Three separate French manufacturers decided to respond to the specification, these being Dassault Aviation, Sud-Est, and Sud-Ouest, offering the MD.550 Delta, SE.212 Durandal and SO.9000 Trident, respectively. Dassault's submission, which became known as the MD.550 Delta, was a diminutive and sleek-appearing aircraft that was principally powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley MD30R Viper afterburning turbojet engines (built under licence by Dassault); atypically, the design also featured provisions for the installation of a secondary propulsion system in the form of a SEPR-built 66 liquid-fuel rocket engine, capable of providing boost thrust of . The basic layout of the MD.550 Delta featured a tailless delta configuration, possessing a 5 per cent thickness (ratio of airfoil thickness to length) and 60¬∞ sweep, complete with a large vertical stabilizer and rudder.Gunston 1976, p. 80. However, the tailless delta configuration imposed a number of limitations, including the lack of a horizontal stabilizer, which meant that conventional flaps could not be used; this resulted in a relatively long takeoff run and a high landing speed.Design For Air Combat, Ray Whitford, Jane's Publishing Company Limited 1987, , p. 54. The delta wing itself limits maneuverability and suffers from buffeting at low altitude due to the large wing area and resulting low wing loading. However, the delta is a simple design, easy to construct and relatively robust while providing generous amounts of internal volume in the wing for fuel tankage and being capable of achieving high speeds when flown in a straight line. British aviation author Derek Wood observed that there was \\"a striking resemblance\\" between the MD.550 Delta and the British Fairey Delta 2, an experimental aircraft that first flew three months later, on 6 October 1954, and which set a new world speed record on 1 March 1956.Wood 1975, pp. 85‚Äì86. During the latter stages of testing of the Fairy Delta 2 in October and November 1956, the FD2 performed 47 low level supersonic test flights from Cazaux Air Base, Bordeaux, in France.Wood 1975, p. 85. Dassault engineers observed these trials and obtained additional data on the performance and flight characteristics of delta wing aircraft. The Delta 2 confirmed Dassault's theories, and provided additional supporting evidence for the viability of the Mirage III development.Wood 1975, p. 86. =Flight testing= On 25 June 1954, the first prototype of the MD.550 Delta, without afterburning engines or rocket motor and with an unusually large vertical stabilizer, conducted its maiden flight.Jackson World Air Power Journal Volume 14, p. 120. In this configuration, it was able to attain a maximum speed of Mach 1.15. Following initial flights, it received a redesign that involved the vertical stabilizer being reduced in size along with the installation of afterburners and a rocket motor; it was at this point that the aircraft was renamed as the Mirage I.Brindley 1971, pp. 173, 175. In late 1954, the prototype attained a recorded speed of Mach 1.3 in level flight without rocket assistance, as well as reaching Mach 1.6 when using the rocket motor. According to aviation author John F. Brindley, testing of the Mirage I and prototypes of the rival Trident and Durandal designs had demonstrated the limitations of the light fighter concept, namely limitations on both endurance and equipment/payload capacity.Brindley 1971, p. 175. The small size of the Mirage I restricted its armament to a single air-to-air missile, and it was decided during flight trials that the aircraft was too small for the carriage of a useful armament. Following the completion of flying trials, the Mirage I prototype was eventually scrapped. Dassault was keen to produce a successor to the Mirage I prototype; at one point, the firm was considering the production of an enlarged version, known as the Mirage II, which would have been furnished with a pair of Turbomeca Gabizo turbojet engines. However, the Mirage II ultimately remained unbuilt as it was bypassed for an even more ambitious design, being 30 per cent heavier than the original Mirage I, powered by the newly developed Snecma Atar afterburning turbojet engine, capable of generating up to of thrust. The Atar was an axial-flow turbojet design, having been derived from the German Second World War-era BMW 003 engine.Smith 1955, p. 266. The new Atar-equipped fighter design received the name Mirage III. There was also an even larger heavy fighter design drafted, referred to as the Mirage IV. A decisive factor had been interest from the French military, who had made its favour for the Mirage III proposal known to the company. The Mirage III incorporated various new design principles, such as the transonic area rule concept, where changes to an aircraft's cross-section were made as gradual as possible, resulting in the famous \\"wasp waist\\" configuration of many supersonic fighters. Similar to its Mirage I predecessor, the Mirage III had provision for a booster rocket engine. On 17 November 1956, the prototype Mirage III perform its first flight. During its 10th flight, it was recorded as having attained a speed of Mach 1.52 at one point.Jackson 1985, p. 12. During the course of the flight test programme, the prototype was fitted with a pair of manually-operated intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as souris (\\"mice\\"), which could be repositioning more forwards as the airspeed was increased to achieve a reduction in inlet pressure losses. Reportedly, their addition enabled an increased speed of Mach 1.65 to be reached, while use of the supplemental SEPR 66 rocket (as fitted to the Mirage I) had allowed for a speed of Mach 1.8 to be reached in September 1957. The success of the Mirage III prototype resulted in an order for 10 pre-production Mirage IIIA fighters. Although the type had initially conceived of as an interceptor, the batch had been ordered with the intention of using them to develop the type for additional roles as well. The Mirage IIIA were almost 2 meters longer than the Mirage III prototype, had an enlarged wing of 17.3 per cent greater area, a chord reduced to 4.5 per cent, and an Atar 09B turbojet capable of generating afterburning thrust of up to . The SEPR 841 rocket engine was also retained. The Mirage IIIA was also fitted with a Thomson-CSF-built Cyrano Ibis air intercept radar, operational-standard avionics, and a drag chute to shorten its landing roll. In May 1958, the first Mirage IIIA conducted its first flight. In October of that year, this aircraft achieved a top speed of Mach 2.2 during one of its test flights, thus becoming the first European aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in level flight. In December 1959, the tenth and final Mirage IIIA was rolled out; the last six pre-production aircraft were largely representative of the subsequent initial production standard. The test regime involved a wide variety of tasks, including the evaluation of the newer SEPR 841 rocket motor, various underwing drop tanks, and other major systems.Brindley 1971, pp. 175‚Äì176. One Mirage IIIA was powered by a Rolls- Royce Avon 67 engine capable of generating of thrust, to serve as a test model for Australian evaluation, which was given the Mirage IIIO designation. This variant flew in February 1961, but the Avon powerplant was ultimately not adopted upon production aircraft.Gunston 1976, p. 86.Brindley 1971, pp. 176, 182. =Mirage IIIC and Mirage IIIB= The first major production model, the Mirage IIIC, first flew in October 1960.Brindley 1971, p. 176. The IIIC was largely similar to the earlier IIIA, being less than a half meter longer and featuring a full operational fit. The Mirage IIIC was a single-seat interceptor, with an Atar 09B turbojet engine, featuring an eyelid type variable exhaust. The Mirage IIIC was armed with twin 30 mm DEFA cannon fitted in the belly with the gun ports under the air intakes. Early Mirage IIIC production had three stores pylons, one under the fuselage and one under each wing; another outboard pylon was soon added to each wing, for a total of five, excluding a sleek supersonic tank which also had bomb-carrying capacity. The outboard pylon was intended to carry an AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missile, later replaced by the Matra R550 Magic and also was armed with the radar guided Matra R530 Missile on the center line pylon. South African Air Force Mirage IIIBZ A total of 95 Mirage IIICs were obtained by the French Air Force (Arm√©e de l'Air, AdA), with initial operational deliveries in July 1961. The Mirage IIIC remained in service with the AdA until 1988. The Arm√©e de l'Air also placed an order for a two-seat Mirage IIIB operational trainer. Performing its first flight on 21 October 1959, it was developed in parallel with the Mirage IIIC. The fuselage was stretched about a meter (3 ft 3.5 in), while both cannon were removed to accommodate the second seat. The IIIB lacked radar and provision for the SEPR rocket was also deleted, although it could carry external stores if desired. The AdA ordered 63 Mirage IIIBs (including the prototype), including five Mirage IIIB-1 trials aircraft, ten Mirage IIIB-2(RV) inflight refueling trainers with dummy nose probes, used for training Mirage IVA bomber pilots, and 20 Mirage IIIBEs, with the engine and some other features of the multi-role Mirage IIIE.Brindley 1971, pp. 176‚Äì177. One Mirage IIIB was fitted with a fly-by-wire flight control system in the mid-1970s and redesignated Mirage IIIB-SV (Stabilit√© Variable), it was used as a testbed for the system in the later Mirage 2000. =Mirage IIIE= While the initial Mirage IIIC model was heading towards quantity production, Dassault turned its attention towards the development of a multirole/strike variant of the aircraft. Efforts in this direction would eventually materialized in the form of the single-seat Mirage IIIE; a two-seat trainer variant of the aircraft was also developed, designated as the Mirage IIID. On 5 April 1961, the first of a batch of three prototypes performed its first flight. Cutaway view of the Cyrano radar system The Mirage IIIE considerably differed from the earlier Mirage IIIC interceptor. In terms of its airframe, the aircraft possessed a forward fuselage extension, which had been made to increase the size of the avionics bay, located directly behind the cockpit. The stretch had also enabled its fuel capacity to be expanded, which had been deemed necessary after several pilots had criticized the Mirage IIIC for having been quite limited in terms of its range. Many Mirage IIIEs were fitted with a British- built Marconi continuous-wave Doppler navigation radar radome on the bottom of the fuselage, underneath the cockpit; in contrast, none of the Mirage IIICs were provided with this apparatus. A similar inconsistent variation was the presence or absence of a high frequency (HF) antenna fitted as a forward extension to the vertical tailplane; on some Mirages, the leading edge of the tailplane was a straight line, while on those with the HF antenna the leading edge had a sloping extension forward. The extension appears to have been generally standard on production Mirage IIIAs and Mirage IIICs, but only appeared in some of the Mirage IIIE's export versions. The Mirage IIIE featured Thomson-CSF Cyrano II dual mode air / ground radar; a radar warning receiver (RWR) system with the antennas mounted in the vertical tailplane; and an Atar 09C engine, the latter being equipped with a petal-style variable exhaust. On 14 January 1964, the first production Mirage IIIE was delivered to the AdA, over time, 192 aircraft were eventually delivered to that service. By 1971, this variant had become the most widely exported version of the aircraft. =Mirage IIIR= Nose of a Mirage IIIRS: thinner than the fighter version, this nose has several glass apertures for medium-format cameras. A number of dedicated reconnaissance variants of the Mirage III were developed and produced, grouped under the general designation of Mirage IIIR.Brindley 1971, p. 177. These aircraft possessed a Mirage IIIE airframe but were furnished with avionics from the Mirage IIIC variant, along with a purpose- developed camera nose, which internally accommodated up to five OMERA cameras. On this variant, the radar system was excluded due to a lack of available space in the nose, however, the aircraft retained the twin DEFA cannon and all compatibility with its external stores. An improved variant, designated as the Mirage IIIRD, was also developed later on; it was essentially a Mirage IIIR outfitted with an extra panoramic camera at the most forward nose position, along with the adoption of the Doppler radar and other avionics from the Mirage IIIE, and provision for carrying an infra-red linescan or a Side looking airborne radar in an under-fuselage pod.Jackson World Air Power Journal Volume 14, p. 133. In response to interest expressed by the AdA in a reconnaissance model of the Mirage design, Dassault proceeded with the development of a pair of prototypes. On 31 October 1961, the first of these prototypes conducted its maiden flight; on 1 February 1963, it was followed by the first production-standard aircraft of the model. The AdA opted to obtain a total of 50 production Mirage IIIRs; the service later ordered a further 20 Mirage IIIRDs as well. Several export customers, most notably Switzerland, also chose to procure reconnaissance Mirages. The Mirage IIIR preceded the Mirage IIIE in operational introduction. =Exports and license production= Exports The largest export customers for Mirage IIICs built in France were Israel, their principal variant being the Mirage IIICJ, and South Africa, the bulk of their fleet being the Mirage IIICZ. Some export customers obtained the Mirage IIIB, with designations only changed to provide a country code, such as: Mirage IIIDA for Argentina, Mirage IIIDBR and Mirage IIIDBR-2 for Brazil, Mirage IIIBJ for Israel, Mirage IIIDL for Lebanon, Mirage IIIDP for Pakistan, Mirage IIIBZ and Mirage IIIDZ and Mirage IIID2Z for South Africa, Mirage IIIDE for Spain and Mirage IIIDV for Venezuela.Brindley 1971, pp. 179-190. After the outstanding Israeli success with the Mirage IIIC, scoring kills against Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s and MiG-21 aircraft and then achieving a formidable victory against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in the Six-Day War of June 1967, the Mirage III's reputation was greatly enhanced. The \\"combat-proven\\" image and low cost made it a popular export success. According to Brindley, a key element of the Mirage III's export success was the extensive support given to Dassault by the French government; he has claimed that the state would often commence negotiations without involving or informing Dassault at all until a later stage.Brindley 1971, pp. 179-180. A good number of Mirage IIIEs were built for export as well, being purchased in small numbers by Argentina as the Mirage IIIEA, Brazil as the Mirage IIIEBR and Mirage IIIEBR-2, Lebanon as the Mirage IIIEL, Pakistan as the Mirage IIIEP, South Africa as the Mirage IIIEZ, Spain as the Mirage IIIEE, and Venezuela as the Mirage IIIEV, with a list of subvariant designations, with minor variations in equipment fit. Dassault believed the customer was always right, and was happy to accommodate changes in equipment fit as customer needs and budget required. Pakistani Mirage 5PA3, for example, were fitted with Thomson-CSF Agave radar with capability of guiding the Exocet anti-ship missile. Some customers obtained the two-seat Mirage IIIBE under the general designation Mirage IIID, though the trainers were generally similar to the Mirage IIIBE except for minor changes in equipment fit. In some cases they were identical, since two surplus AdA Mirage IIIBEs were sold to Brazil under the designation Mirage IIIBBR, and three were similarly sold to Egypt under the designation Mirage 5SDD. New-build exports of this type included aircraft sold to Abu Dhabi, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Gabon, Libya, Pakistan, Peru, Spain, Venezuela, and Zaire. During the 1960s, the Soviet Union was alleged to have been engaged in attempts at conducting industrial espionage that targeted Dassault and specifically the Mirage III. In one widely reported incident, a pilot of the Lebanese Air Force was approached by Soviet agents, who offered him a bribe to fly one of the nation's 14 Mirage IIIs directly to Soviet territory; Lebanese counter-intelligence was notified of the attempt by the pilot.Brindley 1971, pp. 186-187. Diplomatically, France was protective of the fighter, often forbidding nations from re-exporting their Mirage IIIs to third parties without their consent under the threat of a prospective embargo.Brindley 1971, p. 187. Export versions of the Mirage IIIR were built for Pakistan as the Mirage IIIRP and South Africa as the Mirage IIIRZ, and Mirage IIIR2Z with an Atar 9K-50 jet engine.Brindley 1971, pp. 187, 189. Export versions of the IIIR recce aircraft were purchased by Abu Dhabi, Belgium, Colombia, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, and South Africa. Some export Mirage IIIRDs were fitted with British Vinten cameras, not OMERA cameras. Most of the Belgian aircraft were built locally. = Israel = Mirage IIICJ at the Israeli Air Force Museum (13 victory markings) The Israeli Air Force (IAF) purchased three variants of the Mirage III:Brindley 1971, p. 183. * 70 Mirage IIICJ single-seat fighters, received between April 1962 and July 1964. * Two Mirage IIIRJ single-seat photo-reconnaissance aircraft, received in March 1964. * Four Mirage IIIBJ two-seat combat trainers, three received in 1966 and one in 1968. Initial Israeli operations were conducted in a close cooperative relationship with both Dassault and France itself, the former sharing large amounts of operational data and experience with the other parties. However, Israel was forced into updating its own Mirages when France imposed an arms embargo on the region after the 1967 Six-Day War. For many years, official relations did not exist between France and Israel, however, spare components remained available. The result of these troubles was the development of Israel Aircraft Industries' Nesher fighter, which was based on the Mirage 5. Nevertheless, Mirage IIIB upgrades up to and including a full Kfir-type conversion have also been made available to third parties by IAI.Brindley 1971, pp. 183, 186. =South Africa= South Africa was amongst the earliest export customers for the Mirage III, having initially ordered a batch of 15 Mirage IIIC for low-level ground attack operations, for which they were armed with the Nord Aviation AS-20, along with three Mirage IIIBZ two-seater trainers. Further aircraft were ordered, including a batch of 16 Mirage IIIEs, three Mirage IIID two-seaters and four Mirage IIIR photo-reconnaissance aircraft. During the early 1970s, South Africa reportedly held negotiations with Dassault with the aim of securing a licence to produce either the Mirage III, the Mirage 5 and the Mirage F-1.Brindley 1971, p. 189. However, much like Israel, South Africa was similarly isolated by a French arms embargo after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 in November 1977. The South African Air Force launched an ambitious rebuild programme for its Mirage III fleet, soliciting Israeli technical assistance to convert existing airframes into the Atlas Cheetah. Fixed foreplanes distinguish the Cheetah from its Mirage predecessor, and an extended nose, probably inspired by the IAI Kfir, houses a modified electronics suite, including radar. Built in single-seat, two-seat interceptor, and two-seat combat trainer versions, the Atlas Cheetah entered service in 1987 during the South African Border War. Armament consists of Denel Kukri or Darter heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, the targeting of which was aided by a pilot's helmet mounted sight. = Pakistan = In 1967, Pakistan opted to purchase an initial batch of 18 Mirage IIIEPs, 3 Mirage IIIDPs and 3 Mirage IIIRPs from France. Over the course of time, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) inducted large numbers of new and second hand Mirages IIIs and Mirage 5s spanning multiple variants. In 1977, an additional 10 new Mirage IIIRPs were delivered. The Mirage III remained a formidable weapon in the hands of the Pakistan Air Force. Perhaps the most notable PAF unit equipped with the type has been No. 5 Squadron, which was fully operational by the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. During the conflict, while flying out from bases in Sargodha and Mianwali, the Mirage III was extensively used to conduct ground attacks against Indian military units and targets of interest. While PAF denied that no mirage was lost it was confirmed by France that 4 fighter jet were missing from total of 28. This shows that PAF had clearly lost 4 fighter jets to Indian airforce fighters in 1971 war. In 1991, because French production of the Mirage III and most spare parts had ceased, Pakistan acquired 50 Australian-built Mirages, which had been retired by the Royal Australian Air Force in 1988: 42 examples of the Mirage IIIO and eight twin-seat IIID. A further five incomplete aircraft were also obtained from the RAAF for cannibalized spare parts. Eight of the ex-RAAF Mirages entered service with the PAF immediately, while another 33 were upgraded under a PAF project known as ROSE I (\\"Retrofit of Strike Element\\"), with new equipment including: head-up display (HUD), HOTAS controls, multi-function display (MFD), radar altimeter, nav/attack system (manufactured by SAGEM), inertial navigation and GPS systems, radar warning receiver (RWR), an electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, decoy flares and chaff dispenser. In 1999, multi-mode FIAR Grifo M3 radar was installed in the PAF Mirages.Paul Lewis, \\"Building a base: Pakistan builds on the capabilities of local support for combat aircraft\\", Flight International, published: 24 February 1999, URL: http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1999/02/24/48539/building-a-base.html Retrieved: 25 September 2009 Ten Lebanese Air Force aircraft were purchased in 2000 and in 2003 13 Mirage IIIEEs were obtained from the Spanish Air Force in the form of 13 Mirage IIIEEs for cannibalized spare parts. From 2011, the PAF Mirage fleet was modified to carry Hatf-VIII (Ra'ad) cruise missiles and to accommodate aerial refueling probes of South African origin (presumably similar to those that built into the Atlas Cheetah). Subsequently, these aircraft have been modified to accept additional equipment and munitions, such as Chinese PL-12 air-to-air missiles. In 2019, PAF was reported to be in negotiation with Egypt for purchase of 30 Mirages.https://www.defenseworld.net/news/24626/Pakistan_To_Get_Egyptian_Mirage_5_JetsReport License production Variants of the Mirage IIIE were built under license in both Australia (as the IIIO) by GAF, and Switzerland (as the IIIS) by F+W Emmen. =Australia= Australian Mirage IIIO (top) and Mirage IIID (bottom) in 1980. These aircraft are now operated by the Pakistan Air Force An Australian Mirage IIID in 1988 Australia first showed an official interest in replacing its CAC Sabre with the Mirage III in 1960, and initially considered a variant powered by a licence-built variant of the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet (used by the CAC Sabre). While an experimental Avon-powered Mirage III was built as a prototype and flown in trials, it did not result in use of the Avon by a production variant. The Australian government decided that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) would receive a variant based on the Mirage IIIE and powered by the SNECMA Atar engine, built under license by Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne. Known as the Mirage IIIO or GAF Mirage, the Australian variant differed from the Mirage IIIE mainly in its avionics. The other major Australian aircraft manufacturer at the time, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC), also based in Melbourne, was also involved in the project, producing the Atar engine under licence.Brindley 1971, p. 180. Initially, Dassault provided a pair of pattern aircraft, the first of these flying in March 1963, which were transported to Australia and used to aid technicians at GAF in establishing their own assembly line for the type. GAF produced three variants: the Mirage IIIO(F), which was an interceptor, the Mirage IIIO(A), a surface attack aircraft and the twin seat Mirage IIIO(D), a fighter lead-in trainer. GAF completed 48 Mirage IIIO(F), 50 Mirage IIIO(A) and 16 Mirage IIIO(D) aircraft. Between 1967 and 1979, all the surviving Mirage IIIO(F) aircraft were converted to the Mirage IIIO(A) standard, which reconfigured them from the interceptor role to perform ground attack and aerial reconnaissance missions instead. In 1988, the Mirage III was finally withdrawn from RAAF service; 50 of the surviving fighters were exported to Pakistan in 1990. Several examples are preserved in museums around Australia; at least one of these is reportedly under restoration to a taxiable condition. =Switzerland= Swiss Dassault Mirage IIIRS recon on display Swiss Air Force Mirage IIIS JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) In 1961, Switzerland purchased a single Mirage IIIC from France for use as a development aircraft to support the nation's intentions to domestically produce 100 Mirage III fighters for the Swiss Air Force. Accordingly, Mirages were manufactured in Switzerland by F+W Emmen (today RUAG, the federal government aircraft factory in Emmen) under the Mirage IIIS designation. The Mirage IIIS was intended to perform the attack, interception, and reconnaissance missions in a single model. However, the venture suffered considerable cost overruns, mainly due to Swiss-mandated customisations and features, this was compounded by a lack of financial oversight, controversy over the manufacturing cost ultimately cumulated in the so-called \\"Mirage affair\\" and the resignation of several officials.Fran√ßois Modoux, ¬´ Du Mirage au Gripen : l'√©preuve du carcan financier ¬ª, Le Temps, Thursday 15 May 2014, p. 9. It became clear that a single model was not capable of the performance desires; thus only 36 Mirage IIIS interceptors and 18 Mirage IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft were eventually produced by F+W Emmen.Brindley 1971, pp. 189-190. The Mirage IIIS was with considerably strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage as the Swiss Air Force had required robustness comparable to that of carrier-based planes. The reinforced airframes enabled aircraft to be moved by lifting them with a crane (hence the airframes also being fitted with four lifting points, retractable nosecones and lengthened nosewheel legs), as the aircraft caverns in the mountains that Swiss Air Force uses as bunkers offer very little space to maneuver parked aircraft. Another benefit of the strengthened frames was the enabling of JATO-assisted takeoffs, giving the type a short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability. Other major differences were present on the Swiss-built interceptors. It was furnished with new American-sourced avionics along with a different cockpit design, including a Hughes Aircraft Company-built TARAN-18 radar system and could armed with the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile (Swiss designation of the SAAB Licence built Robot 27 (Rb27), which is similar to the Hughes AIM-26 \\"Falcon\\"). Radar warning receivers (RWR) were installed upon on both wingtips and on the back of the rudder. In addition, the Mirage IIIS had the wiring to carry a Swiss-built or French-built nuclear bomb. In the event, the programme to produce a Swiss nuclear bomb was stopped in the pre-production stage and Switzerland chose not to purchase such weapons from France either. The Mirage IIIRS could also carry a centerline pod for conducting photo reconnaissance missions, as well as an integral fuel tank underneath the aft belly; this tank could carry a smaller fuel load, but also allowed for a rear-facing film camera to also be added. When fitted with the reconnaissance pod, supersonic performance was severely diminished. The Mirage IIIS could be optionally fitted with a SEPR (Soci√©t√© d'Etudes pour la Propulsion par R√©action) 841 rocket engine with its nitric acid oxidiser tank. It was installed under the rear of the fuselage on a removable adaptor; it could be removed and a similar-shaped fuel tank installed instead. The SEPR rocket enabled the Mirage IIIS to reach an altitude of 24,000 m with its additional thrust of 1500 kp; the rocket motor could be switched off and restarted a maximum of three times during a flight, and had a maximum running time of 80 seconds. In an emergency, the rocket engine could be jettisoned at low flight speeds. The rocket fuel (TG-02) was very hazardous and highly toxic, requiring special buildings for maintenance to be built in Buochs and Payerne and personnel involved in its handling to wear special protective suits; accordingly, the rocket motor was not used often. SEPR at the Flieger-Flab-Museum In 1967, the Mirage IIIS entered operational service with the Swiss Air Force; the Mirage IIIRS followed two years later.Brindley 1971, p. 190. After an upgrade programme started in 1988, canards designed and produced by RUAG Aerospace were fitted to the type, along with a Martin-Baker-built ejection-seat. Defensive measures included a TRACOR AN/ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser positioned at the back under the end of the engine, first fitted following upgrades in 1988. In 1999, Switzerland phased out the last of its Mirage IIIS fleet; the remaining Mirage IIIRS, BS and DS variants were taken out of service in 2003.\\"Historical aircraft.\\" Swiss Air Force. Retrieved 9 April 2010. Operational history Wreckage of downed Israeli Mirage in the Yom Kippur war =Israel= On 29 November 1966, an Israeli Air Force Dassault Mirage III shot down two Egyptian MiG-19s which were trying to intercept an Israeli reconnaissance Piper J-3 Cub in Israeli airspace. The first MiG was destroyed with a R.530 radar guided missile fired from less than a mile away, marking the first aerial kill for the French made missile. The second MiG-19 was dispatched with cannon fire. Six-Day War During the Six-Day War, fought between 5 and 10 June 1967, Israel chose to deploy its Mirage III fleet offensively over the demilitarized zone located on the Israeli side of the border with Syria. A small detachment of 12 Mirages (comprising 4 permanently in the air and 8 at a high state of readiness on the ground) were assigned to defend the skies of Israel against attacks by hostile bombers, virtually all other Mirages were equipped with bombs and deployed on bombing raids against Arab air bases. Reportedly, the Mirage's performance as a bomber was modest at best, perhaps due to its limited payload capacity. During the first day of combat, a total of 6 MiG fighters were claimed to have been shot down by Mirage pilots. During the following days, Israeli Mirages typically performed as fighters; out of a claimed total of 58 Arab aircraft shot down in air combat during the conflict, 48 were accounted for by Mirage pilots. Yom Kippur War During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Mirage fleet was solely engaged in air-to-air operations. ACIG.org claims that at least 26 Mirages and Neshers were lost in air-to-air combat during the war.\\"Egyptian Air-to-Air Victories since 1948.\\" ACIG. Retrieved: 25 August 2013.\\"Syrian Air-to-Air Victories since 1948.\\" ACIG. Retrieved: 25 August 2013.\\"Iraqi Air-to-Air Victories since 1967.\\" ACIG. Retrieved: 25 August 2013. Contrary to these claims, formal Israeli sources claim that only five Israeli Air Force aircraft were shot down in air-to-air dogfights. In comparison, 106 Syrian and Egyptian aircraft were claimed shot down by Israeli Mirage IIICJ planes, and another 140 aircraft were claimed by the Nesher derivative. Israeli Air Force pilot Giora Epstein, \\"ace of aces\\" of modern, supersonic fighter jets, achieved all of his victories flying either the Mirage IIICJ or the IAI Nesher (An Israeli derivative of the Mirage 5, which were in turn developed from the Mirage III). =South Africa= Border War During the South African Border War, the South African Air Force operated a force of 16 Mirage IIICZ interceptors, 17 Mirage IIIEZ multirole fighter-bombers, and 4 Mirage IIIRZ reconnaissance fighters, which were typically flown from bases in South-West Africa. Despite being recognised as an exceptional dogfighter, the Mirage III was often criticised for lacking the range to make it effective over long distances, such as during strike operations against People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) insurgents based in neighbouring Angola. South African pilots also found the high-nosed, delta-winged Mirage III relatively difficult to land on the rudimentary airstrips near the operational area. Over time, the Mirage IIIs were eventually assigned to 2 Squadron, SAAF, and restricted to the secondary roles of daytime interception, training exercises, and photographic reconnaissance missions following the adoption of the newer Mirage F1. The mediocre performance of the fighter's Cyrano II radar effectively precluded the type from conducting nighttime operations, as well as during challenging weather conditions. By the late 1980s, the Mirage IIICZ was considered so obsolete that it was utilised only for base security. Nevertheless, the Mirage IIIRZ continued to be deployed for photo reconnaissance missions over Angolan targets, as the SAAF had only one other aircraft equipped for this role, the even more antiquated English Electric Canberra. During reconnaissance missions, SAAF Mirage IIIRZs would often fly at extremely low altitudes, sometimes as low as fifty feet (15 metres); briefly prior to reaching their intended targets, the aircraft would enter a rapid climb from which photographs would be taken before turning away. During the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Mirage IIIRZ pilots carried out mock sorties over enemy positions in Xangongo and Humbe in an attempt to provoke a response from Cuban or Angolan MiG-21s and MiG-23s, which would then be engaged by accompanying SAAF Mirage F1AZs. =Pakistan= During the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the Mirages were used in pre-emptive strikes and also claimed the first aerial against Indian Air Force Canberra aircraft in Western Front. During the war, the Mirage Aircraft were frequently employed for Airfield Interdiction, strike, as well as CAP missions; whereas the tasks of Close Air Support and Battle Field Air Interdiction were taken up by F-86 Sabre and Shenyang J-6 aircraft. From 2004/5 on wards, PAF also utilized Mirages to provide air support to Pakistani Security Forces during war with Taliban along with F-16 Fighting Falcon jets. In February 2019, the Mirages (both V and IIIDA variants) also formed the part of ground strike package of Operation Swift Retort in which f-16s and mirage 5 were used,which later resulted in combat related loss of one Indian fighter jet https://nation.com.pk/26-May-2019/paf-ops-swift-retort-and-the- effectiveness-of-air-power.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/false-claim-india- rubbishes-pakistans-claim-of-shooting-down-sukhoi-30-2003211 =Argentina= Falklands War The Argentine Air Force deployed their Mirage IIIEA fleet during the 1982 Falklands War. Their ability to function as long-range strike aircraft was dramatically hindered by the type's lack of any aerial refueling capability; even when furnished with a pair of 2,000-litre (550-gallon) drop tanks to carry extra fuel, the Mirages (and Israeli-built Daggers) would be forced to fly up to the absolute limit of their range in order to even reach the British fleet from the mainland. Normally, the fighters would be sent to engage patrolling British Harrier jets and to provide air cover to a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk strike force; however, they would have no more than five minutes at most over the combat area before having to embark upon the return flight back to their airfields.Hezsely, Csaba B. \\"Argentine Airpower in the Falklands War.\\" United States Air Force, 12 January 1989. Usually, Argentine Mirages were flown with an armament consisting of one Matra R530 or a pair of Magic 1 AAMs. They only entered direct combat once, resulting in one of the Mirages being shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder fired by a Harrier, and another destroyed by friendly fire after attempting to land on the runway at Port Stanley when nearly out of fuel. The fighters were frequently deployed to conduct diversion flights, flying at a very high altitude to force a response from the patrolling British Harriers to improve the chances of survival and success of the attack force. Additionally, a number of Mirages were also kept on a high state of alert against possible Avro Vulcan raids upon targets within the Argentine mainland, as well as to serve as a deterrence against aggressive flights by neighbouring Chile conducted upon Argentina's western border.Carballo, Pablo.

Original designation of the Mirage 3NG. A total of 1,422 Mirage III/5/50 aircraft of all types were built by Dassault. There were a few unbuilt variants: * A Mirage IIIK that was powered by a Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan was offered to the British Royal Air Force. * The Mirage IIIM was a carrier-based variant, with catapult spool and arresting hook, for operation with the French A√©ronavale. * The Mirage IIIW was a lightweight fighter version, proposed for a US competition, with Dassault partnered with Boeing. The aircraft would have been produced by Boeing, but it lost to the Northrop F-5. =Derivatives= Mirage 5/Mirage 50 The next major variant, the Mirage 5, grew out of a request to Dassault from the Israeli Air Force. The first Mirage 5 flew on 19 May 1967. It looked much like the Mirage III, except it had a long slender nose that extended the aircraft's length by about half a meter. The Mirage 5 itself led directly to the Israeli Nesher, either through a Mossad (Israeli intelligence) intelligence operation or through covert cooperation with AdA, depending upon which story is accepted. (See details in the Nesher article). In either case, the design gave rise to the Kfir, which can be considered a direct descendant of the Mirage III. Milan In 1968, Dassault, in cooperation with the Swiss, began work on a Mirage update known as the Milan (\\"Kite\\"). The main feature of the Milan was a pair of pop out foreplanes in the nose, which were referred to as \\"moustaches\\". The moustaches were intended to provide better take-off performance and low-speed control for the attack role. The three initial prototypes were converted from existing Mirage fighters; one of these prototypes was nicknamed \\"Asterix\\", after the internationally popular French cartoon character, a tough little Gallic warrior with a huge moustache.Brindley 1971, p. 178. A fully equipped prototype rebuilt from a Mirage IIIR flew in May 1970, and was powered by the uprated afterburning thrust SNECMA Atar 09K-50 engine, following the evaluation of an earlier model of this new series on the one-off Mirage IIIC2. The Milan also had updated avionics, including a laser designator and rangefinder in the nose. A second fully equipped prototype was produced for Swiss evaluation as the Milan S. The canards did provide significant handling benefits, but they had drawbacks. They blocked the pilot's forward view to an extent, and set up turbulence in the engine intakes. The Milan concept was abandoned in 1972, while work continued on achieving the same goals with canards. Mirage 3NG Mirage IIING Following the development of the Mirage 50, Dassault had experimented with yet another derivative of the original Mirage series, named the Mirage 3NG (Nouvelle G√©n√©ration, new generation). Like the Milan and Mirage 50, the 3NG was powered by the Atar 9K-50 engine. The prototype, a conversion of a Mirage IIIR, flew in December 1982. The Mirage 3NG had a modified delta wing with leading-edge root extensions, plus a pair of fixed canards fitted above and behind the air intakes. The canards provided a degree of turbulent airflow over the wing to make the aircraft more unstable and so more maneuverable. The aircraft's avionics were completely modernized, making use of the parallel development effort underway for the next-generation Mirage 2000 fighter. Chiefly amongst these changes, the Mirage 3NG used a fly-by-wire system to allow control over the aircraft's instabilities, and featured an advanced nav/attack system; new multimode radar; and a laser rangefinder system. The uprated engine and aerodynamics gave the Mirage 3NG impressive performance. Ultimately, the type never went into production, but to an extent the Mirage 3NG was a demonstrator for various technologies that could be and were featured in upgrades to existing Mirage IIIs and Mirage Vs. After 1989, enhancements derived from the Mirage 3NG were incorporated into Brazilian Mirage IIIEs, as well as into four ex-Arm√©e de l'Air Mirage IIIEs that were transferred to Brazil in 1988. In 1989, Dassault offered a similar upgrade refit of ex-AdA Mirage IIIEs under the designation Mirage IIIEX, featuring canards, a fixed in-flight refueling probe, a longer nose, new avionics, and other refinements. Balzac / Mirage IIIV One of the offshoots of the Mirage III/5/50 fighter family tree was the Mirage IIIV vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter. (\\"IIIV\\" is read \\"three-vee,\\" not \\"three-five\\").Brindley 1971, pp. 179. This aircraft featured eight small vertical lift jets straddling the main engine. The Mirage IIIV was built in response to a mid-1960s NATO specification for a VTOL strike fighter. Mirage IIIV carries eight RB.162-31 lift engines(generating 5,400 lb thrust each), long-stroke landing gears, and additional covers to reduce impact of the lift engine exhausts. Main engine a SNECMA TF-104 turbojet. Mirage III ROSE Project ROSE (Retrofit Of Strike Element) was an upgrade programme launched by the Pakistan Air Force to upgrade old Dassault Mirage III and Mirage 5 aircraft with modern avionics. In the early 1990s, the PAF procured 50 ex-Australian Mirage III fighters, 33 of which were selected after an inspection to undergo upgrades. In the first phases of Project ROSE, the ex- Australian Mirage III fighters were fitted with new defensive systems and cockpits, which included new HUDs, MFDs, RWRs, HOTAS controls, radar altimeters and navigation/attack systems. They were also fitted with the FIAR Grifo M3 multi-mode radar and designated ROSE I. Around 34 Mirage 5 attack fighters also underwent upgrades designated ROSE II and ROSE III before Project ROSE was completed. The Mirage III/5 ROSE fighters are expected to remain in service with the PAF until replacement in the mid-2010s.

Biography Born 18 October 1868, in Stockholm, Didring aspired to a career in teaching, but was unable to complete his studies due to lack of money. Instead, by 1884 he was working as an office clerk in the head office of the Swedish railways, and in 1899 he married a Danish teacher, Jeanne Rye. He was very involved in the founding of \\"Statsbanens Pensonering\\" in 1910, and was a full-time writer from 1914. Between 1915 and 1920 he was the leader of the Swedish red cross for prisoners of the war. Also during that time, and then again in 1923 to 1929, he was the leader of Sweden's writers society. In the intervening years (1920‚Äì22) he traveled through Europe (France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany). In 1931 he was awarded the prestigious \\"Large Prize\\" by the literary institution Samfundet De Nio. He died, aged 62, in Stockholm. Works Ernst Didring at 1930 Ernst Didring was a proponent of naturalism. His main series and best known book is the novel trilogy Malm (iron ore) which was published 1914‚Äì25. It describes the life in the north of Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. # Pioneers: A nice and detailed description of the construction of the railway from Kiruna to Narvik. # The Mountain's Song: Here the work in the digging company is shown. # Speculators: The last part describes shareholders of the iron companies in Stockholm ‚Äì the ups and downs before World War I. Some of his other novels are also important in terms of the history of the Swedish literature: # Gr√•l√∂ga‚ÄîTrilogin ‚Äì The former life in the Stockholm archipelago (1925‚Äì27); # \\"V√§rldsspindeln\\" ‚Äì The Worlds Spider (ca. 1925); # \\"Det m√∂rkbl√• frim√§rket\\" ‚Äì The Darkblue Stamp (1932). They paint a comprehensive picture of the life in the Swedish society around 1900 which is relevant even today. Often there were only several months between the publication of the original book and the translation to other European languages. His work was especially well-recognized in Germany. Didring also wrote some theater plays which were well known in Stockholm in his time. Many of his books can still be bought in second hand bookshops or loaned from Swedish or German libraries. There are also some unabridged audiobooks available from the Swedish (Myndigheten f√∂r tillg√§ngliga medier) (or look for \\"Didring\\" in the Handikat catalogue).

The guitar was the first instrument to be popularly amplified and used by early pioneers T-Bone Walker in the late 1930s and John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters in the 1940s. Their styles developed into West Coast blues, Detroit blues, and post-World War II Chicago blues, which differed from earlier, predominantly acoustic-style blues. By the early 1950s, Little Walter was a featured soloist on blues harmonica using a small hand-held microphone fed into a guitar amplifier. Although it took a little longer, the electric bass guitar gradually replaced the stand-up bass by the early 1960s. Electric organs and especially keyboards later became widely used in electric blues. Early regional styles The blues, like jazz, probably began to be amplified in the late 1930s.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat books, 3rd ed., 2002), pp. 1351-2. The first star of the electric blues is generally recognized as being T-Bone Walker; born in Texas but moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1930s, he combined blues with elements of swing music and jazz in a long and prolific career. After World War II, amplified blues music became popular in American cities that had seen widespread African American migration, such as Chicago,E. M. Komara, Encyclopedia of the blues (Routledge, 2006), p. 118. Memphis,M. A. Humphry, \\"Holy Blues: The Gospel Tradition,\\" in L. Cohn, M. K. Aldin and B. Bastin, eds, Nothing But the Blues: The Music and the Musicians (Abbeville Press, 1993), p. 179. Detroit,G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 53. St. Louis, and the West Coast. The initial impulse was to be heard above the noise of lively rent parties.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to the blues: the definitive guide to the blues (Backbeat Books, 3rd ed., 2003), pp. 694-95. Playing in small venues, electric blues bands tended to remain modest in size compared with larger jazz bands. In its early stages electric blues typically used amplified electric guitars, double bass (which was progressively replaced by bass guitar), and harmonica played through a microphone and a power amp or a guitar amplifier. By the late 1940s several Chicago-based blues artists had begun to use amplification, including John Lee Williamson and Johnny Shines. Early recordings in the new style were made in 1947 and 1948 by musicians such as Johnny Young, Floyd Jones, and Snooky Pryor. The format was perfected by Muddy Waters, who utilized various small groups that provided a strong rhythm section and powerful harmonica. His \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" (1948) was followed by a series of ground-breaking recordings.M. A. Humphry, \\"Holy Blues: The Gospel Tradition,\\" in L. Cohn, M. K. Aldin and B. Bastin, eds, Nothing But the Blues: The Music and the Musicians (Abbeville Press, 1993), p. 180. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. In addition to electric guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums, some performers such as J. T. Brown who played in Elmore James's bands or J. B. Lenoir's also used saxophones, largely as a supporting instrument. Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller) and Big Walter Horton were among the best known harmonica (called \\"blues harp\\" by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene and the sound of electric instruments and harmonica is often seen as characteristic of electric Chicago blues.R. Unterberger, Music USA: a coast- to-coast tour of American music: the artists, the venues, the stories, and the essential recordings (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 250. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar.G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 95. Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were for their deep, \\"gravelly\\" voices.G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 185. Bassist and composer Willie Dixon played a major role on the Chicago blues scene. He composed and wrote many standard blues songs of the period, such as \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\" (both penned for Muddy Waters) and, \\"Wang Dang Doodle\\", \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Back Door Man\\" for Howlin' Wolf.G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 56. Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based Chess Records and Checker Records labels, there were also smaller blues labels in this era including Vee-Jay Records and J.O.B. Records.Victor Coelho, The Cambridge companion to the guitar (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 98. In the late 1950s, the West Side style blues emerged in Chicago with major figures including Magic Sam, Jimmy Dawkins, Magic Slim and Otis Rush.E. M. Komara, Encyclopedia of the blues (Routledge, 2006), p. 49. West side clubs were more accessible to white audiences, but performers were mainly black, or part of mixed combos.R. Unterberger, Music USA: a coast-to-coast tour of American music: the artists, the venues, the stories, and the essential recordings (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 256. West side blues incorporated elements of blues rock but with a greater emphasis on standards and traditional blues song forms.C. Rotella, Good with Their Hands: Boxers, Bluesmen, and Other Characters from the Rust Belt (Chicago: University of California Press, 2004), pp. 68-70. Albert King, Buddy Guy, and Luther Allison had a West Side style that was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. John Lee Hooker created his own blues style and renewed it several times during his long career. Memphis, with its flourishing acoustic blues scene based in Beale Street, also developed an electric blues sound during the early 1950s. Sam Phillips' Sun Records company recorded musicians such as Howlin' Wolf (before he moved to Chicago), Willie Nix, Ike Turner, and B.B.King.J. Broven, Record Makers and Breakers: Voices of the Independent Rock  πn π Roll Pioneers Music in American Life (University of Illinois Press, 2009), pp. 149-54. Other Memphis blues musicians involved with Sun Records included Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare who introduced electric guitar techniques such as distorted and power chords, anticipating elements of heavy metal music.Robert Palmer, \\"Church of the Sonic Guitar\\", pp. 13-38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, pp. 24-27. . These players had an influence on early rock & rollers and rockabillies, many of whom also recorded for Sun Records. After Phillips discovered Elvis Presley in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock 'n' roll.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to the blues: the definitive guide to the blues (Backbeat Books, 3rd ed., 2003), pp. 690-91. Booker T. & the M.G.'s carried the electric blues style into the 1960s. Detroit-based John Lee Hooker pursued a unique brand of electric blues based on his deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. Though not directly influenced by boogie woogie, his \\"groovy\\" style is sometimes called \\"guitar boogie\\". His first hit, \\"Boogie Chillen\\", reached #1 on the R&B; charts in 1949.L. Bjorn, Before Motown (University of Michigan Press, 2001), p. 175. He continued to play and record until his death in 2001.P. Buckley, The rough guide to rock (Rough Guides, 3rd ed., 2003), p. 505. The New Orleans blues musician Guitar Slim recorded \\"The Things That I Used to Do\\" (1953), which featured an electric guitar solo with distorted overtones and became a major R&B; hit in 1954. It is regarded as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and contributed to the development of soul music.R. Unterberger, \\"Louisiana blues\\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), , pp. 687-8. In the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music. While popular musicians like Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry,G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 11. both recording for Chess, were influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues and played a major role in the development of rock and roll.M. Campbell, ed., Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on (Cengage Learning, 3rd ed., 2008), p. 168. Chicago blues also influenced Louisiana's zydeco music,G. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 236. with Clifton ChenierG. Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues (University of Arkansas Press, 1997), p. 35. using blues accents. Zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and cajun arrangements of blues standards. British electric styles British blues emerged from the skiffle and folk club scene of the late 1950s, particularly in London, which included the playing of American acoustic blues. Critical was the visit of Muddy Waters in 1958, who initially shocked British audiences by playing amplified electric blues, but who was soon performing to ecstatic crowds and rave reviews.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 700-2. This inspired guitarist and blues harpist Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to plug in and they began to play a high-powered electric blues that became the model for the subgenre, forming the band Blues Incorporated. Blues Incorporated was something of a clearing house for British blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s, with many joining, or sitting in on sessions. These included future Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones; Cream founders Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker; and Graham Bond and Long John Baldry. Blues Incorporated were given a residency at the Marquee Club and it was from there that in 1962 they took the name of the first British Blues album, R&B; from the Marquee for Decca, but split before its release. The model of British rhythm and blues was emulated by a number of bands including the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Yardbirds. Clapton in 2008, one of the major figures of the British blues boom in the 1960s. The other key focus for British blues was around John Mayall who moved to London in the early 1960s, eventually forming the Bluesbreakers, whose members at various times included, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor. The Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano) album (1966) is considered one of the seminal British blues recordings.T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C. White, Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960-1969 (Omnibus Press, 2002), p. 130. It was notable for its driving rhythms and Clapton's rapid blues licks with a full distorted sound derived from a Gibson Les Paul and a Marshall amp, which became something of a classic combination for British blues (and later rock) guitarists.M. Roberty and C. Charlesworth, The Complete Guide to the Music of Eric Clapton (Omnibus Press, 1995), p. 11. It also made clear the primacy of the guitar, seen as a distinctive characteristic of the subgenre. Clapton left to form Cream with Baker and Bruce and his replacement was Peter Green, who in turn (with the then Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie) left in 1967 to form Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.R. Brunning, The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies (Omnibus Press, 2004), pp. 1-15. Incorporating elements of rock led these bands to a hybrid form known as blues rock. Blues rock Blues rock combines blues with rock. With some notable exceptions, blues rock has largely been played by white musicians, bringing a rock sensitivity to blues standards and forms and it played a major role in widening the appeal of the blues to white American audiences. In 1963, American guitarist Lonnie Mack had developed a blues rock guitar style, releasing several guitar instrumentals, the best-known of which are the hit singles \\"Memphis\\" (Billboard #5) and \\"Wham!\\" (Billboard #24).P. Prown, H. P. Newquist, J. F. Eiche, Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists (Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997), p. 25. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and \\"attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records\\". In the UK, blues rock was popularized by bands as Fleetwood Mac, Free, Savoy Brown and the groups formed around the three major guitarists that emerged from the Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. After leaving the Yardbirds and his work with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton formed supergroups Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos, followed by an solo career. In the late 1960s Jeff Beck added elements heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. Jimmy Page formed the New Yardbirds, which became Led Zeppelin. Many of the songs on their first two albums and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs. Johnny Winter in 2007. Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, and The J. Geils Band later popularized the style in the US. The revolutionary electric guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix with the Experience and Band of Gypsys, influenced blues rock guitarists. Blues rock bands like Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and eventually ZZ Top from the American South, incorporated country elements into their style to produce Southern rock.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat books, 3rd edn., 2002), p. 1333. By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues rock and hard rock \\"were barely visible\\", as bands began recording rock- style albums. The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood and Pat Travers. Except perhaps for groups such as Status Quo and Foghat in the UK, who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock, bands moved towards heavy metal and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.P. Prown, H. P. Newquist and Jon F. Eiche, Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists (Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997), p. 113. More recently, the White Stripes,V.

Electric Texas blues Stevie Ray Vaughan was the most prominent figure in Texas electric blues in the late 20th century Texas had had a long history of major acoustic blues performers like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lightnin' Hopkins, but by the 1940s many Texas blues artists had moved elsewhere to further their careers, including T-Bone Walker who relocated to Los Angeles to record his most influential records in the 1940s. His R&B; influenced backing and saxophone imitating lead guitar sound would become an influential part of the electric blues sound. Goree Carter's \\"Rock Awhile\\" (1949) featured an over-driven electric guitar style and has been cited as a strong contender for the \\"first rock and roll record\\" title.Robert Palmer, \\"Church of the Sonic Guitar\\", pp. 13-38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. . The state R&B; recording industry was based in Houston with labels like Duke/Peacock, which in the 1950s provided a base for artists who would later pursue the electric Texas blues sound, including Johnny Copeland and Albert Collins. Freddie King, a major influence on electric blues, was born in Texas, but moved to Chicago as a teenager. His instrumental number \\"Hide Away\\" (1961), was emulated by British blues artists including Eric Clapton.M. Roberty and C. Charlesworth, The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton (Omnibus Press, 1995), p. 11. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Texas electric blues scene began to flourish, influenced by country music and blues rock, particularly in the clubs of Austin. The diverse style often featured instruments like keyboards and horns, but placed particular emphasis on powerful lead guitar breaks. The most prominent artists to emerge in this era were the brothers Johnny and Edgar Winter, who combined traditional and southern styles. In the 1970s Jimmie formed the Fabulous Thunderbirds and in the 1980s his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan broke through to mainstream success with his virtuoso guitar playing, as did ZZ Top with their brand of Southern rock.E. M. Komara, Encyclopedia of the blues (Routledge, 2006), p. 50. Contemporary electric blues Since the end of the 1960s electric blues has declined in mainstream popularity, but retained a strong following in the US, Britain and elsewhere, with many musicians that began their careers as early as the 1950s continuing to record and perform, occasionally producing breakthrough stars. In the 1970s and 80s it absorbed a number of different influences, including particularly rock and soul music. Stevie Ray Vaughan was the biggest star influenced by blues rock and opened the way for guitarists like Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Jonny Lang.R. Weissman, Blues: the basics (Routledge, 2005), p. 140. Practitioners of soul-influenced electric blues in the 1970s and 80s included Joe Louis Walker and most successfully Robert Cray, whose Strong Persuader album (1986), with its fluid guitar sound and an intimate vocal style, produced a major crossover hit.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 703-4. Veteran Linsey Alexander is known for his original Chicago blues influenced by soul, R&B;, and funk. Since her breakthrough commercial success Nick of Time in 1989 Bonnie Raitt has been one of the leading artists in acoustic and electric blues, doing much to promote the profile of older blues artists.R. Weissman, Blues: the basics (Routledge, 2005), pp. 131-2. After the renewed success of John Lee Hooker with his collaborative album The Healer (1989),V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to the blues: the definitive guide to the blues (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 245. several artists began to return to electric blues, including Gary Moore, beginning with Still Got the Blues (1990)V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to the blues: the definitive guide to the blues (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 410-12. and Eric Clapton with From the Cradle (1994).D.

In Britain, it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including The Rolling Stones, The Animals, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. Origins Alexis Korner, often called the father of British blues American blues became known in Britain from the 1930s onwards through a number of routes, including records brought to Britain, particularly by African-American GIs stationed there in the Second World War and Cold War, merchant seamen visiting ports such as London, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Belfast,R. F. Schwartz, How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 28. and through a trickle of (illegal) imports. Blues music was relatively well known to British jazz musicians and fans, particularly in the works of figures like female singers Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and the blues- influenced boogie-woogie of Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller.R. F. Schwartz, How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), p. 22. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI, the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records, began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to what was an emerging market. Many encountered blues for the first time through the skiffle craze of the second half of the 1950s, particularly the songs of Lead Belly covered by acts like Lonnie Donegan. As skiffle began to decline in the late 1950s, and British rock and roll began to dominate the charts, a number of skiffle musicians moved towards playing purely blues music.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944-2002 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), pp. 69-80. Among these were guitarist and blues harpist Cyril Davies, who ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse public house in London's Soho, and guitarist Alexis Korner, both of whom worked for jazz band leader Chris Barber, playing in the R&B; segment he introduced to his show. The club served as a focal point for British skiffle acts and Barber was responsible for bringing over American folk and blues performers, who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America. The first major artist was Big Bill Broonzy, who visited England in the mid-1950s, but who, rather than his electric Chicago blues, played a folk blues set to fit in with British expectations of American blues as a form of folk music. In 1957 Davies and Korner decided that their central interest was the blues and closed the skiffle club, reopening a month later as the London Blues and Barrelhouse Club.L. Portis, Soul Trains (Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2002), p. 213. To this point British blues was acoustically played emulating Delta blues and Country blues styles and often part of the emerging second British folk revival. Critical in changing this was the visit of Muddy Waters in 1958, who initially shocked British audiences by playing amplified electric blues, but who was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and rave reviews.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 700. Davies and Korner, having already split with Barber, now plugged in and began to play high powered electric blues that became the model for the subgenre, forming the band Blues Incorporated. Blues Incorporated became something of a clearing house for British blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s, with many joining, or sitting in on sessions. These included future Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones; as well as Cream founders Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker; beside Graham Bond and Long John Baldry. Blues Incorporated were given a residency at the Marquee Club and it was from there that in 1962 they took the name of the first British Blues album, R&B; from the Marquee for Decca, but split before its release. The culmination of this first movement of blues came with John Mayall, who moved to London in the early 1960s, eventually forming the Bluesbreakers, whose members at various times included, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor. British rhythm and blues While some bands focused on blues artists, particularly those of Chicago electric blues, others adopted a wider interest in rhythm and blues, including the work of Chess Records' blues artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, but also rock and roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1315-6. Most successful were the Rolling Stones, who abandoned blues purism before their line-up solidified and they produced their first eponymously titled album in 1964, which largely consisted of rhythm and blues standards. Following in the wake of the Beatles' national and then international success, the Rolling Stones soon established themselves as the second most popular UK band and joined the British Invasion of the American record charts as leaders of a second wave of R&B; orientated bands. In addition to Chicago blues numbers, the Rolling Stones also covered songs by Chuck Berry and The Valentinos, with the latter's \\"It's All Over Now\\", giving them their first UK number one in 1964.Bill Wyman, Rolling With the Stones (DK Publishing, 2002), , p. 137. Blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones' music, as in their version of \\"Little Red Rooster\\" went to number 1 on the UK singles chart in December 1964.S. T. Erlewine, [ \\"Rolling Stones\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 16 July 2010. Other London-based bands included The Yardbirds (who would number their ranks three key guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page), The Kinks (with the pioneer songwriter Ray Davies and rock-guitarist Dave Davies), and Manfred Mann (considered to have one of the most authentic sounding vocalists in the scene in Paul Jones) and the Pretty Things, beside the more jazz-influenced acts like the Graham Bond Organisation, Georgie Fame and Zoot Money. Bands to emerge from other major British cities included The Animals from Newcastle (with the keyboards of Alan Price and vocals of Eric Burdon), The Moody Blues and Spencer Davis Group from Birmingham (the latter largely a vehicle for the young Steve Winwood), and Them from Belfast (with their vocalist Van Morrison). None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on a variety of sources, including Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained at the core of their early albums. Georgie Fame, one of the major figures of the British R&B; movement in 1968 The British Mod subculture was musically centred on rhythm and blues and later soul music, performed by artists that were not available in small London clubs around which the scene was based.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1321-2. As a result, a number of mod bands emerged to fill this gap. These included The Small Faces, The Creation, The Action and most successfully The Who. The Who's early promotional material tagged them as producing \\"maximum rhythm and blues\\", but by about 1966 they moved from attempting to emulate American R&B; to producing songs that reflected the Mod lifestyle. Many of these bands were able to enjoy cult and then national success in the UK, but found it difficult to break into the American market. Only the Who managed, after some difficulty, to produce a significant US following, particularly after their appearances at the Monterey Pop Festival (1967) and Woodstock (1969).B. Eder & S. T. Erlewine, [ \\"The Who\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 16 July 2010. Because of the very different circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues these bands produced was very different in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, but it has also been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. Most of these bands rapidly moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music, often leaving their R&B; roots behind, but enabling several to enjoy sustained careers that were not open to most of the more pop-oriented beat groups of the first wave of the invasion, who (with the major exception of the Beatles) were unable to write their own material or adapt to changes in the musical climate. The British blues boom Peter Green performing with Fleetwood Mac in 1970 The blues boom overlapped, both chronologically and in terms of personnel, with the earlier, wider rhythm and blues phase, which had begun to peter out in the mid-1960s leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques, which they would carry into the pursuit of more purist blues interests.R. Unterberger, \\"Early British R&B;\\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1315-6.N. Logan and B. Woffinden, The NME Book of Rock 2 (London: W. H. Allen, 1977), , pp. 61-2. Blues Incorporated and Mayall's Bluesbreakers were well known in the London Jazz and emerging R&B; circuits, but the Bluesbreakers began to gain some national and international attention, particularly after the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings.T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C. White, Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960-1969 (Omnibus Press, 2002), p. 130. Produced by Mike Vernon, who later set up the Blue Horizon record label, it was notable for its driving rhythms and Clapton's rapid blues licks with a full distorted sound derived from a Gibson Les Paul and a Marshall amp. This sound became something of a classic combination for British blues (and later rock) guitarists,M. Roberty and C. Charlesworth, The Complete Guide to the Music of Eric Clapton (Omnibus Press, 1995), p. 11. and also made clear the primacy of the guitar, seen as a distinctive characteristic of the subgenre. Clapton stated, \\"I spent most of my teens and early twenties studying the blues - the geography of it and the chronology of it, as well as how to play it\\". Peter Green started what is called \\"second great epoch of British blues\\", as he replaced Clapton in the Bluesbreakers after his departure to form Cream. In 1967, after one record with the Bluesbreakers, Green, with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac,R. Brunning, The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies (Omnibus Press, 2004), pp. 1-15. produced by Mike Vernon on the Blue Horizon label. One key factor in developing the popularity of the music in the UK and across Europe in the early 1960s was the success of the American Folk Blues Festival tours, organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau. The rise of electric blues, and its eventual mainstream success, meant that British acoustic blues was completely overshadowed. In the early 1960s, folk guitar pioneers Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and particularly Davy Graham (who played and recorded with Korner), played blues, folk and jazz, developing a distinctive guitar style known as folk baroque.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005) pp. 184-9. British acoustic blues continued to develop as part of the folk scene, with figures like Ian A. Anderson and his Country Blues Band,\\"Ian A. Anderson\\", NME Artists, retrieved 23/06/09. and Al Jones.\\"Al Jones: acoustic blues and folk musician\\", Times Online 20/08/08, retrieved 23/06/09. Most British acoustic blues players could achieve little commercial success and, with a few exceptions, found it difficult to gain any recognition for their \\"imitations\\" of the blues in the US.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005) p. 252. Cream, one of the most influential bands to emerge from the movement, c. 1966 In contrast, the next wave of bands, formed from about 1967, like Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, and Free, pursued a different route, retaining blues standards in their repertoire and producing original material that often shied away from obvious pop influences, placing an emphasis on individual virtuosity.D. Hatch and S. Millward, From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), p. 105. The result has been characterised as blues rock and arguably marked the beginnings of a separation of pop and rock music that was to be a feature of the record industry for several decades. Cream is often seen as the first supergroup, combining the talents of Clapton, Bruce and Baker; they have also been seen as one the first groups to exploit the power trio. Although only together for a little over two years, from 1966‚Äì69, they were highly influential and it was in this period that Clapton became an international superstar.R. Unterberger, \\"Cream: biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 22 June 2012. Fleetwood Mac are often considered to have produced some of the finest work in the subgenre, with inventive interpretations of Chicago Blues. They were also the most commercially successful group, with their eponymous d√©but album reaching the UK top five in early 1968 and as the instrumental \\"Albatross\\" reached number one in the single charts in early 1969. This was, as Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz put it, \\"The commercial apex of the British blues Boom\\".S. Schinder and A. Schwartz, Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever (Greenwood, 2008), p. 218. Free, with the guitar talents of Paul Kossoff, particularly from their self titled second album (1969), produced a stripped down form of blues that would be highly influential on hard rock and later heavy metal.J. Ankeny, \\"Free: biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 22 June 2012. Ten Years After, with guitarist Alvin Lee, formed in 1967, but achieved their breakthrough in 1968 with their live album Undead and in the US with their appearance at Woodstock the next year.W. Ruhlmann, \\"Ten Years After: biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 22 June 2012. Among the last British blues bands to gain mainstream success were Jethro Tull, formed from the amalgamation of two blues bands, the John Evan Band and the Mcgregor's Engine in 1967. Their second album, Stand Up, reached number one in the UK in 1969.Barry Miles, The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era (London: Sterling, 2009), , p. 286. Decline Members of Jethro Tull, in 1973, by which time they had already begun to move away from a blues sound British blues entered a rapid decline at the end of 1960s. Surviving bands and musicians tended to move into other expanding areas of rock music. Some, like Jethro Tull, followed bands like the Moody Blues away from 12-bar structures and harmonicas into complex, classical-influenced progressive rock.S. Borthwick and Ron Moy, Popular Music Genres: an Introduction (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 64. Some played a loud version of blues rock that became the foundation for hard rock and heavy metal. Led Zeppelin, formed by Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page, on their first two albums, both released in 1969, fused heavy blues and amplified rock to create what has been seen as a watershed in the development of hard rock and nascent heavy metal.C. Smith, 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music (Madison NY: Greenwood, 2009), , pp. 64-5. Later recordings would mix in elements of folk and mysticism, which would also be a major influence on heavy metal music.S. T. Erlewine, \\"Led Zeppelin: biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 8 September 2011. Deep Purple developed a sound based on \\"squeezing and stretching\\" the blues,P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), , p. 278. and achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, In Rock (1970), which has been seen as one of heavy metal's defining albums.E. Rivadavia, \\"Review: Deep Purple, In Rock\\", Allmusic, retrieved 29 December 2011. Black Sabbath was the third incarnation of a group that started as the Polka Tulk Blues Band in 1968. Their early work included blues standards, but by the time of their second album Paranoid (1970), they had added elements of modality and the occult that would largely define modern heavy metal.M. Campbell and J. Brody, Rock and Roll: an Introduction (Cengage Learning, 2nd edn., 2008), , pp. 213-4. Some, like Korner and Mayall, continued to play a \\"pure\\" form of the blues, but largely outside of mainstream notice. The structure of clubs, venues and festivals that had grown up in the early 1950s in Britain virtually disappeared in the 1970s.R. F. Schwartz, How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), p. 242. Survival and resurgence The Blues Band onstage in 2012 Suzy Starlite and Simon Campbell of the Starlite Campbell Band onstage in 2018 Although overshadowed by the growth of rock music the blues did not disappear in Britain, with American bluesmen like John Lee Hooker, Eddie Taylor, and Freddie King continuing to be well received in the UK and an active home scene led by figures including Dave Kelly and his sister Jo Ann Kelly, who helped keep the acoustic blues alive on the British folk circuit.Year of the Blues , retrieved 20 July 2009. Dave Kelly was also a founder of The Blues Band with former Manfred Mann members Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness, Hughie Flint and Gary Fletcher. The Blues Band was credited with kicking off a second blues boom in Britain, which by the 90s led to festivals all around the country, including The Swanage Blues Festival, The Burnley National Blues Festival, The Gloucester Blues and Heritage Festival and The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival at Colne. The twenty-first century has seen an upsurge in interest in the blues in Britain that can be seen in the success of previously unknown acts like Seasick Steve, in the return to the blues by major figures who began in the first boom, including Peter Green,R.

Aynsley Lister and most recently in 2017 the Starlite Campbell Band. The British blues tradition lives on, as a style, outside of Britain as well. American guitarist Joe Bonamassa describes his main influences as the 1960s era British blues players, and considers himself a part of that tradition rather than the earlier American blues styles. Significance Beside giving a start to many important blues, pop and rock musicians, in spawning blues rock British blues also ultimately gave rise to a host of subgenres of rock, including particularly psychedelic rock, progressive rock. hard rock and ultimately heavy metal.W. Kaufman and H. S. Macpherson, Britain and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History (ABC- CLIO, 2005), p. 154. Perhaps the most important contribution of British blues was the surprising re-exportation of American blues back to America, where, in the wake of the success of bands like the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac, white audiences began to look again at black blues musicians like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker, who suddenly began to appeal to middle class white Americans. The result was a re-evaluation of the blues in America which enabled white Americans much more easily to become blues musicians, opening the door to Southern rock and the development of Texas blues musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

In the view of Simon Reynolds, dream pop \\"celebrates rapturous and transcendent experiences, often using druggy and mystical imagery\\". According to Rachel Felder, dream pop artists often resist representations of social reality in favour of ambiguous or hallucinogenic experiences. History Author Nathan Wiseman-Trowse explained that the \\"approach to the sheer physicality of sound\\" integral to dream pop was \\"arguably pioneered in popular music by figures such as Phil Spector and Brian Wilson\\". The music of the Velvet Underground in the 1960s and 1970s, which experimented with repetition, tone, and texture over conventional song structure, was also an important touchstone in the genre's development George Harrison's 1970 album All Things Must Pass, with its Spector-produced Wall of Sound and fluid arrangements, led music journalist John Bergstrom to credit it as a progenitor of the genre. Reynolds described dream pop bands as \\"a wave of hazy neo-psychedelic groups\\", noting the influence of the \\"ethereal soundscapes\\" of bands such as Cocteau Twins. Rolling Stones Kory Grow described \\"modern dream pop\\" as originating with the early 1980s work of Cocteau Twins and their contemporaries, while PopMatters AJ Ramirez noted an evolutionary line from gothic rock to dream pop. Grow considered Julee Cruise's 1989 album Floating into the Night, written and produced by David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, as a significant development of the dream pop sound which \\"gave the genre its synthy sheen.\\" The influence of Cocteau Twins extended to the expansion of the genre's influence into Cantopop and Mandopop through the music of Faye Wong, who covered multiple Cocteau Twins songs, including tracks featured in Chungking Express, in which she also acted. Cocteau Twins would go on to collaborate with Wong on original songs of hers, and Wong contributed vocals to a limited release of a late Cocteau Twins single. In the early 1990s, some dream pop acts influenced by My Bloody Valentine, such as Seefeel, were drawn to techno and began utilizing elements such as samples and sequenced rhythms. Ambient pop music was described by AllMusic as \\"essentially an extension of the dream pop that emerged in the wake of the shoegazer movement\\", distinct for its incorporation of electronic textures. Much of the music associated with the 2009-coined term \\"chillwave\\" could be considered dream pop. In the opinion of Grantlands David Schilling, when \\"chillwave\\" was popularized, the discussion that followed among music journalists and bloggers revealed that labels such as \\"shoegaze\\" and \\"dream pop\\" were ultimately \\"arbitrary and meaningless\\".

Characterised by its simplicity and perceived innocence, some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, prominent independent record labels associated with twee pop were Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US). Characteristics The definition of twee is something \\"excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental,\\" supposedly born from a childish mispronunciation of the word sweet. While the terms \\"twee\\" or \\"twee pop\\" are considered pejorative in the UK, a retrospective fascination with the genre in the US saw Americans eagerly defining themselves as twee. According to The A.V. Clubs Paula Mejia: AllMusic says that twee pop is \\"perhaps best likened to bubblegum indie rock ‚Äì it's music with a spirit of D.I.Y. defiance in the grand tradition of punk, but with a simplicity and innocence not seen or heard since the earliest days of rock & roll\\". The author Marc Spitz suggests that the roots of twee stem from the post-war 1950s music. While the culture categorized itself under the moniker of \\"indie\\" (short for independent), many major twee powerhouses gained mainstream critical acclaim for their contributions to the twee movement. Related movements Cuddlecore is a movement that emerged as a consequence of twee pop that was briefly prominent in the mid-1990s.\\"Cute. Real Cute : The Look Is Dainty, but Cuddle Core Followers Are Brashly Telling the World They'll Grow Up the Way They Please\\". Los Angeles Times, 28 June 1995.

It was designed and built by the British company Vickers Defence Systems (now known as BAE Systems Land & Armaments). Vickers Defence Systems began to develop a successor to Challenger 1 as a private venture in 1986. A ¬£90 million deal for a demonstrator vehicle was finalised in January 1989. In June 1991, the Ministry of Defence placed a ¬£520 million order for 140 vehicles, with a further 268 ordered in 1994. Production began in 1993 and the unit's tanks were delivered in July 1994, replacing the Challenger 1. The tank entered service with the British Army in 1998, with the last delivered in 2002. It is expected to remain in service until 2035. The Royal Army of Oman ordered 18 Challenger 2s in 1993 and a further 20 tanks in November 1997. The Challenger 2 is an extensive redesign of the Challenger 1. Although the hull and automotive components seem similar, they are of a newer design and build than those of the Challenger 1 and only around 3% of components are interchangeable. A visual recognition feature is the armoured housing for the TOGS thermal gunsight: the Challenger 2 has this above the gun barrel, the Challenger 1 has it at the right hand side of the turret. The tank's drive system provides a 550 km range, with a maximum road speed of 59 km/h. The Challenger 2 is equipped with a 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on the Chieftain and Challenger 1. Unique among NATO main battle tank armament, the L30A1 is rifled, because the British Army continues to place a premium on the use of High-explosive squash head (HESH) rounds in addition to armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding-sabot rounds. The Challenger 2 is also armed with a L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm chain gun and a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun. Fifty main armament rounds and 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried. The Challenger 2 has a four-man crew. The turret and hull are protected with second generation Chobham armour (also known as Dorchester). On one occasion, in August 2006, during the post-invasion stage of the Iraq War, an RPG-29 was fired at a Challenger 2 that was climbing over a ramp. The armour on its front underside hull, which was augmented with an explosive reactive armour package, was damaged, injuring several crew members. The tank subsequently returned to base under its own power and was quickly repaired and back on duty the following day. As a response to the incident, the explosive reactive armour package was replaced with a Dorchester block and the steel underbelly lined with armour as part of the 'Streetfighter' upgrade. To date, the only time the tank has been destroyed during operations was by another Challenger 2 in a 'blue on blue' (friendly fire) incident at Basra in 2003 when the destroyed tank had its hatch open at the time of the incident. It has seen operational service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq.  History  The Challenger 2 is the third vehicle of this name, the first being the A30 Challenger, a World War II design using the Cromwell tank chassis with a 17-pounder gun. The second was the Persian Gulf War era Challenger 1, which was the British army's main battle tank (MBT) from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. Vickers Defence Systems began to develop a successor to Challenger 1 as a private venture in 1986. Following the issue of a Staff Requirement for a next-generation tank, Vickers submitted its plans for Challenger 2 to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). They evaluated the American M1 Abrams offered by General Dynamics, but the Thatcher government chose to proceed with the Challenger 2 in December 1988. Secretary of State for Defence George Younger announced to the House of Commons that Vickers would receive a ¬£90 million contract for a demonstrator vehicle, a deal that was finalised in January 1989.Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank 1987‚Äì2006 By Simon Dunstan, Tony Bryan, page 5 The demonstration phase had three milestones for progress, with dates of September 1989, March 1990, and September 1990. At the last of these milestones, Vickers was to have met 11 key criteria for the tank's design. In June 1991, after competition with other tank manufacturers' designs (including the M1A2 Abrams and the Leopard 2 (Improved)), the MoD placed a ¬£520 million order for 127 MBTs and 13 driver training vehicles. An order for a further 259 tanks and 9 driver trainers (worth ¬£800 million) was placed in 1994. Oman ordered 18 Challenger 2s in 1993 and a further 20 tanks in November 1997. Production began in 1993 at two primary sites: Elswick, Tyne and Wear and Barnbow, Leeds, although over 250 subcontractors were involved. The first tanks were delivered in July 1994. The Challenger 2 failed the acceptance trials in 1994 and it was forced into the Progressive Reliability Growth Trial in 1995. Three vehicles were tested for 285 simulated battlefield days. Each day consisted of: * of on-road travel * of off-road travel * 34 main armament rounds fired * 1,000 7.62 MG rounds fired * 16 hours weapon system operation * 10 hours main engine idling * 3.5 hours main engine running Challenger 2 Tank of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Squadron D) during live fire training exercises on Bergen-Hohne Training Area (Germany) The tank was then accepted into service in 1998. An equally important milestone was the In-Service Reliability Demonstration (ISRD) in 1998. The CR2 In-Service Reliability Demonstration (ISRD) milestone was successfully achieved in January 1999. The ISRD took place from September to December 1998. 12 fully crewed tanks were tested at the Bovington test tracks and at Lulworth Bindon ranges. The tank exceeded all staff requirements. The Challenger 2 entered service with the British Army in June 1998 (with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards), with the last delivered in 2002. Under Army 2020, only three Challenger 2 Tank Regiments will remain: the Queen's Royal Hussars, the King's Royal Hussars and the Royal Tank Regiment, each of which is the tank Regiment of an Armoured Infantry Brigade. A single Army Reserve regiment, The Royal Wessex Yeomanry, will provide reservist Challenger crews to the regular regiments. Deliveries of the Challenger 2 to Oman were completed in 2001. The Trojan minefield breaching vehicle and the Titan bridge-laying vehicle based on the chassis of the Challenger 2 were shown in November 2006; 66 are to be supplied by BAE Systems to the Royal Engineers, at a cost of ¬£250 million.Trojan and Titan Armoured Engineer Vehicles armedforces.co.uk A British military document from 2001 indicated that the British Army would not procure a replacement for the Challenger 2 because of a lack of foreseeable conventional threats in the future. However, IHS Jane's 360 reported on 20 September 2015 that following discussions with Senior Army Officers and Procurement Officials at DSEI 2015, as well as the head of the British Army, General Sir Nick Carter, that the British Army was looking at either upgrading the Challenger 2 or outright replacing it. Sources confirmed that the future of the MBT was being considered at the highest levels of the Army. This stemmed from the British Army's concern with the new Russian T-14 Armata main battle tank and the growing ineffectiveness of the aging L30 rifled gun and its limited suite of ammunition. Further, it was confirmed that numerous armoured vehicle manufacturers had discussions with the MoD about a potential replacement for the Challenger 2. Shortly after, the British Army decided that purchasing a new tank would be too expensive and chose to proceed with a Challenger 2 life extension project (LEP).UK Army To Extend Life of Challenger 2; New Tank Too Costly - Defensenews.com, 11 October 2015 It is expected to remain in service until 2025. Maintenance and overhaul of the Challenger 2's is currently undertaken by Babcock Defence Support Group, and design authority for the tank is held by BAE Systems.  Design  = Armament = A Challenger 2 firing its main armament during an exercise. The shell is visible to the left of the smoke cloud. Close-up of muzzle showing rifling BATUS, Canada The Challenger 2 is equipped with a 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1. The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining and, like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve. It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilization system. The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees. Uniquely among NATO main battle tank armament, the L30A1 is rifled and along with its predecessor, Royal Ordnance L11A5, the only Third Generation Main Battle Tank Guns to use a rifled barrel. This is because the British Army continues to place a premium on the use of high explosive squash head (HESH) rounds in addition to Armour-piercing fin- stabilized discarding-sabot rounds. HESH rounds have a longer range (up to further) than APFSDS, and are more effective against buildings and thin- skinned vehicles. Forty-nine main armament rounds are carried in the turret and hull; these are a mix of L27A1 APFSDS (also referred to as CHARM 3), L31 HESH and L34 white phosphorus smoke rounds, depending on the situation. As with earlier versions of the 120 mm gun, the propellant charges are loaded separately from the shell or KE projectile. A combustible rigid charge is used for the APFSDS rounds and a combustible hemispherical bag charge for the HESH and Smoke rounds. An electrically fired vent tube is used to initiate firing of the main armament rounds. (The main armament ammunition is thus described to be \\"three-part ammunition\\", consisting of the projectile, charge and vent tube.) The separation of ammunition pieces also aids in ensuring lower chances of ammunition detonation. The Challenger 2 is also armed with a L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm chain gun coaxially to the left of the main gun, and a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun mounted on a pintle on the loader's hatch ring. 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried. The Challenger can also mount a Leonardo \\"Enforcer\\" remote control weapons system bearing a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun, a 12.7mm heavy machine gun or a 40mm automatic grenade launcher.  Fire control and sights  Close up view of a Challenger 2 The digital fire control computer from Computing Devices Co of Canada contains two 32-bit processors with a MIL STD1553B databus, and has capacity for additional systems, such as a Battlefield Information Control System. The commander has a panoramic SAGEM VS 580-10 gyrostabilised sight with laser rangefinder. Elevation range is +35¬∞ to ‚àí35¬∞. The commander's station is equipped with eight periscopes for 360¬∞ vision. The Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight II (TOGS II), from Thales, provides night vision. The thermal image is displayed on both the gunner's and commander's sights and monitors. The gunner has a stabilised primary sight using a laser rangefinder with a range of to . The driver's position is equipped with a Thales Optronics image- intensifying Passive Driving Periscope (PDP) for night driving and a rear view thermal camera. = Protection = Counter-IED ECM antennas are on the platform on the turret, and additional ECM equipment overhangs the left and right front fenders. A remote controlled weapon systems (RCWS) has also been fitted to the turret. The Challenger 2 is a heavily armoured and well protected tank. The turret and hull are protected by second generation of Chobham armour (also known as Dorchester), the details of which are classified but which is said to have a mass efficiency more then two times that of rolled homogeneous armor against high explosive anti tank projectiles. Crew safety was paramount in the design, using a solid state electric drive for its turret and gun movement, thus removing the traditional risk of hydraulic rupture into the crew compartment. Explosive reactive armour kits are also fitted as necessary along with additional bar armour. The nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection system is located in the turret bustle. The tank's shape is also designed to minimise its radar signature. On each side of the turret are five L8 smoke grenade dischargers. The Challenger 2 can also create smoke by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust manifolds. = Drive system = A Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Challenger 2 climbing an obstacle during a training exercise 17 Nov 2008, in Basra, Iraq The tank's drive system comprises: * Engine: Perkins 26.1 litre, 60¬∞ Vee, twin turbo-charged, CV12-6A four-stroke, four valve per cylinder (pushrod), direct injection diesel engine delivering 1200 bhp (895 kW) at 2300rpm. Torque 4126 Nm at 1700rpm.https://www.thefreelibrary.com/building challenger 2.-a09038700 The engine and gearbox are controlled by a Petards Vehicle Integrated Control System (VICS). * Gearbox: David Brown Santasalo TN54E epicyclical transmission (6 fwd, 2 rev.) rated at 1200 bhp and upgradable to 1500 bhp. * Suspension: Horstman Defence Systems second (current) or third-generation (future) hydrogas suspension units (HSU). * Track: William Cook Defence hydraulically adjustable TR60 414FS double-pin. * Maximum speed: on road; cross country * Range: on road with external fuel; cross country on internal fuel. The tank is also fitted with an Extel Systems Wedel APU (Auxiliary Power Unit - also referred to as a GUE [Generating Unit Engine]) based around a 38 kW Perkins P404C-22 Diesel engine, with a 600 A electrical output which can be used to power the vehicle's electrical systems when it is stationary and the main engine is switched off, this replaces the Perkins P4.108 engine fitted when the tank was first introduced. The use of an APU allows for reduced fuel consumption and lowers the audio and thermal signature of the vehicle. As of 2013, the British Army has, at various events featuring the Challenger 2, begun to state the on road range of 550 km as opposed to an earlier stated value of 450 km. They have also publicly stated a maximum road speed of 59 km/h while equipped with 15 tons of additional modules. = Crew and accommodation = The British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew (including a loader) after risk analysis of the incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that auto-loaders reduced battlefield survivability. Mechanical failure and the time required for repair were prime concerns. Similar to every British tank since the Centurion, and most other British AFVs, Challenger 2 contains a boiling vessel (BV) for water, which can be used to brew tea, ramen or produce other hot beverages and heat boil-in- the-bag meals contained in field ration packs.Audrey Gillan. A brew brings coalition forces closer together, Guardian Unlimited, 7 April 2003 This BV requirement is general for armoured vehicles of the British Armed Forces, and is unique to the armed forces of the UK and India.  Operational history  The Challenger 2 had been used in peacekeeping missions and exercises before, but its first combat use came in March 2003 during the invasion of Iraq. 7th Armoured Brigade, part of 1st Armoured Division, was in action with 120 Challenger 2s around Basra. The type saw extensive use during the siege of Basra, providing fire support to the British forces and knocking out Iraqi tanks, mainly T-54/55s. The problems that had been identified during the large Saif Sareea II exercise, held 18 months earlier, had been solved by the issuing of Urgent Operational Requirements for equipment such as sand filters and so during the invasion of Iraq the tank's Operational availability was improved. A Challenger 2 crosses into Iraq, 2003 During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Challenger 2 tanks suffered no tank losses to Iraqi fire, although one was penetrated by an Improvised explosive device (IED). This was, at the time, unprotected by Dorchester armour. The driver was injured. In one encounter within an urban area, a Challenger 2 came under attack from irregular forces with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. The driver's sight was damaged and while attempting to back away under the commander's directions, the other sights were damaged and the tank threw its tracks entering a ditch. It was hit by 14 rocket propelled grenades from close range and a MILAN anti-tank missile. The crew survived, safe within the tank until it was recovered for repairs, the worst damage being to the sighting system. It was back in operation six hours later. One Challenger 2 operating near Basra survived being hit by 70 RPGs in another incident. In August 2006 south east of al-Amarah, southern Iraq, an RPG-29 capable of firing a tandem-charge penetrated the frontal lower underbelly armour of a Challenger 2 commanded by Captain Thomas Williams of The Queens's Royal Hussars. The tank, which had already been hit by 10‚Äì15 RPGs, small arms and sniper fire, was attempting to draw fire away from another callsign that had become stricken. Its driver, Trooper Sean Chance, lost part of his foot in the blast; two more of the crew were slightly injured. Chance was able to reverse the vehicle to the regimental aid post despite his injuries. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations that crews had been told the tank was impervious to the insurgents' weapons, the MoD said \\"We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.\\" Since then, the explosive reactive armour has been replaced with a Dorchester block and the steel underbelly lined with armour as part of the 'Streetfighter' upgrade as a direct response to this incident. Two Challenger 2s have been damaged in combat, but only one has been destroyed: * 25 March 2003: A friendly fire (\\"blue-on-blue\\") incident in Basra in which one Challenger 2 of the Black Watch Battlegroup (2nd Royal Tank Regiment) mistakenly engaged another Challenger 2 of the Queen's Royal Lancers after detecting what was believed to be an enemy flanking manoeuvre on thermal equipment. The attacking tank's second HESH round hit the open commander's hatch lid of the QRL tank sending hot fragments into the turret, killing two crew members. The hit caused a fire that eventually led to an explosion of the stowed ammunition, destroying the tank. It remains the only Challenger 2 to be destroyed on operations. * 6 April 2007: in Basra, Iraq, a shaped charge from an IED penetrated the underside of a tank resulting in the driver losing three of his toes and causing minor injuries to another soldier. An upgraded Challenger 2 with added explosive reactive armour panels, manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems To help prevent incidents of this nature, Challenger 2s have been upgraded with a new passive armour package, including the use of add-on armour manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel.British Next Generation Armour, Tankograd British Special no. 9009, Dan Hay When deployed on operations the Challenger 2 is now normally upgraded to TES (Theatre Entry Standard), which includes a number of modifications including armour and weapon system upgrades.  Upgrades  = CLIP = The Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme (CLIP) was a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the Leopard 2A6. The use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed Challenger 2 to use NATO standard ammunition developed in Germany and the US. This includes tungsten-based kinetic energy penetrators, which do not have the same political and environmental objections as depleted uranium rounds. The production lines for rifled 120 mm ammunition in the UK have been closed for some years, so existing stocks of ammunition for the L30A1 are finite. In 2009, a new HESH round manufactured in Belgium by Mecar has been trialled. This means that the Challenger 2 now has available new Tungsten \\"FIN\\" (APFSDS) and HESH rounds, if and when required, which secures a line of ammunition for its 55 calibre rifled main gun, the L30, when required in the future. Challenger 2 fitted with 120 mm smoothbore gun for trials A single Challenger 2 was fitted with the L55 and underwent trials in January 2006. The smoothbore gun is the same length as the L30A1, and is fitted with the rifled gun's cradle, thermal sleeve, bore evacuator and muzzle reference system. Early trials apparently revealed that the German tungsten DM53 round was more effective than the depleted-uranium CHARM 3. The ammunition storage and handling arrangements will need to be changed to cater for the single-piece smoothbore rounds, instead of the separate-loading rifled rounds. In 2006, a figure of ¬£386 million was estimated to fit all Challengers in the British Army with the Rheinmetall 120 mm gun. = CSP = Other improvements have also been considered, including a regenerative NBC protection system. In addition, several Challenger 2s had the pintle-mounted GPMG on the loader's crew hatch replaced with a remote controlled turret, allowing the loader to operate the weaponry without having to expose himself to enemy fire. In May 2007, the Ministry of Defence's Future Systems Group invited BAES to tender for the Challenger 2 Capability Sustainment Program (C2 CSP), which combined all upgrades into one programme. However, by mid-2008, the programme was in danger of slipping, or even being cancelled, as a result of defence budget shortfalls. = CLEP = \\"Megatron\\", the British TES reference vehicle at Bovington fitted with a Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) in 2016 The Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP) is designed to replace obsolete equipment, enhance protection, increase range and provide improved lethality of the tank until an out of service date of 2035 - extending its life from 2025. The LEP forms the major component of the \\"Armour MBT (2025) Programme\\". In July 2013, it was confirmed that the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP) was in the concept stage and would be in initial gate by 2014, this later slipped to early 2015. In June 2014, it was stated that not all of the 227 Challenger 2s may be modified to CLEP standard and the smoothbore cannon had been dropped. A Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) Newsletter dated December 2015 stated that the LEP includes managing to curb obsolescence in several turret systems ‚Äì including TI sights, the Fire Control Computer (FCC) and electronic architecture in turret. Improved technology will be integrated as a new system on the platform, which will deliver more accurate engagements at range and improved FCC power, meaning that CR2 will remain a \\"battle winning\\" asset out to the extended out of service date. Parallel work strands will provide extensions to virtual training systems, deliver improved Live Fire Monitoring Equipment (LFME) and work is ongoing to develop improved 120 mm ammunition. The full scope of the LEP is indicated as being broken down into four areas: # Surveillance and Target Acquisition: Updated Commanders Primary Sight, Updated Gunners Primary Sight, Replacement Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sights (TOGS) and, 3rd Generation Thermal Imaging (TI). # Weapon Control System: Fire Control Computer (FCC), Fire Control Panel (FCP) and, Gun Processing Unit (GPU) # Mobility (Through In-Service Efficiencies): 3rd Generation (Horstman) Hydrogas Suspension, Improved Air Filtration, CV-12 Common Rail Fuel Injection, Transmission and, Cooling. # Electronic Architecture (Modernised Electronics): Gunners Control Handles, Video Distribution Architecture, Generic Vehicle Architecture (GVA) Compliant Interfaces, Increased On-board Processing and, Improved Human Machine Interface (HMI). A recent Ministry of Defence document also identified a \\"soft kill defensive aid system\\", the German MUSS, for the Challenger 2. Active Protection Systems (APS) for armoured vehicles in the UK armed forces (including the Challenger 2) are being assessed by the UK Defence Science and Technical Laboratory (DSTL) as part of the MEDUSA Technical Assessment Programme, this includes the MUSS System. In 2017 a Challenger 2 was also fitted with a Rheinmetall ROSY rapid obscurant system including parts from the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Iron Fist Hard-Kill APS for development and assessment by the DSTL. In January 2016 it was reported by IHS Jane's that the UK's Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S;) organisation had received a number of replies to its pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) for the projected Challenger 2 MBT life extension programme (LEP) which aims to extend the life of the Challenger 2 out to 2035. In addition to BAE Systems Combat Vehicles (UK), which is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), contenders were stated to include Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann of Germany, General Dynamics UK, Lockheed Martin UK, CMI Defence of Belgium, and RUAG Defence of Switzerland. Around this time a separate two-year contract was awarded to BAE Systems and Krauss Maffei Wegmann to develop an update to the bridging variant in part to address the increase in weight of the Challenger 2 from 62.5t to 75t arising from upgrades made during the Iraq campaign.http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2016/01/16/uk- surges-ahead-challenger-2-upgrade/78841260/ Final bids for the upgrade programme were submitted in August 2016. The LEP will see the replacement of most of the tanks electronics, including its sighting systems but does not envisage a major upgrade of the vehicle's drive systems or replacement of the 120 mm L30A1 rifled gun. Full bidder confirmation was not available at this time. On 2 November 2016 it was reported that teams led by Rheinmetall Landsystem and BAE Systems had been chosen as preferred bidders for the assessment phase of the LEP by the UK MoD. The MoD are investing ¬£53 million in the assessment phase. Each contractor receives ¬£23 million, with an additional ¬£7 million being set aside to cover additional, unspecified work. The Rheinmetall consortium includes BMT, Pearson Engineering, Supacat, and Thales UK and includes an option to retrofit Rheinmetall's 120 mm L55 smooth bore gun should additional funds be made available. The BAE team includes General Dynamics UK, Qinetiq, Leonardo, Moog and Safran. Also bidding for the LEP were teams headed by CMI Defence (Belgium), Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (Germany), Lockheed Martin UK, and RUAG Defence (Switzerland). It is expected the LEP modernization program could be worth around ¬£650 million ($802 million) to the eventual winner. On 22 December 2016, an assessment phase award was awarded to BAE Systems and Rheinmetall Land Systeme GmbH to progress the Challenger 2 Life Extension Project. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the Thermal Imaging System prior to the award and implementation of the CR2 LEP, an interim ¬£15.4 million \\"Challenger 2 Thermal imaging sustainment project\\" was awarded to BAE Systems on 15 December 2017 to \\"demonstrate and manufacture\\" a suitable interim solution separate to that incorporated in the LEP. In October 2019 it was announced that Thales would be supplying their Catherine Megapixel (MP) Thermal Imaging Camera which forms part of the Thermal Imaging Sub-System on the Tank. In October 2018, BAE Systems unveiled its proposed Challenger 2 LEP technology demonstrator, the ‚ÄúBlack Night‚Äù. The new improvements include a Safran Paseo commander‚Äôs independent sight, Leonardo thermal imager for the gunner, and Leonardo night sight DNVS 4. The Black Night Challenger 2 turret has been modified to improve the speed of traverse and provides greater space as well as regenerative braking to generate and store power. Other enhancements include a laser warning system and an active protection system.https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/bae-unveils-black-knight-the-first- fully-upgraded-challenger-2-tank/https://www.army-technology.com/news/bae- black-night-challenger-2-army/ In January 2019 Rheinmetall unveiled details of its proposal for the Challenger 2 LEP. The company‚Äôs solution has been to develop a completely new turret which has a fully digital electronic architecture, new day and night sights for the commander and gunner, and a Rheinmetall L55 smoothbore 120 mm gun. The turret was developed on Rheinmetall‚Äôs own initiative and was not funded by the UK MoD for the LEP assessment phase. The smoothbore gun was not part of the MoD‚Äôs LEP requirement, with the request for proposals focusing on mission system obsolescence. The Rheinmetall proposal is ambitious and is likely to be significantly more expensive than the BAE Systems‚Äô offering unveiled in 2018. However, the new turret is necessary if a smoothbore gun is selected. If Rheinmetall‚Äôs planned purchase of a 55% stake in BAE Systems‚Äô UK operations is approved the LEP competition between the companies will continue, an agreement with Rheinmetall ensuring that the solution will be delivered from Telford regardless of the contract winner. = HAAIP = Options for updating the automotive components of Challenger 2, and its associated variants, are being analysed separately from CLEP as part of the Heavy Armour Automotive Improvement Programme (HAAIP). HAAIP has already led to upgrades to the air filtration system, through the use of cleanable air filters with increased operating life, which were tested in Exercise Saif Sareea 3 in October 2018. The HAAIP programme, awarded to BAE Systems will also apply a common engine (CV12-8A) and suspension standard (3rd generation Hydrogas) to Challenger 2, CRARRV, Titan and Trojan improving reliability. With regard to the powertrain, BAE Systems are evaluating whether to uprate the existing CV12 engine or swap this for alternative designs. The CV12 upgrade by Caterpillar Defense would fit electronically controlled common rail fuel injection and introduce engine health monitoring (HUMS). This would increase the maximum power output to 1,500 bhp, reduce battlefield smoke emissions, and improve fleet reliability and availability./ The engines and transmission units have themselves also been remanufactured in recent years. Variants = Titan = Titan Bridge Launcher with No.12 Bridge at Salisbury Plain The Titan armoured bridge layer is based on aspects of the Challenger 2 running gear and replaced the Chieftain Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridge (ChAVLB). The Titan came into service in 2006 with the Royal Engineers, with 33 in service. Titan can carry a single 26-metre-long bridge or two 12-metre-long bridges. It can also be fitted with a bulldozer blade. = Trojan = Trojan AVRE The Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers is a combat engineering vehicle designed as a replacement for the Chieftain AVRE (ChAVRE). It uses the Challenger 2 chassis, and carries an articulated excavator arm, a dozer blade, and attachment rails for fascines. Entering service in 2007, 33 were produced. = Challenger 2E = The Challenger 2E is an export version of the tank. It has a new integrated weapon control and battlefield management system, which includes a gyrostabilised panoramic SAGEM MVS 580-day/thermal sight for the commander and SAGEM SAVAN 15 gyrostabilised day/thermal sight for the gunner, both with eyesafe laser rangefinder. This allows hunter/killer operations with a common engagement sequence. An optional servo-controlled overhead weapons platform can be slaved to the commander's sight to allow operation independent from the turret. The power pack has been replaced by a new EuroPowerPack with a transversely mounted MTU MT883 diesel engine coupled to Renk HSWL 295TM automatic transmission. The increase in both vehicle performance and durability is significant. The smaller volume but more powerful Europowerpack power pack additionally incorporates as standard a cooling system and air- intake filtration system proved in desert use. The free space in the hull is available for ammunition stowage or for fuel, increasing the vehicle's range to . This powerpack was previously installed on the French Leclerc tanks delivered to the UAE as well as the recovery tank version of the Leclerc in service with the French Army. Further developed versions of the Europowerpack have more recently been installed in the latest serial produced Korean K2 Black Panther tank as well as the new Turkish ALTAY tank. BAES announced in 2005 that development and export marketing of 2E would stop. This has been linked by the media to the failure of the 2E to be selected for the Hellenic Army in 2002, a competition won by the Leopard 2. = CRARRV = CRARRV on display at Salisbury Plain The Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle (CRARRV) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the Challenger 1 hull (with the updated Challenger 2 powertrain) and designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield. It has five seats but usually carries a crew of three soldiers from the Royal Electrical And Mechanical Engineers (REME), of the recovery mechanic and vehicle mechanic/technician trades. There is room in the cabin for two further passengers (e.g. crew members of the casualty vehicle) on a temporary basis. The size and performance are similar to the MBT, but instead of armament it is fitted with: * A main winch with 50 tonnes- force pull in a 1:1 configuration or 98 tonnes-force pull using an included pulley in a 2:1 configuration and anchor point on the vehicle, plus a small auxiliary winch to aid in deploying the main winch rope. * Atlas crane capable of lifting at a distance of (this is sufficient to lift a Challenger 2 power pack). * In order to improve flexibility and supplement the transportation of power packs around the battlefield, the British Army procured a quantity of dedicated CRARRV High Mobility Trailers (CRARRV HMT). Each CRARRV HMT enables a CRARRV to transport a single (Challenger, Titan or Trojan) power pack or two Warrior power packs, by altering the configuration of dedicated fixtures and attachment of fittings. * Dozer blade to use as an earth anchor/stabiliser, or in obstacle clearance and fire position preparation. * Large set of recovery and heavy repair tools including a man-portable ultrathermic cutting system with an underwater cutting capability and a man-portable welder. The design prototype is on display at The REME Museum at MoD Lyneham, Wiltshire.

The tank was firing 120 mm practice shells with a standard propellant charge. The explosion critically injured the four-man crew, with two later dying of their wounds in hospital. The incident resulted in all British Army tank firing exercises being suspended for 48 hours while the cause of the explosion was investigated. The extent of the damage to the tank, if any, is unknown. It was later determined that a bolt vent axial (BVA) seal assembly had been removed during an earlier exercise and had yet to be replaced at the time of the incident, thus allowing explosive gases to enter the turret space; the lack of a written process for removal and replacement of the seal assembly meant that the crew at the time of the incident was unaware of its absence, and it was also noted that inadequate consideration had been given during the production of the L30 gun as to whether it could be fired without the seal assembly. A second explosion that occurred during the incident was attributed to the detonation of bag charges that had been stowed outside of the internal ammunition bins (rather than inside the bins as per correct procedure).

Reggae is especially popular through the international fame of Bob Marley. Jamaican music's influence on music styles in other countries includes the practice of toasting, which was brought to New York City and evolved into rapping. British genres such as Lovers rock, jungle music and grime are also influenced by Jamaican music. Mento Mento is a style of Jamaican music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box‚Äîa large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music. Lord Flea and Count Lasher are two of the more successful mento artists. Well-known mento songs include Day-O, Jamaica Farewell and Linstead Market. Mento is often confused with calypso, a musical form from Trinidad and Tobago. Calypso As in many Anglo-Caribbean Caribbean islands, the calypso music of Trinidad & Tobago has become part of the culture of Jamaica. Jamaica's own local music mento is often confused with calypso music. Although the two share many similarities, they are separate and distinct musical forms. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently referred to as calypso, kalypso and mento calypso; mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques. As in calypso, mento uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues. Sexual innuendos are also common. The Trinidadian calypso and soca music are popular in Jamaica. Popular calypso/soca artists from Jamaica include Byron Lee, Fab 5, and Lovindeer. Harry Belafonte (born in the U.S., raised in Jamaica from age 5 to 13) introduced American audiences to calypso music (which had originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 20th century), and Belafonte was dubbed the \\"King of Calypso\\". Jazz From early in the 20th century, Jamaica produced many notable jazz musicians. In this development the enlightened policy of the Alpha Boys School in Kingston, which provided training and encouragement in music education for its pupils, was very influential. Also significant was the brass band tradition of the island, strengthened by opportunities for musical work and training in military contexts. However, limited scope for making a career playing jazz in Jamaica resulted in many local jazz musicians leaving the island to settle in London or in the United States. Among the most notable Jamaican jazz instrumentalists who made successful careers abroad was alto saxophonist Joe Harriott, now regarded internationally as one of the most original and innovative of jazz composers. Also internationally successful were trumpeters Dizzy Reece, Leslie 'Jiver' Hutchinson and Leslie Thompson, bassist Coleridge Goode, guitarist Ernest Ranglin and pianist Monty Alexander. Harriott, Goode, Hutchinson and Thompson built their careers in London, along with many other instrumentalists, such as pianist Yorke de Souza and the outstanding saxophonist Bertie King, who later returned to Jamaica and formed a mento- style band. Reece and Alexander worked in the US. Saxophonist Wilton 'Bogey' Gaynair settled in Germany working mainly with Kurt Edelhagen's orchestra. Ska Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. The first ever ska recording was made by Count Ossie, a Nyabhingi drummer from the rasta community.Dave Thompson (2002) Reggae and Caribbean Music. Backbeat Books. p. 261. . It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave), the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave) and the third wave ska movement, which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s. The recent revival of Jamaican Jazz attempts to bring back the sound of early Jamaican music artists of the late 1950s. DJs and toasting Along with the rise of ska came the popularity of deejays such as Sir Lord Comic, King Stitt and pioneer Count Matchuki, who began talking stylistically over the rhythms of popular songs at sound systems. In Jamaican music, the Deejay is the one who talks (known elsewhere as the MC) and the selector is the person who chooses the records. The popularity of Deejays as an essential component of the sound system, and created a need for instrumental songs, as well as instrumental versions of popular vocal songs. Toasting is a type of lyrical chanting over the beat. While Dancehall music involves deejays, they are the ones chanting or humming over the rhythm or track. With the rise of many different genres, toasting became popular in Jamaica during the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1960s, producers such as King Tubby and Lee Perry began stripping the vocals away from tracks recorded for sound system parties. With the bare beats and bass playing and the lead instruments dropping in and out of the mix, Deejays began toasting, or delivering humorous and often provoking jabs at fellow deejays and local celebrities. Over time, toasting became an increasingly complex activity, and became as big a draw as the dance beats played behind it. The basic elements of hip-hop‚Äîboasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and political commentary‚Äîwere all present in Trinidadian music referred to as Extempo Wars as long ago as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 30s. Calypso like other forms of music continued to evolve through the 50s and 60s. When rocksteady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso's example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved back and forth between the predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, 'conscious' style. Rocksteady Rocksteady was the music of Jamaica's rude boys by the mid-1960s, when The Wailers and The Clarendonians dominated the charts. Desmond Dekker's \\"007\\" brought international attention to the new genre. The mix put heavy emphasis on the bass line, as opposed to ska's strong horn section, and the rhythm guitar began playing on the upbeat. Session musicians like Supersonics, Soul Vendors, Jets and Jackie Mittoo (of the Skatalites) became popular during this period. Reggae Reggae is one of few music genres first created in Jamaica. In the late 1960s, around the same time of toasting, reggae began to expand and infiltrate the ears and bodies of countless Jamaicans. The genre stems from early Ska and Rocksteady, but also has its own style of Jamaican authenticity, speaking about life ups and downs. Bob Marley is the most renowned reggae entrepreneur and still considers to have hits today. In the late 1960s reggae emerged as a reinterpretation of American rhythm and blues. Reggae became popular around the world, due in large part to the international success of artists like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Marley was viewed as a Rastafarian messianic figure by some fans, particularly throughout the Caribbean, Africa, and among Native Americans and Australian Aborigines. His lyrics about love, redemption and natural beauty captivated audiences, and he gained headlines for negotiating truces between the two opposing Jamaican political parties (at the One Love Concert), led by Michael Manley (PNP) and Edward Seaga. Dub By 1973, dub music had emerged as a distinct reggae genre, and heralded the dawn of the remix. Developed by record producers such as Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and King Tubby, dub featured previously recorded songs remixed with prominence on the bass. Often the lead instruments and vocals would drop in and out of the mix, sometimes processed heavily with studio effects. King Tubby's advantage came from his intimate knowledge with audio gear, and his ability to build his own sound systems and recording studios that were superior to the competition. He became famous for his remixes of recordings made by others, as well as those he recorded in his own studio. Other 1970s developments Other popular music forms that arose during the 1970s include: Briton (Linton Kwesi Johnson's dub poetry); Sly & Robbie's rockers reggae, which drew on Augustus Pablo's melodica, becoming popular with artists such as The Mighty Diamonds and The Gladiators; Joe Gibbs' mellower rockers reggae, including music by Culture and Dennis Brown; Burning Spear's distinctive style, as represented by the albums Marcus Garvey and Man in the Hills; and harmonic, spiritually oriented Rasta music like that of The Abyssinians, Black Uhuru and Third World. In 1975, Louisa Mark had a hit with \\"Caught You in a Lie\\", beginning a trend of British performers making romantic, ballad-oriented reggae called lovers rock. Reggae and ska had a massive influence on British punk rock and new wave bands of the 1970s, such as The Clash, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, The Police, The Slits, and The Ruts. Ska revival bands such as The Specials, Madness and The Selecter developed the 2 Tone genre. Dancehall and ragga During the 1980s, the most popular music styles in Jamaica were dancehall and ragga. Dancehall is essentially speechifying with musical accompaniment, including a basic drum beat (most often played on electric drums). The lyrics moved away from the political and spiritual lyrics popular in the 1970s and concentrate more on less serious issues. Ragga is characterized by the use of computerized beats and sequenced melodic tracks. Ragga is usually said to have been invented with the song \\"Under Mi Sleng Teng\\" by Wayne Smith. Ragga barely edged out dancehall as the dominant form of Jamaican music in the 1980s. DJ Shabba Ranks and vocalist team Chaka Demus and Pliers proved more enduring than the competition, and helped inspire an updated version of the rude boy culture called raggamuffin. Dancehall was sometimes violent in lyrical content, and several rival performers made headlines with their feuds across Jamaica (most notably Beenie Man versus Bounty Killer). Dancehall emerged from pioneering recordings in the late 1970s by Barrington Levy, with Roots Radics backing and Junjo Lawes as producer. The Roots Radics were the pre-eminent backing band for the dancehall style. Yellowman, Ini Kamoze, Charlie Chaplin and General Echo helped popularize the style along with producers like Sugar Minott. The 1980s saw a rise in reggae music from outside of Jamaica. During this time, reggae particularly influenced African popular music, where Sonny Okusuns, John Chibadura, Lucky Dube and Alpha Blondy became stars. The 1980s saw the end of the dub era in Jamaica, although dub has remained a popular and influential style in the UK, and to a lesser extent throughout Europe and the US. Dub in the 1980s and 1990s has merged with electronic music. The late 2000s saw large local success for dancehall artists like Popcaan, Vybz Kartel, Konshens, Mr. Vegas and Mavado. In the next decade, others artists such as Tommy Lee Sparta, Alkaline, Cashtro Troy, and Insideeus would also rise to the dancehall scene. By the late 2010s, music in Western markets saw influences of dancehall in pop music, including Drake's \\"One Dance\\" and \\"Controlla\\" (2016) and Rihanna's \\"Work\\" (2016). Reggae fusion Reggae fusion emerged as a popular subgenre in the late 1990s. It is a mixture of reggae or dancehall with elements of other genres such as hip hop, R&B;, jazz, rock 'n roll or indie rock. It is closely related to ragga music. It originated in Jamaica, North America and Europe. Reggae fusion artists from Jamaica with a #1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 hit include Ini Kamoze with \\"Here Comes the Hotstepper\\" in 1994, Super Cat (featured on Sugar Ray's song \\"Fly\\"), Shaggy (2 #1 hits, like \\"Angel\\"), Rikrok (featured on Shaggy's song \\"It Wasn't Me\\"), Sean Paul (3 #1 hits, like \\"Get Busy\\"), Sean Kingston with \\"Beautiful Girls\\" in 2007, and OMI (singer) with \\"Cheerleader\\" in 2015. All are from Kingston, except Ini Kamoze, Rikrok, and OMI. Non-Rastafarian Jamaican religious music The Bongo Nation is a distinct group of Jamaicans possibly descended from the Congo. They are known for Kumina, which refers to both a religion and a form of music. Kumina's distinctive drumming style became one of the roots of Rastafarian drumming, itself the source of the distinctive Jamaican rhythm heard in ska, rocksteady and reggae. The modern intertwining of Jamaican religion and music can be traced back to the 1860s, when the Pocomania and Revival Zion churches drew on African traditions, and incorporated music into almost every facet of worship. Later, this trend spread into Hindu communities, resulting in baccra music. The spread of Rastafari into urban Jamaica in the 1960s transformed the Jamaican music scene, which incorporated drumming (played at grounation ceremonies) and which has led to today's popular music. Many of the above- mentioned music and dance have been styliled by Prof. Rex Nettleford artistic director (ret, prof and vice chancellor of The University of the West Indies) and Marjorie Whyle Musical Director (Caribbean Musicologist, pianist, drummer, arranger lecturer at the University of the West Indies). Since 1962, this volunteer company of dancers and musicians have had many of these dances in its core repertoire and have performed worldwide to large audiences, including The British Royal family. Other developments Other trends included minimalist digital tracks, which began with Dave Kelly's \\"Pepper Seed\\" in 1995, alongside the return of love balladeers like Beres Hammond. American, British, and European electronic musicians used reggae-oriented beats to create further hybrid electronic music styles. Dub, world music, and electronic music continue to influence music in the 2000s. One of the latest developments is a musical form called Linguay which was founded by record producer Lissant Folkes in 2013. JaFolk Mix is a term coined by Jamaican musician Joy Fairclough, to mean the mix of Jamaican Folk Music with any foreign and local styles of music and the evolution of a new sound created by their fusion. This is the latest Jamaican Music stylistic development of the late 20th century and 21st century. Jamaican music continues to influence the world's music. Many efforts at studying and copying Jamaican music has introduced the world to this new form of music as the copied styles are performed with accents linguistically and musically slanted to that of the home nation in which it is being studied, copied and performed.

Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: mycology, phycology, microbiology and botany. Scholars of lichenology are known as lichenologists. History =The beginnings= Lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times. Several species have appeared in the works of Dioscorides, Pliny the Elder and Theophrastus although the studies are not very deep. During the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored.Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). A Popular History of British Lichens p. 22 For centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a French researcher Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in his Institutiones Rei Herbariae grouped them into their own genus. He adopted the Latin term lichen, which had already been used by Pliny who had imported it from Theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed.Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). A Popular History of British Lichens p. 23 The original meaning of the Greek word ŒªŒµŒπœáŒÆŒΩ (leichen) was moss that in its turn derives from the Greek verb ŒªŒµŒØœáœâ (liekho) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water. In its original use the term signified mosses, liverworts as well as lichens. Some forty years later Dillenius in his Historia Muscorum made the first division of the group created by Tournefort separating the sub-families Usnea, Coralloides and Lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus. After the revolution in taxonomy brought in by Linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the Plant Kingdom forming a single group Lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus.Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). A Popular History of British Lichens. p. 24. The taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius (1757‚Äì1819), who is therefore sometimes named the \\"father of lichenology\\". Acharius was a student of Carl Linnaeus. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are: * Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus (1798) * Methodus lichenum (1803) * Lichenographia universalis (1810) * Synopsis methodica lichenum (1814) Lichen on rocks Evernia prunastri, oakmoss Later lichenologists include the American scientists Vernon Ahmadjian and Edward Tuckerman and the Russian evolutionary biologist Konstantin Merezhkovsky, as well as amateurs such as Louisa Collings. Over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants. A controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction. In these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of Linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs, as in other plants, independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred. Other researchers only considered asexual reproduction by means of Propagules.Lauder Lindsay, William. A Popular History of British Lichens. p. 25. =19th century= Against this background appeared the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius disciple of Linnaeus, who is today considered the father of lichenology, starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering study of Swedish lichens in Lichenographiae Suecicae Prodromus of 1798 or in his Synopsis Methodica Lichenum, Sistens omnes hujus Ordinis Naturalis of 1814. These studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations. In these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as Lichenographia Europaea Reformata published in 1831 by Elias Fries or Enumeratio Critico Lichenum Europaeorum 1850 by Ludwig Schaererhttp://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000391348?history=true in Germany.Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). A Popular History of British Lichens. p. 27. Erik Acharius (1757‚Äì1819), Swedish botanist, the father of lichenology But these works suffer from being superficial and mere lists of species without further physiological studies. It took until the middle of the 19th century for research to catch up using biochemical and physiological methods. In Germany Ernst Itzigsohn and Johann Bayrhoffer, in France Edmond Tulasne and Camille Montagne, in Russia Fedor Buhse, in England William Allport Leighton and in the United States Edward Tuckerman began to publish works of great scientific importance. Scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens. In the French publication Annales des Sciences Naturelles in an article of 1852 \\"Memorie pour servir a l'Histoire des Lichens Organographique et Physiologique\\" by Edmond Tulasne, the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified.Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). A Popular History of British Lichens. p. 23. These new discoveries were becoming increasingly contradictory for scientists. The apothecium reproductive organ being unique to fungi but absent in other photosynthetic organisms. With improvements in microscopy, algae were identified in the lichen structure, which heightened the contradictions. At first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus. That the algae continued to multiply showed that they were not mere contaminants. It was Anton de Bary a German mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others. Successive studies such as those carried out by Andrei Famintsyn and Baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus. It was in 1869 that Simon Schwendener demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature. This researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component. In 1873 Jean- Baptiste Edouard Bornet concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely symbiotic. It was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen phenotypes. French botanist (Jean-Baptiste) √âdouard Bornet (1828‚Äì1911) =20th century= In 1909 the Russian lichenologist Konstantin Mereschkowski presented a research paper \\"The Theory of two Plasms as the basis of Symbiogenesis, A new study on the Origin of Organisms\\", which aims to explain a new theory of Symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work \\"Nature and Origin of Chromatophores in the Plant Kingdom\\". These new ideas can be studied today under the title of the Theory of Endosymbiosis. Despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the Swiss researcher Eugen A ThomasSpecies:Eugen A. Thomas was able to reproduce in the laboratory the phenotype of the lichen Cladonia pyxidata by combining its two identified components. During the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens. On the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms. There appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology Henry Nicollon des Abbayes, William Alfred Weber, Antonina Georgievna Borissova, Irwin M. Brodo, George Albert Llano. Lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them. Age dating in this way can be absolute or relative because the growth of these organisms can be arrested under various conditions. The technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied. Miguel Mateo Garcia, The Growth Curve of Rhizocarpon geographicum in the Valley of Madriu Andorra, Biophysical Processes in Cold Media Lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an epilithic lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by Roland Beschel in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years. Growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15‚Äì50 mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2‚Äì4 mm per year. The difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens. In 1982 the International Association for Lichenology convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee. The chairman of this committee was the renowned researcher Vernon Ahmadjian. The definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure.David L. Hawksworth (1989) \\"Interactions Fungus and Alga in Lichen Symbiosis liquenoides\\" Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid (46). Such a simple a priori definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments. For example, David L. Hawksworth considered the definition imperfect because it is impossible to determine which one thallus is of a specific structure since thalli changed depending upon the substrate and conditions in which they developed. This researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism. Today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields. Especially important are studies on environmental quality that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment. Lichen is extremely sensitive to various air pollutants, especially to sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain and prevents water absorption. K S Merezhkovsky Russian Lichenologist (1855‚Äì1921) Lichens in pharmacology Although several species of lichen have been used in traditional medicine it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with antibacterial action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to medicine Mike Crockett, Stacie Kageyama, Delfina Homen, Carrie Lewis, Jane Osborn, Logan Sander (2003). \\"Antibacterial Properties of four Pacific North West Lichens\\". From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted microbiologist Rufus Paul Burkholder who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus Usnea against Bacillus subtilis and Sarcina lutea. Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was usnic acid. Something similar occurred with the substance Ramelina synthesised by the lichen Ramalina reticulata, nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol, usnic acid etc.Bustinza, Francisco (1948) \\"Contribution to the Study of Antibiotics Produced by Lichens\\". Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid (7) ISSN pp. 511‚Äì548. Interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of World War II along with the growing interest in all antibiotic substances. In 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of Cetraria islandica and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be d-protolichosteric acid and d-1-usnic acid.Bustinza, Francisco (1951) \\"Contribution to the Study of Antibacterial Activity in Cetraria islandica\\". Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid (10) ISSN pp. 144‚Äì149. Further investigations have identified novel antibacterial substances, Alectosarmentin or Atranorin. Antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial proteins with a subsequent loss of bacterial metabolic capacity. This is possible due to the action of lichen phenolics such as usnic acid derivatives.Neli Kika Honda & Wagner Vilegas (1998) \\"The Chemistry of Lichens\\" (Port) Quimica Nova 22(1) ISSN 0100-4042 From the 1950s the lichen product usnic acid was the object of most antitumour research. These studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens Peltigera leucophlebia and Collema flaccidum. Recent work in the field of applied biochemistry has shown some antiviral activity with some lichen substances.

Biography Little is known of Peuerbach's life before he enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1446. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1448. His curriculum was most likely composed primarily of humanities courses, as was usual at the time. His knowledge of astronomy probably derived from independent study, as there were no professors of astronomy at the University of Vienna during Peuerbach's enrollment. From 1448 to 1451 Peuerbach traveled through central and southern Europe, most notably in Italy, giving lectures on astronomy. His lectures led to offers of professorships at several universities, including those at Bologna and Padua. During this time he also met Italian astronomer Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara. He returned to the University of Vienna in 1453, earned his Masters of Arts, and began lecturing on Latin poetry. In 1454 Peuerbach was appointed court astrologer to King Ladislas V of Bohemia and Hungary. It was in this capacity that Peuerbach first met Ladislas' cousin Frederick who was then serving as guardian to the 14-year-old king and who would later become Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. Ladislas resided primarily in Prague and Vienna, allowing Peuerbach to maintain his position at the University of Vienna. During this time Peuerbach met Johannes M√ºller von K√∂nigsberg, better known as Regiomontanus. M√ºller was currently a student at the university and, after he graduated in 1452 at the age of 15, began collaborating extensively with Peuerbach in his astronomical work. In 1457, following the assassination of two notable political figures, Ladislas fled Vienna and died later that year. Rather than taking of service with either of Ladislas' successors, Peuerbach accepted an appointment as court astrologer to Frederick III. Work One of Peuerbach's best known works is his Theoricae Novae Planetarum (written in 1454, published by Regiomontanus in 1472).\\"The Early Manuscripts of Georg von Peuerbach's Theoricae Novae Planetarum\\" It began as a series of lectures transcribed by Regiomontanus. The Theoricae Novae Planetarum was an attempt to present Ptolemaic astronomy in a more elementary and comprehensible way. The book was very successful, replacing the older Theorica Planetarum Communis, sometimes attributed to a certain Gerardus Cremonensis, as the standard university text on astronomy and was studied by many later-influential astronomers including Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler. In 1457 Peuerbach observed an eclipse and noted that it had occurred 8 minutes earlier than had been predicted by the Alphonsine Tables, the best available eclipse tables at the time. He then computed his own set of eclipse tables, the Tabulae Eclipsium. Widely read in manuscript form beginning around 1459 and formally published in 1514, these tables remained highly influential for many years. Peuerbach wrote various papers on practical mathematics, and constructed various astronomical instruments. Most notably, he computed sine tables based on techniques developed by Arabian mathematicians. In 1460, Cardinal Johannes Bessarion, while visiting Frederick's court seeking assistance in a crusade to reclaim Constantinople from the Turks, proposed that Peuerbach and Regiomontanus create a new translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from the original Greek. Bessarion thought that a shorter and more clearly written version of the work would make a suitable teaching text. Peuerbach accepted the task and worked on it with Regiomontanus until his death in 1461, at which time 6 volumes had been completed. Regiomontanus completed the project, the final version containing 13 volumes. Notes References ;Attribution *  Further reading  *Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit.

As of October 2019, he was listed by Forbes magazine as the fourth-wealthiest person in the United States and as the sixth-wealthiest in the world, with a fortune of $69.1 billion, increased from $54.5 billion in 2018. Early life and education Larry Ellison was born in New York City, to an unwed Jewish mother. His biological father was an Italian-American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48. Ellison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chose the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression. Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: \\"While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff.\\" At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration.Symonds and Ellison, pp. 19‚Äì20. Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector. Ellison attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and was enrolled as a premed student. At Illinois, he was named science student of the year but later withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year, because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California, he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, studying physics and mathematics. He did not take any exams and at Chicago he first encountered computer design. In 1966, aged 22, he moved to Berkeley, California. Early career and Oracle Larry Ellison lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010 While working at Ampex in the early 1970s, he became influenced by Edgar F. Codd's research on relational database design, which led in 1977 to the formation of what became Oracle. Oracle became a successful database vendor to mid- and low-range systems, later competing with Sybase (created 1984) and Microsoft SQL Server (a port of Sybase created in 1989) which led to Ellison being listed by Forbes as one of the richest men in the world. = 1977‚Äì1994 = During the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His projects included a database for the CIA, which he named \\"Oracle\\". Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called \\"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\\". In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his. In 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc., and in 1983, officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product, the Oracle Database. Ellison had heard about the IBM System R database, also based on Codd's theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R's code. The initial release of Oracle in 1979 was called Oracle 2; there was no Oracle 1. In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money. This crisis, which almost resulted in the company's bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle's \\"up-front\\" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made \\"an incredible business mistake\\". Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its DB2 and SQL/DS database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on Unix and Windows operating systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle, Informix, and eventually Microsoft to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers. Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor, but soon it fell victim to merger mania. Sybase's 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name \\"SQL Server\\". In his early years at Oracle, Larry Ellison was named an Award Recipient in the High Technology Category for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Program. = 1994‚Äì2010 = Ellison in 2009 In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front-page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and IBM absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of Apple Computer after Steve Jobs returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002. With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM's acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their DB2 database. Oracle's main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems comes from IBM's DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's DB2 still dominates the mainframe database market. In 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100. In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100. In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $84,598,700, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $10,779,000, no stock grants, and options granted of $71,372,700. In the year ending May 31, 2009, he made $56.8 million. In 2006, Forbes ranked him as the richest Californian. In April 2009, after a tug-of-war with IBM and Hewlett- Packard, Oracle announced its intent to buy Sun Microsystems. On July 2, 2009, for the fourth year in a row, Oracle's board awarded Ellison another 7 million stock options. On August 22, 2009, it was reported that Ellison would be paid only $1 for his base salary for the fiscal year of 2010, down from the $1,000,000 he was paid in fiscal 2009. = 2010‚Äìpresent = The European Union approved Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 21, 2010, and agreed that Oracle's acquisition of Sun \\"has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative products\\". The Sun acquisition also gave Oracle control of the popular MySQL open source database, which Sun had acquired in 2008. On August 9, 2010, Ellison denounced Hewlett-Packard's board for firing CEO Mark Hurd, writing that \\"the HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.\\" (Ellison and Hurd are close personal friends.) Then on September 6, Oracle hired Mark Hurd as co-president alongside Safra Catz. Ellison remained in his current role at Oracle. In March 2010, the Forbes list of billionaires ranked Ellison as the sixth-richest person in the world and as the third-richest American, with an estimated net worth of US$28 billion. On July 27, 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison was the best-paid executive in the last decade, collecting a total compensation of US$1.84 billion. In September 2011, Ellison was listed on the Forbes list of billionaires as the fifth richest man in the world and was still the third richest American, with a net worth of about $36.5 billion. In September 2012, Ellison was again listed on the Forbes list of billionaires as the third richest American citizen, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $44 billion. In October 2012, he was listed just behind David Hamilton Koch as the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison owns stakes in Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Quark Biotechnology Inc. and Astex Pharmaceuticals. In June 2012, Ellison agreed to buy 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lana'i from David Murdock's company, Castle & Cooke. The price was reported to be between $500 million and $600 million. In 2005, Ellison agreed to settle a four-year-old insider- trading lawsuit by offering to pay $100 million to charity in Oracle's name. In 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal, Ellison earned $94.6 million. On September 18, 2014, Ellison appointed Mark Hurd to CEO of Oracle from his former position as President; Safra Catz was also made CEO, moving from her former role as CFO. Ellison assumed the positions of chief technology officer and executive chairman. In November 2016, Oracle bought NetSuite for $9.3 billion. Ellison owned 35% of NetSuite at the time of the purchase making him $3.5 billion personally. In 2017, Forbes estimated that Ellison was the 4th richest person in tech. In June 2018, Ellison's net worth was about $54.5 billion, according to Forbes. In December 2018, Ellison became a director on the board of Tesla, Inc. As of December 31, 2019, Ellison owns 36.2% of the shares of Oracle Corporation. As of June 2020, Ellison is said to be the seventh wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $66.8 billion. Personal life Ellison has been married and divorced four times:Symonds and Ellison, pp. 57, 64‚Äì65, 84, 310, 337‚Äì42, 348‚Äì54. * Adda Quinn from 1967 to 1974. * Nancy Wheeler Jenkins from 1977 to 1978. They married six months before Ellison founded Software Development Laboratories. In 1978, the couple divorced. Wheeler gave up any claim on her husband's company for $500. * Barbara Boothe from 1983 to 1986. Boothe was a former receptionist at Relational Software Inc. (RSI). They had two children, David and Megan, who are film producers at Skydance Media and Annapurna Pictures, respectively. * Melanie Craft, a romance novelist, from 2003 to 2010. They married on December 18, 2003, at his Woodside estate. Ellison's friend Steve Jobs, former CEO and co-founder of Apple Inc., was the official wedding photographer, and Representative Tom Lantos officiated. They divorced in 2010. Ellison made a brief cameo appearance in the 2010 movie Iron Man 2. In 2010, Ellison purchased a 50% share of the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament. Ellison owns many exotic cars, including an Audi R8 and a McLaren F1. His favorite is the Acura NSX, which he was known to give as gifts each year during its production. Ellison is also reportedly the owner of a Lexus LFA. =Yachts= In 2010, Ellison ended his ownership of the 12th largest yacht in the world, named Rising Sun. He sold his remaining shares in the yacht to music and film mogul David Geffen. Rising Sun is long, and reportedly cost over $200million to build. He downsized to Musashi, a yacht built by Feadship. =Yacht racing= Ellison competes in yachting through Oracle Team USA. Following success racing Maxi yachts, Ellison founded BMW Oracle Racing to compete for the 2003 Louis Vuitton Cup. In 2002, Ellison's Oracle's team introduced kite yachting into the America's Cup environment. Kite sail flying lasting about 30 minutes was achieved during testing in New Zealand. BMW Oracle Racing was the \\"Challenger of Record\\" on behalf of the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco for the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, Spain, until eliminated from the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup challenger-selection series in the semi-finals. On February 14, 2010, Ellison's yacht USA 17 won the second race (in the best of three \\"deed of gift\\" series) of the 33rd America's Cup, after winning the first race two days earlier. Securing a historic victory, Ellison and his BMW Oracle team became the first challengers to win a \\"deed of gift\\" match. The Cup returned to American shores for the first time since 1995. Ellison served as a crew member in the second race. Previously, Ellison had filed several legal challenges, through the Golden Gate Yacht Club, against the way that Ernesto Bertarelli (also one of the world's richest men) proposed to organize the 33rd America's Cup following the 2007 victory of Bertarelli's team Alinghi. The races were finally held in February 2010 in Valencia. On September 25, 2013, Ellison's Oracle Team USA defeated Emirates Team New Zealand to win the 34th America's Cup in San Francisco Bay, California. Oracle Team USA had been penalized two points in the final for cheating by some team members during the America's Cup World Series warm-up events. The Oracle team came from a 1‚Äì8 deficit to win 9‚Äì8, in what has been called \\"one of the greatest comebacks in sports history\\". Oracle Racing lost the 2017 America's Cup to Team New Zealand. In 2019, Ellison, in conjunction with Russell Coutts, started the SailGP international racing series. The series used F50 foiling catamarans, the fastest class of boat in history with regattas held across the globe. Ellison committed to five years of funding to support the series until it could become self sustaining. The first season was successful with global audiences of over 1.8 billion. =Aviation= Ellison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft. He was cited by the city of San Jose, California, for violating its limits on late-night takeoffs and landings from San Jose Mineta International Airport by planes weighing more than 75,000 pounds (34,019 kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his Gulfstream V aircraft \\"is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it.\\" US District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled in Ellison's favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison's jet, but did not invalidate the curfew. Ellison also owns at least two military jets: a SIAI-Marchetti S.211, a training aircraft designed in Italy, and a decommissioned MiG-29, which the US government has refused him permission to import. =Tennis= In 2009, Larry purchased the Indian Wells Tennis Garden tennis facility in California's Coachella Valley and the Indian Wells Masters tournament, both of which he still owns. =Homes= Ellison styled his estimated $110 million Woodside, California, estate after feudal Japanese architecture, complete with a man- made lake and an extensive seismic retrofit. In 2004 and 2005 he purchased more than 12 properties in Malibu, California, worth more than $180 million. The $65 million Ellison spent on five contiguous lots at Malibu's Carbon Beach made this the most costly residential transaction in United States history until Ron Perelman sold his Palm Beach, Florida, compound for $70 million later that same year. His entertainment system cost $1 million, and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool, using the gaping hole as a giant subwoofer. In early 2010, Ellison purchased the Astor's Beechwood Mansion ‚Äì formerly the summer home of the Astor family ‚Äì in Newport, Rhode Island, for $10.5 million. In 2011 he purchased the 249-acre Porcupine Creek Estate and private golf course in Rancho Mirage, California, for $42.9 million. The property was formerly the home of Yellowstone Club founders Edra and Tim Blixseth, and was sold to Ellison by creditors following their divorce and bankruptcy. On June 21, 2012, the governor of Hawaii, Neil Abercrombie, declared that Ellison had signed an agreement to buy most of the island of Lanai from the Castle & Cooke company, owned by David H. Murdock. Following the purchase Ellison owns 98% of Lanai, Hawaii's sixth-largest island. =Philanthropy= In 1992 Ellison shattered his elbow in a high-speed bicycle crash. After receiving treatment at University of California, Davis, Ellison donated $5 million to seed the Lawrence J. Ellison Musculo-Skeletal Research Center. In 1998, the Lawrence J. Ellison Ambulatory Care Center opened on the Sacramento campus of the UC Davis Medical Center. To settle an insider trading lawsuit arising from his selling nearly $1 billion of Oracle stock, a court allowed Ellison to donate $100 million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison's legal fees of $24 million. Ellison's lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to Stanford University raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case's merits for Oracle.In Re Oracle Corp. Derivative Litigation (824 A.2d 917 (2003)) In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, Ellison made a controversial offer to donate software to the federal government that would have enabled it to build and run a national identification database and to issue ID cards.Compare: Forbes 2004 list of charitable donations made by the wealthiest 400 Americans stated that Ellison had donated $151,092,103, about 1% of his estimated personal wealth. In June 2006, Ellison announced he would not honor his earlier pledge of $115 million to Harvard University, claiming it was due to the departure of former President Lawrence Summers. Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne announced, \\"It was really Larry Summers' brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered ... [I]t was Larry Ellison and Larry Summers that had initially come up with this notion.\\" In 2007 Ellison pledged $500,000 to fortify a community centre in Sderot, Israel, after discovering that the building was not fortified against rocket attacks. Other charitable donations by Ellison include a $10 million donation to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2014. In 2017 Ellison donated $16.6 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. His donation was intended to support the construction of well-being facilities on a new campus for co-ed conscripts.Record $53.8 million raised for IDF soldiers at Beverly Hills gala, November 5, 2017, Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In August 2010 a report listed Ellison as one of the 40 billionaires who had signed \\"The Giving Pledge\\". In May 2016 Ellison donated $200 million to the University of Southern California for establishing a cancer research center: the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC. Political involvement Ellison (right) with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2020 Ellison was critical of NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, saying that \\"Snowden had yet to identify a single person who had been 'wrongly injured' by the NSA's data collection\\". He has donated to both Democratic and Republican politicians, and in late 2014 hosted Republican Senator Rand Paul at a fundraiser at his home. Ellison was one of the top donors to Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC supporting Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential bid. As of February 2016, Ellison had given $4 million overall to the PAC. In 2020, Ellison hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump at his Rancho Mirage estate.

","title":"Larry Ellison"},{"id":"172396","text":"A tree covered with leafy foliose lichens and shrubby fruticose lichens A lichen ( or, sometimes in the UK, , ) is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship.Introduction to Lichens ‚Äì An Alliance between Kingdoms . University of California Museum of Paleontology. Lichens have properties different from those of their component organisms. Lichens come in many colors, sizes, and forms and are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf- like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), a powder-like appearance (leprose), or other growth forms. A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens. Here, \\"macro\\" and \\"micro\\" do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word moss (e.g., \\"reindeer moss\\", \\"Iceland moss\\"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant.Brodo, Irwin M. and Duran Sharnoff, Sylvia (2001) Lichens of North America. . Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do,Sharnoff, Stephen (2014) Field Guide to California Lichens, Yale University Press. but like plants, they produce their own nutrition by photosynthesis. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites, but instead use the plants as a substrate. Lichens occur from sea level to high alpine elevations, in many environmental conditions, and can grow on almost any surface. Lichens are abundant growing on bark, leaves, mosses, on other lichens, and hanging from branches \\"living on thin air\\" (epiphytes) in rain forests and in temperate woodland. They grow on rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces, and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust. Different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. They can even live inside solid rock, growing between the grains. It is estimated that 6% of Earth's land surface is covered by lichens. There are about 20,000 known species of lichens. Some lichens have lost the ability to reproduce sexually, yet continue to speciate. Lichens can be seen as being relatively self- contained miniature ecosystems, where the fungi, algae, or cyanobacteria have the potential to engage with other microorganisms in a functioning system that may evolve as an even more complex composite organism. Lichens may be long- lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living things. They are among the first living things to grow on fresh rock exposed after an event such as a landslide. The long life-span and slow and regular growth rate of some lichens can be used to date events (lichenometry). Pronunciation and etymology In American English, \\"lichen\\" is pronounced the same as the verb \\"liken\\" (). In British English, both this pronunciation and one rhyming with \\"kitchen\\" ) are used.The Oxford English Dictionary cites only the \\"liken\\" pronunciation: English lichen derives from Greek leichƒìn (\\"tree moss, lichen, lichen-like eruption on skin\\") via Latin .. The Greek noun, which literally means \\"licker\\", derives from the verb leichein, \\"to lick\\".. Like the word moss, the word lichen is also used as an uncountable noun, as in, \\"Lichen grows on rocks\\".  Growth forms  Lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms (morphologies). The shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments. The nonreproductive tissues, or vegetative body parts, are called the thallus. Lichens are grouped by thallus type, since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen. Thallus growth forms typically correspond to a few basic internal structure types. Common names for lichens often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen genus. Common groupings of lichen thallus growth forms are: # fruticose ‚Äì growing like a tuft or multiple-branched leafless mini-shrub, upright or hanging down, 3-dimensional branches with nearly round cross section (terete) or flattened # foliose ‚Äì growing in 2-dimensional, flat, leaf-like lobes # crustose ‚Äì crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint # squamulose ‚Äì formed of small leaf-like scales crustose below but free at the tips # leprose ‚Äì powdery # gelatinous ‚Äì jelly-like # filamentous ‚Äì stringy or like matted hair # byssoid ‚Äì wispy, like teased wool # structureless There are variations in growth types in a single lichen species, grey areas between the growth type descriptions, and overlapping between growth types, so some authors might describe lichens using different growth type descriptions. When a crustose lichen gets old, the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint, old- broken asphalt paving, or like the polygonal \\"islands\\" of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed. This is called being rimose or areolate, and the \\"island\\" pieces separated by the cracks are called areolas. The areolas appear separated, but are (or were) connected by an underlying \\"prothallus\\" or \\"hypothallus\\". When a crustose lichen grows from a center and appears to radiate out, it is called crustose placodioid. When the edges of the areolas lift up from the substrate, it is called squamulose. These growth form groups are not precisely defined. Foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose. Fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy. Squamulose lichens may appear where the edges lift up. Gelatinous lichens may appear leafy when dry. Means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below. Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus. The thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is most visually noticeable. Some lichens can grow inside solid rock between the grains (endolithic lichens), with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock. These may be dramatic in color or appearance. Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories.Lichen Vocabulary, Lichens of North America Information, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, The most visually noticeable reproductive parts are often circular, raised, plate-like or disc-like outgrowths, with crinkly edges, and are described in sections below. = Color = Lichens come in many colors. Coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component. Special pigments, such as yellow usnic acid, give lichens a variety of colors, including reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, especially in exposed, dry habitats. In the absence of special pigments, lichens are usually bright green to olive gray when wet, gray or grayish-green to brown when dry. This is because moisture causes the surface skin (cortex) to become more transparent, exposing the green photobiont layer. Different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces, or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors \\"come to life\\" or \\"glow\\" in brilliant displays following rain. Different colored lichens may inhabit different adjacent sections of a rock face, depending on the angle of exposure to light. Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places, such as the vertical \\"paint\\" covering the vast rock faces of Yosemite National Park. Color is used in identification.Michigan Lichens, Julie Jones Medlin, B. Jain Publishers, 1996, , 9780877370390, The color of a lichen changes depending on whether the lichen is wet or dry. Color descriptions used for identification are based on the color that shows when the lichen is dry. Dry lichens with a cyanobacterium as the photosynthetic partner tend to be dark grey, brown, or black. The underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side (dorsiventral), often brown or black, sometimes white. A fruticose lichen may have flattened \\"branches\\", appearing similar to a foliose lichen, but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the same color as the top side. The leaf-like lobes of a foliose lichen may branch, giving the appearance of a fruticose lichen, but the underside will be a different color from the top side. The sheen on some jelly-like gelatinous lichens is created by mucilaginous secretions. = Internal structure and growth forms = The cyanobacterium Hyella caespitosa with fungal hyphae in the lichen Pyrenocollema halodytes A lichen consists of a simple photosynthesizing organism, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium, surrounded by filaments of a fungus. Generally, most of a lichen's bulk is made of interwoven fungal filaments,Lichens: More on Morphology, University of California Museum of Paleontology, although in filamentous and gelatinous lichens this is not the case. The fungus is called a mycobiont. The photosynthesizing organism is called a photobiont. Algal photobionts are called phycobionts.Lichen Photobionts, University of Nebraska Omaha Cyanobacteria photobionts are called cyanobionts. The part of a lichen that is not involved in reproduction, the \\"body\\" or \\"vegetative tissue\\" of a lichen, is called the thallus. The thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately. The thallus is made up of filaments of the fungus called hyphae. The filaments grow by branching then rejoining to create a mesh, which is called being \\"anastomose\\". The mesh of fungal filaments may be dense or loose. Generally, the fungal mesh surrounds the algal or cyanobacterial cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues that are unique to lichen associations. The thallus may or may not have a protective \\"skin\\" of densely packed fungal filaments, often containing a second fungal species, which is called a cortex. Fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the \\"branches\\". Foliose lichens have an upper cortex on the top side of the \\"leaf\\", and a separate lower cortex on the bottom side. Crustose and squamulose lichens have only an upper cortex, with the \\"inside\\" of the lichen in direct contact with the surface they grow on (the substrate). Even if the edges peel up from the substrate and appear flat and leaf-like, they lack a lower cortex, unlike foliose lichens. Filamentous, byssoid, leprose, gelatinous, and other lichens do not have a cortex, which is called being ecorticate. Schematic cross section of foliose lichen: a) The cortex is the outer layer of tightly woven fungus filaments (hyphae) b) This photobiont layer has photosynthesizing green algae c) Loosely packed hyphae in the medulla d) A tightly woven lower cortex e) Anchoring hyphae called rhizines where the fungus attaches to the substrate. Fruticose, foliose, crustose, and squamulose lichens generally have up to three different types of tissue, differentiated by having different densities of fungal filaments. The top layer, where the lichen contacts the environment, is called a cortex. The cortex is made of densely tightly woven, packed, and glued together (agglutinated) fungal filaments. The dense packing makes the cortex act like a protective \\"skin\\", keeping other organisms out, and reducing the intensity of sunlight on the layers below. The cortex layer can be up to several hundred micrometers (Œºm) in thickness (less than a millimeter). The cortex may be further topped by an epicortex of secretions, not cells, 0.6‚Äì1 Œºm thick in some lichens. This secretion layer may or may not have pores. Below the cortex layer is a layer called the photobiontic layer or symbiont layer. The symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments, with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them. The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, similar to the anatomy of a leaf. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by a haustorium. In crustose and foliose lichens, algae in the photobiontic layer are diffuse among the fungal filaments, decreasing in gradation into the layer below. In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below. The layer beneath the symbiont layer called is called the medulla. The medulla is less densely packed with fungal filaments than the layers above. In foliose lichens, there is usually, as in Peltigera, another densely packed layer of fungal filaments called the lower cortex. Root-like fungal structures called rhizines (usually) grow from the lower cortex to attach or anchor the lichen to the substrate. Fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the \\"stems\\" and \\"branches\\". The medulla is the lowest layer, and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus, or it may be hollow. Crustose and squamulose lichens lack a lower cortex, and the medulla is in direct contact with the substrate that the lichen grows on. In crustose areolate lichens, the edges of the areolas peel up from the substrate and appear leafy. In squamulose lichens the part of the lichen thallus that is not attached to the substrate may also appear leafy. But these leafy parts lack a lower cortex, which distinguishes crustose and squamulose lichens from foliose lichens. Conversely, foliose lichens may appear flattened against the substrate like a crustose lichen, but most of the leaf-like lobes can be lifted up from the substrate because it is separated from it by a tightly packed lower cortex. Gelatinous, byssoid, and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are ecorticate), and generally have only undifferentiated tissue, similar to only having a symbiont layer. In lichens that include both green algal and cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called cephalodia. Pruinia is a whitish coating on top of an upper surface. An epinecral layer is \\"a layer of horny dead fungal hyphae with indistinct lumina in or near the cortex above the algal layer\\". In August 2016, it was reported that macrolichens have more than one species of fungus in their tissues. Physiology = Symbiotic relation = A lichen is a composite organism that emerges from algae or cyanobacteria living among the filaments (hyphae) of the fungi in a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. The fungi benefit from the carbohydrates produced by the algae or cyanobacteria via photosynthesis. The algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungi, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it. Although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen, the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners, whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic. However, while symbiotic, the relationship is probably not mutualistic, since the algae give up a disproportionate amount of their sugars (see below). Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the substrate. If a cyanobacterium is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can fix atmospheric nitrogen, complementing the activities of the green alga. In three different lineages the fungal partner has independently lost the mitochondrial gene atp9, which has key functions in mitochondrial energy production. The loss makes the fungi completely dependent on their symbionts. The algal or cyanobacterial cells are photosynthetic and, as in plants, they reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Phycobionts (algae) produce sugar alcohols (ribitol, sorbitol, and erythritol), which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus). Cyanobionts produce glucose. Lichenized fungal cells can make the photobiont \\"leak\\" out the products of photosynthesis, where they can then be absorbed by the fungus. It appears many, probably the majority, of lichen also live in a symbiotic relationship with an order of basidiomycete yeasts called Cyphobasidiales. The absence of this third partner could explain the difficulties of growing lichen in the laboratory. The yeast cells are responsible for the formation of the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus, and could also be important for its shape.Basidiomycete yeasts in the cortex of ascomycete macrolichens ‚Äì Science The lichen combination of alga or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology), physiology, and biochemistry than the component fungus, alga, or cyanobacterium growing by itself, naturally or in culture. The body (thallus) of most lichens is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as a structureless, undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments (hyphae). If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges, in the process called morphogenesis. In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner. Evidence that lichens are examples of successful symbiosis is the fact that lichens can be found in almost every habitat and geographic area on the planet. Two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens, but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen. In a case where one fungal partner simultaneously had two green algae partners that outperform each other in different climates, this might indicate having more than one photosynthetic partner at the same time might enable the lichen to exist in a wider range of habitats and geographic locations. At least one form of lichen, the North American beard-like lichens, are constituted of not two but three symbiotic partners: an ascomycetous fungus, a photosynthetic alga, and, unexpectedly, a basidiomycetous yeast. Phycobionts can have a net output of sugars with only water vapor. The thallus must be saturated with liquid water for cyanobionts to photosynthesize. Algae produce sugars that are absorbed by the fungus by diffusion into special fungal hyphae called appressoria or haustoria in contact with the wall of the algal cells. The appressoria or haustoria may produce a substance that increases permeability of the algal cell walls, and may penetrate the walls. The algae may lose up to 80% of their sugar production to the fungus. =Ecology= Lichen associations may be examples of mutualism, commensalism or even parasitism, depending on the species. There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is parasitic or commensalistic, rather than mutualistic. The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed. The fungus surrounds the algal cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall, forming penetration pegs (haustoria) similar to those produced by pathogenic fungi that feed on a host. Cyanobacteria in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen. Miniature ecosystem and holobiont theory Symbiosis in lichens is so well-balanced that lichens have been considered to be relatively self- contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves. Honegger, R. (1991) Fungal evolution: symbiosis and morphogenesis, Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation, Margulis, L., and Fester, R. (eds). Cambridge, MA, USA: The MIT Press, pp. 319‚Äì340. It is thought that lichens may be even more complex symbiotic systems that include non-photosynthetic bacterial communities performing other functions as partners in a holobiont.Barreno, E., Herrera-Campos, M., Garc√≠a-Breijo, F., Gasulla, F., and Reig-Armi√±ana, J. (2008) \\"Non photosynthetic bacteria associated to cortical structures on Ramalinaand Usnea thalli from Mexico\\". Asilomar, Pacific Grove, CA, USA: Abstracts IAL 6- ABLS Joint Meeting. Many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used to cheaply assess air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have been used in making dyes, perfumes, and in traditional medicines. A few lichen species are eaten by insects or larger animals, such as reindeer. Lichens are widely used as environmental indicators or bio-indicators. When air is very badly polluted with sulphur dioxide, there may be no lichens present; only some green algae can tolerate those conditions. If the air is clean, then shrubby, hairy and leafy lichens become abundant. A few lichen species can tolerate fairly high levels of pollution, and are commonly found in urban areas, on pavements, walls and tree bark. The most sensitive lichens are shrubby and leafy, while the most tolerant lichens are all crusty in appearance. Since industrialisation, many of the shrubby and leafy lichens such as Ramalina, Usnea and Lobaria species have very limited ranges, often being confined to the areas which have the cleanest air. Lichenicolous fungi Some fungi can only be found living on lichens as obligate parasites. These are referred to as lichenicolous fungi, and are a different species from the fungus living inside the lichen; thus they are not considered to be part of the lichen. =Reaction to water= Moisture makes the cortex become more transparent. This way, the algae can conduct photosynthesis when moisture is available, and is protected at other times. When the cortex is more transparent, the algae show more clearly and the lichen looks greener. =Metabolites, metabolite structures and bioactivity= Lichens can show intense antioxidant activity. Secondary metabolites are often deposited as crystals in the apoplast. Secondary metabolites are thought to play a role in preference for some substrates over others. Sometimes lichens contain structures made from fungal metabolites, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a polysaccharide layer in the cortex. = Growth rate = Lichens often have a regular but very slow growth rate of less than a millimeter per year. In crustose lichens, the area along the margin is where the most active growth is taking place. Most crustose lichens grow only 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter per year. = Life span = Lichens may be long-lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living organisms. Lifespan is difficult to measure because what defines the \\"same\\" individual lichen is not precise. Lichens grow by vegetatively breaking off a piece, which may or may not be defined as the \\"same\\" lichen, and two lichens can merge, then becoming the \\"same\\" lichen. An Arctic species called \\"map lichen\\" (Rhizocarpon geographicum) has been dated at 8,600 years, apparently the world's oldest living organism. =Response to environmental stress= Unlike simple dehydration in plants and animals, lichens may experience a complete loss of body water in dry periods. Lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of water content (poikilohydric). They quickly absorb water when it becomes available again, becoming soft and fleshy. Reconfiguration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes or more. In tests, lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The European Space Agency has discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space. In an experiment led by Leopoldo Sancho from the Complutense University of Madrid, two species of lichen‚ÄîRhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans‚Äîwere sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket 31 May 2005. Once in orbit, the capsules were opened and the lichens were directly exposed to the vacuum of space with its widely fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation. After 15 days, the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be unchanged in their ability to photosynthesize.  Reproduction and dispersal  =Vegetative reproduction= Xanthoparmelia sp. with dark-colored reproductive structures (disc-like apothecia) at center, surrounded by a pale coloured vegetative thallus. Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own (vegetative reproduction) or through the dispersal of diaspores containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells. Because of the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus, the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred. Fruticose lichens can easily fragment, and new lichens can grow from the fragment (vegetative reproduction). Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns. Soredia (singular: \\"soredium\\") are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia, from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind. Isidia (singular: \\"isidium\\") are branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal. Lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called \\"fringe species\\" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the \\"core species\\". =Sexual reproduction= Disc-like apothecia (left) and thallus (right) on a foliose lichen Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus. Only the fungal partner in a lichen reproduces sexually. Many lichen fungi reproduce sexually like other fungi, producing spores formed by meiosis and fusion of gametes. Following dispersal, such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form. Some lichen fungi belong to Basidiomycetes (basidiolichens) and produce mushroom-like reproductive structures resembling those of their nonlichenized relatives. Most lichen fungi belong to Ascomycetes (ascolichens). Among the ascolichens, spores are produced in spore-producing structures called ascomata. The most common types of ascomata are the apothecium (plural: apothecia) and perithecium (plural: perithecia). Apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs located on the top surface of the lichen thallus. When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called lirellae. Perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue, which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask, and appear like black dots on the lichen surface. The three most common spore body types are raised discs called apothecia (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups with a small hole at the top called perithecia (singular: perithecium), and pycnidia (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the structure that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the Ascomycota). The apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called asci (singular: ascus), and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue. When the apothecium has an outer margin, the margin is called the exciple. When the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called lecanorine, meaning similar to members of the genus Lecanora. When the exciple is blackened like carbon it is called lecideine meaning similar to members of the genus Lecidea. When the margin is pale or colorless it is called biatorine. Crust-like thallus with pseudopodetia A \\"podetium\\" (plural: podetia) is a lichenized stalk-like structure of the fruiting body rising from the thallus, associated with some fungi that produce a fungal apothecium. Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent. The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. They usually bear the fungal pycnidia or apothecia or both. Many lichens have apothecia that are visible to the naked eye. Most lichens produce abundant sexual structures. Many species appear to disperse only by sexual spores. For example, the crustose lichens Graphis scripta and Ochrolechia parella produce no symbiotic vegetative propagules. Instead, the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self- fertilization (i.e. they are homothallic). This breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments. Mazaedia (singular: mazaedium) are apothecia shaped like a dressmaker's pin in (pin lichen)s, where the fruiting body is a brown or black mass of loose ascospores enclosed by a cup- shaped exciple, which sits on top of a tiny stalk.  Taxonomy and classification  Lichens are classified by the fungal component. Lichen species are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus species in the lichen. Lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungus. There are about 13,500‚Äì17,000 identified lichen species. Nearly 20% of known fungal species are associated with lichens. \\"Lichenized fungus\\" may refer to the entire lichen, or to just the fungus. This may cause confusion without context. A particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species, giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species, but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species. Formerly, some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division, the Mycophycophyta, but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate lineages. Neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form monophyletic lineages in their respective fungal phyla, but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum. Even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus Geosiphon pyriforme, a member of the Glomeromycota that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells. Geosiphon is not usually considered to be a lichen, and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years. The genus is more closely allied to endomycorrhizal genera. Fungi from Verrucariales also form marine lichens with the brown algae Petroderma maculiforme, and have a symbiotic relationship with seaweed like (rockweed) and Blidingia minima, where the algae are the dominant components. The fungi is thought to help the rockweeds to resist desiccation when exposed to air. In addition, lichens can also use yellow-green algae (Heterococcus) as their symbiotic partner. Lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria multiple times throughout history. = Fungi = The fungal component of a lichen is called the mycobiont. The mycobiont may be an Ascomycete or Basidiomycete. The associated lichens are called either ascolichens or basidiolichens, respectively. Living as a symbiont in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients, since about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life. Thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. But the same mycobiont with different photobionts may also produce very different growth forms. Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species. Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species. Two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen. The following table lists the orders and families of fungi that include lichen-forming species. =Photobionts= The photosynthetic partner in a lichen is called a photobiont. The photobionts in lichens come from a variety of simple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In the majority of lichens the photobiont is a green alga (Chlorophyta) or a cyanobacterium. In some lichens both types are present. Algal photobionts are called phycobionts, while cyanobacterial photobionts are called cyanobionts. According to one source, about 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts, and about 10% have cyanobionts, while another source states that two thirds of lichens have green algae as phycobiont, and about one third have a cyanobiont. Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: Cyanophyceae; eukaryotic: Trebouxiophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Chlorophyceae) have been found to associate with the lichen- forming fungi. Common algal photobionts are from the genera Trebouxia, Trentepohlia, Pseudotrebouxia, or Myrmecia. Trebouxia is the most common genus of green algae in lichens, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. \\"Trebouxioid\\" means either a photobiont that is in the genus Trebouxia, or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class Trebouxiophyceae. The second most commonly represented green alga genus is Trentepohlia. Overall, about 100 species of eukaryotes are known to occur as photobionts in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen. A \\"cyanolichen\\" is a lichen with a cyanobacterium as its main photosynthetic component (photobiont). Most cyanolichen are also ascolichens, but a few basidiolichen like Dictyonema and Acantholichen have cyanobacteria as their partner. The most commonly occurring cyanobacterium genus is Nostoc. Other common cyanobacterium photobionts are from Scytonema. Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have limestone as the substrate. Another cyanolichen group, the jelly lichens of the genera Collema or Leptogium are gelatinous and live on moist soils. Another group of large and foliose species including Peltigera, Lobaria, and Degelia are grey- blue, especially when dampened or wet. Many of these characterize the Lobarion communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the Celtic rain forest. Strains of cyanobacteria found in various cyanolichens are often closely related to one another. They differ from the most closely related free-living strains. The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga Trentepohlia, which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called \\"fringe species\\" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the \\"core species\\". The same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners. The same phycobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners. More than one phycobiont may be present in a single thallus. A single lichen may contain several algal genotypes. These multiple genotypes may better enable response to adaptation to environmental changes, and enable the lichen to inhabit a wider range of environments. =Controversy over classification method and species names= There are about 20,000 known lichen species. But what is meant by \\"species\\" is different from what is meant by biological species in plants, animals, or fungi, where being the same species implies that there is a common ancestral lineage. Because lichens are combinations of members of two or even three different biological kingdoms, these components must have a different ancestral lineage from each other. By convention, lichens are still called \\"species\\" anyway, and are classified according to the species of their fungus, not the species of the algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus in them, which may cause some confusion. The alga bears its own scientific name, which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungus. Depending on context, \\"lichenized fungus\\" may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus when it is in the lichen, which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria. Some algae and cyanobacteria are found naturally living outside of the lichen. The fungal, algal, or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture. When growing by themselves, the fungus, algae, or cyanobacteria have very different properties than those of the lichen. Lichen properties such as growth form, physiology, and biochemistry, are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae or cyanobacteria. The same fungus growing in combination with different algae or cyanobacteria, can produce lichens that are very different in most properties, meeting non-DNA criteria for being different \\"species\\". Historically, these different combinations were classified as different species. When the fungus is identified as being the same using modern DNA methods, these apparently different species get reclassified as the same species under the current (2014) convention for classification by fungal component. This has led to debate about this classification convention. These apparently different \\"species\\" have their own independent evolutionary history. There is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus, and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium (synecdoche). This is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms, which would be considered different species by any measure other than the DNA of the fungal component. If the whole lichen produced by the same fungus growing in association with different algae or cyanobacteria, were to be classified as different \\"species\\", the number of \\"lichen species\\" would be greater. =Diversity= The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the Ascomycota, with about 40% of species forming such an association. Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as saprotrophs or plant parasites (for example, the Leotiales, Dothideales, and Pezizales). Other lichen fungi occur in only five orders in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders Graphidales, Gyalectales, Peltigerales, Pertusariales, and Teloschistales). Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont. Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned fungi imperfecti, a catch-all category for fungi whose sexual form of reproduction has never been observed. Comparatively few Basidiomycetes are lichenized, but these include agarics, such as species of Lichenomphalia, clavarioid fungi, such as species of Multiclavula, and corticioid fungi, such as species of Dictyonema. =Identification methods= Lichen identification uses growth form and reactions to chemical tests. The outcome of the \\"Pd test\\" is called \\"Pd\\", which is also used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test, para-phenylenediamine. If putting a drop on a lichen turns an area bright yellow to orange, this helps identify it as belonging to either the genus Cladonia or Lecanora. = Evolution and paleontology = The fossil record for lichens is poor.\\"Lichens: Fossil Record\\" , University of California Museum of Paleontology. The extreme habitats that lichens dominate, such as tundra, mountains, and deserts, are not ordinarily conducive to producing fossils. There are fossilized lichens embedded in amber. The fossilized Anzia is found in pieces of amber in northern Europe and dates back approximately 40 million years. Lichen fragments are also found in fossil leaf beds, such as Lobaria from Trinity County in northern California, USA, dating back to the early to middle Miocene. The oldest fossil lichen in which both symbiotic partners have been recovered is Winfrenatia,an early zygomycetous (Glomeromycotan) lichen symbiosis that may have involved controlled parasitism, is permineralized in the Rhynie Chert of Scotland, dating from early Early Devonian, about 400 million years ago. The slightly older fossil Spongiophyton has also been interpreted as a lichen on morphological and isotopic grounds, although the isotopic basis is decidedly shaky. It has been demonstrated that Silurian-Devonian fossils Nematothallus and Prototaxites were lichenized. Thus lichenized Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were a component of Early Silurian-Devonian terrestrial ecosystems. Newer research suggests that lichen evolved after the evolution of land plants. The ancestral ecological state of both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota was probably saprobism, and independent lichenization events may have occurred multiple times. In 1995, Gargas and colleagues proposed that there were at least five independent origins of lichenization; three in the basidiomycetes and at least two in the Ascomycetes. However, Lutzoni et al. (2001) indicate that lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses. Some non-lichen-forming fungi may have secondarily lost the ability to form a lichen association. As a result, lichenization has been viewed as a highly successful nutritional strategy. Lichenized Glomeromycota may extend well back into the Precambrian. Lichen-like fossils consisting of coccoid cells (cyanobacteria?) and thin filaments (mucoromycotinan Glomeromycota?) are permineralized in marine phosphorite of the Doushantuo Formation in southern China. These fossils are thought to be 551 to 635 million years old or Ediacaran. Ediacaran acritarchs also have many similarities with Glomeromycotan vesicles and spores. It has also been claimed that Ediacaran fossils including Dickinsonia, were lichens, although this claim is controversial. Endosymbiotic Glomeromycota comparable with living Geosiphon may extend back into the Proterozoic in the form of 1500 million year old Horodyskia and 2200 million year old Diskagma. Discovery of these fossils suggest that fungi developed symbiotic partnerships with photoautotrophs long before the evolution of vascular plants.  Ecology and interactions with environment  =Substrates and habitats= Lichens on a statue made of limestone on a tower of Regensburg Cathedral Lichens cover about 7% of the planet's surface and grow on and in a wide range of substrates and habitats, including some of the most extreme conditions on earth.In the Race to Live on Land, Lichens Didn't Beat Plants - The New York Times They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, and hanging from branches \\"living on thin air\\" (epiphytes) in rain forests and in temperate woodland. They grow on bare rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, and exposed soil surfaces. They can survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. They can live inside solid rock, growing between the grains, and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust in arid habitats such as deserts. Some lichens do not grow on anything, living out their lives blowing about the environment. When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals, contributing to the process of weathering by which rocks are gradually turned into soil. While this contribution to weathering is usually benign, it can cause problems for artificial stone structures. For example, there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on Mount Rushmore National Memorial that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument. Lichens are not parasites on the plants they grow on, but only use them as a substrate to grow on. The fungi of some lichen species may \\"take over\\" the algae of other lichen species. Lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment. Lichens growing on leaves may have the appearance of being parasites on the leaves, but they are not. However, some lichens, notably those of the genus Diploschistes are known to parasitise other lichens. Diploschistes muscorum starts its development in the tissue of a host Cladonia species. In the arctic tundra, lichens, together with mosses and liverworts, make up the majority of the ground cover, which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals. An example is \\"Reindeer moss\\", which is a lichen, not a moss. A crustose lichen that grows on rock is called a saxicolous lichen.Mosses Lichens & Ferns of Northwest North America, Dale H. Vitt, Janet E. Marsh, Robin B. Bovey, Lone Pine Publishing Company, Crustose lichens that grow on the rock are epilithic, and those that grow immersed inside rock, growing between the crystals with only their fruiting bodies exposed to the air, are called endolithic lichens. A crustose lichen that grows on bark is called a corticolous lichen. A lichen that grows on wood from which the bark has been stripped is called a lignicolous lichen. Lichens that grow immersed inside plant tissues are called endophloidic lichens or endophloidal lichens. Lichens that use leaves as substrates, whether the leaf is still on the tree or on the ground, are called epiphyllous or foliicolous. A terricolous lichen grows on the soil as a substrate. Many squamulous lichens are terricolous. Umbillicate lichens are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point. A vagrant lichen is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind. =Lichens and soils= In addition to distinct physical mechanisms by which lichens break down raw stone, recent studies indicate lichens attack stone chemically, entering newly chelated minerals into the ecology. > The lichen exudates, which have powerful chelating capacity, the widespread > occurrence of mineral neoformation, particularly metal oxalates, together > with the characteristics of weathered substrates, all confirm the > significance of lichens as chemical weathering agents. Over time, this activity creates new fertile soil from lifeless stone. Lichens may be important in contributing nitrogen to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting the nitrogen into the soils. Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes. In deserts and semi-arid areas, lichens are part of extensive, living biological soil crusts, essential for maintaining the soil structure. Lichens have a long fossil record in soils dating back 2.2 billion years. =Ecological interactions= Lichens are pioneer species, among the first living things to grow on bare rock or areas denuded of life by a disaster. Lichens may have to compete with plants for access to sunlight, but because of their small size and slow growth, they thrive in places where higher plants have difficulty growing. Lichens are often the first to settle in places lacking soil, constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes. Some survive in the tough conditions of deserts, and others on frozen soil of the Arctic regions. A major ecophysiological advantage of lichens is that they are poikilohydric (poikilo- variable, hydric- relating to water), meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration, they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe desiccation. Like some mosses, liverworts, ferns, and a few \\"resurrection plants\\", upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as cryptobiosis) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity. In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit. Lichens suppress the growth of mosses and higher plants around them Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs and monuments. Many lichens also grow as epiphytes (epi- on the surface, phyte- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees. When growing on plants, lichens are not parasites; they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it. Lichens produce allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the growth of mosses. Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus Cladina (reindeer lichens), produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants. Stability (that is, longevity) of their substrate is a major factor of lichen habitats. Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, vascular (higher) plant seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water. Lichens may be eaten by some animals, such as reindeer, living in arctic regions. The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species feed exclusively on lichens. These include Common Footman and Marbled Beauty. However, lichens are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates, making them unsuitable for some animals. Lichens are also used by the Northern Flying Squirrel for nesting, food, and a water source during winter. = Effects of air pollution = Some lichens, like the foliose Lobaria pulmonaria, are sensitive to air pollution. If lichens are exposed to air pollutants at all times, without any deciduous parts, they are unable to avoid the accumulation of pollutants. Also lacking stomata and a cuticle, lichens may absorb aerosols and gases over the entire thallus surface from which they may readily diffuse to the photobiont layer. Because lichens do not possess roots, their primary source of most elements is the air, and therefore elemental levels in lichens often reflect the accumulated composition of ambient air. The processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include fog and dew, gaseous absorption, and dry deposition. Consequently, many environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective biomonitors of atmospheric quality. Not all lichens are equally sensitive to air pollutants, so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants. The sensitivity of a lichen to air pollution is directly related to the energy needs of the mycobiont, so that the stronger the dependency of the mycobiont on the photobiont, the more sensitive the lichen is to air pollution. Upon exposure to air pollution, the photobiont may use metabolic energy for repair of its cellular structures that would otherwise be used for maintenance of its photosynthetic activity, therefore leaving less metabolic energy available for the mycobiont. The alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association. Therefore, lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances, but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other. This interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859, with more systematic methods developed by William Nylander in 1866.  Human use  Iwatake (Umbilicaria esculenta) gathering at Kumano in Kish≈´, by Hiroshige II = Food = Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world. Although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine, others are a staple food or even a delicacy. Two obstacles are often encountered when eating lichens: lichen polysaccharides are generally indigestible to humans, and lichens usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds that should be removed before eating. Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in vulpinic acid or usnic acid are toxic. Most poisonous lichens are yellow. In the past, Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica) was an important source of food for humans in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. Wila (Bryoria fremontii) was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested reindeer lichen (Cladina spp.) after they remove it from the rumen of caribou or reindeer that have been killed. Rock tripe (Umbilicaria spp. and Lasalia spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America, and one species, Umbilicaria esculenta, is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods. = Lichenometry = Lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli. Introduced by Beschel in the 1950s, the technique has found many applications. it is used in archaeology, palaeontology, and geomorphology. It uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock.Curry, R. R. (1969) \\"Holocene climatic and glacial history of the central Sierra Nevada, California\\", pp. 1‚Äì47, Geological Society of America Special Paper, 123, S. A. Schumm and W. C. Bradley, eds. Measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years.Sowers, J. M., Noller, J. S., and Lettis, W. R. (eds.) (1997) Dating and Earthquakes: Review of Quaternary Geochronology and its Application to Paleoseismology. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG/CR 5562. Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period. The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera Rhizocarpon (e.g. the species Rhizocarpon geographicum) and Xanthoria. =Biodegradation= Lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of Baelo Claudia in Spain. Lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead, copper, and radionuclides. Some species of lichen such as Parmelia sulcata and Lobaria pulmonaria, and many in the Cladonia genus have been shown to produce serine proteases capable of the degradation of pathogenic forms of prion protein (PrP), which may be useful in treating contaminated environmental reservoirs. = As dyes = Many lichens produce secondary compounds, including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that reduce herbivory or kill bacteria. These compounds are very useful for lichen identification, and have had economic importance as dyes such as cudbear or primitive antibiotics. The pH indicator (indicated acidic or basic) in the litmus test is a dye extracted from the lichen Roccella tinctoria by boiling. In the Highlands of Scotland, traditional dyes for Harris tweed and other traditional cloths were made from lichens, including the orange Xanthoria parietina and the grey foliaceous Parmelia saxatilis common on rocks known as \\"crottle\\". There are reports dating almost 2,000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes. Of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family Roccellaceae, commonly called orchella weed or orchil. Orcein and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions. =Traditional medicine and research= Historically in traditional medicine of Europe, Lobaria pulmonaria was collected in large quantities as \\"Lungwort\\", due to its lung-like appearance (the doctrine of signatures suggesting that herbs can treat body parts that they physically resemble). Similarly, Peltigera leucophlebia was used as a supposed cure for thrush, due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease. Lichens produce metabolites in research for their potential therapeutic or diagnostic value. Some metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities.Morton, E.; Winters, J. and Smith, L. (2010). \\"An Analysis of Antiseptic and Antibiotic Properties of Variously Treated Mosses and Lichens\\" . University of Michigan Biological Station Usnic acid is the most commonly studied metabolite produced by lichens. It is also under research as an bactericidal agent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. =Aesthetic appeal= Pine forest with Cladonia lichen ground-cover Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating the surface of the visual landscape as part of the aesthetic appeal to visitors of Yosemite National Park and Sequoia National Park. Orange and yellow lichens add to the ambience of desert trees, rock faces, tundras, and rocky seashores. Intricate webs of lichens hanging from tree branches add a mysterious aspect to forests. Fruticose lichens are used in model railroading and other modeling hobbies as a material for making miniature trees and shrubs. =In literature= In early Midrashic literature, the Hebrew word \\"vayilafeth\\" in Ruth 3:8 is explained as referring to Ruth entwining herself around Boaz like lichen.Thus explained by Rabbi Enoch Zundel ben Joseph, in his commentary Etz Yosef (\\"Tree of Joseph\\"), on Sefer Midrash Rabbah, vol. 2, New York 1987, s.v. Ruth Rabba 6:3 The tenth century Arab physician, Al-Tamimi, mentions lichens dissolved in vinegar and rose water being used in his day for the treatment of skin diseases and rashes.Zohar Amar and Yaron Serri, The Land of Israel and Syria as Described by Al-Tamimi, Ramat-Gan 2004, pp. 56, 108‚Äì109 (Hebrew) The plot of John Wyndham's novel Trouble with Lichen revolves around an anti-aging chemical extracted from a lichen. History \\"Lichenes\\" fancifully drawn by Ernst Haeckel to emphasize his ideas of symmetry in his Artforms of Nature, 1904 Although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time, it was not until 1867, when Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener proposed his dual theory of lichens, that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge. Schwendener's hypothesis, which at the time lacked experimental evidence, arose from his extensive analysis of the anatomy and development in lichens, algae, and fungi using a light microscope. Many of the leading lichenologists at the time, such as James Crombie and Nylander, rejected Schwendener's hypothesis because the common consensus was that all living organisms were autonomous. Other prominent biologists, such as Heinrich Anton de Bary, Albert Bernhard Frank, Melchior Treub and Hermann Hellriegel were not so quick to reject Schwendener's ideas and the concept soon spread into other areas of study, such as microbial, plant, animal and human pathogens. When the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified, Schwendener's hypothesis began to gain popularity. Further experimental proof of the dual nature of lichens was obtained when Eugen Thomas published his results in 1939 on the first successful re-synthesis experiment. In the 2010s, a new facet of the fungi-algae partnership was discovered. Toby Spribille and colleagues found that many types of lichen that were long thought to be ascomycete-algae pairs were actually ascomycete- basidiomycete-algae trios.

Aiming is performed by calculating azimuth and inclination, and may include correcting aim by observing the fall of shot and calculating new angles. Description There are two dimensions in aiming a weapon: * In the horizontal plane (azimuth); and * In the vertical plane (elevation), which is governed by the distance (range) to the target and the energy of the propelling charge. The projectile trajectory is affected by atmospheric conditions, the velocity of the projectile, the difference in altitude between the firer and the target, and other factors. Direct fire sights may include mechanisms to compensate for some of these. Handguns and rifles, machine guns, anti-tank guns, tank main guns, many types of unguided rockets (although missiles, mortars, howitzers, rocket artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and artillery in general, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles, etc., are indirect), and guns mounted in aircraft are examples of weapons primarily designed for direct fire. NATO defines indirect fire as \\"Fire delivered at a target which cannot be seen by the aimer.\\"AAP-6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions The implication is that azimuth and/or elevation 'aiming' is done using instrumental methods. Hence indirect fire means applying 'firing data' to azimuth and elevation sights and laying these sights. Indirect fire can be used when the target is visible from the firing position. However, it is mostly used when the target is at longer range and invisible to the firer due to the terrain. Longer range uses a higher trajectory, and in theory maximum range is achieved with an elevation angle of 45 degrees. Calling and adjusting indirect artillery fire on a target unseen to the soldiers manning the guns, a modern United States example Indirect fire is most commonly associated with field artillery (although field artillery was originally and until after World War I a direct fire weapon, hence the bullet-shields fitted to the carriages of guns such as the famous M1897 75 mm) and mortars. It is also used with naval guns against shore targets, sometimes with machine guns, and has been used with tank and anti-tank guns and by anti-aircraft guns against surface targets. It is reasonable to assume that original purpose of indirect fire was to enable fire from a 'covered position', one where gunners can not be seen and engaged by their enemies (that and as the range of artillery lengthened, it was impossible to see the target past all the intervening terrain). The concealment aspect remains important, but from World War I equally important was the capability to concentrate the fire of many artillery batteries at the same target or set of targets. This became increasingly important as the range of artillery increased, allowing each battery to have an ever-greater area of influence, but required command and control arrangements to enable concentration of fire. The physical laws of ballistics means that guns firing larger and heavier projectile can send them further than smaller-calibre guns firing lighter shells. By the end of the 20th century, the typical maximum range for the most common guns was about 24 to 30 km, up from about 8 km in World War I. During World War I, covered positions moved further back and indirect fire evolved to allow any point within range to be attacked, firepower mobility, without moving the firers. If the target cannot be seen from the gun position, there has to be a means of identifying targets and correcting aim according to fall of shot. The position of some targets may be identified by a headquarters from various sources of information (spotters): observers on the ground, in aircraft, or in observation balloons. The development of electrical communication immensely simplified reporting, and enabled many widely dispersed firers to concentrate their fire on one target. Until the introduction of smart munitions the trajectory of the projectile could not be altered once fired. History Indirect arrow fire by archers was commonly used by ancient armies. It was used during both battles and sieges. For several centuries Coehorn mortars were fired indirectly because their fixed elevation meant range was determined by the amount of propelling powder. It is also reasonable conjecture that if these mortars were used from inside fortifications their targets may have been invisible to them and therefore met the definition of indirect fire. It could also be argued that Niccol√≤ Tartaglia's invention of the gunner's quadrant (see clinometer) in the 16th century introduced indirect fire guns because it enabled gunlaying by instrument instead of line of sight.Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline, Brigadier O. F. G. Hogg, 1970, C. Hurst and Company This instrument was basically a carpenter's set square with a graduated arc and plumb-bob placed in the muzzle to measure an elevation. There are suggestions,The History of the Royal Artillery from the Indian Mutiny to the Great War, Vol II, 1899‚Äì1914, Major General Sir John Headlam, 1934 based on an account in Livre de Canonerie published in 1561 and reproduced in Revue d'Artillerie of March 1908, that indirect fire was used by the Burgundians in the 16th Century. The Russians seem to have used something similar at Paltzig in 1759 where they fired over trees, and their instructions of the time indicate this was a normal practice.\\"Red God of War\\" Soviet Artillery and Rocket Forces, Chris Bellamy, 1986 These methods probably involved an aiming point positioned in line with the target. The earliest example of indirect fire adjusted by an observer seems to be during the defence of Hougoumont in the Battle of Waterloo where a battery of the Royal Horse Artillery fired an indirect Shrapnel barrage against advancing French troops using corrections given by the commander of an adjacent battery with a direct line of sight.Against All Odds!: Dramatic Last Stand Actions. Perret, Brian. Cassell 2000. : discussed during the account of the Hougoumont action. Modern indirect fire dates from the late 19th century. In 1882 a Russian, Lt Col K. G. Guk, published Field Artillery Fire from Covered Positions that described a better method of indirect laying (instead of aiming points in line with the target). In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an azimuth instrument to enable it; clinometers for elevation already existed. The Germans solved this problem by inventing the lining-plane in about 1890. This was a gun-mounted rotatable open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced \\"lining-plane\\" in English. The first incontrovertible, documented use of indirect fire in war using Guk's methods, albeit without lining-plane sights, was on 26 October 1899 by British gunners during the Second Boer War. Although both sides demonstrated early on in the conflict that could use the technique effectively, in many subsequent battles, British commanders nonetheless ordered artillery to be \\"less timid\\" and to move forward to address troops' concerns about their guns abandoning them. The British used improvised gun arcs with howitzers; the sighting arrangements used by the Boers with their German and French guns is unclear. The early goniometric devices suffered from the problem that the layer (gun aimer) had to move around to look through the sight. This was very unsatisfactory if the aiming point was not to the front, particularly on larger guns. The solution was a periscopic panoramic sight, with the eyepiece to the rear and the rotatable top of the sight above the height of the layer's head. The German Goertz 1906 design was selected by both the British and the Russians. The British adopted the name \\"Dial Sight\\" for this instrument; the US used \\"Panoramic Telescope\\"; the Russia used \\"Goertz panorama\\". Elevations were measured by a clinometer, a device using a spirit level to measure a vertical angle from the horizontal plane. These could be separate instruments placed on a surface parallel to the axis of the bore or physically integrated into some form of sight mount. Some guns had clinometers graduated in distances instead of angles. Clinometers had several other names including \\"gunner's level\\", \\"range scale\\", \\"elevation drum\\" and \\"gunner‚Äôs quadrant\\" and several different configurations. Those graduated in ranges were specific to a type of gun. These arrangements lasted for most of the 20th century until robust, reliable and cost-effectively accurate gyroscopes provided a means of pointing gun or launcher in any required azimuth and elevation, thereby enabling indirect fire without using external aiming points. These devices use gyros in all three axes to determine current elevation, azimuth and trunnion tilt. Related issues United States Marine lance corporal plots the direction and elevation of a mortar before firing. Before a gun or launcher can be aimed, it must be oriented towards a known azimuth, or at least towards a target area. Initially, the angle between the aiming point and target area is deduced, or estimated, and set on the azimuth sight. Each gun is then laid on the aiming point, with this angle in order to keep them aimed roughly parallel to each other. However, for artillery another instrument, called either a director (United Kingdom) or aiming circle (United States), became widespread and eventually the primary method of orienting guns in most if not all armies. After being oriented and pointed in the required direction a gun recorded angles to one or more aiming points. Indirect fire needs a command and control arrangement to allot guns to targets and direct their fire. The latter may involve ground or air observers or technical devices and systems. Fire may be either \\"adjusted\\" or \\"predicted\\". The latter (originally called \\"map shooting\\") means firing data is calculated to include corrections for non-standard conditions. It also requires the target location to be precisely known relative to the gun location. Predicted fire was introduced in World War I. Adjusting (originally \\"ranging\\") means some form of observation is used to correct the fall of shot onto the target; there are several possible reasons for this: * geospatial relationship between gun and target is not accurately known; * good quality data for non-standard conditions is unavailable; or * the target is moving or expected to move. Adjusted and predicted fire are not mutually exclusive, the former may use predicted data and the later may need adjusting in some circumstances. There are two approaches to the azimuth that orients the guns of a battery for indirect fire. Originally \\"zero\\", meaning 6400 mils, 360 degrees or their equivalent, was set at whatever the direction the oriented gun was pointed. Firing data was a deflection or switch from this zero. The other method was to set the sight at the actual grid bearing in which the gun was oriented, and firing data was the actual bearing to the target. The latter reduces sources of mistakes and made it easier to check that the guns were correctly laid. By the late 1950s, most armies had adopted the bearing method, the notable exception being the United States.

Stockings vary in color, design, and transparency. Today, stockings are primarily worn for fashion and aesthetics, usually in association with mid-length or short skirts. History Examining the quality of nylon stockings, Malm√∂ clothing factory 1954. Stockings on display for sale in South Korea. Historically, even though the word sock is at least as ancient in origin, what men normally wore were often referred to as stockings, probably especially when referring to longer hose.Oxford English Dictionary, quotations The word stock used to refer to the bottom \\"stump\\" part of the body, and by analogy the word was used to refer to the one-piece covering of the lower trunk and limbs of the 15th century‚Äîessentially tights consisting of the upper-stocks (later to be worn separately as knee breeches) and nether-stocks (later to be worn separately as stockings). (See Hose.) Before the 1590s, stockings were made of woven cloth. The first knitting machines were for making stockings.Elizabethan England by Kathy Elgin The stockings themselves were made of cotton, linen, wool or silk. A polished cotton called lisle was common, as were those made in the town of Balbriggan. Before the 1920s, stockings, if worn, were worn for warmth. In the 1920s, as hemlines of dresses rose and central heating was not widespread, women began to wear flesh-colored stockings to cover their exposed legs. Those stockings were sheer, first made of silk or rayon (then known as \\"artificial silk\\") and after 1940 of nylon. leftThe introduction of nylon in 1939 by chemical company DuPont began a high demand for stockings in the United States with up to 4 million pairs being purchased in one day. Nylon stockings were cheap, durable, and sheer compared to their cotton and silk counterparts. When America entered World War II, DuPont ceased production of nylon stockings and retooled their factories to produce parachutes, airplane cords, and rope. This led to a shortage and the creation of a black market for stockings. At the end of the war DuPont announced that the company would return to producing stockings, but could not meet demand. This led to a series of disturbances in American stores known as the nylon riots until DuPont was able to ramp up production. A precursor of pantyhose made an appearance in the 1940s and 1950s, when film and theater productions had stockings sewn to the briefs of actresses and dancers, according to actress-singer-dancer Ann Miller and seen in popular films such as Daddy Long Legs. Today, stockings are commonly made using knitted wool, silk, cotton or nylon (see hosiery). The introduction of commercial pantyhose in 1959 gave an alternative to stockings, and the use of stockings declined dramatically. A main reason for this was the trend towards higher hemlines on dresses (see minidress). In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and has remained this way ever since. Beginning in 1987, sales of pantyhose started a slight decline due to the newly invented hold-ups, but still remain the most sold kind of hosiery. Benefits and drawbacks Stockings are still sometimes preferred to pantyhose in North American English, for a number of reasons. These may include the perception that stockings, and the associated use of garters, lace, high fashion, appliqu√© and the exposure of the thigh, are more aesthetically pleasing, or sexually attractive and alluring than pantyhose. Both nylon stockings and pantyhose in being sheer share the advantage of being quick-drying compared to pants. Spare pairs are also easy to carry if they are ruined. If laddered they can be replaced 'one at a time' which provides a cost advantage over tights. However, stockings have a drawback in colder weather, because more skin is exposed to the cold compared to pantyhose. Also, pantyhose do not require garters or garter belts, and do not need to be adjusted as much, whilst also leaving a smoother line under form-fitting clothing. Support A garter belt with guipure lace stay-up stockings held up by elastic Stockings can be held up in one of three ways: # A garter belt (AmE), or suspender belt or suspenders (BrE), is the most common way of holding up stockings. It is a piece of underwear worn around the waist like a belt but under clothing which has \\"suspenders\\" or \\"stays\\" that clip to the tops of the stockings. # \\"Stay-ups\\" are the second most common means of support. The inside of the top of the stockings has a band (typically silicone) of elastic or highly tractive material that resists slipping down the thigh. However, there is no consistent sizing for differences in thigh circumference, resulting in some stockings either falling down or being too tight, leaving red marks and possibly aggravating varicose veins. # A garter is the least common means of support. It is slipped over the top of the stocking to hold the stocking by essentially clamping it to the leg. These are the garters typically worn by a bride at her wedding. They have similar disadvantages to \\"stay-ups\\". Terminology Fishnet hosiery. In modern usage, stocking specifically refers to the form of hosiery configured as two pieces, one for each leg (except for American and Australian English, where the term can also be a synonym for pantyhose). The terms hold-ups and thigh highs refer to stockings that stay up through the use of built-in elastic, while the word stockings is the general term or refers to the kind of stockings that need a suspender belt (garter belt, in American English), and are quite distinct from tights or pantyhose (American English). Other terms used with stockings include: * Cuban heel: A stocking with a heel made with folded over and sewn reinforcement. * Demi-toe: Stockings which have a reinforced toe with half the coverage on top as on the bottom. This results in a reinforcement that covers only the tip of the toes as opposed to the whole toe. These can be with or without a reinforced heel. * Denier: The lower the denier number the sheerer the garment. Stockings knitted with a higher denier tend to be less sheer but more durable. * Fishnet: Knitted stockings with a very wide open knit resembling a fish net. * Fencenet: Similar to fishnet, but with a much wider pattern. These are sometimes worn over another pair of stockings or pantyhose, such as matte or opaque, with a contrasting colour. Sometimes referred to as whalenets. * Full Fashioned: Fully fashioned stockings are knitted flat, the material is then cut and the two sides are then united by a seam up the back. Fully fashioned stockings were the most popular style until the 1960s. * Hold- ups (British English) or Stay-ups: Stockings that are held up by sewn-in elasticated bands (quite often a wide lace top band). In the US they are referred to as thigh-highs. * Knee highs: Stockings that terminate at or just barely below the knee. Also known as half-stockings, trouser socks, or socks. * Matte: Stockings which have a dull or non-lustre finish. * Mock seam: A false seam sewn into the back of a seamless stocking. * Nude heel: Stockings without reinforcement in the heel area. * Opaque: Stockings made of yarn which give them a heavier appearance (usually 40 denier or greater). * Point heel: in a Fully Fashioned stocking it is a heel in which the reinforced part ends in a triangle shape. * RHT: Abbreviation of reinforced heel and toe. * Open- toed: Stockings that stop at the base of the toe with a piece that goes between the first and second toes to hold them down. They can be worn with some open-toed shoes, especially to show off pedicured toes. * Sandalfoot: Stockings with a nude toe, meaning no heavier yarn in the toe than is in the leg. They are intended to be worn with sandal or open-toe shoes. * Seamed: Stockings manufactured in the old Full-Fashioned manner with a seam running up the back of the leg. In the past they were manufactured by cutting the fabric and then sewing it together. Today, thanks to Pio Chiaruttini who patented this new technique, stockings are generally fully knitted and a fake or mock seam is added up the back for a particular fashion look. Some brands also produce seamed hold-ups. * Seamless: Stockings knit in one operation on circular machines (one continuous operation) so that no seaming is required up the back. * Sheers: Stockings generally of a 15 to 20 denier. * Stocking Feet: Shoeless feet covered by stockings or socks. * Suspender belt (British English) or Garter belt (American English): a belt with straps to keep stockings (not hold-ups) on place: usually they have 4 straps, but may have also 6 or 8. * Ultra sheer: A fine denier fiber which gives the ultimate in sheerness. Usually 10 denier. * Welt: A fabric knitted separately and machine- sewn to the top of a stocking. Knit in a heavier denier yarn and folded double to give strength for supporter fastening.

He wrote and played both popular and classical music. He was the brother of the conductor Steuart Bedford and the grandson of the composer, painter and author Herbert Bedford and the composer Liza Lehmann. From 1969 to 1981, Bedford was Composer in Residence at Queen's College, London. From 1968 to 1980, he taught music in a number of London secondary schools. In 1996 he was appointed Composer in Association with the English Sinfonia. In 2001 he was appointed Chairman of the Performing Right Society, having previously been Deputy chairman. Early life and career Bedford was educated at Lancing College, then as a conscientious objector to National Service he worked as a porter at Guy's Hospital. Bedford studied music at the Royal Academy of Music under Lennox Berkeley, and later in Venice under Luigi Nono. His studies and early influences included the work of Nono, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern.Decca (1970) LP notes by Anthony Payne from Music for Albion Moonlight LP ZRG 638 In the mid-60s, he was a music teacher at Whitefield school in Hendon. The pupils were very fond of him, as he taught them to play Sonny and Cher songs, instead of the usual music class stuff. In 1969, Bedford was engaged to orchestrate Kevin Ayers' album Joy of a Toy, on which he also played keyboards. This led to his role as keyboardist for Ayers' band, Kevin Ayers and the Whole World, who recorded one album, Shooting at the Moon (1970). On that album, in addition to organ and piano, Bedford plays accordion, marimbaphone and guitar. Bedford also contributed to later Kevin Ayers albums as keyboardist and orchestral arranger. Bedford was a former president of the Severnside Composers' Alliance. Recording and arranging Bedford's work with The Whole World led to collaborations with the group's saxophonist Lol Coxhill, with whom he formed the Coxhill-Bedford Duo. The Duo released several singles of old vaudeville and British music hall songs featuring Bedford on piano and lead vocal, and Coxhill on saxophone and second vocal, for John Peel's Dandelion Records label in the early 1970s. One of these singles was released under the pseudonym, Will Dandy and the Dandylettes (covering a medley of Al Jolson songs), with the B-side credited to the Coxhill-Bedford Duo. More tracks by the Duo appear on Coxhill's solo album, Ear of Beholder (1971) on which they play three songs, including an early version of \\"Don Alfonso\\" which Bedford would record again later. Still more Coxhill-Bedford Duo songs can be found on Banana Follies, a 1972 BBC concert radio broadcast featuring Kevin Ayers, released on CD in 1998. In that broadcast, Bedford and Coxhill also perform a short radio play titled \\"Murder in the Air\\". Coxhill later re-recorded the play without Bedford and released it as a 12-inch single, stating in the liner notes that he would have preferred to record it with Bedford, who was unavailable. The first album to consist entirely of David Bedford compositions was Nurses Song with Elephants, recorded at the Marquee Studios, and released in 1972 on John Peel's Dandelion label. On this album, Bedford mixed classical ensemble with poems and voices. Some Bright Stars for Queen's College uses twenty-seven plastic pipe twirlers, John Peel himself being among the pipe twirler players. There are five tracks on the album: It's Easier Than It Looks, Nurses Song With Elephants, Some Bright Stars for Queen's College, Trona (1967), and Sad and Lonely Faces. Bass guitar on the title song is played by Mike Oldfield and the final track features a poem by Kenneth Patchen that is sung by Kevin Ayers. Bedford collaborated even more extensively with Mike Oldfield, The Whole World's bass guitarist. He orchestrated and conducted Oldfield's The Orchestral Tubular Bells album (1975), an adaptation of Tubular Bells, the record that had given the Virgin record label its first major success in 1973. Bedford also orchestrated Oldfield's follow-up album-length composition, Hergest Ridge (1974) as The Orchestral Hergest Ridge, which was performed live and recorded for radio broadcast from concert performances twice, once in 1974 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Steve Hillage on guitar, and once in 1976 by the Scottish National Orchestra, again with Hillage on guitar, although Andy Summers had played on other performances that year. The latter recording was acquired by Virgin, but not released as an album, although portions of it were used in The Space Movie (1979), which featured Oldfield's music. Bedford provided vocals and piano for Oldfield's cover versions of more old music hall numbers (in the manner of the now- defunct Coxhill-Bedford Duo), Don Alfonso (1974) and Speak (Tho' You Only Say Farewell) (1976), collaborated with Oldfield on a piece titled \\"First Excursion\\" for Oldfield's box set compilation Boxed, and orchestrated Oldfield's soundtrack for The Killing Fields (1984). In 1983, Oldfield created a short-lived record label called Oldfield Music whose sole release was a David Bedford album, Star Clusters, Nebulae and Places in Devon / The Song of the White Horse. Bedford's association with Oldfield led to a record contract to make a number of albums for Virgin, some using orchestral players, others featuring Bedford's keyboards, and some include Oldfield as a featured performer. Album titles from this period include Star's End (1974), The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1975, a musical setting of the poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge), The Odyssey (1976, a musical setting of the poem by Homer), and Instructions for Angels (1977), the latter including an appearance by Mike Ratledge. Bedford contributed to records by the Edgar Broughton Band, including a single titled Up Yours!, a polemic on the 1970 UK general election declaring their intention to drop out. The single features a string arrangement by Bedford. Bedford worked on several Roy Harper projects, including the 1971 four-song album Stormcock which also featured Jimmy Page on guitar (credited as S. Flavius Mercurius for contractual reasons), and the 1974 album Valentine. Bedford also conducted an orchestra during Harper's live concerts, including the Valentine's Day launch of the album, the concert later released as Flashes from the Archives of Oblivion and featuring, among others, Keith Moon. In 2001 he was reunited with Harper when the latter celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at London's Royal Festival Hall, joined by numerous guest artists, including Jeff Martin and John Renbourn. A recording of the concert Royal Festival Hall Live - 10 June 2001 was released as a double CD shortly afterwards. He also worked with a wide variety of other artists, including A-ha, Billy Bragg, Camel, Elvis Costello, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Madness, Andy Summers, Alan White (drummer for Yes) and Robert Wyatt. Avant-garde classical compositions All this time, Bedford was also writing avant-garde classical works. The liner notes from a 1970 album cite Piece for Mo (1963) as \\"his first work of standing\\", although that piece has never been recorded for release. Another early composition, Come in Here, Child was recorded twice in the 1960s for two different classical record labels, Mainstream and RCA Red Seal. O Now the Drenched Land Wakes and The Great Birds (two poems for chorus based on the words of Kenneth Patchen, 1966) were released by Deutsche Grammophon on one of their Avant Garde series of albums in 1968. Music for Albion Moonlight was released in 1970 by Argo Records, paired with And Suddenly It's Evening by Elisabeth Lutyens. Star Clusters, Nebulae and Places in Devon (1971), for chorus and brass instruments was premi√®red by the London Philharmonic Choir and the brass of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In With 100 Kazoos (1971), an instrumental ensemble is joined by the audience who are invited to play kazoos. Bedford also composed a number of works for wind orchestra, beginning with Sun Paints Rainbows on the Vast Waves in 1982, commissioned by the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. Many of these works have recorded by the wind orchestra of the Royal Northern College of Music, conducted by Clark Rundell, released by Doyen Records UK in 1998. Bedford combined skilled and non-skilled musicians in other works as well, with Seascapes (1986), for instance, combining a full symphony orchestra with school children, and Stories from the Dreamtime (1991) written for 40 deaf children and orchestra. He was a founding Trustee of the PRS for Music Foundation, which supports the composition of new pieces. After his death, as part of a tribute, one of his later works for children 'The Wreck of the Titanic' received nine performances at venues across England during early 2012. The performance at the SAGE Gateshead included choirs from four North East primary/junior schools. He is noted for the large amount of educational music he wrote for children. The musical notation he used was often unconventional, frequently making use of graphics, thus letting his works be performed by children and others who cannot read conventional notation. For example, in the liner notes to the album Viola Today (1974) by Karen Phillips, it is stated that in the score of Bedford's Spillihpnerak (1972) (the title being the performer's name printed backwards) there is \\"(a) page consisting of a drawing of a lysozyme molecule which the performer is asked to interpret\\".Finnadar Records (1974) LP notes by Karen Phillips from Viola Today LP by Karen Phillips, SR 9007 In general, Bedford's music has a tendency to harmonic stasis, the main interest instead being created by shifting timbres and textures.

Bedford was married three times. His first marriage was to Maureen Parsonage, in 1958, and produced two daughters. His second marriage, to Susan Pilgrim in 1969, also produced two daughters. His first two marriages ended in divorce. He married his third wife, Allison Powell, in 1994, and the couple had a son and two daughters. His third wife and all seven of his children survive him.

A music tracker (short version tracker) is a type of music sequencer software for creating music. The music is represented as discrete musical notes positioned in several channels at discrete chronological positions on a vertical timeline. A music tracker's user interface is usually number based. Notes, parameter changes, effects and other commands are entered with the keyboard into a grid of fixed time slots as codes consisting of letters, numbers and hexadecimal digits. Separate patterns have independent timelines; a complete song consists of a master list of repeated patterns. Later trackers departed from solely using module files, adding other options both to the sound synthesis (hosting generic synthesizers and effects or MIDI output) and to the sequencing (MIDI input and recording), effectively becoming general purpose sequencers with a different user interface. In the 2010s, tracker music is still featured in demoscene products for old hardware platforms and demoparties have often separate tracker music competitions. Tracker music may also be used in non-commercial games which borrow aesthetics from past decades.  History  Schism Tracker with a pure text mode based GUI, playing a module from the video game Bejeweled by Finnish composer Skaven. = 1987: origins on the Amiga = The term tracker derives from Ultimate Soundtracker (the first tracker software) written by Karsten Obarski and released in 1987 by EAS Computer Technik for the Commodore Amiga. Ultimate Soundtracker was a commercial product, but soon shareware clones such as NoiseTracker appeared as well. The general concept of step-sequencing samples numerically, as used in trackers, is also found in the Fairlight CMI sampling workstation of the early 1980s. Some early tracker-like programs appeared for the MSX (Yamaha CX5M) and Commodore 64, before 1987, such as Sound Monitor, but these did not feature sample playback, instead playing notes on the computer's internal synthesizer. Later, programs like Rock Monitor also supported additional sample playback, usually with short drum samples loaded in RAM memory. The first trackers supported four pitch and volume modulated channels of 8-bit PCM samples, a limitation derived from the Amiga's Paula audio chipset and the commonplace 8SVX format used to store sampled sound. However, since the notes were samples, the limitation was less important than those of synthesizing music chips.Commodore's SID or General Instruments' venerable AY-3-8912 and Yamaha's compatible YM2149. = 1990s: MS-DOS PC versions = During the 1990s, tracker musicians gravitated to the PC as software production in general switched from the Amiga platform to the PC. Although the IBM and compatibles initially lacked the hardware sound processing capabilities of the Amiga, with the advent of the Sound Blaster line from Creative, PC audio slowly began to approach CD Quality (44.1 kHz/16 bit/Stereo) with the release of the SoundBlaster 16. Another sound card popular on the PC tracker scene was the Gravis Ultrasound, which continued the hardware mixing tradition, with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage. For a time, it offered unparalleled sound quality and became the choice of discerning tracker musicians. Understanding that the support of tracker music would benefit sales, Gravis gave away some 6000 GUS cards to participants. Coupled with excellent developer documentation, this gesture quickly prompted the GUS to become an integral component of many tracking programs and software. Inevitably, the balance was largely redressed with the introduction of the Sound Blaster AWE32 and its successors, which also featured on-board RAM and wavetable (or sample table) mixing. The responsibility for audio mixing passed from hardware to software (the main CPU) which gradually enabled the use of more channels. From the typical 4 MOD channels of the Amiga, the limit had moved to 7 with TFMX players and 8, first with Oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular OctaMED (all Amiga programs), then 32 with ScreamTracker 3 and FastTracker 2 on the PC and on to 64 with Impulse Tracker (PC) and MED SoundStudio (Amiga and later PC). An Amiga tracker called Symphonie Pro even supported 256 channels. As such, hardware mixing did not last. As processors got faster and acquired special multimedia processing abilities (e.g. MMX) and companies began to push Hardware Abstraction Layers, like DirectX, the AWE and GUS range became obsolete. DirectX, WDM and, now more commonly, ASIO, deliver high-quality sampled audio irrespective of hardware brand. There was also a split off from the sample based trackers taking advantage of the OPL2 and OPL3 chips of the Sound Blaster series. All Sound Tracker was able to combine both the FM synthesis of the OPL chips and the sample based synthesis of the EMU-8000 chips in the Sound Blaster AWE series of cards as well as MIDI output to any additional hardware of choice. Jeskola Buzz is a modular music studio developed from 1997-2000 for Microsoft Windows using a tracker as its sequencer where the sounds where produced by virtual machines (Buzzmachines) such as signal generators, synthesizer emulators, drum computers, samplers, effects and control machines, that where connected in a modular setup. Each machine would have its own tracker, drum machines would use a tracker-like drum pattern editor and effect and control machines could be automated tracker-like via tables of parameters. = 2000s: Multiple platforms = Tracker music could be found in computer games of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Unreal series, Deus Ex, Crusader: No Remorse, Jazz Jackrabbit and Uplink. Some of the early Amiga trackers such as ProTracker and OctaMED have received various updates, mostly for porting to other platforms. ProTracker having resumed development in 2004, with plans for releasing version 5 to Windows and AmigaOS, but only version 4.0 beta 2 for AmigaOS has been released. Renoise, a popular tracker in the 2000s and 2010s. During 2007, Renoise and OpenMPT were presented in Computer Music Magazine as professional and inexpensive alternative to other music production software.  Terminology  There are several elements common to any tracker program: samples, notes, effects, tracks (or channels), patterns, and orders. A sample is a small digital sound file of an instrument, voice, or other sound effect. Most trackers allow a part of the sample to be looped, simulating a sustain of a note. A note designates the frequency at which the sample is played back. By increasing or decreasing the playback speed of a digital sample, the pitch is raised or lowered, simulating instrumental notes (e.g. C, C#, D, etc.). An effect is a special function applied to a particular note. These effects are then applied during playback through either hardware or software. Common tracker effects include volume, portamento, vibrato, retrigger, and arpeggio. A track (or channel) is a space where one sample is played back at a time. Whereas the original Amiga trackers only provided four tracks, the hardware limit, modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing. Tracks have a fixed number of \\"rows\\" on which notes and effects can be placed (most trackers lay out tracks in a vertical fashion). Tracks typically contain 64 rows and 16 beats, although the beats and tempo can be increased or decreased to the composer's taste. A basic drum set could thus be arranged by putting a bass drum at rows 0, 4, 8, 12 etc. of one track and putting some hihat at rows 2, 6, 10, 14 etc. of a second track. Of course, bass and hats could be interleaved on the same track, if the samples are short enough. If not, the previous sample is usually stopped when the next one begins. Some modern trackers simulate polyphony in a single track by setting the \\"new note action\\" of each instrument to cut, continue, fade out, or release, opening new mixing channels as necessary. A pattern is a group of simultaneously played tracks that represents a full section of the song. A pattern usually represents an even number of measures of music composition. An order is part of a sequence of patterns that defines the layout of a song. Patterns can be repeated across multiple orders to save tracking time and file space. There are also some tracker-like programs that utilize tracker-style sequencing schemes, while using real-time sound synthesis instead of samples. Many of these programs are designed for creating music for a particular synthesizer chip such as the OPL chips of the Adlib and SoundBlaster sound cards, or the sound chips of classic home computers. Tracker music is typically stored in module files where the song data and samples are encapsulated in a single file. Several module file formats are supported by popular audio players. Well-known formats include MOD, MED, S3M, XM and IT. Many of these formats can also be imported into existing trackers, allowing to view arrangement, instrumentation and the use of effect commands. This also makes the self-teaching of music composition using trackers easier and allows to extract instruments for later use in own songs, which was very common.

They are known for their hit songs \\"Shimmer\\" from the album Sunburn, \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" and \\"Bad Day\\" from the album Something Like Human, and \\"Falls on Me\\" from the Grammy nominated album Natural Selection, as well as many other songs. The band has had numerous Top 10 Billboard rock hits, multiple videos in heavy rotation on MTV, VH1, and other former video channels, numerous live network TV performances in the US, Canada, and Australia, Platinum singles in Australia in addition to the US, and numerous songs on movie soundtracks such as Scream 3, Daredevil, and Godzilla. The album Sunburn is certified Platinum by the RIAA, and the album Something Like Human is certified Double-Platinum by the RIAA. The band has worldwide record sales of nearly 4 million records. \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" was the No. 1 Active Rock song for 13 weeks and became the No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to Billboard's Best of the 2000s Rock Songs Charts. In 2013 \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboard's Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. They have released five studio albums, most recently Puppet Strings in 2014. The band has toured extensively from arenas to clubs throughout the world and continues to tour today. History =Early years (1989‚Äì1997)= Fuel was formed in 1989 in the western Tennessee town of Kenton when Carl Bell and Jeff Abercrombie, childhood friends, started playing music together in junior high and high school and played in various garage bands. After graduating high school, Bell, who was a few years older than Abercrombie, headed off to college where he met drummer Jody Abbott. Bell and Abbott formed a college campus band, Wanted (along with Robert Wagner and Mark Crawford) in Henderson, Tennessee. The band Wanted transitioned into Phoenix, which was a touring band for the college primarily used to recruit prospective students. After college, Bell and Abercrombie, who at the time was attending college at the University of Tennessee at Martin, reunited along with Abbott and formed the band Reel Too Real, playing cover songs at local clubs in Tennessee and eventually becoming a national touring club circuit band. Lead vocalist- guitarist Brett Scallions joined the group after bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw him performing in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee in 1993 and later asked him to join in 1994.Anderson, Philip. \\"Interview with Carl Bell/Fuel\\" . KAOS2000 Magazine. March 3, 1999. Keyboardist, Erik Avakian joined the group in 1993. During this time, Carl played guitar and provided backing vocals, Jeff played bass, Jody was on drums, Brett played guitar and sung lead vocals, and Erik played keyboards and shared singing duties on different songs, like most cover bands. That same year, the band moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played at local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs under the name Reel Too Real, playing cover songs. The band made a choice to go under a different name when showcasing its own original material. That name, for the time being, would be Small the Joy, which put out one EP in 1994. The band once again decided to change its name, this time settling on the name Fuel, before releasing their second EP, Porcelain, in 1996 as well as repackaging their first EP, Small the Joy, with the \\"Fuel\\" name on it. Erik played keyboards and sung backing vocals on both EP's before leaving the band in 2006. Porcelain sold well locally, spawning a small local radio hit with \\"Shimmer\\" even before being signed to a major label. The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their third EP, Hazleton, the following year. =Mainstream success (1998‚Äì2003)= Upon signing to Epic, the band entered Longview Farm recording studios in Massachusetts, along with producer Steven Haigler and session drummer Jonathan Mover due to problems with Abbott. The band's full-length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. \\"Shimmer\\" was again included and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 37 on the Adult Top 40 chart and at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as Platinum single sales in Australia; while, the other singles (\\"Bittersweet\\" which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Rock Mainstream charts, \\"Jesus or a Gun\\", and \\"Sunburn,\\") received some airplay. The songs \\"Shimmer\\" and \\"Sunburn\\" are also featured on the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. \\"Sunburn\\" was also featured in the movie Scream 3, and the band contributed the non-LP track \\"Walk the Sky\\" to the 1998 American Godzilla film. The band hit the road in support of the release. Once again due to problems with Abbott, Mover was enlisted, this time to play drums on tour while the band sought out a full-time drummer to join. Liner notes for the cassette and CD issues of \\"Sunburn\\" list the band members as Carl Bell (guitar), Brett Scallions (vocals), Jeff Abercrombie (bass), and Kevin Miller (drums), although Jonathan Mover is credited with playing all the drums and percussion on the record. The band picture includes Miller, though he did not play on the record. The album Sunburn was the band's first Gold and Platinum selling record. Fuel NYC Hammerstein Ballroom Dec 20, 2001 In 2000, Fuel came back with their second album, Something Like Human, featuring the single \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" which was No. 1 for 12 weeks on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single was also named Billboards No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to their Best of the 2000s Rock Songs chart. In 2013 \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboards Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. Something Like Human peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA on September 25, 2001. The group's third album, Natural Selection, named after Darwinian theory, was released in September 2003 and debuted at No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard charts.

The album spawned the hit \\"Falls on Me\\", which hit No. 9 and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts, and reaching No. 13 and No. 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, peaking at No. 52 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004 for best engineered album, and the band contributed the song \\"Won't Back Down\\" to the Daredevil soundtrack earlier in the year. They released their greatest hits album The Best of Fuel on December 13, 2005. Their song \\"Quarter\\" was featured in the games \\"Need for Speed: Underground\\", \\"NFL Street\\" and \\"NASCAR Thunder 2004\\". =Line-up changes and Angels & Devils (2004‚Äì2007)= After disagreements (both public and private), drummer Kevin Miller was dismissed from the band in 2004. On February 7, 2006, Fuel announced through their website that singer Brett Scallions had left the band. Fuel had already laid down the instrumental tracks for their fourth album and soon started auditioning singers so the band could move forward. Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed \\"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\\" on the show. The single shot up to the Top 10 download list on iTunes and stayed there for a number of days. This also sparked interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear in the Top 100 download chart on iTunes. On March 3, 2006, judge Randy Jackson stated in an interview that Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight.\\"Carl Bell Of Fuel Talks About Am Idol Singer....\\" Melodic.net. May 16, 2006. On May 11, 2006, Abercrombie and Bell appeared on the TV show Extra to officially offer Daughtry the job. However, though flattered, Daughtry turned down this offer. By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named as Fuel's drummer on Fuel's Myspace page. On June 8, 2006, Bell announced that the band had found a new lead singer but were waiting confirmation from the record label to announce it. Still, they officially entered the studio in mid-August with producer Scott Humphrey to start recording their fourth album. Due to other commitments Stewart was not available to play drums on the album, so Tommy Lee and Josh Freese performed drums in his place. The band posted photos from the studio fairly often on the band's website and MySpace. On March 9, 2007, Carl Bell officially announced that Fuel's next album, complete with new band members, was fully mixed and going to mastering, and on April 19, 2007, he posted on Fuel's official website that their new lead singer was Toryn Green. On May 15, 2007, Bell announced the title of the new album‚ÄîAngels & Devils. On June 19, 2007, Fuel's first single from their new album, \\"Wasted Time\\", was released into rock radio and internet download and peaked at No. 24 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The album was released on August 7, 2007. A second single, \\"Gone,\\" was released on October 23. Angels & Devils debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 42, selling about 15,000 copies in its first week.Katie Hasty, \\"After Five-Year Absence, UGK Scores First No. 1 Album\\", Billboard.com, August 15, 2007.

The band consisted of Scallions with an entirely new lineup. \\"There is only one original of anything\\" says Scallions, \\"and that includes Fuel. The original lineup with Carl, Jeff, Jody and myself will always be something special to all of us, and our first Fuelies (a term for Fuel fans) but it has been thirteen years since the original lineup was intact, and since then many great musicians have come and gone. The lineup I put together for Fuel is not meant to replace or diminish what any of the original members created. Just the opposite, it is to give our fans a live destination, and to keep the Fuel name alive for a new generation to discover. Maybe someday we'll all get on the same page and play together again, but life happens and the next thing you know you just can't jump on a bus and take off for a month, let alone a year.\\" It was later announced on June 25, 2010 that former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd had joined the band to replace Yogi Lonich on lead guitar.\\"Former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd Joins Fuel\\" Tunelab.com. June 26, 2010. Lonich returned to the band in January 2011. Jasin Todd left the band on good terms. In March 2011, Brett Scallions started a new band called World Fire Brigade. The lineup for World Fire Brigade included all current members of Fuel in addition to Smile Empty Soul vocalist/guitarist Sean Danielsen. The re-formed Fuel performed at The Bamboozle in East Rutherford, New Jersey on May 1, 2011. The band played Bethlehem Musikfest alongside Buckcherry, however Yogi Lonich was not on stage. A friend of Scallions, Martin Estrada, filled in for the show. Brett Scallions announced on his official Facebook page that Yogi Lonich was fired from the band for his lack of commitment or loyalty. Scallions also hinted that there is in fact a new Fuel record in the works and also introduced the band's new lead guitarist, Andy Andersson. The band continued its tour and played new material during their shows. Fuel entered the studio on March 8, 2012 to record their fifth full-length studio album, Puppet Strings. Eddie Wohl, producer of the World Fire Brigade album, produced the new Fuel album. In late September the band re-entered the studio to complete the guitar and bass tracks for the record. As of February 2013 the band was still in the studio finishing off vocal and guitar tracks. Originally planned for a 2012 release the album had been pushed back to a possible mid-2013 release. This marked six years since the band released their previous album Angels & Devils. On April 30, 2013 drummer Ken Schalk announced his departure from the band to spend more time with his family. On that same day Scallions announced new drummer Bryan \\"Keelgood\\" Keeling. The band, however, kept Schalk's drum tracks, as referenced by Keeling in his first interview since joining the band. On April 30, 2013 Brett Scallions announced that a new Fuel single was targeted for a mid-summer release via download once the \\"details have been worked out and handshakes have been made\\". On June 26, 2013, Scallions announced that Bryan Keeling was going out on tour with Eric Sardinas in Europe and that Shannon Boone (current drummer for Puddle of Mudd) had joined the band. Scallions also commented on the new album; \\"The record has been recorded and is so close to being released for all of you I can taste it. There will be big announcements very soon regarding release dates, singles, videos, and much much more. Take care and we will see you all soon at a venue near you!\\" Scallions confirmed that the new album was mixed by Ben Grosse who also collaborated with Fuel on the Something Like Human album. According to Scallions the new album was currently in the mastering stage of production. It was announced through Guitar World on December 5, 2013 that the album indeed titled, Puppet Strings, would be released March 4, 2014. The song, \\"Yeah!\\" was released for free download on the website as well, although it was believed to be the first single, Scallions stated that it is not the first single, but rather a \\"teaser.\\" The first single, \\"Soul To Preach To\\" was released late January 2014. In May 2015 as Fuel geared up to join Everclear on their Summerland Tour, ex-Filter bass player Phil Buckman temporarily replaced Brad Stewart, with Stewart himself filling in for the band Saliva. Although Brad stated he was scheduled to re-join Fuel on June 9, the temporary switch proved to be permanent with Stewart continuing his new role in Saliva, as did Buckman with Fuel. The band took part in the Make America Rock Again tour in mid- to late 2016. =Upcoming sixth studio album (2016‚Äìpresent)= Brett Scallions has made many posts on Facebook and Instagram of him working in the studio on the new Fuel record. Scallions commented in one of the photos that the sixth album will be out in the future. The band toured in August and September in 2017 and toured Australia and New Zealand in December 2017. Scallions has said that Fuel will tour in 2018 playing its first album in its entirety marking its 20th anniversary year.

The communications regulator Ofcom requires that certain television and radio broadcasters fulfil certain requirements as part of their license to broadcast. All of the BBC's television and radio stations have a public service remit, including those that broadcast digitally.  History  The BBC, whose broadcasting in the UK is funded by a licence fee and does not sell advertising time, is most notable for being the first public service broadcaster in the UK. Its first director general, Lord Reith introduced many of the concepts that would later define public service broadcasting in the UK when he adopted the mission to \\"inform, educate and entertain\\". With the launch of the first commercial broadcaster ITV in 1955, the government required that the local franchises fulfilled a similar obligation, mandating a certain level of local news coverage, arts and religious programming, in return for the right to broadcast. The next commercial television broadcasters in the UK, the state-owned Channel 4 and S4C, were set up by the government in 1981 to provide different forms of public broadcasting. Channel 4 was required to be a public service alternative to the BBC and to cater for minorities and arts. S4C was to be a mainly Welsh language programmer. Neither was required to be commercially successful as Channel 4 was subsidised by the ITV network and S4C received a grant from the central government. However, Channel 4 was later restructured under the Broadcasting Act 1990 to be a state owned corporation that is self-financing and from 2013 the BBC took over funding for S4C. When the final analogue terrestrial broadcaster, Channel 5, was launched in 1997 it too was given a number of public service requirements. These included the obligation to provide minimum amounts of programming from various genres, minimum amounts of programming originally commissioned by the channel and of European origin, and maximum limits on the number of repeats. Future viability The advent of digital age has brought about many questions about the future of public service broadcasting in the UK. The BBC has been criticised by some for being expansionist and exceeding its public service remit by providing content that could be provided by commercial broadcasters. They argue that the BBC can distort the market, making it difficult for commercial providers to operate. A notable example of this is the Internet services provided by the BBC. However, those who defend the BBC suggest that the BBC needs to provide new services and entertainment, to remain relevant in the digital age . ITV has been attempting to significantly reduce its obligations to produce and broadcast unprofitable public service programming, citing the increased competition from digital and multichannel television.

Nearby towns include Grand Rapids, Hibbing and Virginia, Minnesota. Hull‚ÄìRust‚ÄìMahoning Open Pit Iron Mine, Mesabi Range, 2010 The Mesabi Iron Range is a mining district in northeastern Minnesota following an elongate trend containing large deposits of iron ore. It is the largest of four major iron ranges in the region collectively known as the Iron Range of Minnesota. First described in 1866, it is the chief iron ore mining district in the United States. The district is located largely in Itasca and Saint Louis counties. It has been extensively worked since 1892, and has seen a transition from high-grade direct shipping ores through gravity concentrates to the current industry exclusively producing iron ore (taconite) pellets. Production has been dominantly controlled by vertically integrated steelmakers since 1901, and therefore is dictated largely by US ironmaking capacity and demand. Name The Mesabi Range was known to the local Ojibwe as Misaabe-wajiw (\\"Giant mountain\\").The Ojibwe peoples dictionary. Minnesota Geographic Names. Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society (Minnesota Historical Society: St. Paul, 1920), page 504. Available in fulltext at Google Book Search .John D. Nichols and Earl Nyholm. A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe. University of Minnesota Press (University of Minnesota: Minneapolis, 1995) Throughout the Mesabi Range, \\"Mesaba\\" and \\"Missabe\\" spelling variations are found along with places containing \\"Giant\\" in their names. Geology There are three iron ranges in northern Minnesota, the Cuyuna, the Vermilion, and the Mesabi. Most of the world's iron ore, including that contained in northern Minnesota, was formed during the middle Precambrian. During this period, erosion leveled mountains. This erosion released iron and silica into the waters of a new sea. Marine algae living in this new sea raised the level of atmospheric oxygen. This oxygen catastrophe caused the eroded iron to precipitate into the banded iron formations found in northern Minnesota and other members of the Animikie Group. Over billions of years, geological forces left behind ore deposits of varied quality and concentrations ‚Äì differences that would determine how the ore was mined from place to place. On the Mesabi Range, stretching from Grand Rapids to Babbitt, soft ore lay close to the surface, where it could be scooped from open pit mines. The overall structure of the range is that of a monocline dipping 5 to 15 degrees to the southeast. Key faults include the Calumet, La Rue, Morton, Biwabik, and the Siphon. The Duluth Gabbro complex to the east has caused metamorphic changes in the Biwabik formation. The natural iron ores and the magnetite taconites occur in this Precambrian Biwabik formation, which is a cherty layer thick. The natural ores are located in elongated channels or tabular deposits, while the magnetite taconites occur in stratigraphic zones. Natural ores have an iron content of 51 to 57 per cent while the pellets contain 60 to 67 per cent. The natural ores are mainly mixtures of hematite and goethite. The most common silicate is Minnesotaite. Also of note are the presence of algal structures in the Biwabik formation. Physical extent The Mesabi Range is long. Heights vary from . The highest point, located about northeast of Virginia, is Pike Mountain at . The range trends from the northeast to the southwest, extending from Babbitt to Grand Rapids. Mesabi Range =Embarrass Mountains= The Embarrass Mountains are a small subrange of the Mesabi Range, spanning about through northern White Township and Hoyt Lakes in St. Louis County. Heights vary from . The highest point, at , is roughly west of the unincorporated community of Hinsdale, near the former Erie Mining Company's pits and taconite processing plant. Mining operations Open-pit iron mining with 5-ton steam shovels, Hibbing, Minnesota c. 1906 Duluth Ore Docks circa 1900‚Äì1915 Hull‚ÄìRust‚ÄìMahoning Open Pit Iron Mine circa 1946 Iron-bearing rocks were noted by the Minnesota State Geologist Henry H. Eames in 1866. Iron ore was discovered north of Mountain Iron, Minnesota on 16 Nov. 1890 by J.A. Nichols of the Merritt brothers. The range was defined by 1900. Initially underground mines were employed but these gave way to open pits so that by 1902, half the operations were conducted this way. The last underground mine closed in 1960. Natural ores eventually gave way to iron-ore concentrates from magnetite taconite so that by 1965 one third of production came from these pellets. Iron ore is currently mined only from open pits, although some mines operated underground early on.Iron Range ‚Äì The Mining Frontier . Macalester College. Much of the softer ore was formed close to the surface, allowing mining operations to be conducted via open pit mines. The world's largest open pit iron ore mine is the Hull‚ÄìRust‚ÄìMahoning Open Pit Iron Mine in Hibbing. In the early years of mining from the late 19th century until the 1950s, mining focus was on high grade ore that could be processed into steel without much change. However, when that supply dried up, focus shifted to lower-grade ore (taconite) which requires extensive processing at large mining-processing facilities before moving to port. The mined ore is then transported, primarily by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway, to the ports of Two Harbors and Duluth. At Duluth, trains of up to eighty 100-ton open cars are moved out on massive ore docks to be dumped into \\"lakers\\" of up to 60,000 tons weight for movement to steel mills in Indiana and Ohio. Dormant and exhausted open pit mines are a common feature along the Iron Range. Some of these sites have been redeveloped for other uses. For instance, the Virginia Pilot is a project which focuses on redeveloping the grounds adjacent to the old mines into low- to moderate-income residential space. The Hill-Annex Mine is now a state park and offers tours to visitors who wish to learn about mine operations. Tours are guided by former mine workers. Currently, there are six mining-processing facilities in operation on the Iron Range. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. owns and operates Northshore Mining, which has mining operations in Babbitt and crushing, concentrating (grinding) and pelletizing operations in Silver Bay, along with United Taconite which has mining operations in Eveleth and crushing, concentrating and pelletizing operations in Forbes. Arcelor Mittal owns and operates the Minorca Mine and Plant with mining operations near Biwabik and Gilbert and a crushing, concentrating and pelletizing facility near Virginia (). United States Steel owns and operates both KeeTac () and Minntac () with mining and processing facilities in Keewatin and Mountain Iron respectively. The last facility is Hibbing Taconite which operates a mine and plant between the cities of Hibbing and Chisholm. Hibbing Taconite is majority owned and managed by ArcelorMittal USA, with minority stakes held by Cleveland-Cliffs and United States Steel. In addition, Mesabi Metallics (controlled by Essar Steel) is constructing a mine/plant near Nashwauk that has plans to not only mine and process the taconite. Steel Dynamics and Kobe Steel formerly owned and operated Mesabi Nugget () near Hoyt Lakes which does not yet mine its own material, but produced high-iron content nuggets from purchase iron ore concentrate. Magnetation, Inc. formerly produced iron ore concentrate reclaimed from tailings with company-designed high-power magnetic separators to produce concentrate to sell and ship throughout the world. Rockefellers' Interests John D. Rockefeller had previously loaned money to his brother, Frank Rockefeller, and Frank's business associate, James Corrigan to buy into the Franklin Iron Mine Company, which operated in the Mesabi Range. By late 1896 or early 1897, John D. took Corrigan's shares due to failure to repay loans. Frank and Carrigan were forced to sell the company. The market for ore from the Mesabi range was almost non-existent at this time because American steel furnaces were not built to deal with its powdery nature and steelmakers believed it to be poor ore. John D. invested $40 million to build up the Mesabi ore and transportation business. To reach the steelmakers in Pittsburgh, the ore had to travel across the Great Lakes to Cleveland. He invested $2 million into a railroad to transport the ore from the Mesabi range to Duluth on Lake Superior. By 1896, he controlled the Lake Superior Consolidated Iron Mines Company, which was a holding company of the Merritt brothers. He built a fleet of ore ships. In December 1896, he made a deal with Henry W. Oliver and Andrew Carnegie of Pittsburgh whereby they agreed not to go into the ore field or transportation business, and John D. agreed not to go into the steel business. The steelmakers adapted their mills to process the ore from the Mesabi range. Oliver broke with the agreement, and in response, John D. procured a monopoly of ore ship transportation on the Great Lakes. John D. sold his western ore holdings to J.P. Morgan for $90,900,000 soon after Morgan bought Carnegie's steel interests in 1901. Labor strikes Miners at work on the Mesabi Range 1903. Several large-scale strikes took place on the Mesabi Iron Range during the early 1900s. The first began on July 20, 1907 after the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) asked Oliver Iron Mining Company for, among other demands, an eight-hour work day and a pay raise. The strike lasted two months and resulted in thousands of workers being blacklisted. In June 1913, the WFM organized a strike of the copper companies in the region, again demanding shorter hours and better pay. This unsuccessful strike lasted 265 days and is known as the Copper Country Strike of 1913‚Äì1914. On June 25, 1916, a miner left his shift after being paid less than the contracted rate. His action led to the Mesabi range strike of 1916. The Industrial Workers of the World quickly supported the strike for better pay and shorter hours. In September 1916, the workers voted to resume work, assuming a failed strike. However, shortly after returning to work a 10% raise in wages was issued for workers throughout the Range.

The band is best known for its 1999 number one single \\"Everything You Want\\". History =Early years (1991‚Äì1998)= Vertical Horizon was formed in 1991 by Georgetown University undergrads Matthew Scannell and Keith Kane. In 1992, after graduating from Georgetown, the duo relocated to Boston and self-released their debut album There and Back Again. Scannell and Kane toured as a duo for the next few years, mostly appearing with similar bands, such as Jackopierce. Their next album was 1995's Running on Ice, produced by John Alagia (Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer), Doug Derryberry, and Scannell. Drummer Ed Toth joined the band in 1996. The band released a live album, Live Stages, in January 1997. In 1998, bassist Sean Hurley was invited to join Vertical Horizon. The band's indie albums began to attract record executives from several record labels during the late 1990s. The band signed with RCA Records in 1998. RCA re-released Vertical Horizon's independent albums, with new packaging and graphics. Before the RCA re-release, the band's first three albums had sold 70,000 combined units. =Everything You Want (1999‚Äì2000)= The band's first album with a major label was 1999's Everything You Want. It was a breakthrough album for the band. Four singles were released from the album. The album's first single was \\"We Are,\\" which reached the Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at no. 21. The album's second single was \\"Everything You Want.\\" The song became a massive hit, reaching number one at the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the Adult Top 40 chart and becoming Billboard's Most Played Single of 2000. As of 2020, \\"Everything You Want\\" is Vertical Horizon's most successful single. Two other singles from the album, \\"You're a God\\" and \\"Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning),\\" were also hits; they peaked at 23 and 58, respectively, at the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2001, the Everything You Want album was certified double platinum by the RIAA, having sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States. =Go and Go 2.0 (2001‚Äì2005)= Vertical Horizon's next album, Go, was released in September 2003. Go was released while RCA was going through a major restructuring and as a result, the album received little support from the label.Chad. \\"Vertical Horizon Plans New Album\\". www.alternativeaddiction.com.

","title":"Vertical Horizon"},{"id":"172460","title":"1930 in film"},{"id":"172466","text":"Jean Buridan (; Latin: Johannes Buridanus; ‚Äì ) was an influential 14th century French philosopher. Buridan was a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris for his entire career, focusing in particular on logic and the works of Aristotle. Buridan sowed the seeds of the Copernican revolution in Europe.Kuhn, T. The Copernican Revolution, 1958, pp. 119‚Äì123. He developed the concept of impetus, the first step toward the modern concept of inertia and an important development in the history of medieval science. His name is most familiar through the thought experiment known as Buridan's ass; however, this thought experiment does not appear in his extant writings. Life =Education and career= 14th century Manuscript of Buridan's Questions on Aristotle's De Anima. Buridan was born sometime before 1301, perhaps at or near the town of B√©thune in Picardy, France,Zupko 2015, ¬ß1 or perhaps elsewhere in the diocese of Arras. He received his education in Paris, first at the Coll√®ge du Cardinal Lemoine and then at the University of Paris, receiving his Master of Arts degree and formal license to teach at the latter by the mid-1320s. Unusually, he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts, rather than obtaining the doctorate in law, medicine or theology that typically prepared the way for a career in philosophy. Also unusual for a philosopher of his time, Buridan further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a secular cleric, rather than joining a religious order. A papal letter of 1330 refers to him as simply, \\"clericus Atrebatensis diocoesis, magister in artibus [a cleric from the Diocese of Arras and Master of Arts].\\"Faral 1951, p. 11 As university statutes only permitted those educated in theology to teach or write on the subject, there are no writings from Buridan on either theological matters or commentary of Peter Lombard's Sentences. Speculation on his reasons for avoiding religious matters have remained uncertain.Zupko 2004, ch. 10Courtenay 2002Courtenay 2005 Most scholars think it is unlikely that he went unnoticed, given his philosophical talents. As well, it is unlikely that he could not afford to study theology, given that he received several bursaries and stipends. Indeed, he is listed in a document from 1350 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the University. Zupko has speculated that Buridan \\"deliberately chose to remain among the 'artists [artistae],'\\" possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect, rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine. The last appearance of Buridan in historical documents came in 1359, where he was mentioned as the adjudicator in a territorial dispute between the English and Picard nations. It is supposed that he died sometime after then, since one of his benefices was awarded to another person in 1362.Michael 1986, pp. 79‚Äì238 399‚Äì404 The bishop Albert of Saxony, himself renowned as a logician, was among the most notable of his students. An ordinance of Louis XI of France in 1473, directed against the nominalists, prohibited the reading of his works. =Apocryphal stories= Apocryphal stories abound about his reputed amorous affairs and adventures which are enough to show that he enjoyed a reputation as a glamorous and mysterious figure in Paris life.Faral 1951, p. 16 None of the stories can be confirmed, and most contradict known historical information.Faral 1951, p. 9-33 Some rumors hold that he died when the King of France had him put in a sack and thrown into the River Seine after his affair with the Queen came to light. Fran√ßois Villon alludes to this in his famous poem Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis. Others suggest that he was expelled from Paris due to his nominalist teachings and moved to Vienna to found the University of Vienna. Another story talks of him hitting Pope Clement VI with a shoe. Impetus theory The concept of inertia was alien to the physics of Aristotle. Aristotle, and his peripatetic followers held that a body was only maintained in motion by the action of a continuous external force. Thus, in the Aristotelian view, a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to eddies or vibrations in the surrounding medium, a phenomenon known as antiperistasis. In the absence of a proximate force, the body would come to rest almost immediately. The theory of impetus proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body, imparted when it was set in motion. Buridan was the first to name this motion-maintaining property impetus but the theory itself probably did not originate with him. A less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in the Avicenna's doctrine of mayl (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by John Philoponus who was developing the Stoic notion of horm√© (impulse).Zupko 1997 The major difference between Buridan's theory and that of his predecessor is that he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously, instead asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus. Buridan further held that the impetus of a body increased with the speed with which it was set in motion, and with its quantity of matter. This is closely related to the modern concept of momentum. Buridan saw impetus as causing the motion of the object: :...after leaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion (Questions on Aristotle's Metaphysics XII.9: 73ra).T. F. Glick, S. J. Livesay, F. Wallis, Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia, 2005, p. 107. Buridan also contended that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined by the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject. In this way, the acceleration of a falling body could be understood in terms of its gradual accumulation of units of impetus. =Legacy= Because of his developments, historians of science Pierre Duhem and Anneliese Maier both saw Buridan as playing an important role in the demise of Aristotelian cosmology. Duhem even called Buridan the forerunner of Galileo.Duhem 1906‚Äì13 Zupko has disagreed, pointing out that Buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics, but instead remained a committed Aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent.

Hauser's claims, and his subsequent death by stabbing, sparked much debate and controversy. Theories propounded at the time linked him with the grand ducal House of Baden and proposed his birth had been hidden as part of royal intrigue. These opinions in many ways have been documented by later investigation.d Heydenreuter: K√∂nig Ludwig I. und der Fall Kaspar Hauser, in: Staat und Verwaltung in Bayern. Festschrift f√ºr Wilhelm Volkert zum 75. Geburtstag. Ed. by Konrad Ackermann and Alois Schmid, Munich 2003, pp. 465‚Äì476, here p. 465. Many during and after Hauser's life have also argued that he was most likely a fraud.  History  = First appearance = On 26 May 1828, a teenage boy appeared in the streets of Nuremberg, Germany. He carried a letter with him addressed to the captain of the 4th squadron of the 6th cavalry regiment, Captain von Wessenig. Its heading read: Von der B√§ierischen Gr√§nz / da√ü Orte ist unbenant / 1828 (\\"From the Bavarian border / The place is unnamed / 1828\\"). The anonymous author said that the boy was given into his custody as an infant on 7 October 1812 and that he instructed him in reading, writing and the Christian religion, but never let him \\"take a single step out of my house\\". The letter stated that the boy would now like to be a cavalryman \\"as his father was\\" and invited the captain either to take him in or to hang him. There was another short letter enclosed purporting to be from his mother to his prior caretaker. It stated that his name was Kaspar, that he was born on 30 April 1812 and that his father, a cavalryman of the 6th regiment, was dead. In fact this letter was found to have been written by the same hand as the other one (whose line \\"he writes my handwriting exactly as I do\\" led later analysts to assume that Kaspar himself wrote both of them).Ivo Striedinger: Neues Schrifttum √ºber Kaspar Hauser, in: Zeitschrift f√ºr bayerische Landesgeschichte, 6. Vol., 1933, pp. 415‚Äì484, here p. 452 A shoemaker named Weickmann took the boy to the house of Captain von Wessenig, where he would repeat only the words \\"I want to be a cavalryman, as my father was\\" and \\"Horse! Horse!\\" Further demands elicited only tears or the obstinate proclamation of \\"Don't know.\\" He was taken to a police station, where he would write a name: Kaspar Hauser. He showed that he was familiar with money, could say some prayers and read a little, but he answered few questions and his vocabulary appeared to be rather limited.Ivo Striedinger: Hauser Kaspar, der ‚Äûr√§tselhafte Findling‚Äú, in: Lebensl√§ufe aus Franken, III. Vol., 1927, pp. 199‚Äì215; here pp. 199‚Äì200 Because he provided no account of himself, he was imprisoned as a vagabond.Bondeson (2004), 77 He spent the following two months in Luginsland Tower in Nuremberg Castle in the care of a jailer named Andreas Hiltel. Despite what many later accounts would say, he was in good physical condition and could walk well; for example, he climbed over 90 steps to his room. He was of a \\"healthy facial complexion\\"police description, dated 7 July 1828; see e.g. Jochen H√∂risch (ed.): Ich m√∂chte ein solcher werden wie...: Materialien zur Sprachlosigkeit des Kaspar Hauser, Suhrkamp 1979, pp. 33‚Äì34 and approximately 16 years old, but appeared to be intellectually impaired. Mayor Binder, however, claimed that the boy had an excellent memory and was learning quickly. Various curious people visited him to his apparent delight. He refused all food except bread and water. Statue of Kaspar, old city centre, Ansbach, Germany  Hauser's story about his life in a dungeon  At first it was assumed that he was raised half-wild in forests, but during many conversations with Mayor Binder, Hauser told a different version of his past life, which he later also wrote down in more detail.Ivo Striedinger 1927, pp. 200‚Äì201; for the primary sources, see e. g. Jochen H√∂risch 1979 According to this story, for as long as he could remember he spent his life totally alone in a darkened cell about two metres long, one metre wide and one and a half high with only a straw bed to sleep on and two horses and a dog carved out of wood for toys. He claimed that he found rye bread and water next to his bed each morning. Periodically the water would taste bitter and drinking it would cause him to sleep more heavily than usual. On such occasions, when he awakened, his straw had been changed and his hair and nails cut. Hauser claimed that the first human being with whom he ever had contact was a mysterious man who visited him not long before his release, always taking great care not to reveal his face to him. This man, Hauser said, taught him to write his name by leading his hand. After learning to stand and walk, he was brought to Nuremberg. Furthermore, the stranger allegedly taught him to say the phrase \\"I want to be a cavalryman, as my father was\\" (in Old Bavarian dialect), but Hauser claimed that he did not understand what these words meant. This tale aroused great curiosity and made Hauser an object of international attention. Rumours arose that he was of princely parentage, possibly of Baden origin, but there were also claims that he was an impostor. Pencil drawing by Kaspar Hauser, 1829 = Further life in Nuremberg = Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach, president of the Bavarian court of appeals, began to investigate the case. Hauser was formally adopted by the town of Nuremberg and money was donated for his upkeep and education.Bondeson (2004), 80 He was given into the care of Friedrich Daumer, a schoolmaster and speculative philosopher, who taught him various subjects and who thereby discovered his talent for drawing. He appeared to flourish in this environment. Daumer also subjected him to homeopathic treatments and magnetic experiments. As Feuerbach told the story, \\"When Professor Daumer held the north pole [of a magnet] towards him, Kaspar put his hand to the pit of his stomach, and, drawing his waistcoat in an outward direction, said that it drew him thus; and that a current of air seemed to proceed from him. The south pole affected him less powerfully; and he said that it blew upon him.\\"Anselm von Feuerbach: Caspar Hauser, translated by Gotfried Linberg, Allen and Ticknor 1832, p. 132  Cut wound  On 17 October 1829, Hauser did not come to the midday meal, but was found in the cellar of Daumer's house bleeding from a cut wound on the forehead. He asserted that while sitting on the privy, he was attacked and wounded by a hooded man who also threatened him with the words: \\"You still have to die ere you leave the city of Nuremberg.\\" Hauser said that by the voice, he recognized the man as the one who had brought him to Nuremberg. As was obvious from his blood trail, Hauser at first fled to the first floor where his room was, but then, instead of moving on to his caretakers, he returned downstairs and climbed through a trap door into the cellar. Alarmed officials called for a police escort and transferred him to the care of Johann Biberbach, one of the municipal authorities. The alleged attack on Hauser also fuelled rumours about his possible descent from Hungary, England or the House of Baden. Hauser's critics are of the opinion that he inflicted the wound on himself with a razor, which he then took back to his room before going to the cellar.Fritz Trautz: Zum Problem der Pers√∂nlichkeitsdeutung: Anl√§√ülich das Kaspar-Hauser-Buches von Jean Mistler, in: Francia 2, 1974, pp. 715‚Äì731, here pp. 717‚Äì718 He might have done so to arouse pity and thus escape chiding for a recent quarrel with Daumer, who had come to believe that the boy had a tendency to lie.Ivo Striedinger 1927, p. 201 and p. 206 Kaspar Hauser, 1830  The \\"pistol accident\\"  On 3 April 1830, a pistol shot went off in Hauser's room at the Biberbachs' house. His escort hurriedly entered the room and found him bleeding from a wound to the right side of his head. Hauser quickly revived and stated that he climbed on a chair to get some books, the chair fell and while trying to hold on to something he accidentally tore down the pistol hanging on the wall, causing the shot to go off. There are doubts whether the benign wound was actually caused by the shot and some authors associate the incident with a preceding quarrel in which, again, Hauser was reproached for lying.Fritz Trautz 1974, pp. 718‚Äì719 Whatever the case, the occurrence led the municipal authorities to come to another decision on Hauser, whose initially good relationship with the Biberbach family had soured. In May 1830, he was transferred to the house of Baron von Tucher,Jean Mistler: Gaspard Hauser, un drame de la personnalit√©, Fayard 1971, pp. 170‚Äì171 who later also complained about Hauser's exorbitant vanity and lies. Perhaps the sharpest judgment passed on Hauser was the one by Mrs. Biberbach, who commented on his \\"horrendous mendacity\\" and \\"art of dissimulation\\" and called him \\"full of vanity and spite\\".Walther Schreibm√ºller 1991, p. 53 = Lord Stanhope = A British nobleman, Lord Stanhope, took an interest in Hauser and gained custody of him late in 1831. He spent a great deal of money attempting to clarify Hauser's origin. In particular, he paid for two visits to Hungary hoping to jog the boy's memory, as Hauser seemed to remember some Hungarian words and had once declared that the Hungarian Countess Maytheny was his mother. Hauser failed to recognize any buildings or monuments in Hungary. A Hungarian nobleman who had met Hauser later told Stanhope that he and his son had a good laugh when they recollected the strange boy and his histrionic behavior.Bondeson (2004), 88‚Äì9 Stanhope later wrote that the complete failure of these inquiries led him to doubt Hauser's credibility. In December 1831, he transferred Hauser to Ansbach, to the care of a schoolmaster named Johann Georg Meyer, and in January 1832, Stanhope left Hauser for good. Stanhope continued to pay for Hauser's living expenses but never made good on his promise that he would take him to England. After Hauser's death, Stanhope published a book in which he presented all known evidence against Hauser, taking it as his \\"duty openly to confess that I had been deceived.\\" Followers of Hauser suspect Stanhope of ulterior motives and connections to the House of Baden, but academic historiography defends him as a philanthropist, a pious man and a seeker of truth.Ivo Striedinger: 1933, pp. 424‚Äì429; Walther Schreibm√ºller 1991, pp. 46‚Äì47 = Life and death in Ansbach = Schoolmaster Meyer, a strict and pedantic man, disliked Hauser's many excuses and apparent lies and their relationship was thus rather strained. In late 1832, Hauser was employed as a copyist in the local law office. Still hoping that Stanhope would take him to England, he was very dissatisfied with his situation, which deteriorated further when his patron, Anselm von Feuerbach, died in May 1833. This certainly was a grievous loss to him.Fritz Trautz 1974, p. 721 Some authors, however, point out that Feuerbach, by the end of his life, had lost faith in Hauser‚Äîwriting a note, to be found in his legacy, which read: \\"Caspar Hauser is a smart scheming codger, a rogue, a good-for-nothing that ought to be killed.\\"Ivo Striedinger 1933, p. 449 But there is no indication that Feuerbach, already seriously ill, let Hauser feel this change of opinion. On 9 December 1833, Hauser had a serious argument with Meyer. Lord Stanhope was expected to visit Ansbach at Christmas and Meyer said that he did not know how he would face him.  Fatal stab wound  The note in mirror writing. Photography, contrast enhanced. The original has been missing since 1945. Five days later, on 14 December 1833, Hauser came home with a deep wound in his left breast. He said that he was lured to the Ansbach Court Garden and that a stranger stabbed him there while giving him a bag. When policeman Herrlein searched the Court Garden, he found a small violet purse containing a pencilled note in \\"Spiegelschrift\\" (mirror writing). The message read, in German: \\"Hauser will be able to tell you quite precisely how I look and from where I am. To save Hauser the effort, I want to tell you myself from where I come _ _ . I come _ _ _ the Bavarian border _ _ On the river _ _ _ _ _ I will even tell you the name: M. L. √ñ.\\" Hauser died of his wound on 17 December 1833. Inconsistencies in Hauser's account led the Ansbach court of enquiry to suspect that he stabbed himself and invented a tale about being attacked. The note in the purse that was found in the Court Garden contained one spelling error and one grammatical error, both of which were typical for Hauser, who, on his deathbed, kept muttering incoherencies about \\"writing with pencil\\". Although he was very eager that the purse be found, he did not ask for its contents. The note itself was folded in a specific triangular form, just the way Hauser used to fold his letters, according to Mrs. Meyer. Forensic doctors agreed that the wound could indeed be self- inflicted. Many authorsA. Lang, Striedinger, Leonhard, Mistler, Trautz, Schreibm√ºller, and others believe that he wounded himself in a bid to revive public interest in his story and to convince Stanhope to fulfil his promise to take him to England, but that he stabbed himself more deeply than planned.For a detailed discussion of the evidence, see: Walther Schreibm√ºller: Bilanz einer 150j√§hrigen Kaspar Hauser-Forschung, in: Genealogisches Jahrbuch 31, 1991, pp. 43‚Äì84, here pp. 63‚Äì80  Burial  Hic jacet Casparus Hauser Aenigma sui temporis ignota nativitas occulta mors MDCCCXXXIII Hauser was buried in the Stadtfriedhof (city cemetery) in Ansbach, where his headstone reads, in Latin, \\"Here lies Kaspar Hauser, riddle of his time. His birth was unknown, his death mysterious. 1833.\\" A monument to him was later erected in the Court Garden which reads Hic occultus occulto occisus est, meaning \\"Here lies a mysterious one who was killed in a mysterious manner.\\"  Medical opinions  Hauser's various accounts of the story of his incarceration include several contradictions.For an analysis of these, see: Reinhard Heydenreuter: Hermann und der Fall Kaspar Hauser, in: Manfred Pix (ed.): Friedrich Benedikt Wilhelm von Hermann (1795‚Äì1868). Ein Genie im Dienste der bayerischen K√∂nige. Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Aufbruch, Stuttgart 1999, pp. 523‚Äì539, here pp. 525‚Äì530 Psychiatrist Karl Leonhard concluded: \\"If he had been living since childhood under the conditions he describes, he would not have developed beyond the condition of an idiot; indeed he would not have remained alive long. His tale is so full of absurdities that it is astonishing that it was ever believed and is even today still believed by many people.\\"Karl Leonhard: Kaspar Hauser und die moderne Kenntnis des Hospitalismus, in: Confinia Psychiatrica 13, 1970, pp. 213‚Äì229, here p. 229 Dr. Heidenreich, one of the physicians present at the autopsy, claimed that the brain of Kaspar Hauser was notable for small cortical size and few, non-distinct cortical gyri, indicating to some that he suffered from cortical atrophy or, as G. Hesse argued, from epilepsy.G√ºnter Hesse: Die Krankheit Kaspar Hausers, in: M√ºnchner Medizinische Wochenschrift, 109. Vol. 1967, pp. 156‚Äì163 Heidenreich may have been influenced by his phrenological ideas when examining Hauser's brain.Peter Josef Keuler: Der Findling Kaspar Hauser als medizinisches Ph√§nomen. Eine medizinhistorische Analyse der √ºberlieferten Quellen, Bochum, Univ.Diss., 1997, pp. 17, 32 and 112 Dr. Albert, who conducted the autopsy and wrote the official report, did not find any anomalies in Hauser's brain. Karl Leonhard rejected the views of both Heidenreich and Hesse. He came to the following conclusion: \\"Kaspar Hauser was, as other authors already opined, a pathological swindler. In addition to his hysterical make-up he probably had the persistence of a paranoid personality since he was able to play his role so imperturbably. From many reports on his behaviour one can recognise the hysterical as well as the paranoid trend of his personality.\\" A 1928 medical studyErwin Bruglocher: √úber Kaspar Hausers Todesart. √Ñrztliche Studie. Ansbach, Br√ºgel 1928 supported the view that Hauser accidentally stabbed himself too deeply, while a 2005 forensic analysis argued that it seems \\"unlikely that the stab to the chest was inflicted exclusively for the purpose of self-damage, but both a suicidal stab and a homicidal act (assassination) cannot be definitely ruled out.\\"  Hauser as hereditary prince of Baden  The Countess of Hochberg The Grand Duchess St√©phanie According to contemporary rumours, probably current as early as 1829, Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince of Baden who was born 29 September 1812, and who, according to known history, died 16 October 1812. It was alleged that this prince was switched with a dying baby and subsequently surfaced 16 years later as Kaspar Hauser in Nuremberg. In this case, his parents would have been Charles, Grand Duke of Baden and St√©phanie de Beauharnais, cousin by marriage and adopted daughter of Napoleon. Because Charles had no surviving male progeny, his successor was his uncle Louis, who was later succeeded by his half-brother, Leopold. Leopold's mother, the Countess of Hochberg, was the alleged culprit of the boy's captivity. The Countess was supposed to have disguised herself as a ghost, the \\"White Lady\\", when kidnapping the prince. Her motive evidently would have been to secure the succession for her sons. After Hauser's death, it was claimed further that he was murdered, again because of his being the prince. = Repudiation in the 1870s = In 1876, Otto Mittelst√§dt presented evidence against this theory based on the official documents about the prince's emergency baptism, autopsy and burial.Otto Mittelst√§dt, Kaspar Hauser und sein badisches Prinzenthum, Heidelberg 1876. Andrew Lang summarizes the results in his Historical Mysteries: \\"It is true that the Grand Duchess was too ill to be permitted to see her dead baby, in 1812, but the baby's father, grandmother, and aunt, with the ten Court physicians, the nurses and others, must have seen it, in death, and it is too absurd to suppose, on no authority, that they were all parties to the White Lady's plot.\\"Andrew Lang, Historical Mysteries, 1905 Historian Fritz Trautz went so far as to write: \\"The silly fairytale, which to this day moves many pens and has found much belief, was fully disproved in Otto Mittelst√§dt's book.\\"Fritz Trautz 1974, p. 723 Furthermore, letters of the Grand Duke's mother, published in 1951, give detailed accounts of the child's birth, illness and death, corroborating the evidence against the alleged switch of babies.Adalbert Prinz von Bayern: K√∂nigin Caroline von Bayern und Kaspar Hauser, in: Der Zwiebelturm 1951, pp. 102‚Äì107 and 121‚Äì128. = Differing DNA analyses = In November 1996, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported an attempt to match genetically a blood sample from underwear assumed to have been Hauser's. This analysis was made in laboratories of Forensic Science Service in Birmingham and in the LMU Institute of Legal Medicine at the University of Munich. Comparisons with descendants of the princely family proved that the blood examined could not possibly stem from the hereditary prince of Baden.Der Spiegel 48 (25 November 1996), pp. 254‚Äì273. In 2002, the Institute for Forensic Medicine of the University of M√ºnster analyzed hair and body cells from locks of hair and items of clothing that also belonged to Kaspar Hauser. The analysts took from the items used in the test six different DNA samples, all of which turned out to be identical, but they differed substantially from the blood sample examined in 1996, the authenticity of which was therefore questioned. The new DNA samples were compared to a DNA segment from Astrid von Medinger, a descendant in the female line of St√©phanie de Beauharnais. The sequences were not identical but the deviation observed is not large enough to exclude a relationship as the difference could be caused by a mutation. (The mitochondrial DNA which was examined is passed only through the female line and thus cannot change except through mutation.) On the other hand, the relatively high similarity by no means proves the alleged relationship, as the \\"Hauser samples\\" showed a pattern that is common among the German population.Bernd Brinkmann, Neuester Stand der Forschung der Gerichtsmedizin und Pathologie der Universit√§t M√ºnster. Preface to: Anselm von Feuerbach, Kaspar Hauser, Reprint-Verlag Leipzig 2006 The House of Baden does not allow any medical examination of the remains of St√©phanie de Beauharnais or of the child that was buried as her son in the family vault at the Pforzheimer Schlosskirche.  Cultural references  Kaspar Hauser fits into the contemporary European image of the \\"wolf child\\" (despite the fact that he almost certainly was not one), and he became possibly the best-known example of the genre. As a result, his story inspired numerous works. = Literature = Works centering on Hauser Kaspar Hauser inspired the French poet Paul Verlaine to write the poem \\"Gaspard Hauser chante\\", published in his book Sagesse (1880). Perhaps the most influential fictional treatment of Kasper Hauser was Jakob Wassermann's 1908 novel Caspar Hauser oder Die Tr√§gheit des Herzens (Caspar Hauser or the Inertia of the Heart), which was largely responsible for its popularization in Germany. In 1913, Georg Trakl wrote the poem \\"Kaspar Hauser Lied\\" (\\"Kaspar Hauser Song\\"). It alludes to the works by Verlaine and Wassermann, and has been called the \\"most striking\\" expression of a literary trope in which Kaspar Hauser \\"stood for the natural, poetic genius lost in a strange world, lacking a home, a sense of origin and attachment, and fearing a violent but uncertain future.\\" Martin Heidegger cited this poem in his essay on poetry and language, Unterwegs zur Sprache. In 1963, Marianne Hauser gave a fictional account of Kaspar Hauser's life in her novel Prince Ishmael. In 1967, the Austrian playwright Peter Handke published his play Kaspar. In 1994 the English poet David Constantine explored the story and its personae in Caspar Hauser: A Poem in Nine Cantos.Reprinted in D. Constantine, Collected Poems (Tarset, Northumberland: Bloodaxe Books, 2004), pp. 143‚Äì216. Canadian artist Diane Obomsawin tells the story of Kaspar Hauser in her 2007 graphic novel Kaspar and later adapted it into an animated short film of the same title in 2012. Incidental mentions Kaspar Hauser is referred to in Herman Melville's unfinished novella Billy Budd (begun in 1886), as well as in his novels, both Pierre: or, The Ambiguities and The Confidence-Man. He is also referenced in the Hans Christian Andersen story \\"Beauty of Form and Beauty of Mind\\" or \\"Beautiful\\". Kaspar Hauser was mentioned in a work of 1897 by Leo Tolstoy entitled What Is Art? (chap. 5). The French novelist Georges Perec identified strongly with the orphan Kaspar, as depicted in Paul Verlaine's poem, and centered several of his works on characters named Gaspard, referencing the name as Verlaine wrote it in his poem. His first novel, which he believed lost, but was found and published after his death under the title \\"Portrait of a Man Known as Il Condottiere,\\" was originally titled \\"Gaspard\\" and then \\"Gaspard not Dead\\". In W, or the Memory of Childhood, Perec alternates autobiographical memories with a retelling of a story he invented as a teenager, centered on a character again named Gaspard. His \\"MICRO-TRADUCTIONS, 15 variations discr√®tes sur un po√®me connu,\\"(1973) is a work entirely composed of creative variations on Verlaine's poem. And in his most famous work, Life: A User's Manual, Perec again uses the character Gaspard Winkler as a central figure in the story. In the mid-20th century, Kaspar Hauser was referred to in several works of science fiction or fantasy literature: Eric Frank Russell, in his 1943 novel Sinister Barrier, described Kaspar Hauser as a person who originated from a non-human laboratory. Fredric Brown, in his 1949 short story \\"Come and Go Mad\\", offered another theory about Kaspar Hauser. In Henry Kuttner's 1954 \\"The Portal in the Picture\\", the author suggests Hauser is from Malesco, a parallel world where science is treated as a religion and its secrets are hidden from the ordinary citizen. Robert A. Heinlein, in his 1963 Glory Road, refers to \\"Kaspar Hausers\\" as an analogue to persons popping in and out of metaphysical planes. Harlan Ellison, in his 1967 story \\"The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World\\", suggested that Hauser had been plucked out of time and later murdered by a female sadist named Juliette. Edward D. Hoch's \\"The Man From Nowhere,\\" first published in the June 1956 issue of Famous Detective Stories, makes reference to Hauser. Paul Auster, in his 1985 novel City of Glass, compares the situation of one of its characters to that of Kaspar Hauser. Kaspar Hauser is also referred to in Jonathan Lethem's 1997 novel As She Climbed Across the Table, Katherine Neville's novel The Magic Circle (1998), in Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Kaspar Hauser Speaks\\" (published in The Knife Thrower and Other Stories, 1998), in Ted Chiang's short story \\"The Evolution of Human Science\\" (originally published as \\"Catching Crumbs from the Table\\" in the journal Nature, 2000), Jeffrey Eugenides's novel Middlesex (2002), Maggie Nelson's poem \\"Kaspar Hauser\\" (2003, itself a probable reference to the Werner Herzog film), and Lucie Brock-Broido's poem \\"Self-Portrait as Kaspar Hauser\\" (published in Trouble in Mind, 2004). He is also referred to in Nick Hornby's Juliet, Naked (2009) and Emma Donoghue's Room. Kaspar Hauser serves as the namesake and inspiration for a character in Dan Abnett's Horus Heresy novel Prospero Burns (2010). The protagonist, \\"Kasper Hawser\\", shares a similar mysterious origin and childhood as attributed to Hauser, including his only toy being a wooden horse. = Film and television = Productions centering on Hauser In 1974, the German filmmaker Werner Herzog made Hauser's story into the film, Jeder f√ºr sich und Gott gegen alle (\\"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\\"). In English, the film was either known by that translation, or by the title The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. The film includes the main known features of Hauser's life, though it omits most of his changes of location and career. It does not question his veracity. In 1993, the German-Austrian co-production Kaspar Hauser ‚Äì Verbrechen am Seelenleben eines Menschen (\\"Kaspar Hauser ‚Äì Crimes against a man's soul\\"), directed by Peter de Sehr, espoused the \\"Prince of Baden\\" theory. La leggenda di Kaspar Hauser (2012, Davide Manuli) is a surreal drama based on \\"the legend\\" of Kaspar Hauser. In this modern western-like re-interpretation featuring Vincent Gallo, a music-obsessive Kaspar washes up on a Mediterranean beach, where half a dozen protagonists try to make sense of who he is. Incidental appearances or mentions Michael Landon played Casper Hauser in an episode of the television series Telephone Time in 1956. In the 1966 film Fahrenheit 451, the protagonist Guy Montag discreetly puts a copy of a book entitled Gaspard Hauser into his bag before the rest of the books in that residence are torched. In the TV series Smallvilles season 1 episode \\"Stray\\" (2002), Martha Kent's car accidentally hits a boy who claims to have no memories of who he was or where he came from, except his name. Chloe refers to the boy as a \\"modern-day Kaspar Hauser\\". In the Japanese horror movie Marebito (2004), the protagonist Masuoka refers to a girl he found chained up underground as his \\"little Kaspar Hauser\\". = Music = In music Kaspar Hauser was the subject of an \\"Epitaph for Kaspar Hauser\\" (1997) by the composer Claus K√ºhnl, a \\"meditation on a day in the life of Kaspar Hauser towards the end of his prison term\\" for an organist, a registrant and two ad hoc Player. Kaspar Hauser's story has inspired numerous musical references. There have been at least two operas named Kaspar Hauser, a 2007 work by American composer Elizabeth Swados and a 2010 work by British composer Rory Boyle. Subterranea, a 1997 concept album by British progressive rock band IQ (1997), was loosely inspired by Hauser's story. Italian artists Reinhold Giovanett and Josef Oberhollenzer put out a CD titled Kaspar Hauser in 1999. Numerous bands and musicians have released songs titled \\"Kaspar Hauser\\", including the German band Dschinghis Khan, the Detroit band Trial, and the Sun City Girls. Colonian-dialect rock band BAP and German singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey have released songs called \\"Kaspar\\". French singer-songwriter Georges Moustaki put out a song titled \\"Gaspard\\", based on Paul Verlaine's poem. Suzanne Vega included \\"Wooden Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song)\\" on her 1987 album Solitude Standing. In 1984, Polish poet and musician Grzegorz Ciechowski has written a song titled \\"Kaspar Hauser\\", which is a part of long play Obywatel G.C. Kaspar Hauser was taken as the name of an alternative rock band based in Amherst, Massachusetts, in the early 1980s, as well as an experimental musician from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England. Ha√ºser is the name of an independent recording artist/songwriter from Northern Ireland who has released several EPs since 2001 and is currently recording new material scheduled for release in late 2012.The Hauser Project is a musical project created in 2011 whose name was inspired by Kaspar Hauser. In 1994, Birgit Scherzer, then director and choreographer of the Saarbr√ºcken Staatstheater Ballet in Germany, used the Hauser story as the basis for a ballet Kaspar Hauser which she presented at the Saarbr√ºcken Staatstheater. In 2012, the American mathcore band Exotic Animal Petting Zoo included a song titled \\"Kaspar Hauser Could See the Stars in the Daytime\\" in its second album Tree of Tongues. In 2013, The Swedish singer-songwriter H√•kan Hellstr√∂m made a reference to Kaspar Hauser in the song \\"Fri till slut\\" (Finally free) on his album Det kommer aldrig va √∂ver f√∂r mig. In 2015, Scottish-born singer-songwriter Momus referenced \\"the loneliness Kaspar Hauser\\" in his song System of Usher, the second track on his album Turpsycore. The German gothic metal band Pyogenesis released a song called \\"Every Man For Himself...And God Against All\\" on their 2017 album A Kingdom to Disappear based on the story of Kaspar Hauser and the film of the same name. = Non-fiction = In his later years, Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach took a deep interest in the fate of Kaspar Hauser. He was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under the title of Kaspar Hauser, ein Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben (1832). There was a January 1861 Atlantic Monthly unsigned article on Kaspar Hauser. Circulated among the American intellectual establishment of the time, it provides a sense of perspective on many of the issues firing the debate about \\"Who Was Kaspar Hauser?\\" which continues to this day. A brief discussion of Kaspar Hauser appears in the \\"Physiology\\" chapter of the editions of Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health (published 1875-1910). Anthroposophists have written several books on Kaspar Hauser. One in particular, a detailed work by Peter Tradowsky, addresses the mysteries surrounding Kaspar Hauser's life from the anthroposophical point of view. His analysis delves into the occult significance of the individuality he sees as incarnated in Kaspar Hauser. In 1996 Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson wrote Lost Prince: The Unsolved Mystery of Kaspar Hauser (1996). Medical writers have referred to psychosocial short stature as \\"Kaspar Hauser syndrome.\\" In a \\"Kaspar Hauser experiment\\", an animal is reared isolated from members of its own species, in an attempt at determining which behaviors are innate.

Like much other late 20th century music of Sub-Saharan Africa, it uses strong electric bass rhythms and prominent brass. In the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across Africa and to a lesser extent abroad. Makossa, which means \\"(I) dance\\" in the Douala language, Section \\"Cultural-based terms\\" (last line) originated from a Douala dance called the kossa. Emmanuel Nelle Eyoum started using the refrain kossa kossa in his songs with his group \\"Los Calvinos\\". The style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later. There were artists such as Eboa Lotin, Misse Ngoh and especially Manu Dibango, who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song \\"Soul Makossa\\" in 1972. The chant from the song, mamako, mamasa, maka makossa, was later used by Michael Jackson in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" in 1983. Many other performers followed suit. The 2010 World cup also brought makossa to the international stage as Shakira sampled the Golden Sounds popular song \\"Zamina mina (Zangalewa)\\". Makassi is a lighter style of makossa. Origins Later in the 1960s, modern makossa developed and became the most popular genre in Cameroon. Makossa is a type of funky dance music, best known outside Africa for Manu Dibango, whose 1972 single \\"Soul Makossa\\" was an international hit. Outside of Africa, Dibango and makossa were only briefly popular, but the genre has produced several Pan-African superstars through the 70s, 80s and 90s. Following Dibango, a wave of musicians electrified makossa in an attempt at making it more accessible outside of Cameroon. Another pop singer in 1970s Cameroon was Andr√©-Marie Tala, a blind singer who had a pair of hits with \\"Sikati\\" and \\"Potaksima\\". By the 1970s, bikutsi performers like Maurice Elanga, Les Veterans and Mbarga Soukous added brass instruments and found controversy over pornographic lyrics. Mama Ohandja also brought bikutsi to new audiences, especially in Europe. The following decade, however, saw Les Tetes Brul√©es surpass previous artists in international popularity, though their reaction at home was mixed. Many listeners did not like their mellow, almost easy listening-styled bikutsi. Cameroonian audiences preferred more roots-based performers like Jimmy Mvondo Mvel√© and Uta Bella, both from Yaound√©. 1980s By the 1980s, makossa had moved to Paris and formed a new pop-makossa that fused the fast tempo zouk style popularized by Kassav from the French Caribbean. Prominent musicians from this period included Moni Bil√©, Douleur, B√©b√© Manga, Ben Decca, Petit-Pays, and Esa. The 80s also saw rapid development of Cameroon's media which saw a flourishing of both makossa and bikutsi. In 1980, L'Equipe Nationale de Makossa was formed, joining the biggest makossa stars of the period together, including Grace Decca, Ndedi Eyango, Ben Decca, Guy Lobe and Dina Bell. Makossa in the 80s saw a wave of mainstream success across Africa and, to a lesser degree, abroad, as Latin influences, French Antilles zouk, and pop music changed its form. While makossa enjoyed international renown, bikutsi was often denigrated as the music of savages and it did not appeal across ethnic lines and into urban areas. Musicians continued to add innovations, however, and improved recording techniques; Nkondo Si Tony, for example, added keyboards and synthesizers, while Elanga Maurice added brass instruments. Les Veterans emerged as the most famous bikutsi group in the 80s, while other prominent performers included Titans de Sangmelima, Seba Georges, Ange Ebogo Emerent, Otheo and Mekongo President, who added complex harmonies and jazz influences. In 1984, a new wave of bikutsi artists emerged, including Sala Bekono formerly of Los Camaroes, Atebass, a bassist, and Zanzibar, a guitarist who would eventually help form Les T√™tes Brul√©es with Jean-Marie Ahanda. 1985 saw the formation of Cameroon Radio Television, a television network that did much to help popularize Cameroonian popular music across the country. Jean-Marie Ahanda became the most influential bikutsi performer of the late 80s, and he revolutionized the genre in 1987 after forming Les T√™tes Brul√©es, whose success changed the Cameroonian music industry. The band played an extremely popular form of bikutsi that allowed for greater depth and diversity. Guitarist Zanzibar added foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar, which made the instrument sound more like a balafon than before, and was more aggressive and innovative than previous musicians. Les T√™tes Brul√©es emerged as a reaction against pop-makossa, which was seen as abandoning its roots in favor of mainstream success. The band's image was part of its success, and they became known for their shaved heads and multi-colored body painting, done to represent traditional Beti scarification, as well as torn T-shirts that implied a common folkness in contrast to the well-styled pop-makossa performers of the period. They also wore backpacks on stage, a reference to Beti women's traditional method of carrying babies while they danced bikutsi. It took only a few weeks for Les T√™tes Brul√©es to knock makossa off the Cameroonian charts, and the band even toured France. While in France, Les T√™tes Brul√©es recorded their first LP, Hot Heads, which was also the first bikutsi music recorded for the CD. Hot Heads expanded the lyrical format of the genre to include socio-political issues. Tours of Japan, Africa, Europe and the United States followed, as well as Claire Denis' film Man No Run, which used footage from their European tour. 1990s In the 1990s, both makossa and bikutsi declined in popularity as a new wave of genres entered mainstream audiences. These included Congolese-influenced new rumba and makossa-soukous, as well as more native forms like bantowbol, northern Cameroonian nganja (which had gained some popularity in the United Kingdom in the mid-80s) and an urban street music called bend-skin. Les T√™tes Brul√©es remained the country's most well known musical export, especially after accompanying the Cameroonian soccer team to the World Cup in 1990 in Italy and 1994 in the United States. A new wave of bikutsi artists arose in the early 1990s, including Les Martiens (formed by Les T√™tes Brul√©es bassist Atebass) and the sexually themed roots singer Katino Ateba (\\"Ascenseur: le secret de l'homme\\") and Douala singer Sissi Dipoko (\\"Bikut-si Hit\\") as well as a resurgence of old performers like Sala Bekono. Bikutsi's international renown continued to grow, and the song \\"Proof\\" from Paul Simon's Rhythm of the Saints, released to mainstream promotion and success in 1990, gained yet more renown from international audiences. Vincent Nguini also contributed guitar arrangements and performance to Simon's Rhythm of the Saints, which became an influential world music album, introducing many North American listeners to the wide range of instrumentation and genres. In 1993, the Pedal√© movement was born as a reaction to the Cameroonian economic slump. Youthful artists like Gibraltar Drakuss, Zele le Bombardier, Eboue Chaleur, Pasto, Roger Bekono, Mbarga Soukous and Saint-Desir√© Atango was a return to the aggressive, earthy sound of bikutsi roots. Meanwhile Henri Dikongu√©, whose music incorporated, amongst others, bikutsi and makossa, began to release albums which met international success. He went on to tour Europe and North America. The most recent form of Cameroonian popular music is a fusion of Congolese soukous and makossa, a scene which has produced Petit Pays, Marcel Bwanga, Kotto Bass, Papillon and Jean Pierre Essome. Other popular genres include tchamassi, mangambeu and makassi. Notes References * West, Ben (2004). Cameroon: The Bradt Travel Guide.

Released in 1980 on Columbia Records, it was the seventh album-length recording by the group. The soundtrack firmly overshadowed the film itself, which enjoyed little fame. The album was a significant departure from the arena rock which characterized the band's three preceding albums, harking back to their progressive rock beginnings and relying on complex musicianship and instrumentals. Dream, After Dream features a full vocal on three of its nine tracks, \\"Destiny\\", \\"Sand Castles\\" and \\"Little Girl\\". \\"Little Girl\\" was later the B-side of the \\"Open Arms\\" single and was featured on Journey's Time3 collection. It also appears as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue of Departure and the 2011 edition of Greatest Hits 2. \\"Destiny\\" is the band's longest recorded song. This was the last studio album to feature founding member Gregg Rolie. Reception Dream, After Dream has been viewed as a major departure from the commercially successful, radio- friendly pop of their previous three albums, instead harking back to their early, progressive rock-oriented work. AllMusic wrote, \\"One of the most overlooked albums in Journey's catalogue ... Dream, After Dream is a fine example of Journey's underrated musicianship, and recommended for devoted fans.\\" Dave Marsh, normally an ardent detractor of the band, was even more enthusiastic, describing the album as \\"the band's finest recording of the 80's\\".Marsh, Dave. \\"Great, Forgotten Records\\".

Americana is any collection of materials and things concerning or characteristic of the United States or of the American people, and is representative or even stereotypical of American culture as a whole. What is and is not considered Americana is heavily influenced by national identity, historical context, patriotism and nostalgia. The ethos or guiding beliefs or ideals which have come to characterize America, such as The American Dream, are central to the idea. Americana encompasses not only material objects but also people, places, concepts and historical eras which are popularly identified with American culture. The name \\"Americana\\" also refers to Americana music, a genre of contemporary music which incorporates elements of various American music styles, including country, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound. As nostalgia From the mid to late 20th century, Americana was largely conceptualized as a nostalgia for an idealized life in small towns and cities in the United States around the turn of the century, roughly in the period between 1880 and the First World War, popularly considered \\"The Good Old Days\\". It was believed that much of the structure of 20th-century American life and culture had been cemented in that time and place. American author Henry Seidel Canby wrote: American historian Hampton Sides wrote in Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier: Many kinds of cultural artifacts fall within the definition of Americana: the things involved need not be old, but are usually associated with some quintessential element of the American experience. Each period of United States history is reflected by the advertising and marketing of the time, and the various types of antiques, collectibles, memorabilia and vintage items from these time periods are typical of what is popularly considered Americana. The Atlantic described the term as \\"slang for the comforting, middle-class ephemera at your average antique store‚Äîthings like needle-pointed pillows, Civil War daguerreotypes, and engraved silverware sets\\". The nostalgia for this period was based on a remembrance of confidence in American life that had emerged during the period due to such factors as a sense that the frontier had finally been \\"conquered\\", with the U.S. Census Bureau's declaration that it was \\"closed\\" in 1890, as well as the recent victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. By 1912, the contiguous United States was at last fully politically incorporated, and the idea of the nation as a single, solid unity could begin to take hold. As Canby put it, On growing up Italian-American, novelist Don DeLillo stated: The zeitgeist of this idealized period is captured in the Disneyland theme park's Main Street, U.S.A. section (which was inspired by both Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri and Harper Goff's childhood home of Fort Collins, Colorado), as well as the musical and movie The Music Man and Thornton Wilder's stage play Our Town. Especially revered in nostalgic Americana are small-town institutions like the barber shop, drug store, soda fountain and ice cream parlor; some of these were eventually resurrected by mid-twentieth century nostalgia for the time period in businesses like the Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour chain, with its 1890s theme.

It remained in the polytonic orthography even after the Hellenistic period, when the sound disappeared from the Greek language. In the monotonic orthography of Modern Greek phonology, in use since 1982, it is not used at all. The absence of an sound is marked by the smooth breathing. The character has also been used for a similar sound by Thomas Wade (and others) in the Wade‚ÄìGiles system of romanization for Mandarin Chinese. Herbert Giles and others have used a left (opening) curved single quotation mark for the same purpose; the apostrophe, backtick, and visually similar characters are often seen as well. History Tack-shaped archaic consonantal Heta, together with a lowercase variant designed for modern typography.The rough breathing comes from the left-hand half of the letter H.Herbert Weir Smyth, Greek Grammar, par. 14. In some archaic Greek alphabets, the letter was used for (Heta), and this usage survives in the Latin letter H. In other dialects, it was used for the vowel (Eta), and this usage survives in the modern system of writing Ancient Greek, and in Modern Greek. Usage The rough breathing ( ·øæ ) is placed over an initial vowel, or over the second vowel of an initial diphthong. * ha√≠resis 'choice' (‚Üí Latin haeresis ‚Üí English heresy) * hƒìÃÅr≈çs 'hero' An upsilonSmyth, par. 10. or rhoSmyth, par. 13. at the beginning of a word always takes a rough breathing. * h√Ωmnos 'hymn' * rhythm√≥s 'rhythm' =Inside a word= In some writing conventions, the rough breathing is written on the second of two rhos in the middle of a word. This is transliterated as rrh in Latin. * di√°rrhoia 'diarrhoea' In crasis (contraction of two words), when the second word has a rough breathing, the contracted vowel does not take a rough breathing. Instead, the consonant before the contracted vowel changes to the aspirated equivalent (i.e., œÄ ‚Üí œÜ, œÑ ‚Üí Œ∏, Œ∫ ‚Üí œá),Smyth, par. 64. if possible, and the contracted vowel takes the apostrophe or coronis (identical to the smooth breathing). * 'the other one' *:t√≤ h√©teron ‚Üí tho√∫teron Under the archaizing influence of Katharevousa, this change has been preserved in modern Greek neologisms coined on the basis of ancient words, e.g. œÄœÅœâŒ∏œÖœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåœÇ ('prime minister'), from ('first') and ('minister'), where the latter was originally aspirated. Technical notes In Unicode, the code point assigned to the rough breathing is . It is intended to be used in all alphabetic scripts (including Greek and Latin). It was also used in the original Latin transcription of Armenian for example with in tÃî. The pair of space + combining rough breathing is . It may bind typographically with the letter encoded before it to its left, to create ligatures for example with in t Ω, and it is used for the modern Latin transcription of Armenian (which no longer uses the combining version). It is also encoded for compatibility as mostly for usage in the Greek script, where it may be used before Greek capital letters to its right and aligned differently, e.g. with , where the generic space+combining dasia should be used after the letter it modifies to its left (the space is inserted so that the dasia will be to the left instead of above that letter). Basically, U+1FFE was encoded for full roundtrip compatibility with legacy 8-bit encodings of the Greek script in documents where dasia was encoded before the Greek capital letter it modifies (it is then not appropriate for transliterating Armenian and Semitic scripts to the Latin script). When is used incorrectly after a Latin letter it is supposed to modify, for example with in t·øæd, a visible small gap will occur between the leading Latin letter t and the Greek dasia, and the Greek dasia may interact typographically with the Latin letter d following it to suppress this gap, like in Greek. There is a polytonic Greek code range in Unicode, covering precomposite versions (breathing mark + vowel etc.): ·ºâ ·ºÅ, ·ºè ·ºá, ·æè ·æá, ·æâ ·æÅ, ·ºô ·ºë, ·º© ·º°, ·ºØ ·ºß, ·æü ·æó, ·æô ·æë, ·ºπ ·º±, ·ºø ·º∑, ·Ωâ ·ΩÅ, ·ø¨ ·ø•, ·Ωô ·Ωë, ·Ωü ·Ωó, ·Ω© ·Ω°, ·ΩØ ·Ωß, ·æØ ·æß, and ·æ© ·æ°.

In this context it is encoded as Unicode In Latin transcription of Semitic languages, especially Arabic and Hebrew, either or a symbol similar to it, , is used to represent the letter ayin.

Belts are used to secure or hold up clothing, like trousers or other articles of clothing, in a manner similar to suspenders and garters. Some trousers come with belt loops around the waist, which the belt goes through. Belts can have many uses, but they are often used as a fashion accessory, with many colours, styles, and finishes. In heavy metal subculture, bullet belts and studded belts are worn. Pouches to carry objects such as coin purses, holsters, scabbards, inr≈çs, etc. have been attached to belts in lieu of pockets. Belts are often secured with some type of metal buckle, which vary from simple one-color finishes to elaborately decorated belt plates with embossed or bas-relief images or multicolored logos. While belts can be adjusted to suit the circumference of a person's waist, belts are sold in different lengths due to the variety in waist sizes. Belts are generally designed for men's or women's fashion use, although some casual belts are unisex. Due to the size constraints of belt loops, any belt designed for use with belt loops cannot be too wide. For women's belts designed to be worn over a dress, however, belts can be wider, with some wide belts called \\"waist cinchers\\" overlapping with corsets in their appearance and function. History Pattern on a cloth belt that is part of one Estonian national costume. Belts have been documented as male clothing since the Bronze Age. Both sexes have used them off and on, depending on the fashion trends. In the western world, belts have been more common for men, with the exception of the early Middle Ages, late 17th century Mantua, and skirt/blouse combinations between 1901 and 1910. Art Nouveau belt buckles are now collectors' items. A possible bone belt hook found in the Bronze Age layers of Yanik Tepe, northeast of Lake Urmia, Iran In the latter half of the 19th century and until the First World War, the belt was a decorative as well as utilitarian part of military uniform, particularly among officers. In the armed forces of Prussia, Tsarist Russia, and other Eastern European nations, it was common for officers to wear extremely tight pressing into their stomachs and gutting them up, wide belts around the waist, on the outside of the uniform, both to support a saber and for aesthetic reasons. These tightly cinched belts served to draw in the waist and give the wearer a trim physique, emphasizing wide shoulders and a pouting chest. Often the belt served only to emphasize the waist made small by a corset worn under the uniform, a practice which was common especially during the Crimean Wars and was often noted by soldiers from the Western Front. Political cartoonists of the day often portrayed the tight waist-cinching of soldiers to comedic effect, and some cartoons survive showing officers being corseted by their inferiors, a practice which surely was uncomfortable but was deemed to be necessary and imposing. Made of rock cut diamonds embedded on a gold belt. In modern times, men started wearing belts in the 1920s, as trouser waists fell to a lower line. Before the 1920s, belts served mostly a decorative purpose, and were associated with the military. Moreover, prior to that trousers did not even have belt loops. As sportswear, trousers with belt loops were already present in the 19th century.See pictures :File:NY Metropolitans.jpg or :File:1868 Reds.jpg for instance. Today it is common for men to wear belts with their trousers. In the US military belts are worn snugly at dress events or at inspection so as convey impressions of fitness and discipline. From 1989 onward the US military standards regarding belt tightness during normal duty and non-duty activities have been somewhat more relaxed to prevent deleterious effects of prolonged excessive abdominal constriction. In some countries, a father's belt could be associated with corporal punishment. As belts are constructed out of materials like leather that are both strong and light, a belt can be easily wielded to produce intense pain by using it as a whip to strike the buttocks of a misbehaving child. Moreover, belts were convenient disciplinary tools, as they are generally immediately available for use. The belt can symbolize fatherly authority and paternal responsibility for one's children's behavior and moral development, but corporal punishment is not recommended for use in modern society as it was in the past. Since the 1980s and more commonly in the mid-1990s, the practice of sagging the pants, in which the waistbands (usually secured by a cinched belt) of trousers or (typically long) shorts are worn at or below the hips, thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment, has been seen among young men and boys, especially among those who are black and consanguine with hip-hop culture and fashion. This practice is sometimes (incorrectly) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison (due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide) -- historically, including in the latter part of the 20th century, gang- affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their belts fastened tightly.  Materials  Belts are commonly made from cowhide leather. Full- grain leather is the highest quality cowhide leather available, and is recommended for its longevity even with daily use. Calfskin is the soft and supple, making a full-grain calfskin belt one of the highest quality available. Belts are also available in a range of other materials, including braided leather, tooled leather, suede, leather-backed ribbon, canvas, webbing, rope, vinyl, and others.  Fashion and formality  Belts have transformed from a strictly utilitarian item, to a fashion accessory in today's modern era. There are several unspoken rules for belts when it comes to belt shape and color, especially for men wearing suits, vs. a woman's choice of belt that is rooted in fashion trend, and not out always out of necessity. = Formal = Belts for formal dress pants/attire are usually 28‚Äì32 mm wide (a little under 1 inch). These belts offer specialty accents such as trapunto straps, beveled edges, fine stitch gauge, and a tapered tip. The leather, if it is made of leather, is commonly in a semi or high-shine finish (ex: spazzalato leather), with a tight grain, and a smooth leather backing. Dress belts typically have a buckle in a polished metal finish. When wearing a formal belt, the leather of your belt and shoes should match, and the metals of the buckle and accessories (like watches) should match. = Casual = Casual belts commonly worn with denim are usually between 35 mm and 42 mm wide (a little under 1 inch). These are typically made out of a one- piece leather construction with a textured appearance, with a belt buckle in an antiqued finish, wider, thicker stitching, or bar-tacking, to ensure a strong construction.

History Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband f√ºr Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in Les Cahiers d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui in French as . Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the Frankfurter Zeitung, as . It was the architect Henry Kulka, who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in Trotzdem, that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the Secessionists.Christopher Long, ‚ÄúOrnament, Crime, Myth, and Meaning‚Äù, 85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined, 1997. Content The essay was written when Art Nouveau‚Äîknown as Secession in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900‚Äîwas showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement, which would be fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio, and would help define the ideology of modernism in architecture. \\"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects,\\" Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying evolution to cultural contexts. Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot. In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the \\"immorality\\" of ornament, describing it as \\"degenerate\\", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the tattooing of the \\"Papuan\\" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him‚ÄîLoos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate. Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material. Loos concluded that \\"No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength\\".

Johnson. He was also the longtime president of the Motion Picture Association of America. During his 38-year tenure in the MPAA, he created the MPAA film rating system, and he was generally regarded as one of the most influential pro-copyright lobbyists in the world. Early life and education Valenti was born on September 5, 1921 in Houston, Texas, the son of Italian immigrants. During World War II, he was a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Force. Valenti flew 51 combat missions as the pilot- commander of a B-25 medium bomber and received four decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jjvalenti.htm Valenti graduated from the University of Houston in 1946 with a BBA. During his time there, he worked on the staff of the university newspaper, The Daily Cougar, and was president of the university's student government. Valenti would later serve on the university's board of regents.  Career  After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1948, Valenti went to work for Humble Oil in its advertising department, where he helped the company's Texas gas stations jump from fifth to first in sales through a \\"cleanest restrooms\\" campaign.Jack Joseph Valenti, Arlington National Cemetery Website In 1952, he and a partner named Weldon Weekley founded Weekley & Valenti, an advertising agency, with oil company, Conoco, as its first client. In 1956, Valenti met then Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson. Weekley & Valenti branched out into political consulting and added Representative Albert Thomas, a Johnson ally, as a client. In 1960, Valenti's firm assisted in the Kennedy-Johnson presidential campaign.Book Review by Thomas Mallon: This Time, This Place, the Jack Valenti memoir. The New York Times June 22, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/review/Mallon-t.html =Politics= Valenti (far left) was present at Lyndon B. Johnson's swearing in aboard Air Force One. Valenti served as liaison with the news media during President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's November 22, 1963 visit to Dallas, Texas, and Valenti was in the presidential motorcade. Following the assassination of President Kennedy, Valenti was present in the famous photograph of Lyndon Johnson's swearing-in aboard Air Force One, and flew with the new president to Washington. He then became the first \\"special assistant\\" to Johnson's White House and lived in the White House for the first two months of Johnson's presidency. In 1964, Johnson gave Valenti the responsibility to handle relations with the Republican Congressional leadership, particularly Gerald Ford and Charles Halleck from the House of Representatives, and the Senate's Everett Dirksen. Valenti later called Johnson \\"the most single dominating human being that I've ever been in contact with\\" and \\"the single most intelligent man I've ever known\\".\\"Interview with Jack Valenti, 1981\\". 04/23/1981. WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved 3 November 2010. In a speech before the American Advertising Federation in 1965, Valenti said: \\"I sleep each night a little better, a little more confidently, because Lyndon Johnson is my president.\\"Address before the Advertising Federation of America convention, Boston, Massachusetts (28 June 1965); published in the Congressional Record (7 July 1965) Vol. 111, Appendix, p. A3583 Valenti later attacked film director Oliver Stone for the 1991 movie JFK. Valenti called the movie a \\"monstrous charade\\" and said, \\"I owe where I am today to Lyndon Johnson. I could not live with myself if I stood by mutely and let some filmmaker soil his memory.\\"Bernard Weinraub, \\"Valenti Calls 'J.F.K.' 'Hoax' and 'Smear'\\", The New York Times, April 2, 1992. =MPAA= In 1966, Valenti, at the insistence of Universal Studios chief Lew Wasserman, and with Johnson's consent, resigned his White House commission and became the president of the Motion Picture Association of America. With Valenti's arrival in Hollywood, the pair were lifelong allies, and together orchestrated and controlled how Hollywood would conduct business for the next several decades. William Patry, a copyright attorney for the Clinton administration, who observed Valenti at first hand says: > His personal passion and extreme comfort around politicians gave him > credibility that others ... would lack. Mr Valenti was a consummate > salesman, who like all great salesmen ... worked himself up into believing > the truth of his clients' message. Those privileged to see Mr Valenti > offstage ‚Äì talking openly with his clients about what could or could not be > achieved, and what artifice would or would not work ‚Äì are aware that Mr > Valenti's clients frequently disagreed with his advice and directed him to > deliver a different message through a different artifice.

F.: Moral Panics > and the Copyright Wars, Oxford University Press, 2009. . Movie rating system In 1968, Valenti developed the MPAA film rating system, which initially comprised four distinct ratings: G, M, R and X. The M rating was soon replaced by GP, and changed to PG in 1972. The X rating immediately proved troublesome, since it was not trademarked and therefore was used freely by the pornography industry, with which it became most associated. Films such as Midnight Cowboy and A Clockwork Orange were assumed to be pornographic because they carried the X rating. In 1990 the NC-17 rating was introduced as a trademarked \\"adults only\\" replacement for the non-trademarked X-rating. The PG-13 rating was added in 1984 to provide a greater range of distinction for audiences, and was first proposed to Valenti by Steven Spielberg.https://www.today.com/popculture/pg-13-20-how-indiana-remade-films- wbna5798549 Valenti on new technologies During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Valenti became notorious for his flamboyant attacks on the Sony Betamax Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), which the MPAA feared would devastate the movie industry. He famously told a congressional panel in 1982, \\"I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.\\"Jack Valenti Testimony at 1982 House Hearing on Home Recording of Copyrighted Works Despite Valenti's prediction, the home video market ultimately came to be the mainstay of movie studio revenues throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Digital Millennium Copyright Act Jack Valenti in 1991 In 1998, Valenti lobbied for the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act, arguing that copyright infringement via the Internet would severely damage the record and movie industries.An interview conducted by a GNU/Linux user from MIT 2003 screener ban injunction In 2003, Valenti found himself at the center of the so-called screener debate, as the MPAA barred studios and many independent producers from sending screener copies of their films to critics and voters in various awards shows. Under mounting industry pressure and a court injunction Antidote Int'l Films Inc. et al. v MPAA (November 2003), Valenti backed down in 2004, narrowly avoiding a massive and embarrassing antitrust lawsuit against the MPAA. The Coalition of Independent Filmmakers' Jeff Levy-Hinte, IFP/Los Angeles executive director Dawn Hudson and IFP/New York executive director Michelle Byrd said in a joint statement, \\"By obtaining a court order to force the MPAA to lift the screener ban last December, the Coalition enabled individual distributors to determine when and in what manner to distribute promotional screeners.\\" It was viewed as Valenti's greatest professional loss. = Honors = Valenti received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal for his service with the Army Air Force during the Second World War. In 1969, Jack Valenti received the Bronze Medallion, New York City's highest civilian honor. In 1985, Jack Valenti received the French L√©gion d'Honneur. In 2002, the University of Houston bestowed Valenti an honorary doctorate. In December 2003, Valenti received the \\"Legend in Leadership Award\\" from the Chief Executive Leadership Institute of the Yale School of Management. In June 2005, the Washington DC headquarters of the Motion Picture Association of America, was renamed the Jack Valenti Building. It is located at 888 16th St. NW, Washington DC, very close to the White House. Jack Valenti maintained an office on the 8th floor, outside the MPAA's space, until his death. In April 2008, the University of Houston renamed its School of Communication to the Jack J. Valenti School of Communication in his honor. Valenti was one of the school's notable alumni. Retirement Jack Valenti Valenti's salary in 2004 was reported to be $1.35 million, which made him the seventh-highest paid Washington trade group chief, according to the National Journal. Valenti was nominated for President of the United States by the Alfalfa Club in 2004. In August 2004, Valenti, then 82 years old, retired and was replaced by former U.S. Congressman and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. The current head of the ratings system, Joan Graves, was appointed by Valenti. After retirement from the MPAA, he became involved in technology- related venture capital activities, such as joining the Advisory Board of Legend Ventures where he advised on media investment opportunities. He also remained a supporter of causes linked to his Italian American heritage and was a member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) for more than 20 years. After retiring from the MPAA in 2004, Valenti became the first President of Friends of the Global Fight Against AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, an organization founded by philanthropists Edward W. Scott and Adam Waldman. The founders wanted to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in its work to prevent millions of people from dying of preventable and treatable diseases each year. Under Valenti's leadership, Friends of the Global Fight oversaw a steady increase in U.S. funding for the Global Fund, resulting in a large-scale, positive impact in the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Valenti remained President of Friends of the Global Fight until his death in 2007.http://www.theglobalfight.org/ Friends of the Global Fight Personal life In 1962, at the age of 41, Valenti married Mary Margaret Valenti. They had three children: John, Alexandra and Warner Bros. studio executive Courtenay Valenti. He died just before their forty- fifth wedding anniversary. In 1964, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation concerning whether Valenti had a sexual relationship with a male photographer (at a time when homosexual acts were still illegal in many states of the United States). The investigation concluded that there was no evidence that Valenti was a homosexual.FBI probed sexuality of LBJ aide Jack Valenti from MSNBC In 1995, he voiced a portrayal of himself on the Warner Bros. animated series Freakazoid! (close friend Steven Spielberg was the executive producer); wherein he helped recount the origin of the titular hero; he also lectured about the movie ratings by using stickers of a family; and also made frequent reference to his cheeks. In the 2016 film Jackie, about the life of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Valenti is portrayed by Max Casella. = Death = He died on April 26, 2007, at his home in Washington from stroke complications. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery under a veteran's gravestone, which lists both his war decorations and his years as president of the MPAA. His memoirs This Time, This Place: My Life in War, the White House and Hollywood were published on May 15, 2007, only a few weeks after his death. Following his death, the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) launched the NIAF Jack Valenti Institute, which provides support to Italian American film students, in his memory. Director Martin Scorsese launched the institute at the Foundation's 32nd Anniversary Gala, after receiving an award from Mary Margaret Valenti.

Fine vertical wires behind the front glass of the display screen separate the different colors of phosphors into strips. These wires are positioned such that an electron beam from one of three guns at the rear of the tube is only able to strike phosphors of the appropriate color. That is, the blue electron gun will strike blue phosphors, but will find a wire blocks the path to red and green phosphors. The fine wires allow for a finer dot pitch as they can be spaced much closer together than the perforations of a shadow mask, and there need be no gap between adjacent horizontal pixels. During the display of bright images, a shadow mask warms, and expands outward in all directions (sometimes called blooming). Aperture grilles do not exhibit this behavior; when the wires heat up, they expand vertically. Because there are no defined holes, this expansion does not affect the image, and the wires do not move horizontally. The vertical wires of the aperture grille have a resonant frequency and will vibrate in sympathetic resonance with loud sounds near the display, resulting in fluttering and shimmering of colors on the display. To reduce these resonant effects, one or two horizontal stabilizing wires, called \\"damping wires\\", are welded across the grille wires, and may be visible as fine dark lines across the face of the screen. These stabilizing wires provide the easiest way to distinguish aperture grille and shadow mask displays at a glance. The stabilized grille can still vibrate but the sounds need to be loud and be emitted close to the display. Additionally, aperture grille displays tend to be vertically flat and are often horizontally flat as well, while shadow mask displays usually have a spherical curvature. The first patented aperture grille televisions were manufactured by Sony in the late 1960s under the Trinitron brand name, which the company carried over to its line of CRT computer monitors. Subsequent designs, whether licensed from Sony or manufactured after the patent's expiration, tend to use the -tron suffix, such as Mitsubishi's DiamondTron and ViewSonic's SonicTron. Cromaclear is an improvement of the aperture grille technology, pioneered by the NEC Corporation; one of its advantages is the lack of damping wires. Aperture grilles are not as mecanically stable as shadow or slot masks; a tap can cause the image to briefly become distorted, even with damping/support wires.https://stweb.peelschools.org/pcsweb/pc_tut/06crtmon.htm See also * Shadow mask * Cromaclear * Chromatron * Trinitron References External links * Aperture grille details Cathode ray tube Japanese inventions ","title":"Aperture grille"},{"id":"172533","text":"Shadow mask Close-up In-line (left) and triad (right) shadow mask Shadow mask- based CRT in close-up The shadow mask is one of the two technologies used in the manufacture of cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer monitors which produce clear, focused color images. The other approach is the aperture grille, better known by its trade name, Trinitron. All early color televisions and the majority of CRT computer monitors used shadow mask technology. Both of these technologies are largely obsolete, having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display (LCD). A shadow mask is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that separate the colored phosphors in the layer behind the front glass of the screen. Shadow masks are made by photochemical machining, a technique that allows for the drilling of small holes on metal sheets. Three electron guns at the back of the screen sweep across the mask, with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes. As the guns are physically separated at the back of the tube, their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles, so after passing through the holes they hit slightly different locations on the screen. The screen is patterned with dots of colored phosphor positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns. For instance, the blue phosphor dots are hit by the beam from the \\"blue gun\\" after passing through a particular hole in the mask. The other two guns do the same for the red and green dots. This arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen, even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place. A red, a green, and a blue phosphor are generally arranged in a triangular shape (sometimes called a \\"triad\\"). These were sometimes referred to as slot masks. For television use, modern displays (starting in the late 1960s) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes, improving brightness. Development =Color television= Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \\"gel\\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Each frame encoded one color of the picture, and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used.Ed Reitan, \\"CBS Field Sequential Color System\\" , 24 August 1997. (This is conceptually similar to a DLP based projection display where a single DLP device is used for all three color channels.) RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system first introduced by Georges Valensi in 1938. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, called the \\"luminance\\". This closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing the picture to be displayed on black and white televisions. The remaining color information was separately encoded into the signal as a high-frequency modulation to produce a composite video signal. On a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the extra information would be detected, filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original RGB for display.Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Dot Sequential Color System\\" , 28 August 1997. Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor. With RCA's system, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era. =Numerous attempts= Through the 1940s and early 1950s a wide variety of efforts were made to address the color problem. A number of major companies continued to work with separate color \\"channels\\" with various ways to re-combine the image. RCA was included in this group; on 5 February 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass, but the image was too dim to be useful. John Logie Baird, who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 February 1938, was already making progress on an all-electronic version. His design, the Telechrome, used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube. Development had not progressed far when Baird died in 1946.\\"The World's First High Definition Colour Television System\\", Baird Television. A similar project was the Geer tube, which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids.\\"Teacher's Tube\\", Time, 20 March 1950. However, all of these projects had problems with colors bleeding from one phosphor to another. In spite of their best efforts, the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots, at least over the entirety of the screen. Moreover, most of these devices were unwieldy; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable \\"dead space\\". =Rear-gun efforts= A more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube, firing at a single multi-color screen on the front. Through the early 1950s, several major electronics companies started development of such systems. Another contender was General Electric's Penetron, which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one.David Morton, \\"Electronics: The Life Story of a Technology\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 87. More common were attempts to use a secondary focussing arrangement just behind the screen to produce the required accuracy. Paramount Pictures worked long and hard on the Chromatron, which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary \\"gun\\", further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color.U.S. Patent 2,692,532, \\"Cathode Ray Focusing Apparatus\\", Ernst O. Lawrence, University of California/Chromatic Television Laboratories (original Chromatron patent). Philco's \\"Apple\\" tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them, by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors.Richard Clapp et all, \\"A New Beam-Indexing Coor Television Display System\\", Proceedings of the IRE, September 1956, p. 1108‚Äì1114. It would be years before any of these systems made their way into production. The Penetron never worked for color TV, but found niche roles in aerospace. Sony tried the Chromatron in the 1960s, but gave up and developed the Trinitron instead. The Apple tube re-emerged in the 1970s and had some success. But it was RCA's success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts. Until 1968, every color television sold used the RCA shadow mask concept, in the spring of that year Sony introduced their first Trinitron sets.John Nathan, \\"Sony: The Private Life\\", Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2001, p. 48. =Shadow mask= In 1938 German inventor Werner Flechsig first patented (received 1941, France) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube, and punching small holes in it. The holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen. Independently, Al Schroeder at RCA worked on a similar arrangement, but using three electron guns as well. When the lab leader explained the possibilities of the design to his superiors, he was promised unlimited manpower and funds to get it working.Abramson & Sterling, p. 40. Over a period of only a few months, several prototype color televisions using the system were produced.Abramson & Sterling, p. 41. The guns, arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube, were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal. For much of the time during the scan, the beams would hit the back of the plate and be stopped. However, when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate. In this way, the plate ensured that the beams were perfectly aligned with the colored phosphor dots. This still left the problem of focusing on the correct colored dot. Normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen. The mask helped by mechanically attenuating the beam to a small size just before it hit the screen.Gilmore, p. 81. But the real genius of the idea is that the beams approached the metal plate from different angles. After being cut off by the mask, the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles, hitting the screens at slightly different locations. The spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube, and the distance between the mask plate and the screen. By painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen, and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions, the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot. Although the system was simple, it had a number of serious practical problems. As the beam swept the mask, the vast majority of its energy was deposited on the mask, not the screen in front of it. A typical mask of the era might have only 15% of its surface open. To produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional B&W; television, the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful. Additionally, the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun, so much of the screen was black.Gilmore, p. 178. This required even more power in order to light up the resulting image. And as the power was divided up among three of these much more powerful guns, the cost of implementation was much higher than for a similar B&W; set.Gilmore, p. 83. The amount of power deposited on the color screen was so great that thermal loading was a serious problem. The energy the shadow mask absorbs from the electron gun in normal operation causes it to heat up and expand, which leads to blurred or discolored images (see doming). Signals that alternated between light and dark caused cycling that further increased the difficulty of keeping the mask from warping. Furthermore, the geometry required complex systems to keep the three beams properly positioned across the screen. If you consider the beam when it is sweeping across the middle area of the screen, the beams from the individual guns are each traveling the same distance and meet the holes in the mask at equal angles. In the corners of the screen some beams have to travel farther and all of them meet the hole at a different angle than at the middle of the screen. These issues required additional electronics and adjustments to maintain correct beam positioning. =Market introduction= During development, RCA was not sure that they could make the shadow mask system work. Although simple in concept, it was difficult to build in practice, especially at a reasonable price point. The company optioned several other technologies, including the Geer tube, in case the system didn't work out. When the first tubes were produced in 1950, these other lines were dropped. Wartime advances in electronics had opened up large swaths of high frequency transmission to practical use, and in 1948 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) started a series of meetings on the use of what would become the UHF channels. At the time there were very few television sets in use in the United States, so the stakeholder groups quickly settled on the idea of using UHF for a new, incompatible, color format. These meetings eventually selected a competing semi-mechanical field-sequential color system being promoted by CBS. However, in the midst of the meetings, RCA announced their efforts on compatible color, but too late to influence the proceedings. CBS color was introduced in 1950.Gilmore, p. 82. However, the promise of the RCA system was so great that the National Television System Committee (NTSC) took up its cause. Between 1950 and 1953 they carried out a huge study on human color perception, and used that information to improve RCA's basic concept.\\"Colorimetry standards\\", Broadcast Engineering. RCA had, by this time, produced experimental shadow mask sets that were an enormous leap in quality over any competitors. The system was dim, complex, large, power hungry and expensive for all these reasons, but provided a usable color image, and most importantly, was compatible with existing B&W; signals. This had not been an issue in 1948 when the first FCC meetings were held, but by 1953 the number of B&W; sets had exploded; there was no longer any way they could simply be abandoned. When the NTSC proposed that their new standard be ratified by the FCC, CBS dropped its interest in its own system. Everyone in the industry wanting to produce a set then licensed RCA's patents, and by the mid-1950s there were a number of sets commercially available. However, color sets were much more expensive than B&W; sets of the same size, and required constant adjustment by field staff. By the early 1960s they still represented a small percentage of the television market in North America. The numbers exploded in the early 1960s, with 5,000 sets being produced a week in 1963.Gilmore, p. 80. =Improvements, market acceptance= By the 1960s the first RCA patents were ending, while at the same time a number of technical improvements were being introduced. A number of these were worked into the GE Porta-Color set of 1966, which was an enormous success. By 1968 almost every company had a competing design, and color television moved from an expensive option to mainstream devices. Doming problems due to thermal expansion of the shadow mask was solved in several ways. Some companies used a thermostat to measure the temperature and adjust the scanning to match the expansion. Bi-metallic shadow masks, where differential expansion rates offset the issue, became common in the late 1960s. Invar and similar low-expansion alloys were introduced in the 1980s\\"Taking the heat out of flat-screen television...\\", New Scientist, 3 October 1985, p. 35. These materials suffered from easy magnetization that can affect the colors, but this could be generally solved by including an automatic demagnetizing feature. The last solution to be introduced was the \\"stretched mask\\", where the mask was welded to a frame, typically glass, at high temperatures. The frame was then welded to the inside of the tube. When the assembly cooled, the mask was under great tension, which no amount of heating from the guns would be able to remove.James Foley, \\"Computer graphics: principles and practice\\", Addison-Wesley, 1996, p. 160. Improving brightness was another major line of work in the 1960s. The use of rare-earth phosphors produced brighter colors and allowed the strength of the electron beams to be reduced slightly. Better focusing systems, especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus, allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen. The Porta-Color used both of these advances and re- arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle, allowing the dots to be extended vertically into slots that covered much more of the screen surface. This design, sometimes known as a \\"slot mask\\", became common in the 1970s.Len Buckwalter, \\"1970 Television: The Picture Is Brighter Than Ever\\", \\"Popular Science\\", October 1969, p. 142‚Äì145, 224.Jerry Whitaker, \\"DTV handbook\\", McGraw-Hill, 2001, p. 461‚Äì462. Another change that was widely introduced in the early 1970s was the use of a black material in the spaces around the inside of the phosphor pattern. This paint absorbed ambient light coming from the room, lowering the amount that was reflected back to the viewer. In order to make this work effectively, the phosphor dots were reduced in size, lowering their brightness. However, the improved contrast compared to ambient conditions allowed the faceplate to be made much more clear, allowing more light from the phosphor to reach the viewer and the actual brightness to increase. Grey-tinted faceplates dimmed the image, but provided better contrast, because ambient light was attenuated before it reached the phosphors, and a second time as it returned to the viewer. Light from the phosphors was attenuated only once. This method changed over time, with TV tubes growing progressively more black over time. In manufacturing color CRTs, the shadow masks or aperture grilles were also used to expose photoresist on the faceplate to ultraviolet light sources, accurately positioned to simulate arriving electrons for one color at a time. This photoresist, when developed, permitted phosphor for only one color to be applied where required. The process was used a total of three times, once for each color. (The shadow mask or aperture grille had to be removable and accurately re-positionable for this process to succeed.)

Cosmatos and written by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the title role. The film co-stars Reni Santoni, Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew Robinson. It is the first film where Brian Thompson plays a prominent role. The film was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling, which was later filmed under that title in 1995. However, Stallone's screenplay was originally conceived from ideas he had during pre-production of Beverly Hills Cop, whose screenplay he heavily revised. He had wanted to make Beverly Hills Cop a less comedic and more action-oriented film, which the studio rejected as being far too expensive. When he left that project, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead role. The film received negative reviews, with much criticism focused on the overuse of genre tropes, yet it debuted at the number one spot on the U.S. box office and became a financial success. It is now considered a cult classic. Plot An armed gunman causes a hostage crisis at a Los Angeles supermarket. When negotiations between him and law enforcement fail, the LAPD summons Lieutenant Marion Cobretti (Stallone), a member of its elite division known as the \\"Zombie Squad\\". Cobretti, known by the codename \\"Cobra\\", infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with the gunman, who threatens him by speaking of a vague and unknown organization known as \\"The New World\\", a supremacist group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the hostages and bodies are removed from the store, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to prioritize the safety of potential victims. Little does everyone realize at the time that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned. Model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Nielsen) later becomes the New World's priority target after witnessing their members and their leader, only identified as \\"The Night Slasher\\" (Thompson), going on a killing spree. She is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Santoni) after a failed attempt on her. When several more failed attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the New World, Cobretti theorizes that there is an entire army of killers operating with the same modus operandi rather than a lone serial killer with some associates, but his suggestion is rebuffed by his superiors. However, the LAPD agrees with Cobretti that it will be safest if he and Knudsen relocate from the city. Cobretti becomes romantically involved with Ingrid shortly after venturing out into the countryside, but Nancy Stalk (Garlington), the New World's second-in- command and right-hand man going undercover as a police officer escorting the Cobretti party, compromises their whereabouts. Despite Cobretti's suspicions and mistrust of Nancy, he does nothing and the party spends the night in a motel. The organization moves in at dawn and besieges the small town. With barely enough time to react, the attackers storm Cobretti and Ingrid's motel, wounding Gonzales in the process. Killing several members but with more swarming into the town, Cobretti and Ingrid escape in a pickup truck. When the truck is severely damaged from the chase, the duo cut through a grapefruit plantation to escape into a nearby factory. Cobretti has defeated most of the New World by this point, with the few remaining members following them into the building. Cobretti eliminates every member and the Night Slasher accidentally shoots Nancy, leaving just himself. Cobretti and the Night Slasher engage in a vicious melee combat inside the steel mill, ending with the Night Slasher being impaled in the back by a large roaming hook, which transports him into a furnace that burns him alive. In the aftermath, Cobretti's department arrives and begins clean-up of the town, rendering medical aid to Gonzales. Detective Monte appears apologetic but confronts Cobretti again about his lack of regard to police protocols, offering to discuss the issue over a long dinner. Cobretti punches Monte instead, before he and Ingrid ride away on one of the motorcycles left by the New World.

The studio read his revised script, and they rejected it, citing action scenes that were far beyond what their projected budget would allow. Stallone eventually left Beverly Hills Cop, and he channeled his ideas for that movie into an original script. The novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling was cited as source material, enough so that she received a screen credit. When Cobra came out, Sylvester Stallone allegedly wanted the novel to be reissued with himself credited as co-author. Gosling declined the offer. The 1995 movie Fair Game was also based on the same novel by Gosling. Sylvester Stallone's earlier draft of the script had a lot of differences from later drafts and the final film. These include the opening shootout taking place in movie theater (instead of a grocery store) during which a lot more people are killed, Cobra mentioning how he had a girlfriend who was killed by some psychopath he was trying to catch, an additional big action sequence taking place during night on a boat where Cobra and Ingrid are hiding when they get attacked by the Night Slasher's cult members but Cobra and Gonzalez manage to kill them all, and a different ending in which it's revealed that Monte was the actual leader of the New Order cult and when he tries to kill Ingrid he gets shot and killed by Cobra. Cobra needed much additional editing because the film was so graphically violent that, at first, it received an X rating from the MPAA. Warner Bros. also did not like the level of gore and violence of the first rough cut, which is why they would not release the movie until most of those scenes were deleted and the movie garnered an R rating, instead. =Casting= Brian Thompson auditioned seven times before he was hired. On the fourth audition he met Stallone, who thought that Thompson was too nice to play the Night Slasher. But after a screen test, he immediately got the job. Also in original script, the Night Slasher was called Abaddon, possibly after the \\"angel of the abyss\\" from the bible. Thompson repeatedly sought Stallone's advice about how to play the Night Slasher, including questions about his background and personal motivations, but Stallone showed no interest in the subject and told Thompson that the character was simply evil. In an unfortunate surprise for Thompson, after filming was completed, director Cosmatos unexpectedly told him: \\"You could have been good if you had listened to me.\\" Cobra reunited two actors from the film Dirty Harry: Reni Santoni, and Andy Robinson. Brigitte Nielsen was cast as Ingrid Knudsen. =Filming= Originally, Cobra was supposed to be filmed in Seattle, climaxing with a motorcycle chase scene on a ferry between the islands. Even though everything was prepared to start filming the final theatrical version of the scene at night, Stallone demanded the ending be changed because of the mosquito problem at that time, which would have made night time filming very difficult to endure. The supporting cast and extras were forbidden from talking to Stallone on set. At one point during filming, Stallone complained to cinematographer Ric Waite that they were falling behind and that he needed to push his crew to work harder. Waite responded by telling Stallone that the delays were due to his fooling around with Brigitte Nielsen and showing off for his bodyguards. Although Stallone was shocked that somebody would talk to him that way, he cleaned up his act and behaved more professionally, although he returned to his old egocentric behavior a few weeks later. Waite later said in an interview that, despite his huge ego, Stallone had a great sense of humor. He also confirmed a rumor that Stallone was the true director of the film, calling George P. Cosmatos a good producer but a bad director. For the Night Slasher's monologue in the lead-up to the final fight, Brian Thompson did the scene with a script girl standing in for Stallone, who was busy watching a basketball game on TV. The custom 1950 Mercury driven by Cobretti was actually owned by Sylvester Stallone. The studio produced stunt doubles of the car for use in some of the action sequences, such as the jump from the second floor of the parking garage. The production built three Cobra cars for stunt work. Although they were identical on the outside, their moving parts were designed for specific sequences, involving high-speed swipes with other vehicles, 180-degree turns, jumps, and 360-degree spins. The knife used by the Night Slasher was made for the film by knife designer Herman Schneider. Sylvester Stallone asked Schneider to create a knife that audiences would never forget. Cobretti uses a custom Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911 chambered in 9mm. The 9mm variant was made specifically for the film (normally it fires .45 ACP). Later in the film, he uses a Jati-Matic submachine gun. =Versions= The first rough cut was over two hours long (the closest estimated original running time is 130 minutes). It was then shortened to a roughly two-hour director's cut which was intended to be released in theaters. However, after Top Gun became a smash hit, Stallone and Warner Bros. were worried that Cobra - which would premiere the following week - would be overshadowed, so in order to ensure at least one extra screening each day the movie was heavily re-edited. Stallone removed much of the plot and scenes involving characters other than his own. Warner Bros. also demanded that the more graphic scenes be cut down or removed entirely because they were \\"too intense,\\" and that some action scenes be cut for pacing. When first submitted to the MPAA the film received an X rating, necessitating even more cuts. The full extent of the censorship is unknown, but based on director Cosmatos's commentary and several other sources, some of the cut scenes include: * The first murder victim having her throat cut and hands severed; * An Asian American child delivers a wrapped present to the LAPD office as instructed by one of the members of the New World. As the officer tells the child to stay, he proceeds to unwrap the present only to discovers traces of blood coming from the box. The officer answers a phone call from one of the members of the New World, who speaks a cryptic message of the murder victim's hands inside the box; * More dead bodies in the autopsy scene, including lingering shots of naked and mutilated bodies of murdered women; * The New World's day jobs as welders, carpenters and fish market employees and cleaners, which were originally part of the \\"Angel of the City\\" sequences. These were cut and replaced with the scenes of the New World doing a routine workout ritual as seen in the film's opening; * An extended death scene for Ingrid's photographer Dan, in which he is hit several more times with axes and attempts to escape, only to slip on his own blood and fall down in puddle of it before being finished off with even more hits; * The scene in which the Night Slasher tries to kill Ingrid in the hospital was cut down for pacing and content. The deaths of the janitor and nurse were originally shown onscreen and a scene where a police guard outside Ingrid's room is killed by the Night Slasher was also cut. A later scene where Cobretti mentions the officer's death to Monte was cut to maintain continuity, which as a result made the editing of that scene choppy; * More scenes of the townspeople (including the motel owner and diner waitress) being killed during the climax, including a scene in which one is hit in the face with ax; two of these death scenes appeared in 1990's TV versions of the film, but with most of the more graphic shots removed; * Graphic close-ups of the Night Slasher's wound after he is impaled on the hook; Cobretti repeatedly forces the hook deeper into the Night Slasher as he screams in pain; * After the demise of the Night Slasher, Cobretti and Ingrid leaves the factory but before they can exit, countryside police enter wherein the sheriff demands from them of what took place in the factory. Besides these cuts, a few scenes in which the Night Slasher and his gang are killing people were slowed down (for continuity reasons since demanded cuts made the editing of the scenes look choppy), while some of the shootouts which were originally in slow-motion were instead played at normal speed (in order to cut prolonged death scenes of gang members, plus close ups of many bullet holes which were also cut). Eventually, the movie received an R rating and was released in theaters with a running time of 84 minutes, approximately 50 minutes shorter than the first assembly cut and 30 to 40 minutes shorter than the director's cut. Much of David Rasche's role was cut. In the behind-the-scenes making of documentary available on DVD/Blu-ray, an additional (deleted) scene with him and Brigitte Nielsen is shown being filmed. The car chase between Cobretti and the Night Slasher was originally longer and ended differently. In the theatrical version the Night Slasher shoots at Cobretti's car and causes him to crash into the boat. In the original version the Night Slasher and his driver are the first ones who crash into the boat; Cobretti fails to stop his car in time and crashes into them. Shots of the Night Slasher's car turning around and him breathing in relief after Cobra crashes his car were taken from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobretti seeing the boat before he crashes into it was actually taken from the Night Slasher's car crash. In the theatrical version, the Night Slasher's crashed car is still visible in scene where Cobretti crashes into the boat. The first cut of the movie featured a slightly different version of the climactic confrontation between the Night Slasher and Cobretti. Where the final version features a longer exchange between the two, in the earlier version Cobretti appears right after the Night Slasher screams \\"We are the future!\\" and reiterates his line from the opening scene: \\"You're the disease, and I'm the cure.\\" Nightstalker's monologue about the law and Cobretti's duty as a policeman is omitted; instead, they stare at each other before Stalk attacks Cobretti. There is a noticeable continuity mistake in the final version: when Stalk jumps on Cobra there is a fire behind him, which isn't visible during the preceding conversation. This is because Stallone's closeups were shot later in a different location. The official soundtrack release includes a track called \\"Skyline\\" which is not heard anywhere in the movie. This is because scenes in which this track was used were cut during the re-editing. Originally there was a scene in which Cobretti is sitting in his home, looking at the sunset (there is a similar scene in the beginning of theatrical version in which he is cleaning up his gun and then looks out the window) and soon, right after the Night Slasher and his gang members have killed the second victim and cops show up at the scene, Cobretti gets a call to go and meet with them. \\"Skyline\\" was also originally used in some other scenes, including the ending, but it was removed and replaced with \\"Voice Of America's Sons\\" by John Cafferty. Although no uncut version or director's cut has ever seen an official release, a timecoded workprint sourced from poor quality VHS copies exists as a bootleg. It contains all of the X rated scenes and uncut action sequences, along with scenes explaining the motives of the New Order gang, focusing on characters such as the Night Slasher and Stalk, alternate lines of dialogue and a temporary score which contains some of the songs and music from the theatrical version and pieces of scores from other movies.

Reception =Box office= Cobra opened the widest for a Warner Bros. release at the time opening on 2,131 screens and debuted at number one at the U.S. box office with a Memorial Day weekend debut of $15. 7million. It eventually went on to gross $160 million, over six times its estimated $25 million budget. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Critical response= Cobra was a critical failure. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a 14% approval rating based on 21 reviews, with a weighted average of 2.99/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 25 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Much criticism was aimed at its plotting and dialogue, which were seen as merely rehashing common action film tropes. The level of violence (even after re-editing) was also considered gratuitous. The TV Guide stated that \\"Stallone's character is an empty hulk...the few attempts to provide us with little insights into his character are downright laughable.\\" The New York Times opined that the film \\"pretends to be against the wanton violence of a disintegrating society, but it's really the apotheosis of that violence....[it] shows such contempt for the most basic American values\\". =Accolades= Cobra was nominated for six Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone), Worst Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star (both for Brian Thompson) and Worst Screenplay.(1987)\\"1986 RAZZIE¬Æ Nominees & 'Winners.'\\" Razzies.com.

He set 80 world records and 81 Soviet records in weightlifting and won gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.  Biography  At the age of 18, Alekseyev began practicing weightlifting at Trud VSS, trained by his coach Rudolf Plyukfelder until 1968, when he began to train solo. He was not a naturally large man like other super heavyweights but was encouraged to gain strength by adding weight. In January 1970 Alekseyev set his first world record, and during the World Weightlifting Championship in Columbus, Ohio, US. In 1970 he was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds (227 kg) in competition. During one of his early world records, Oscar State OBE remarked that the weight of over 460 pounds (209 kg) in the Olympic press looked so easy it could have been a broomstick. This was the beginning of a series of 80 world records Alekseyev set between 1970 and 1977. He received bonus funds every time he set a world record by the Soviet government (Soviet athletes were funded by the state); so he made it a point to gradually increase his world records by 1.1 pounds or 0.5 kg. He was unbeaten and held the World Championship and European Championship titles for those eight years. He was the first man to total over 600 kg in the triple event. Many thought he would be the first to clean and jerk the mythical 600 pounds but it was never to be as his habit of increasing world records by only 1/2 kilo took so long that age caught up to him. Alekseyev's performance in the Moscow Olympics of 1980 was a disappointment. He had by then become more of a recluse, training by himself without a coach. In the snatch he set his opening weight too high and was unable to lift it, scoring zero kilograms as the result. He retired from weightlifting after the Moscow Olympics. In 1987, Alekseyev was elected to represent the Ryazan District for the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies. Alekseyev worked as a coach between 1990 and 1992. Under his leadership, the Unified Team earned ten medals in weightlifting at the 1992 Summer Olympics, including five golds. From 1966 Alekseyev lived in Shakhty, where in 1971 he graduated from the branch of the Novocherkassk Polytechnical Institute. He died on 25 November 2011 in Germany in a clinic where he had been sent for serious heart problems. He was 69. The Russian Weightlifting Federation reported his death and called him a \\"Soviet sports legend\\" and \\"one of the strongest people in the world\\".Original Russian text: \\"–ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥–æ–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞\\" and \\"–æ–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–µ–π—à–∏—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã\\". He was survived by wife Olimpiada and sons Sergey and Dmitry. Dmitry competed nationally in weightlifting, placing fourth at the 1988 Soviet weightlifting championships. Legacy and awards Vladimir Vysotsky devoted his \\"Song about weightlifter\\" (, 1971) to Alekseyev. Alekseyev was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated 14 April 1975, titled \\"World's Strongest Man.\\" In 1999, in Greece, Alekseyev was acknowledged as the best sportsman of the 20th century. He was also awarded: Order of Lenin (1972), Order of Friendship of Peoples, Order of the Badge of Honour (1970), and Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1972). In 1993, he was elected a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame.

artificial restrictions of computers or entertainment devices. Modchips are mainly used in video game consoles, but also in some DVD or Blu-ray players. They introduce various modifications to its host system's function, including the circumvention of region coding, digital rights management, and copy protection checks for the purpose of using media intended for other markets, copied media, or unlicensed third-party (homebrew) software.  Function and construction  Modchips operate by replacing or overriding a system's protection hardware or software. They achieve this by either exploiting existing interfaces in an unintended or undocumented manner, or by actively manipulating the system's internal communication, sometimes to the point of re-routing it to substitute parts provided by the modchip. Most modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits (microcontrollers, FPGAs, or CPLDs), often complemented with discrete parts, usually packaged on a small PCB to fit within the console system it is designed for. Although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes, most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version. Modchips typically require some degree of technical skill to install since they must be connected to a console's circuitry, most commonly by soldering wires to select traces or chip legs on a system's circuit board. Some modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the modchip's contacts to the console's circuit (\\"quicksolder\\"), by the precise positioning of electrical contacts (\\"solderless\\"), or, in rare cases, by plugging them into a system's internal or external connector. Memory cards or cartridges that offer functions similar to modchips work on a completely different concept, namely by exploiting flaws in the system's handling of media. Such devices are not referred to as modchips, even if they are frequently traded under this umbrella term. The diversity of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips are often used for the same goal, they may work in vastly different ways, even if they are intended for use on the same console. Some of the first modchips for the Nintendo Wii, known as drive chips, modify the behaviour and communication of the optical drive to bypass security. On the Xbox 360, a common modchip took advantage of the fact short periods of instability in the CPU could be used to fairly reliably lead it to incorrectly compare security signatures. The precision required in this attack meant that the modchip had to make use of a CPLD. Other modchips, such as the XenoGC and clones for the Nintendo GameCube, invoke a debug mode where security measures are reduced or absent (in which case a stock Atmel AVR microcontroller was used). A more recent innovation are optical disk drive emulators or ODDE, which replace the optical disk drive and allow data to come from another source bypassing the need to circumvent any security. These often make use of FPGAs to enable them to accurately emulate timing and performance characteristics of the optical drives.  History  Most cartridge-based console systems did not have modchips produced for them. They usually implemented copy protection and regional lockout with game cartridges, both on hardware and software level. Converters or passthrough devices have been used to circumvent the restrictions, while flash memory devices (game backup devices) were widely adopted in later years to copy game media. Early in the transition from solid-state to optical media, CD-based console systems did not have regional market segmentation or copy protection measures due to the rarity and high cost of user-writable media at the time. Modchips started to surface with the PlayStation system, due to the increasing availability and affordability of CD writers and the increasing sophistication of DRM protocols. At the time, a modchip's sole purpose was to allow the use of imported and copied game media. Today, modchips are available for practically every current console system, often in a great number of variations. In addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms, modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system, such as allowing the use of user-created software (homebrew), expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system, or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system (e.g. for use as a home theater PC).  Anti-modchip measures  Most modchips open the system to copied media, therefore the availability of a modchip for a console system is undesirable for console manufacturers. They react by removing the intrusion points exploited by a modchip from subsequent hardware or software versions, changing the PCB layout the modchips are customized for, or by having the firmware or software detect an installed modchip and refuse operation as a consequence. Since modchips often hook into fundamental functions of the host system that cannot be removed or adjusted, these measures may not completely prevent a modchip from functioning but only prompt an adjustment of its installation process or programming, e.g. to include measures to make it undetectable (\\"stealth\\") to its host system. With the advent of online services to be used by video game consoles, some manufacturers have executed their possibilities within the service's license agreement to ban consoles equipped with modchips from using those services.Xbox LIVE Terms of Use , Section 14 In an effort to dissuade modchip creation, some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles. However, some of these features have been withdrawn at a later date.Microsoft XNALinux for PlayStation 2Linux for PlayStation 3 An argument can be made that a console system remains largely untouched by modchips as long as their manufacturers provide an official way of running unlicensed third-party software.  Legality  One of the most prominent functions of many modchips --the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms--is outlawed by many countries' copyright laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States, the European Copyright Directive and its various implementations by the EU member countries, and the Australian Copyright Act. Other laws may apply to the many diversified functions of a modchip, e.g. Australian law specifically allowing the circumvention of region coding. The ambiguity of applicable law, its nonuniform interpretation by the courts, and constant profound changes and amendments to copyright law do not allow for a definitive statement on the legality of modchips. A modchip's legality under a country's legislature may only be individually asserted in court. Most of the very few cases that have been brought before a court ended with the conviction of the modchip merchant or the manufacturer under the respective country's anti-circumvention laws. A small number of cases in the United Kingdom and Australia were dismissed under the argument that a system's copy protection mechanism would not be able to prevent the actual infringement of copyright-- the actual process of copying game media--and therefore cannot be considered an effective technical protection measure protected by anti-circumvention laws. In 2006, Australian copyright law has been amended to effectively close this legal loophole.Australian Copyright Amendment Act 2006 In a 2017 lawsuit against a retailer, a Canadian court ruled in favor of Nintendo under anti- circumvention provisions in Canadian copyright law, which prohibit any breaching of technical protection measures. The court ruled that even though the retailer claimed the products could be used for homebrew, thus asserting exemptions for maintaining interoperability, the court ruled that because Nintendo offers development kits for its platforms, interoperability could be achieved without breaching TPMs, and thus the defence is invalid.  Alternatives  An alternative of installing a modchip is a process of softmodding a device. A softmodded device does not need to permanently have any additional hardware pieces inside. Instead, the software of a device or its internal part is modified in order to change the device's behaviour.

Often, roots revivals include an addition of newly composed songs with socially and politically aware lyrics, as well as a general modernization of the folk sound. The term roots revival is vague, and may not always refer to identical events. Characteristics associated with a roots revival include: * Popularization of previously non-mainstream folk music * Adaptation of folk styles to pop (or rock) structures * Invention of new formats like bands where only solo acts had existed before * Introduction of new instruments * Composition of works by those who perform them, as opposed to folk tunes mostly passed down orally (see singer-songwriter) * Incorporation of politically aware lyrics, often critical of a government, religion or other authority, or society in general. * Lyrics are the first from the nation to express more than simple desires and problems, and are often seen as the embodiment of a national character or literary tradition (in comparison to the legendary American songwriter, such composers are often said to be the \\"Bob Dylan\\" of a particular variety, as in Wannes Van de Velde is the Belgian Bob Dylan) * Roots revival performers will often come from very different social and economic backgrounds compared to the people whose style of music they are popularizing. With such a vague and variable definition, roots revival could be seen as referring to the creation of any kind of pop music industry, though there are countries with well-developed pop traditions that have not had a period referred to as a roots revival (such as Jamaica, India, Cuba and Kenya). For example, homogenized pop has long had its fans in most every country in the world, but many of these nations have created their own indigenous pop styles out of folk music; this process could be called a roots revival, though in some cases the folk musics in question were still widespread and did not need to be revived. History Cecil Sharp, founding figure of the early 20th century folk revival in England The British folk revival was an academic movement to transcribe and record traditional British songs during the late 19th and early 20th century. Pioneers of this movement were the Harvard professor Francis James Child (1825‚Äì96), compiler of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882‚Äì92), Sabine Baring-Gould (1834‚Äì1924), Frank Kidson (1855‚Äì1926), Lucy Broadwood (1858‚Äì1939), and Anne Gilchrist (1863‚Äì1954).B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 31‚Äì8. The Folk Song Society was founded in 1898 to promote this new endeavour. A major figure in this movement was Cecil Sharp who was the most influential on the repertoire of subsequent performers and defining the nature of folk song. His lectures and other publications attempted to define a musical tradition that was rural in origin, oral in transmission and communal in nature. The American folk music revival, which focused on culture and entertainment, began in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Great Depression, folk music styles were disseminated around the country, as Delta blues, Latino and Cajun musicians, and itinerant honky tonk singers spread to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City. The growth of the music industry in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs. This meant that musical fads, such as Hawaiian slack-key guitar, never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres. The movement became global in the 1960s and 1970s. In most cases, the folk music being revived was not quite extinct, though some hadn't been played for years or was moribund; such cases include the Celtic music of Cornwall and the Isle of Man, for example. In other cases, such as Cameroon and the Dominican Republic, no revival was necessary as the music remained common, and was merely popularized and adapted for mainstream audiences at home and abroad.  Roots revivals  Algerian music: Beginning as early as 1964, gaining steam in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, a mainstream ra√Ø revival occurred, and pop-ra√Ø stars like Khaled and Chaba Fadela gained worldwide audiences; the same period saw similar trends occur among Kabyle musicians such as Idir, Ferhat and Lounis Ait Menguellet, who popularized the native sounds of their people Belgian music: Starting early in the 1960s, a wave of popular folk-based performers emerged, led by Wannes Van de Velde, who drew primarily on Flemish traditions. By the 1980s, popular bands included Brabants Volksorkest and the folk rock band Kadril. Beninese music: Artists like Tohon Stan have created a popular version of Benin's numerous styles of indigenous folk music, such as tchink-system, a derivative of the funeral genre of tchinkoum√© Cambodian music: The early 1960s saw a revival of classical music and dance, inspired by Princess Norodom Buppha Devi and led by Sinn Sisamouth, though the rise of the Khmer Rouge largely ended this trend. Cameroonian music: Beginning with bikutsi in the 1950s and continuing with makossa into the end of the 20th century, Cameroon's popularized folk musics have become among the most prominent in Africa. Messi Me Nkonda Martin undoubtedly did the most to evolve bikutsi from its folk origins into a popular style using electric guitars and other importations, while Manu Dibango brought makossa to new audiences around the world. Chinese music: Partially as a reaction against attempts by the Communist government to use traditional styles to drum up patriotism and loyalty, the 1970s saw the creation of Chinese rock and Cantopop (in Hong Kong), both of which made some use of native folk styles, especially in vocal techniques. The leader of Chinese rock is undoubtedly Cui Jian. Ivorian music: Ernesto Dj√©dj√©'s ziglibithy style incorporates a number of folk genres from across C√¥te d'Ivoire, a diverse country with hundred of ethnic groups; Dj√©dj√©'s most immediate influence was the folk rhythms of the B√©t√©. Croatian music: By the 1980s, Croatian pop-folk had seen some mainstream success, and a wave of bands appeared, inspired by Vje≈°tice, who combined Meƒëimurje folk music with rock in an innovative fusion of sounds. Czech music: In 1966, the Porta Festival was held, and a wave of singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Pete Seeger arose. Danish music: In contrast to its neighbors, Denmark did not see a Roots revival until the late 1990s, when performers like Morten Alfred H√∏irup gained a widespread following in the country. Dutch music: The late 1960s saw a revival of Dutch folk music, led by performers like Gerard van Maasakkers; popularity was limited, and soon ended, though region of Friesland has maintained a strong traditional music scene. Egyptian music: The city of Cairo is the most important center for Egyptian music, which includes a variety of popularized folk styles, including northern sawahii and southern saiyidi. Finnish music: Finland's folk styles include a variety of national genres and ballads, while the traditional rhyming sleigh songs rekilaulu have become an integral part of many pop singers. In 1967, the Savonlinna Opera Festival, the first of several similar festivals, contributed to a revival of Finnish opera and other more traditional styles. French music: Though many of France's regional styles have seen popularization, the most vibrant scene is undoubtedly the traditional music of Brittany. The region boasts a uniquely Celtic heritage, which has been emphasized by the revival since its beginnings in the early 1970s, led by Alan Stivell. Corsican music has also seen a revival, though with little popular success, concurrent with the rise of Corsican nationalism in the 1970s. In the same way Occitan music, has also seen a revival with Occitan nationalism and reviviscence of occitan speaking in 60's (politic crisis with Gaullists to a clash with French linguistic imperialism and conservative politics) See also the Qu√©b√©cois under Canadian music. Gambian music: By the 1970s, Gambian musicians were mostly playing popular merengue or other styles. A visit by pop band The Super Eagles to London to record saw a change, as they were encouraged to continue their practice of Gambian folk. The band became known as Ifang Bondi, and their music was called Afro-Manding blues. Garifuna music: Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the following decades, the Garifunas, an Afro-Caribbean people found throughout Central America, began turning to their native punta sound and creating popular styles like punta rock, which found an audience across the area. Pen Cayetano was the most important figure in this scene. German music: Following the 1968 student revolution in West Germany, singer- songwriters playing a kind of expressive, melancholy music with traditional influences became popular. Due to governmental interference, East Germany did not see much of this influence until the mid-1970s. Ghanaian music: Ghana is best known for the highlife style of music, which has been popular throughout the 20th century. By the late 1960s, however, the pop scene was dominated by generic guitar bands that imitated Western acts. The 1971 Soul to Soul festival, however, featured a number of African American musicians (like Wilson Pickett and Tina Turner), which had the effect of legitimizing African culture, thus causing a major roots revival that brought highlife to international audiences. Greek music: The late 1960s and early 1970s coup repressed remb√©tika, a style which had developed earlier in the century. This oppression ironically created a major boom in popularity for the genre, which became associated with political resistance and rebellion. Singer-songwriters like Dionysis Savvopoulos also became wildly popular, and were seen as voices of the Greek nation. Music of Israel: Early Zionist settlers in Palestine, as far back as the 1880s, sought to create a new mode of Jewish folk music that was based on Biblical musical modes that had long since been abandoned. These composers, who included Matityahu Shelem, Yedidiah Admon, and many others, drew on Yemenite, Arabic and other antique sources to create a unique style that they considered a revival of ancient Jewish music. The songs that they and their followers composed constitute a canonical body of folk music called \\"Songs of the Land of Israel.\\" These songs are still widely performed today by popular artists. Another example of roots revival in Israel is the preservation of regional Jewish musical styles. The music of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities has morphed into an eclectic new style called \\"Muzika Mizrahit\\". Folksongs in Yiddish and Ladino have been revived and recorded by artists like Chava Alberstein and Yehoram Gaon. Yair Dalal incorporates stylistic elements of the music of his native Iraq in his synthetic musical style. Italian music: The diverse regions of Italy are home to dozens of varieties of folk music. By the 1950s, their popularity was declining rapidly and a group of musicians and musicologists founded organizations like Istituto de Martino and Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano to help preserve folk cultures. The following decade saw a revival of a number of traditions, including Ciccio Busacca's fusions of Sicilian folk styles, central Italy's jazzy modern folk, pioneered by Canzoniere del Lazio, the re- appearance of the lira through the work of Re Niliu, the popularization of diverse genres of northern Italian music and some of the work of world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso, who revitalized Naples' canzone napoletana tradition. In contrast to many other countries', Italy's roots revival has resulted in very little mainstream success. Japanese music: Though elements of traditional Japanese music can be found in some rock and pop from the country, the only major roots revival was Okinawan, and began in the late 1980s. Popularized Okinawan folk music includes genres like kawachi ondo and goshu ondo. Korean music: In the early 1970s, a genre called t'ong guitar developed, performed by singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Korean folk has seen little popular success, though there has been some for the pansori, nongak and sanjo styles. Latvian music: Its traditional long suppressed or appropriated by the Soviet Union, Latvia's kokles (an instrument similar to a box zither) was revived and popularised in the 1970s, led by traditional suiti kokle player JƒÅnis Poriƒ∑is and ethnomusicologist Valdis MuktupƒÅvels. Lithuanian music: The Soviet Union had sponsored some music festivals, such as the dain≈≥ ≈°ventƒós, but did not allow for much lyrical or musical innovation, and kept all songwriters from experimenting with politically aware and dissident lyrics. An active cultural rebellion occurred in the 1960s, based around a series of national music festivals and concerts. Malian music: Cuban music had become extremely popular in Mali by the 1960s, and little folk music could compete. The country's second president, however, Moussa Traor√©, encouraged the growth of a Malian music industry, resulting in a revival of some kinds of folk music, and a popularization led by Salif Keita. Later Fanto Sacko's bajourou music and wassoulou music also became popularized. However, by the 1980s, Malian pop had lost most traces of its folk origins and was simply dance music, even topping the European charts; another roots revival occurred, led by Guinean acoustic singer and kora player Jali Musa Jawara. Mozambiquan music: Music was used in the 1960s by the independence movement in Mozambique. Leaders in this movement encouraged the growth of a national music industry. By the 1970s, native forms of music, such as marrabenta, had been popularized. Russian music: Starting in about 1966, a group of bards arose, most prominently including Vladimir Vysotsky, and Vyacheslav Shchurov organized a number of concerts for folk singers. This led to a revival and revitalization of Russian folk songs, a trend which continued in ensuing decades. Sami music: The Sami, an indigenous people found in central and northern Scandinavia, northern Finland and northwestern Russia, have a tradition of folk songs called joiks, which have been popularized by the likes of Mari Boine, who remains a legend in the field. Slovenian music: in the 1950s, the so-called \\"folk popular music\\" emerged with groups like Avsenik and Lojze Slak band, based on modernized Slovenian-style polka. In the 1980s, a completely different trend emerged, based on more archaic folk music, usually from specific regions; and it was popularized by groups like Istranova (Slovenian Istria) and singer Vlado Kreslin (Prekmurje). =Latin America, Portugal and Spain= Argentine music: In the 1960s, Andean nationalism was spreading across Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Peru. Argentina's nativist scene includes landmark performers like Mercedes Sosa and Atahualpa Yupanqui, who helped spawn the nueva canci√≥n scene. Bolivian music: The 1950s saw an increase in nationalist identity surrounding the Quechua and Aymara peoples, and a number of intellectuals began associating themselves with folk music, clothing, cuisine and other elements. By the mid-1960s, a folk revival was blossoming, led by Edgar Jofr√©. Brazilian music: Beginning in the 1950s and continuing for several decades, a multitude of Brazilian styles (most importantly samba) and imported American jazz combined to create the wildly popular bossa nova scene. This soon evolved into the politically charged Tropicalia genre, which starred controversial and acclaimed singer-songwriters Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Chilean music: In the early to mid-1960s, the burgeoning nueva canci√≥n movement spread throughout Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, featuring a wave of singer-songwriters who incorporated folk elements and nationalist lyrics, often critical of governmental authorities, and achieved great acclaim. Violeta Parra is sometimes viewed as the founder of the scene, for she popularized Quechua and Aymara songs and provided an outlet for performances by future luminaries like Victor Jara. Cuban music: By the 1960s, Cuban music had seen international success in the form of pop- mambo, chachacha and other genres, and many artists were disillusioned with these styles, which were seen as watered-down. A vanguard of singer- songwriters like Silvio Rodr√≠guez and Pablo Milan√©s arose, composing politically aware songs in a style that came to be called Nueva Trova. Dominican music: Merengue had been popular in the Dominican Republic for decades since evolving out of confusing folk origins, but did not truly become a form of pop music until the early 1960s, when legends like Johnny Ventura brought the music to new audiences at home and abroad. Spanish music was incorporated into Spanish Baroque music in the harpsichord works of Soler. Later composers such as Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo and Giuliani used the dance rhythms of Spain. The classical guitarists Andr√©s Segovia, John Williams and Julian Bream popularised the music through their recordings. Current popular folk musicians include Susana Seivane, Hevia and Milladoiro. A roots revival Nueva canci√≥n, which also evolved into new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish-speaking countries. Portuguese music: In the 1960s and 1970s, Jos√© Afonso led a return to more traditionally styled fado music, which later evolved into a number of new song forms that incorporated socio- political lyrics and foreign influences. =English-speaking countries= : Includes English and Celtic revivals : For additional Celtic music, see the French section above Australian music: Beginning in the 1980s, Australian Aborigines began turning to their native styles of folk music, which were updated, creating popular bands and styles like Aboriginal rock. Canadian music: Though some artists, like The Band, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, had been integral parts of the 1960s American folk rock scene, Canada has seen its own distinctive revival of styles. This includes the late 1970s scene in Maritime Canada, which glorified the area's Celtic heritage and was led by regional legends Figgy Duff and Stan Rogers, as well as the mid-1960s Quebecois revival led by Gilles Vigneault. There were also revivals of Acadian, Inuit and other folk styles. In the 1950s and 1960s dedicated folk music collectors spread out across the country to record traditional music. The songs and tunes were popularized on public radio by performers such as Alan Mills, Stu Davis, Marg Osborne, and the Travellers.\\"Folk Music Revival\\", The Encyclopedia of Music in CanadaA number of musicians who grew up listening to this traditional music became singer-songwriters in the 1970s; for example, Gordon Lightfoot and Ian and Sylvia.Dicaire, David, The Folk Music Revival, 1958‚Äì1970: Biographies of Fifty Performers, McFarland, 2001 English music: There were two folk music revivals in England. The first, led by Cecil Sharp, was academic. It involved the collection of songs and tunes and their publication in journals. It was at its peak about 1910. The second revival involved large-scale public performances of English music, beginning with the appearance of the Copper Family at the Royal Albert Hall in 1952, together with a proliferation of folk clubs meeting mainly in the upper rooms of public houses. Starting in the late 1960s the songs were performed in a contemporary style; this was the origin of the British folk rock style. Irish music: There was a revival of Irish folk music that began in the early 20th century, based both in Dublin and Ireland, though the longer-lasting and more famous revival began in 1955 with the album \\"The Lark in the Morning\\", whose recording was supervised by Diane Hamilton and which featured Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem prior to their involvement with the influential but U.S.-based Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Later famous groups include The Dubliners (founded 1962), The Chieftains (1963), Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann, and Clannad (1973). Later, singer- songwriters such as Christy Moore were inspired by American popular folk singers, and they took to modernizing and adapting Irish music for modern audiences. The result was a dramatic change from folk traditions, including the introduction of the bouzouki and influences including soul and rock. Scottish music: The Scottish folk revival begin in 1951 when Hamish Henderson created the People's Festival. The Boys of the Lough were one of the first instrumental Celtic groups to tour the world. US music: The American Folklore Society was founded in 1888. Some members, including Frank Clyde Brown, George Lyman Kittredge, and John Lomax began collecting and recording 'trivial' music of minority groups. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, performers such as A. P. Carter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Lesley Riddle, and Woody Guthrie specifically began to seek out traditional songs to incorporate them into their performance repertoire. A traditional music revival started the American folk music revival that began in the 1940s and led to a new genre, contemporary folk music. A group of American archivists and researchers that included John A. Lomax, his son Alan Lomax, poet Carl Sandburg, musician Charles Seeger, and others collected, recorded, and published old ballads, prison songs, Appalachian folk music and black blues. A number of performers influenced by traditional music, such as Pete Seeger, Josh White, Burl Ives, and The Weavers, enjoyed considerable commercial success in the 1940s, leading to a broader commercial revival in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with performers such as The Kingston Trio, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary selling millions of record albums. The folk revival in the US led to the creation of folk rock, a new genre that drew on songs and themes associated with folk music and arranged them with rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll instruments. Many of the early artists and groups associated with the genre began as folk musicians, most notably Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, and Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead. The 21st century saw a smaller revival of Appalachian folk music with the release of the 2000 motion picture soundtrack to \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\". Singers such as Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss and the bluegrass performer Ralph Stanley were featured on the album. Transnational: During the 2010s, folk-inspired acts began to score chart hits in the UK, US and beyond. Most notably the UK group Mumford & Sons won the Grammy (US National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences award) for best album in 2013. References  Further reading  = General = * Bakan, Michael B.

Some black bloc protesters wear hoods, allowing their faces to be viewed, while others use such items as scarves, dark sunglasses or masks to conceal their faces as much as possible. A black bloc is a tactic used by protesters who wear black clothing, ski masks, scarves, sunglasses, motorcycle helmets with padding, or other face-concealing and face-protecting items.Autonomia and the Origin of the Black Bloc. Retrieved 7 November 2008. The clothing is used to conceal wearers' identities and hinder criminal prosecution by making it difficult to distinguish between participants. It is also used to protect their faces and eyes from pepper spray, which is used by police during protests or civil unrest. The tactic allows the group to appear as one large unified mass. Black bloc participants are often associated with anarchism, anarcho-communism, communism, libertarian socialism, antifascism, or the anti-globalization movement. The tactic was developed in the 1980s in the European autonomist movement's protests against squatter evictions, nuclear power, and restrictions on abortion, as well as other influences. Black blocs gained broader media attention outside Europe during the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, when a black bloc damaged property of Gap, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other multinational retail locations in downtown Seattle. History =Precursors= In February 1967, the anarchist group Black Mask marched on Wall Street in New York City wearing black clothes and balaclavas. This was the first instance of a social movement in the western world utilizing masks and black dress, which were used not for purposes of disguise but to signify a militant identity. In this regard, Black Mask anticipated and may have indirectly influenced the black bloc tactic. =West German origins= An anti-fascist black bloc in Germany This tactic was developed in response to increased use of police force following the 1977 Brokdorf demonstration. On 1 May 1987, demonstrators in Berlin-Kreuzberg were confronted by West Berlin police. After this, thousands of people attacked the police with rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails. The riots at the May Day in Kreuzberg became famous after the police had to completely pull out of the \\"SO 36\\" neighborhood in Kreuzberg for several hours, and rioters looted shops together with residents. When Ronald Reagan came to Berlin in June 1987, he was met by around 50,000 demonstrators protesting against his Cold War policies. This included a black bloc of 3,000 people. In November 1987, the residents were joined by thousands of other protesters and fortified their squat, built barricades in the streets and defended themselves against the police for nearly 24 hours. After this the city authorities legalised the squatters residence. On 1 May 1988, radical left groups organised a May Day demonstration through Berlin-Kreuzberg, ending in riots even heavier than the year before. The police were attacked with steel balls fired by slingshots, stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. On 2 May, headline of the Berlin newspaper BZ was \\"Beirut?? Nein, das ist Berlin!\\" (Beirut?? No, it's Berlin!). The riots finally became a tradition in Berlin-Kreuzberg and have recurred every 1 May since, but never as fatally as in the first two years. When the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund met in Berlin in 1988, the autonomen hosted an international gathering of anti-capitalist activists. Numbering around 80,000, the protesters greatly outnumbered the police. Officials tried to maintain control by banning all demonstrations and attacking public assemblies. Nevertheless, there were riots and upmarket shopping areas were destroyed. =Unified Germany= Part of a black bloc in Hamburg during the G20 summit In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the German black bloc movement continued traditional riots such as May Day in Berlin-Kreuzberg, but with decreasing intensity. Their main focus became the struggle against the recurring popularity of Neo-Nazism in Germany. The \\"turn\\" came in June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit. A black bloc of 2,000 people built barricades, set cars alight and attacked the police during a mass demonstration in Rostock. 400 police officers were injured, as well as about 500 demonstrators and activists. According to the German Verfassungsschutz, the weeks of organisation before the demonstration and the riots themselves amounted to a revival for the militant left in Germany. Since the \\"Battle of Rostock\\", traditional \\"May Day Riots\\" after demonstrations every 1 May in Berlin, and since 2008 also in Hamburg, became more intense. =International development= North America Iraq War Protest in Washington D.C., on March 21, 2009. The first prominent use of the tactic in United States of America occurred at the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C. on 17 October 1988, although anarchists had been using similar tactics in small numbers in preceding years in places like San Francisco, culminating with several hundred anarchists in black smashing glass store fronts and attacking vehicles in the Berkeley Anarchist Riot of 1989. In D.C., over one thousand demonstrators‚Äîa small number consisting of a black bloc‚Äîcalled for the end to U.S. support for the right wing death squads in El Salvador.See The Black Bloc Papers, page 35, Breaking Glass Press, Shawnee Mission, KS, 2010 A black bloc caused damage to property of GAP, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other retail locations in downtown Seattle during the 1999 anti-WTO demonstrations. They were a common feature of subsequent anti-globalization protests. In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more legalistic, orderly forms, and was increasingly dominated by the middle-class.Doug McAdam, et al. \\"There Will Be Fighting in the Streets: The Distorting Lens of Social Movement Theory\\", Mobilization: An International Journal 10(1): 1-18. This corresponded with the rise of a highly effective police strategy of crowd control called \\"negotiated management.\\"McPhail, Clark, David Schweingruber and John McCarthy. 1998. \\"Policing Protest in the United States: 1960-1995\\", pp. 49-69, in della Porta, Donatella and Herbert Reiter (eds), Policing Protest: The Control of Mass Demonstrations in Western Democracies. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. Many social scientists have noted the \\"institutionalization of movements\\" in this period.Doug McAdam, et al. \\"There Will Be Fighting in the Streets: The Distorting Lens of Social Movement Theory\\", Mobilization: An International Journal 10(1): 1-18. These currents largely constrained disruptive protest until 1999. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists, some of them in a black bloc formation.\\"Day 2- November 30, 1999\\", WTO History Project, University of Washington.\\"Seattle Declares Civil Emergency\\", BBC News, 1 December 1999.John Vidal, \\"The real battle of Seattle\\", The Guardian, 5 December 1999. In the lead up to the shutdown, local group Seattle Anarchist Response (SAR) had circulated Ward Churchill's text Pacifism as Pathology freely among protesters. SAR actively promoted among the rank-and-file of the Direct Action Network (DAN) and criticized NGO hegemony of the protests. They often found an enthusiastic response.Seattle Anarchist Response Bulletin, 15 November 1999. Black bloc organizing during WTO protests The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from Peoples' Global Action (a network co-founded by the Zapatistas) which supported diversity of tactics and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence.Geov Parrish, \\"Beyond Gandhi\\", The Seattle Weekly, 17 November 1999. In the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. Medea Benjamin told The New York Times that \\"These anarchists should have been arrested,\\"Alexander Cockburn and our readers, \\"WTO: Workers of the World United?\\" The Nation, 14 February 2000.Timothy Egan, \\"Black masks lead to pointed fingers in Seattle\\", The New York Times, 2 December 1999. while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants.\\"Lori's War\\" , Foreign Policy, Spring 2000, p. 49.

During protests against the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, a black bloc riot damaged a number of retail locations including an Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, Adidas Store, Starbucks and many banking establishments. On the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, black bloc groups were present among other protests in Washington, D.C. and other places. The groups engaged in vandalism, rioting, and violence. At least 217 were arrested and six police officers sustained minor injuries, and at least one other person was injured. In February 2017, an event at the University of California, Berkeley by commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was cancelled by college administrators after protestors of a black bloc broke windows, shot fireworks, and caused a light fixture to catch fire. The cancellation of the event brought mainstream attention to anarchism and black bloc tactics, and led to a larger conversation about the role of violence in protest movements. Brazil During the June‚ÄìJuly 2013 mass public demonstrations, groups of people using Black Bloc tactics started attending demonstrations, especially those held across the street from governor of Rio de Janeiro State S√©rgio Cabral's residence and the state government palace. Police face accusations of infiltrating the movement and, at times, acting as agents provocateurs by starting confrontations. Many leftists claim that video footage shows an infiltrated police officer throwing a molotov cocktail that wounded a riot policeman, although this has been denied by the police and hasn't been proven until today (2017). Protester violence occurred regularly during the Brazilian protests (particularly the week of 17 to 21 June) even when not linked with the black bloc, or with police infiltration.\\"Black Bloc Rising: Social Networks in Brazil\\". Igarape Institute, 13 March 2014Hannah Waldram \\"Brazil protests continue\\". The Guardian, 21 June 2013 Despite the denunciations by media, police, and even some activists, the black bloc tactic persisted in the movement. By October 2013, \\"The mask-wearers were welcomed by the protesters who wanted to wreak havoc during manifestations...Indeed, this sense of solidarity amidst the demonstrations, this shared manning of barricades, inspires a common determination to fight against the fear of repression.\\" According to a report by two Brazilian leftists published in Al Jazeera, this coincided with a revival in the breadth of the street protests that had not been seen since its early days in June.Bruno Cava and Marcelo Castaneda \\"Black Bloc and Teachers: Education crisis explodes on Rio's streets\\". Al Jazeera, 23 October 2013 On 10 October, the Rio teacher's union (Sepe) officially declared support for the recent black bloc actions, stating that the bloc were \\"welcome\\" at their demonstrations.

O Dios, 10 October 2013 Europe On 1 May 2018, over 1,200 black bloc took part in demonstrations in Paris, France. Public infrastructures and stores were damaged. During the demonstrations of the Yellow vests movement (autumn 2018-spring 2019) major damage was done by black bloc in Paris, Toulouse and Bordeaux. The protest resulting in the most significant amount of property damage took place in Paris when protestors took to the streets on the Champs-√âlys√©es on 16 March 2019.AFP (16 March 2019). \\"Et une foule noire et jaune enflamma les Champs-√âlys√©es.\\" CNews.fr.

A group of about 400 black bloc demonstrators took part in the 2011 London anti-cuts protest where they targeted various high end retail outlets; according to journalist Paul Mason this may have been the largest ever black bloc assembly in the UK. Mason says some of the participants were anarchists from Europe, others were British students who joined the demonstrations after participating in the 2010 UK student protests. A black bloc protested the opening of the universal exposition Expo 2015 in Milan. Amongst hundreds of thousands of protesters protesting the G20 Summit in Hamburg Germany were thousands of black clad rioters who clashed with police in a 3-day standoff resulting in millions of euros in property damage. At least 500 protestors were injured and more than 200 were arrested. Egypt On 25 January 2013, on the second anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution, black blocs made an appearance in the Egyptian political scenes where they have reportedly attacked various Muslim Brotherhood headquarters and government buildings and stopped traffic and metro lines in more than 8 cities.\\"Black Block in Egypt, a mysterious group monitored by authorities\\". France24 (in arabic) A group of young protesters, who identified themselves as the \\"Black Bloc\\", have marked the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution by blocking the tramway tracks in Alexandria on Friday. Egyptian Prosecutor General Talaat Abdallah ordered the police and armed forces to arrest any participant in the Black Bloc, pointing out that the group was carrying out \\"terrorist activities\\" and is considered by the government and under the new Constitution a violent radical outlaw group. =Police infiltration= On occasion, police and security services have infiltrated black blocs, for purposes of investigation. Allegations first surfaced after several demonstrations. At the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa, among the many complaints about the police there was mention of video footage which \\"suggests that men in black were seen getting out of police vans near protest marches.\\" In August 2007, Quebec police admitted that \\"their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators\\" in Montebello. However, the officers purportedly did not engage in violence, and claimed that they were carrying rocks because other protesters were doing so. They were identified by genuine protesters because of their police-issue footwear. According to veteran activist Harsha Walia, it was other participants in the black bloc who identified and exposed the undercover police. There is no evidence that the black bloc tactic is particularly vulnerable to infiltration, however, as investigatory ‚Äì and even agent provocateur ‚Äì activity has taken place regularly among completely nonviolent, non-\\"black bloc\\" campaigns. In 2003, the Oakland, California Police Department infiltrated a group of demonstrators protesting police brutality and the war in Iraq at the port; subpoenaed private comments by Captain Howard Jordan indicate that his plan was to steer the march away from the police station in order to avoid confrontation. In internal documents, Jordan mentioned this strategy was common in other police departments, including San Francisco and Seattle.\\"State of Surveillance: Government Monitoring of Political Activity in Northern & Central California A Report by the ACLU of Northern California\\" Written by Mark Schlosberg, Police Practices Policy Director, July 2006; Tactics Tactics of a black bloc primarily include vandalism of private property, rioting, and demonstrating without a permit. Tactics can also include use of defensive measures such as misleading the authorities, assisting in the escape of people arrested by the police (\\"un-arrests\\" or \\"de-arrests\\"), administering first aid to persons affected by tear gas, rubber bullets and other riot control measures in areas where protesters are barred from entering, building barricades, resisting the police, and practicing jail solidarity. Property destruction carried out by black blocs tends to have symbolic significance: common targets include banks, institutional buildings, outlets for multinational corporations, gasoline stations, and video-surveillance cameras. There may be several blocs within a particular protest, with different aims and tactics.K, 2001, \\"being black block\\" in On Fire: the battle of Genoa and the anti-capitalist movement, p. 31, One Off Press. As an ad hoc group, blocs often share no universally common set of principles or beliefs apart from an adherence to‚Äîusually‚Äîradical left or autonomist values, although some anarchist groups have called for the Saint Paul Principles to be adapted as a framework in which diverse tactics can be deployed. A few radical right-wing groups, like some of the \\"autonomous nationalists\\" of Europe or the Australian so-called \\"National-Anarchists\\" have adopted \\"black bloc\\" tactics and dress. The political scientist Nicholas Apoifis, in his ethnography of anarchism in Athens, Greece, argues that black bloc action can constitute a form of prefigurative politics, due to its \\"flat and horizontal organisational structure, alongside its focus on solidarity.\\" In 2000, some months after the Battle of Seattle and the A16 protests against the IMF in Washington DC, the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective (based out of rural Vermont), called for Black Bloc activities to be coordinated on the tactical level, through the temporary election of street officers democratically empowered to make fast tactical decisions, especially concerning movement, while in confrontation with state police forces. This collective also called for Black Bloc actions to entail reserve groups, who could be called into a clash by these elected officers. These proposals were mapped out in the first edition of the pamphlet Communique on Tactics. The pamphlet was controversial within the anarchist community. Some anarchists attacked this approach be being too formal and bordering on Leninist in structure. The Green Mountain Anarchist Collective countered that the direct election of tactical officers was historically in line with the CNT and FAI anarchist militias during the Spanish Civil War. Of those early segments of the anarchist scene that agreed, in principle, with these assertions were the Barricada Collective (Boston, MA) and Columbus Anti-Racist Action (Ohio). The Barricada Collective, in their publication of the same name, published the pamphlet, and also wrote their own essays calling for a more nuanced and more militant use of the Black Bloc in the North American anarchist movement. In July 2001 the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective would go on to produce a second edition of the Communique on Tactics pamphlet in cooperation with Columbus ARA. This second edition further refined the proposal to suggest, among other things, that large Black Blocs, composed of numerous affinity groups, could reach a further level of tactical sophistication by each affinity group further specializing their capabilities (i.e. offense, defense, recon, etc.) and by investing coordinating ability to the elected officer core. This pamphlet, like the first, was debated among anarchists. Aspects of these tactical reforms were field tested with some success at the Festival De La Pueblo 5 May March in Boston in 2002, and the siege of the Lewiston Armory (in opposition to a failed neo-Nazi organizing meeting), Maine, 2003. Both these actions were organized largely by the Northeast Federation of Anarcho- Communist (whom the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective and Barricada were then affiliated).

It attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed. Ole Holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g., an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most prominent theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism.Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.52 Sometimes, institutionalism proposed and developed by Keohane and Nye is discussed as a paradigm differed from liberalism. International relations theories can be divided into \\"positivist/rationalist\\" theories which focus on a principally state-level analysis, and \\"post-positivist/reflectivist\\" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security. Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo-Gramscianism, and others. However, two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism. The study of international relations, as theory, can be traced to E. H. Carr's The Twenty Years' Crisis, which was published in 1939, and to Hans Morgenthau's Politics Among Nations published in 1948.Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew \\"Introduction\\" Theories of International Relations, ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.1. Palgrave, 2005. International relations, as a discipline, is believed to have emerged after the First World War with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations, the Woodrow Wilson Chair held by Alfred Eckhard Zimmern at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew \\"Introduction\\" Theories of International Relations, ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.6. Palgrave, 2005. Early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as \\"Idealists\\".Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew \\"Introduction\\" Theories of International Relations, ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.7. Palgrave, 2005. The leading critique of this school of thinking was the \\"realist\\" analysis offered by Carr. However, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field of international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th Century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by \\"great debates\\", such as the realist-idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: \\"We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field\\". Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development. A clear distinction is made between explanatory and constitutive approaches when classifying international relations theories. Realism Thucydides author of History of the Peloponnesian War is considered one of the earliest \\"realist\\" thinkers.See Forde, Steven,(1995), 'International Realism and the Science of Politics:Thucydides, Machiavelli and Neorealism,' International Studies Quarterly 39(2):141‚Äì160 Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the conception of the discipline.Dunne, Tim and Schmidt, Britain, The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, p The theory claims to rely upon an ancient tradition of thought which includes writers such as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes. Early realism can be characterized as a reaction against interwar idealist thinking. The outbreak of World War II was seen by realists as evidence of the deficiencies of idealist thinking. There are various strands of modern-day realist thinking. However, the main tenets of the theory have been identified as statism, survival, and self-help. *Statism: Realists believe that nation states are the main actors in international politics.Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.59 As such it is a state-centric theory of international relations. This contrasts with liberal international relations theories which accommodate roles for non-state actors and international institutions. This difference is sometimes expressed by describing a realist world view as one which sees nation states as billiard balls, liberals would consider relationships between states to be more of a cobweb. *Survival: Realists believe that the international system is governed by anarchy, meaning that there is no central authority. Therefore, international politics is a struggle for power between self-interested states.Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.55 *Self-help: Realists believe that no other states can be relied upon to help guarantee the state's survival. Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that nation-states are unitary, geographically based actors in an anarchic international system with no authority above capable of regulating interactions between states as no true authoritative world government exists. Secondly, it assumes that sovereign states, rather than intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, or multinational corporations, are the primary actors in international affairs. Thus, states, as the highest order, are in competition with one another. As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in pursuit of its own self-interest with a primary goal to maintain and ensure its own security‚Äîand thus its sovereignty and survival. Realism holds that in pursuit of their interests, states will attempt to amass resources, and that relations between states are determined by their relative levels of power. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's military, economic, and political capabilities. Some realists, known as human nature realists or classical realists, believe that states are inherently aggressive, that territorial expansion is constrained only by opposing powers, while others, known as offensive/defensive realists, believe that states are obsessed with the security and continuation of the state's existence. The defensive view can lead to a security dilemma, where increasing one's own security can bring along greater instability as the opponent(s) builds up its own arms, making security a zero-sum game where only relative gains can be made. = Neorealism = Neorealism or structural realism is a development of realism advanced by Kenneth Waltz in Theory of International Politics. It is, however, only one strand of neorealism. Joseph Grieco has combined neo-realist thinking with more traditional realists. This strand of theory is sometimes called \\"modern realism\\".Lamy,Steven, Contemporary Approaches:Neo-realism and neo-liberalism in \\"The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed,p127 Waltz's neorealism contends that the effect of structure must be taken into account in explaining state behavior. It shapes all foreign policy choices of states in the international arena. For instance, any disagreement between states derives from lack of a common power (central authority) to enforce rules and maintain them constantly. Thus there is constant anarchy in international system that makes it necessary for states the obtainment of strong weapons in order to guarantee their survival. Additionally, in an anarchic system, states with greater power have tendency to increase its influence further. According to neo-realists, structure is considered extremely important element in IR and defined twofold as: a) the ordering principle of the international system which is anarchy, and b) the distribution of capabilities across units. Waltz also challenges traditional realism's emphasis on traditional military power, instead characterizing power in terms of the combined capabilities of the state.Lamy, Steven, \\"Contemporary mainstream approaches: neo-realism and neo-liberalism\\", The Globalisation of World Politics, Smith, Baylis and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, pp.127‚Äì128 Liberalism Kant's writings on perpetual peace were an early contribution to democratic peace theory.E Gartzk, Kant we all just get along? Opportunity, willingness, and the origins of the democratic peace, American Journal of Political Science, 1998 The precursor to liberal international relations theory was \\"idealism\\". Idealism (or utopianism) was viewed critically by those who saw themselves as \\"realists\\", for instance E. H. Carr.Brian C. Schmidt, The political discourse of anarchy: a disciplinary history of international relations, 1998, p.219 In international relations, idealism (also called \\"Wilsonianism\\" because of its association with Woodrow Wilson) is a school of thought that holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, which would arise amongst the \\"institution-builders\\" after World War I. Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior. Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state actions. Thus, preferences will vary from state to state, depending on factors such as culture, economic system or government type. Liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political/security (\\"high politics\\"), but also economic/cultural (\\"low politics\\") whether through commercial firms, organizations or individuals. Thus, instead of an anarchic international system, there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power, such as cultural capital (for example, the influence of films leading to the popularity of the country's culture and creating a market for its exports worldwide). Another assumption is that absolute gains can be made through co-operation and interdependence‚Äîthus peace can be achieved. The democratic peace theory argues that liberal democracies have never (or almost never) made war on one another and have fewer conflicts among themselves. This is seen as contradicting especially the realist theories and this empirical claim is now one of the great disputes in political science. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the democratic peace. It has also been argued, as in the book Never at War, that democracies conduct diplomacy in general very differently from non-democracies. (Neo)realists disagree with Liberals over the theory, often citing structural reasons for the peace, as opposed to the state's government. Sebastian Rosato, a critic of democratic peace theory, points to America's behavior towards left-leaning democracies in Latin America during the Cold War to challenge democratic peace.Rosato, Sebastian, The Flawed Logic of Democratic Peace Theory, American Political Science Review, Volume 97, Issue 04, November 2003, pp.585‚Äì602 One argument is that economic interdependence makes war between trading partners less likely.Copeland, Dale, Economic Interdependence and War: A Theory of Trade Expectations, International Security, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Spring, 1996), pp.5‚Äì41 In contrast realists claim that economic interdependence increases rather than decreases the likelihood of conflict. =Neoliberalism= Neoliberalism, liberal institutionalism or neo-liberal institutionalismSutch, Peter, Elias, 2006, Juanita, International Relations: The Basics, Routledge p.11 is an advancement of liberal thinking. It argues that international institutions can allow nations to successfully cooperate in the international system. =Complex interdependence= Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, in response to neorealism, develop an opposing theory they dub \\"complex interdependence.\\" Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explain, \\"... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism.\\" In explaining this, Keohane and Nye cover the three assumptions in realist thought: First, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and finally, the assumption that there is a hierarchy in international politics. The heart of Keohane and Nye's argument is that in international politics there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional Westphalian system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to multinational corporations and organizations. Here they define their terminology; interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; transgovernmental relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; transnational applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channel as championed by realists. Secondly, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations. Finally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. The idea is developed that between countries in which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important in that \\"alliance's political and military relations with a rival bloc.\\" = Post-liberalism = One version of post- liberal theory argues that within the modern, globalized world, states in fact are driven to cooperate in order to ensure security and sovereign interests. The departure from classical liberal theory is most notably felt in the re- interpretation of the concepts of sovereignty and autonomy. Autonomy becomes a problematic concept in shifting away from a notion of freedom, self- determination, and agency to a heavily responsible and duty laden concept. Importantly, autonomy is linked to a capacity for good governance. Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a shift from a right to a duty. In the global economy, International organizations hold sovereign states to account, leading to a situation where sovereignty is co-produced among \\"sovereign\\" states. The concept becomes a variable capacity of good governance and can no longer be accepted as an absolute right. One possible way to interpret this theory, is the idea that in order to maintain global stability and security and solve the problem of the anarchic world system in International Relations, no overarching, global, sovereign authority is created. Instead, states collectively abandon some rights for full autonomy and sovereignty. Another version of post-liberalism, drawing on work in political philosophy after the end of the Cold War, as well as on democratic transitions in particular in Latin America, argues that social forces from below are essential in understanding the nature of the state and the international system. Without understanding their contribution to political order and its progressive possibilities, particularly in the area of peace in local and international frameworks, the weaknesses of the state, the failings of the liberal peace, and challenges to global governance cannot be realised or properly understood. Furthermore, the impact of social forces on political and economic power, structures, and institutions, provides some empirical evidence of the complex shifts currently underway in IR. Constructivism constructivism as an international relations theory increased after the fall of the Berlin wall (pictured) and Communism in Eastern EuropeStephen M. Walt, Foreign Policy, No. 110, Special Edition: Frontiers of Knowledge. (Spring, 1998), p.41: \\"The end of the Cold War played an important role in legitimizing constructivist t realism and liberalism failed to anticipate this event and had trouble explaining it. as this was something not predicted by the existing mainstream theories.Hay, Colin (2002) Political Analysis: A Critical Introduction, Basingstoke: Palgrave, P. 198 Constructivism or social constructivism has been described as a challenge to the dominance of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations theories.Hopf, Ted, The Promise of Constructivism in International Relations Theory, International Security, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Summer, 1998), p.171 Michael Barnett describes constructivist international relations theories as being concerned with how ideas define international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states and how states and non-state actors reproduce this structure.Michael Barnett, \\"Social Constructivism\\" in The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, 4th ed, OUP, p.162 The key element of constructivism is the belief that \\"International politics is shaped by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identities.\\" Constructivism argues that international reality is socially constructed by cognitive structures which give meaning to the material world.Alder, Emmanuel, Seizing the middle ground, European Journal of International Relations, Vol .3, 1997, p.319 The theory emerged from debates concerning the scientific method of international relations theories and theories role in the production of international power.K.M. Ferike, International Relations Theories:Discipline and Diversity, Dunne, Kurki and Smith, OUP, p.167 Emanuel Adler states that constructivism occupies a middle ground between rationalist and interpretative theories of international relations. Constructivist theory criticises the static assumptions of traditional international relations theory and emphasizes that international relations is a social construction. Constructivism is a theory critical of the ontological basis of rationalist theories of international relations.In international relations ontology refers to the basic unit of analysis that an international relations theory uses. For example for neorealists humans are the basic unit of analysis Whereas realism deals mainly with security and material power, and liberalism looks primarily at economic interdependence and domestic-level factors, constructivism most concerns itself with the role of ideas in shaping the international system; indeed it is possible there is some overlap between constructivism and realism or liberalism, but they remain separate schools of thought. By \\"ideas\\" constructivists refer to the goals, threats, fears, identities, and other elements of perceived reality that influence states and non-state actors within the international system. Constructivists believe that these ideational factors can often have far-reaching effects, and that they can trump materialistic power concerns. For example, constructivists note that an increase in the size of the U.S. military is likely to be viewed with much greater concern in Cuba, a traditional antagonist of the United States, than in Canada, a close U.S. ally. Therefore, there must be perceptions at work in shaping international outcomes. As such, constructivists do not see anarchy as the invariable foundation of the international system, but rather argue, in the words of Alexander Wendt, that \\"anarchy is what states make of it\\".Wendt, Alexander, \\"Anarchy is what states make of it: the social construction of power politics\\" in International Organization, vol. 46, no. 2, 1992 Constructivists also believe that social norms shape and change foreign policy over time rather than security which realists cite. Marxism Antonio Gramsci's writings on the hegemony of capitalism have inspired Marxist international relations scholarship Marxist and Neo-Marxist international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of historical materialism and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. A sub-discipline of Marxist IR is Critical Security Studies. Gramscian approaches rely on the ideas of Italian Antonio Gramsci whose writings concerned the hegemony that capitalism holds as an ideology. Marxist approaches have also inspired Critical Theorists such as Robert W. Cox who argues that \\"Theory is always for someone and for some purpose\\".Cox, Robert, Social Forces, States and World Orders: Beyond International Relations Theory Cox Millennium ‚Äì Journal of International Studies.1981; 10: 126‚Äì155 One notable Marxist approach to international relations theory is Immanuel Wallerstein's World-system theory which can be traced back to the ideas expressed by Lenin in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of capitalism. World-system theory argues that globalized capitalism has created a core of modern industrialized countries which exploit a periphery of exploited \\"Third World\\" countries. These ideas were developed by the Latin American Dependency School. \\"Neo-Marxist\\" or \\"New Marxist\\" approaches have returned to the writings of Karl Marx for their inspiration. Key \\"New Marxists\\" include Justin Rosenberg and Benno Teschke. Marxist approaches have enjoyed a renaissance since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Criticisms of Marxists approaches to international relations theory include the narrow focus on material and economic aspects of life. Feminism Feminist approaches to international relations became popular in the early 1990s. Such approaches emphasize that women's experiences continue to be excluded from the study of international relations.Zalewski, Marysia, \\"Do We Understand Each Other Yet? Troubling Feminist Encounters With(in)\\" British Journal of Politics & International Relations, Volume 9, Issue 2 p.304 International Relations Feminists who argue that gender relations are integral to international relations focus on the role of diplomatic wives and marital relationship that facilitate sex trafficking. Early feminist IR approaches were part of the \\"Third Great Debate\\" between positivists and post- positivists. They argued against what they saw as the positivism and state- centrism of mainstream international relations. J. Ann Tickner argues that these approaches did not describe what a feminist perspective on world politics would look like. The feminist international relations scholar Jacqui True differentiates between empirical feminism, analytical feminism and normative feminism. Empirical feminism sees women and gender relations as empirical aspects of international relations. It is argued that mainstream international relations emphasis on anarchy and statecraft mean that areas of study that make the reproduction of the state system possible are marginalized.Grant, R. and Newland, K. (eds) (1991) Gender and International Relations, (London). Analytical feminism claims that the theoretical framework of international relations has a gender bias. Here gender refers not to the \\"biological\\" differences between men and women but the social constructs of masculine and feminine identity.True, Jacqui, \\"Feminism\\" in Theories of International Relations, Scott Burchill et al., 3rd ed, Palgrave, p. 221 It is claimed that in mainstream international relations masculinity is associated with objectivity. Analytical feminists would see neo-realism's dislike of domestic explanations for explaining interstate behaviour as an example of this bias. Normative feminist sees theorizing as part of an agenda for change. Criticisms of feminist international relations theory include its portrayal of women in developing countries.Mohanty, C, (1991) \\"Under Western Eyes:Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses\\" in C. Mohanty, T.A. Russo and L.Torres (ed), Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism, Bloomington Feminist International Relations is sometimes oversimplified into a women's issue or simply a need to 'add women and stir'. \\"Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics\\", an article by Charlotte Hooper, makes the case that looking at international relations through a gendered lens is important for all genders. The article illustrates that the hyper-masculinity used in international relations has a negative impact on all genders. It privileges only a certain kind of man, forcing all others to fit into the constraints of one vision of masculinity. Hooper also argues that this gendered lens requires a complete overhaul of traditional methods, rather than just adding women to the study. \\"In order to investigate the intersections between gender identities and international relations, one cannot rely on approaches which would take gender identities as 'givens' or as independent, externally derived variables\\". Traditional methods do not meet the needs of men or women. They attempt to reduce our needs to security, failing to take into account class, education level, gender, or experience. Hooper argues that traditional studies of international relations are causing us to miss many factors for more than just women and children. To appeal to sympathetic sceptics, Hooper explains that international relations shapes masculinity in a way that affects us all. To establish this she explains that masculinity and femininity are social constructs that can be influenced by theories and discourse. Hooper turns so called feminist international relations into gendered international relations, which brings in all people and highlights the importance of new methods to the field. Genders just like class, ethnicity, age, etc. can help inform our understanding of how people and nations act and if we ignore the range of masculinities and femininities we are only working with half the puzzle. The system that Feminist International Relations is trying to subvert affects us all and influences many of our traditional theories. Hooper offers the example of war which has shaped the male body; it has created men as takers of life and women as givers of it. We proceed to tell men they simply have more natural aggression. Hooper also illustrates the ways masculinity, like femininity, has been influenced by colonization. The hierarchy formed by colonization labels Asians as effeminate, Africans as savage and white men as the proper balance at the top the hierarchy. War and colonialism still influence international relations to a large extent. Green theory Green theory in international relations is a sub-field of international relations theory which concerns international environmental cooperation. Alternative approaches Several alternative approaches have been developed based on foundationalism, anti- foundationalism, positivism, behaviouralism, structuralism and post- structuralism. These theories however are not widely known. Behaviouralism in international relations theory is an approach to international relations theory which believes in the unity of science, the idea that the social sciences are not fundamentally different from the natural sciences.Jackson, Robert, Sorensen, Georg, ‚ÄúIntroduction to International Relations: Theories and Approaches\\", OUP, 3rd ed, p305 English School The \\"English School\\" of international relations theory, also known as International Society, Liberal Realism, Rationalism or the British institutionalists, maintains that there is a 'society of states' at the international level, despite the condition of \\"anarchy\\", i.e., the lack of a ruler or world state. Despite being called the English School many of the academics from this school were neither English nor from the United Kingdom. A great deal of the work of the English School concerns the examination of traditions of past international theory, casting it, as Martin Wight did in his 1950s-era lectures at the London School of Economics, into three divisions: * Realist (or Hobbesian, after Thomas Hobbes), which views states as independent competing units * Rationalist (or Grotian, after Hugo Grotius), which looks at how states can work together and cooperate for mutual benefit * Revolutionist (or Kantian, after Immanuel Kant), which looks at human society as transcending borders or national identities In broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or via media) between the power politics of realism and the \\"utopianism\\" of revolutionism. The English School rejects behavioralist approaches to international relations theory. One way to think about the English School is that, while some theories identify with just one of the three historical traditions (Classical Realism and Neorealism owe a debt to the Realist or Hobbesian tradition; Marxism to the Revolutionist tradition, for example), English School looks to combine all of them. While there is great diversity within the 'school', much of it involves either examining when and how the different traditions combine or dominate, or focusing on the Rationalist tradition, especially the concept of International Society (which is the concept most associated with English School thinking). In Hedley Bull's The Anarchical Society, a seminal work of the school, he begins by looking at the concept of order, arguing that states across time and space have come together to overcome some of the danger and uncertainty of the Hobbesian international system to create an international society of states that share certain interests and ways of thinking about the world. By doing so, they make the world more ordered, and can eventually change international relations to become significantly more peaceful and beneficial to their shared interests.  Functionalism  Functionalism is a theory of international relations that arose principally from the experience of European integration. Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states. Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This \\"invisible hand\\" of integration phenomenon is termed \\"spillover\\". Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses. This usage, and the usage in functionalism in international relations, is the less common meaning of functionalism. More commonly, however, functionalism is an argument that explains phenomena as functions of a system rather than an actor or actors. Immanuel Wallerstein employed a functionalist theory when he argued that the Westphalian international political system arose to secure and protect the developing international capitalist system. His theory is called \\"functionalist\\" because it says that an event was a function of the preferences of a system and not the preferences of an agent. Functionalism is different from structural or realist arguments in that while both look to broader, structural causes, realists (and structuralists more broadly) say that the structure gives incentives to agents, while functionalists attribute causal power to the system itself, bypassing agents entirely. Post- structuralism Post-structuralism differs from most other approaches to international politics because it does not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter. Instead, post- structuralism is an approach, attitude, or ethos that pursues critique in particular way. Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives. It states that \\"Every understanding of international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and interpretation\\". Scholars associated with post-structuralism in international relations include Richard K. Ashley, James Der Derian, Michael J. Shapiro, R. B. J. Walker, and Lene Hansen. Post-modernism Post-modernist approaches to international relations are critical of metanarratives and denounces traditional IR's claims to truth and neutrality. Postcolonialism Postcolonial International relations scholarship posits a critical theory approach to International relations (IR), and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship. Post-colonialism focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.Baylis, Smith and Owens, The Globalisation of World Politics, OUP, 4th ed, p187-189  Evolutionary perspectives  Evolutionary perspectives, such as from evolutionary psychology, have been argued to help explain many features of international relations. Humans in the ancestral environment did not live in states and likely rarely had interactions with groups outside of a very local area. However, a variety of evolved psychological mechanisms, in particular those for dealing with inter group interactions, are argued to influence current international relations. These include evolved mechanisms for social exchange, cheating and detecting cheating, status conflicts, leadership, ingroup and outgroup distinction and biases, coalitions, and violence. Evolutionary concepts such as inclusive fitness may help explain seeming limitations of a concept such as egotism which is of fundamental importance to realist and rational choice international relations theories.Bradley A. Thayer. Darwin and International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. 2004. University Press of Kentucky.  Neuroscience and IR  In recent years, with significant advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging tools, IR Theory has benefited from further multidisciplinary contributions. Prof. Nayef Al-Rodhan from Oxford University has argued that neuroscience can significantly advance the IR debate as it brings forward new insights about human nature, which is at the centre of political theory. New tools to scan the human brain, and studies in neurochemistry allow us to grasp what drives divisiveness, conflict, and human nature in general. The theory of human nature in Classical Realism, developed long before the advent of neuroscience, stressed that egoism and competition were central to human behaviour, to politics and social relations. Evidence from neuroscience, however, provides a more nuanced understanding of human nature, which Prof. Al-Rodhan describes as emotional amoral egoistic. These three features can be summarized as follows: 1. emotionality is more pervasive than rationality and central to decision-making, 2. we are born neither moral, nor immoral but amoral, and circumstances decide how our moral compass will develop, and finally, 3. we are egoistic insofar as we seek to ensure our survival, which is a basic form of egoism. This neurophilosophy of human nature can also be applied to states \\\\- similarly to the Realist analogy between the character (and flaws) of man and the state in international politics. Prof Al-Rodhan argues there are significant examples in history and contemporary politics that demonstrate states behave less rationality than IR dogma would have us believe: different strategic cultures, habits, identity politics influence state conduct, geopolitics and diplomacy in profound ways.  Queer and transgender perspectives  Queer international relations scholarship aims to broaden the scope and method of traditional international relations theory to include sexed and gendered approaches that are often excluded in the discipline at large. While affiliated with feminist theory and gender studies, as well as post-structuralism, queer IR theory is not reducible to any other field of international relations scholarship. Queer international relations theory works to expose the many ways in which sexualities and gender affect international politics. This includes the ways in which queer subjects and practices are disciplined, normalized, or capitalized on by traditional sites of power; how queer identities have often been the focus of domestic and foreign policy in heteronormative states; and how the order-versus-anarchy dichotomy in traditional international relations theory socially manifests itself in normal-versus-perverse and hetero/homo-normative versus queer dichotomies. Queer IR theory takes sites of traditional international relations scholarship (war and peace, international political economy, and state and nation building) as its subjects of study. It also expands its scope and methods beyond those traditionally utilized in Realist IR scholarship. Ontologically, queer IR utilizes a different scope from traditional IR, as it aims to non-monolithically address the needs of various queer groups, including trans-, inter-, cross-, and pan- gendered, sexed, and sexualized bodies. Epistemologically, queer IR explores alternative methodologies to those traditionally used in IR, as it emphasizes the sexual dimension of knowledge within international relations.Weber, Cynthia. ‚ÄúQueer International Relations: From Queer to Queer IR.‚Äù International Studies Review 16 (2014). 596‚Äì622. Web. March 10. 2015. Criticism for queer theory in general, and queer international relations in particular, addresses worries of the minimization or exclusion of certain groups. While queer IR incorporates transgender individuals in its expanded scope, some argue its emphasis on sexuality fails to adequately capture transgender experiences. Susan Stryker contests that queer theory's approach merely treats the ‚ÄòT‚Äô in LGBT as another, detached genre of sexual identity, ‚Äúrather than perceived, like race or class, as something that cuts across existing sexualities, revealing in often unexpected ways the means through which all identities achieve their specificities.‚Äù While queer theoretical spaces remain friendly to transgender work, Stryker argues that ‚Äòqueer‚Äô often acts as code for ‚Äògays‚Äô or ‚Äòlesbians,‚Äô implicitly excluding transgender issues by privileging sexual orientations and identities. This leads Stryker to advocate that transgender studies follows its own trajectory.Stryker, Susan. ‚ÄúTransgender Studies: Queer Theory‚Äôs Evil Twin.‚Äù GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 10.2 (2004). 212‚Äì215. Web. March 21. 2015. Laura Sjoberg advocates for allying trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing in IR. She suggests some possible improvements that trans- theorizing may offer for feminist IR theory, which include a more nuanced understanding of gender hierarchy through a pluralist approach to sex, a holistic view of gender that resists viewing gender entirely either as a social construction or as biologically essential, and an increased awareness of gender as involving power relations among different sexes and genders. Additionally, Sjoberg argues, trans-theorizing makes important contributions to traditional IR's understanding of global politics. Discussions of ‚Äòoutness,‚Äô visibility, invisibility, and hypervisibility in transgender theorizing are applicable to questions of identity, relations between individuals and groups, and the enforcement of norms in IR. Additionally, transgender understandings of transition and liminality can fill the gap in traditional IR's need for an account of change and unrest in the international system. Moreover, talk of ‚Äúcrossing‚Äù and ‚Äúpassing‚Äù in trans-theorizing may assist in explaining the process, logic, and consequences of states shifting identities. Finally, transgender disidentification, either from exclusionary movements or from their assigned sex, can help in unpacking ‚Äúthe problem of difference‚Äù in international relations. As such, Sjoberg advocates for the inclusion of trans-theorizing in feminist IR theory in the interests of improving explanations and understandings of global politics.Sjoberg, Laura. ‚ÄúTowards Trans-gendering International Relations?‚Äù International Political Sociology 6 (2013). 337‚Äì354. Web. April 7. 2015.  Theory in international relations scholarship  Several IR scholars bemoan what they see as a trend away from IR theory in IR scholarship. The September 2013 issue of European Journal of International Relations and the June 2015 issue of Perspectives on Politics debated the state of IR theory. A 2016 study showed that while theoretical innovations and qualitative analyses are a large part of graduate training, journals favor middle-range theory, quantitative hypothesis testing and methodology for publishing.

It is maintained as a garden island and a model of excellent environmental practices.http://www.mainau.de/aktuelles-leser/ehrung-fuer- umweltmanagement.html Administratively, the island has been a part of Konstanz since December 1, 1971, when the municipality of Litzelstetten, of which Mainau was part, was incorporated into Konstanz. Mainau is still part of Litzelstetten, now one of 15 wards (administrative subdivisions) of Konstanz. The island belongs to the Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung (eng. The Lennart Bernadotte Foundation),http://www.mainau.de/lennart-bernadotte-stiftung.html an entity created by Prince Lennart Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg, originally a Prince of Sweden and Duke of Sm√•land.http://www.mainau.de/chronik.html It is one of the main tourist attractions of Lake Constance. Beside flowers there is a park landscape with views on the lake. There is a greenhouse as well with tropical climate and thousands of butterflies. Mainau Bay is the location of their university's sailing club. Geography =Position= The island averages out at a height between 395 (roughly equals the lake‚Äôs average medium water-level) and 425 meters above sea level. Its highest peak is located at the Gro√üherzog-Friedrich Terrace (historic water reservoir). Mainau Island is 610-meters long from North to South and a 1050 meters wide from West to East. The island‚Äôs circumference is about three kilometers. The shortest distance between the downwelling molasse slice and the lake‚Äôs shore is about 130 meters. =Population= Few people inhabit Mainau Island. Due to its small amount of inhabitants, it is considered a hamlet. Meyer‚Äôs Lexikon‚Äôs issue of 1888 declared that 28 people lived on Mainau Island. During the census of 1961, a population of 123 was verified. Count Bj√∂rn Bernadotte is living in the castle on Mainau Island.  Parks and gardens  Island map Mainau Island is a \\"flowering island\\" notable for its parks and gardens. Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, created the island's arboretum, which now contains 500 species of deciduous and coniferous trees, many exotic and valuable, including fine specimens of Sequoiadendron giganteum (1864) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (1952). The island also contains about 200 rhododendron and azalea varieties. Due to the advantageous climate at the lake, palm trees and other Mediterranean plants can grow on the drop-shaped island. Because of its rich subtropical and partly even tropical vegetation, Mainau Island is also called \\"flowering island in the Lake Constance\\". Count Lennart Bernadotte, who died in 2004, liked to call his island \\"Blumenschiff\\" (engl. flower ship). He also described the famous destination as follows: \\"She is a coquettish little Lady, Mainau Island, who constantly demands much attention, even more love and ceaselessly new clothes.\\" - Lennart Bernadotte. By \\"new clothes\\", he probably meant the blossoms, plants and flower-beds which are constantly renewed by the gardeners. Apart from the historic buildings, the centerpiece of Mainau Island is the Arboretum with its 500 different types of rare and valuable broad- leaved trees and conifers, which was created in 1856 by grand duke Friedrich I. Among those is one of Germany's \\"oldest\\" dawn redwood trees (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). The tree, which originated from China, was planted on the island in 1952, when it was just 70 centimeters tall. Particularly mighty are some exemplars of the giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum). Their seeds came from California in 1853 and were planted on the island in 1864, which makes them one of the oldest of their kind in Europe. You can find the above- mentioned giant redwoods as well as Cedars, Dawn Redwoods and Tulip Poplars on the island. The Arboretum expands towards the north-west of the island. Spring marks the beginning of the \\"Blumenjahr\\" (eng. Flower Year) with an exhibition of orchids. From March to May you can see several types of flowers in full bloom, like Tulips, Daffodils, Primroses, Forget-Me-Nots and Hyacinths. To show the full beauty of all these flowers the so-called ‚ÄûFr√ºhlingsallee‚Äú (eng. Spring Alley) was opened, which is a path across the island surrounded by beds of these plants. From May to June over 200 kinds of Rhododendrons and Azaleas are in full bloom. To the west of the \\"Comturey-Keller\\" you can find an Italian rose garden commissioned by Friedrich I. This rose garden is strictly geometric and consists of pergolas, sculptures and fountains. In general, over 1200 kinds of roses can be found on the island. ‚ÄûFr√ºhlingsallee‚Äú leads to ‚ÄûMediterran-Terrassen‚Äú (eng. Mediterranean Terrace) where exotic plants such as palm families, agaves, cacti and bougainvillea are presented in pails during summer. Lake Constance and its surroundings as well as the Alps can be seen in a panoramic view from here. In July the blossoms of brugmansia and hibiscus are blooming on Mainau Island and in August the blossoms of passion flowers bloom. On the southern end you can find ‚ÄúS√ºdgarten‚Äù (eng. South Garden) where in autumn fields of dahlia with approximately 20,000 dahlia bushes and 250 varieties gleam from September until October. Spring and summer flowers such as different kinds of fuchsia are growing on the affiliated shore garden to the eastern side of ‚ÄúS√ºdgarten‚Äù. The ‚ÄúBodenseerelief‚Äù (eng. Relief of Lake Constance) is a very popular photo motive. It is a relief with the picture of a flower which is changed by season. A small harbor with a landing place is situated to the northern side of Mainau Island. Excursion boats lay in here and another entrance to ‚ÄúFr√ºhlingsallee‚Äù can be found here. =Schmetterlingshaus= The \\"Schmetterlingshaus\\" (eng. butterfly house) on Mainau Island is open all year round. With roughly 1,000 square meters it is the second biggest of its kind in Germany. The temperature is 26 degrees Celsius and with a humidity of 80 to 90 percent visitors can walk through a tropical surrounding with swooshing waterfalls and exotic plants and flowers. Depending on the season, roughly 700 to 1,000 colorful butterflies of 80 different kinds, mainly of southern American origin, are flying among visitors in the tropical landscape. Approximately one third of these butterflies reproduce in a natural way. But the amount of progeny is extremely varying. Therefore, every week the butterfly house gets 400 butterfly cocoons delivered from Costa Rican, English and Dutch breeders. A budget of approximately 20,000 Euros is provided each year for new butterfly caterpillars. The gardens surrounding the butterfly house serve as habitat for the native species. Affiliated to the butterfly house is a scent garden with more than 150 species of scented plants. =Wasserwelt= A playground called Wasserwelt (eng. water world) was especially built for kids and it expands over an area of 1,100 square meters. Wasserwelt is a pool which is 60 centimetres deep and bordered by 130 tonnes of boulders. The pool is filled with 170 cubic metres of water and has an island at its centre. The children can float around or cross the lake with rafts or a wooden ferry. The lake is surrounded by little wooden houses which serve as climbing scaffolds and as a reminder of the pile dwellings. The houses are connected through suspension bridges and studs. In addition, there are water channels and mud tables. Matthias Wagner and Markus Zeiler, the two designers of Mainau Island, prepared for the case of a child having dived to deeply into the water world: They placed a tumbler inside a kiosk at the playground, so that parents can easily dry wet clothing. The playground, like all other playgrounds, is inspected and approved by T√úV S√úD on a regular basis.  Buildings  =Deutschordenschloss= The ‚ÄúDeutschordenschloss‚Äú was built upon the stables of the old castle, which had been destroyed in the 18th century. It was built after the drafts and under the construction management of Giovanni Gaspare Bagnato. The construction started in 1739 and took 7 years. The three-winged baroque palace was built around the main courtyard with a terraced garden at its side. At the central risalit of the western part is a big crest of the grand master Clemens August of Bavaria, the provincial commander Philipp von Froberg, and of the Mainaukomptur Friedrich of Baden. The crest of the ‚ÄúDeutschorden‚Äù (eng. Teutonic Order) was affixed to the east wing (Seaside) . The castle still serves as the residence of the comital family. Depending on whether the comital family is present or not, the comital flag is hoisted on the castle‚Äôs roof. The private rooms are in the northern wing in the non-accessible part of the castle, which is on the lefthand side of the castle‚Äòs courtyard. The centerpiece is the former audience hall. The so-called ‚ÄúWei√üer Saal‚Äù (eng. white hall) is kept in the colors white and gold and has since its construction in 1883 not been changed. It is only open to the public for special events or concerts. The central section of the castle is used for temporary exhibitions. There is a Caf√© in the southern wing with right below the tall palm trees of the castle‚Äòs patio. Although the building licence for the palm house, a building made up of complex glass structure, originally only covered the few months of winter, it now protects its trees all year round. More than 20 different kinds of palm trees grow here, including a Canarian date-tree (Phoenix canariensis), planted in 1888, which is more than 15 meters high. =Schlosskirche= Many call the newly constructed palace chapel the debut work of Bagnatos' countless church buildings. Its construction on the southeast end of the island lasted from 1732 to 1739. The rectangular aisleless church is 20 meters long and 9,5 meters wide and has a hemispheric chancel. While raised rectangular panels are organised around the outer front, the lateral walls are decorated with arched windows. A gable is situated above the western wall, just below the tower buildup with a curved roof. The inside of the chapel is divided into two parts: a rectangular aisle containing the semicircular choir and the organ loft right across from the altar. Not just several altars but also a pulpit and multiple sculptures by Joseph Anton Feuchtmayer (1696 - 1770) can be found here. In 1737/1738 Franz Joseph Spiegler (1691 - 1757) added an additional high altar painting as well as ceiling frescoes, now framed by Francesco Pozzi's (1704 - 1789) long garnish stucco. Johann Baptist Babel (1716 - 1799) later added a Black Madonna to the picture. Both side altars display very dynamic angel figures. The left is crowned with a figurine of the martyr Sebastian and the right altar shows St. Nepomuk. The altarpiece of the high altar depicts Maria with child, the holy family and John the Baptist. The ceiling fresco also portrays the life of Mary. The original organ, manufactured by master craftsman Johann Michael Bieher (1687/88 to 1763) from Constance and decorated by Feuchtmayer, was sold and around 1860 and replaced by a new organ in late classicistic style. Bagnatos' grave is situated in the crypt. The castle church is known to be the point of beginning of the oberswabian high baroque und is used as a wedding chapel. =G√§rtnerturm= The so-called ‚ÄúG√§rtnertum‚Äù is situated on the western side, opposite the baroque castle and churchensemble. The walls, which were part of the medieval fortifications, contrast the festive frontage of the castle. In earlier days, a vault used for stockpiling and as a wine press house had been constructed deep inside the rocks. The Comturey restaurant, reconstructed and expanded in 2013/2014, offers dining with a view across the lake.  History  Until the Napoleonic mediatisations and secularisations of small German fiefs this island belonged to the Order of Teutonic Knights. It was later sold into private ownership. In 1853 Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden purchased the island as his personal property and used the palace built by the Teutonic Knights as summer palace. At the end of World War I Baden became a republic with the abdication of Grand Duke Frederick II, son of Frederick I. The former Grand Duke retained his private property including Mainau. When he died childless in 1928 the island passed to his sister Victoria of Baden, wife of King Gustaf V of Sweden. Upon her death two years later she bequeathed the island to her second son Prince Wilhelm, Duke of S√∂dermanland and his descendants. In 1932 Prince Wilhem gave Mainau to his only child Lennart Bernadotte who owned it until 1974 when he transferred the island to a foundation. Count Bernadotte formed Enterprise Mainau GmbH in 1991 as a private enterprise to manage the island for the benefit of the Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung. The Count remained active in managing Mainau until his death in 2004 but had appointed his second wife Sonja co-manager in 2001. Widowed, she and their children ran both the foundation and the management company until 2007. Since January 2007 Bettina Bernadotte, the eldest daughter of Lennart and Sonja, directs the Mainau GmbH as current manager, and since 2011 her brother Bj√∂rn Bernadotte has joined her. =Pre- and Early History= In 1862, signs of an earlier population were discovered along the south banks of Mainau and soon exploited by domain administrator Walter: among the items were wedges, a potsherd, flint splinters, an axe and a muller. The pile dwelling settlement made up of six houses was uncovered in the 1930s and dated back to the Neolithic Age ( 3.000 b.c.). Lake-dwelling settlements of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age were located along the northern shore and the southwestern island along the shallow water zone.

Assuming the SMTP server expects TCP connections on port 25, one would configure stunnel to map the SSL port 465 to non-SSL port 25. A mail client connects via SSL to port 465.

The mail server sees a non-SSL mail client. The stunnel process could be running on the same or a different server from the unsecured mail application; however, both machines would typically be behind a firewall on a secure internal network (so that an intruder could not make its own unsecured connection directly to port 25).

For detailed information on French literature in specific historic periods, see the separate historical articles in the template to the right. French literature is, generally speaking, literature written in the French language, particularly by citizens of France; it may also refer to literature written by people living in France who speak traditional languages of France other than French. Literature written in the French language, by citizens of other nations such as Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, Senegal, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, etc. is referred to as Francophone literature. France itself ranks first on the list of Nobel Prizes in literature by country. For centuries, French literature has been an object of national pride for French people, and it has been one of the most influential components of the literature of Europe.French literature Discover FranceRomance languages and literatures: why study French ? University of Michigan One of the first known examples of French literature is the Song of Roland, the first major work in a series of poems known as, \\"chansons de geste\\". The French language is a Romance language derived from Latin and heavily influenced principally by Celtic and Frankish. Beginning in the 11th century, literature written in medieval French was one of the oldest vernacular (non-Latin) literatures in western Europe and it became a key source of literary themes in the Middle Ages across the continent. Although the European prominence of French literature was eclipsed in part by vernacular literature in Italy in the 14th century, literature in France in the 16th century underwent a major creative evolution, and through the political and artistic programs of the Ancien R√©gime, French literature came to dominate European letters in the 17th century. In the 18th century, French became the literary lingua franca and diplomatic language of western Europe (and, to a certain degree, in America), and French letters have had a profound impact on all European and American literary traditions while at the same time being heavily influenced by these other national traditions Africa, and the far East have brought the French language to non-European cultures that are transforming and adding to the French literary experience today. Under the aristocratic ideals of the Ancien R√©gime (the \\"honn√™te homme\\"), the nationalist spirit of post-revolutionary France, and the mass educational ideals of the Third Republic and modern France, the French have come to have a profound cultural attachment to their literary heritage. Today, French schools emphasize the study of novels, theater and poetry (often learnt by heart). The literary arts are heavily sponsored by the state and literary prizes are major news. The Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the Institut de France are important linguistic and artistic institutions in France, and French television features shows on writers and poets (one of the most watched shows on French television was Apostrophes,Roger Cohen, \\"The Media Business; Books Star on TV, but Only in France\\" , The New York Times, September 10, 1990. a weekly talk show on literature and the arts). Literature matters deeply to the people of France and plays an important role in their sense of identity. As of 2006, French literary people have been awarded more Nobel Prizes in Literature than novelists, poets and essayists of any other country. (However, writers in English‚ÄîUSA, UK, India, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Nigeria and Saint Lucia‚Äîhave won twice as many Nobels as the French.) In 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it, stating that \\"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean- Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\\" French Nobel Prize in Literature winners Paul Verlaine (far left) and Arthur Rimbaud (second to left) in an 1872 painting by Henri Fantin- Latour.

In the background is the crescent-shaped Ehrentrib√ºne (the Tribune of Honor). The Nuremberg Rally (officially ', meaning Reich Party Convention) was the annual rally of the Nazi Party in Germany, held from 1923 to 1938. They were large Nazi propaganda events, especially after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933. These events were held at the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg from 1933 to 1938 and are usually referred to in English as the \\"Nuremberg Rallies\\". Many films were made to commemorate them, including Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and The Victory of Faith.  History and purpose  The first Nazi Party rallies took place in 1923 in Munich and in 1926 in Weimar. From 1927 on, they took place exclusively in Nuremberg. The Party selected Nuremberg for pragmatic reasons: it was in the center of the German Reich and the local Luitpoldhain (converted parkland) was well suited as a venue. In addition, the Nazis could rely on the well- organized local branch of the party in Franconia, then led by Gauleiter Julius Streicher. The Nuremberg police were sympathetic to the event. Later, the location was justified by the Nazi Party by putting it into the tradition of the Imperial Diet (German Reichstag) of the Holy Roman Empire, considered the First Reich. After 1933, the rallies took place near the time of the Autumnal equinox, under the title of \\"The German people's National Party days\\" (Reichsparteitage des deutschen Volkes), which was intended to symbolize the solidarity between the German people and the Nazi Party. This point was further emphasized by the yearly growing number of participants, which finally reached over half a million from all sections of the party, the army, and the state. Rallies  Postal marking from Nuremberg, May 1940, referring to the Reichsparteitage Each rally was given a programmatic title, which related to recent national events: * 1923: The First Party Congress took place in Munich on January 27, 1923. * 1923: The \\"German day rally\\" was held in Nuremberg, September 1‚Äì2, 1923. * 1926: The 2nd Party Congress (\\"Refounding Congress\\") was held in Weimar, July 3‚Äì4, 1926. * 1927: The 3rd Party Congress (\\"Day of Awakening\\") was held in Nuremberg, August 19‚Äì21, 1927. The propaganda film Eine Symphonie des Kampfwillens was made at this rally. * 1929: The 4th Party Congress, known as the \\"Day of Composure\\", was held in Nuremberg, August 1‚Äì4, 1929. The propaganda film Der N√ºrnberger Parteitag der NSDAP was made at this rally. * 1933: The 5th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, August 30 ‚Äì September 3, 1933. It was called the \\"Rally of Victory\\" (Reichsparteitag des Sieges). The term \\"victory\\" relates to the Nazi seizure of power and the victory over the Weimar Republic. The Leni Riefenstahl film Der Sieg des Glaubens was made at this rally. Hitler announced that from then on all Rallies would take place in Nuremberg.spiegel.de (german) * 1934: The 6th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 5‚Äì10, 1934, which was attended by about 700,000 Nazi Party supporters. Initially it did not have a theme. Later it was labeled the \\"Rally of Unity and Strength\\" (Reichsparteitag der Einheit und St√§rke), \\"Rally of Power\\" (Reichsparteitag der Macht), or \\"Rally of Will\\" (Reichsparteitag des Willens). The Leni Riefenstahl film Triumph des Willens was made at this rally.Triumph des Willens (1935) This rally was particularly notable due to Albert Speer's Cathedral of light: 152 searchlights that cast vertical beams into the sky around the Zeppelin Field to symbolise the walls of a building.Propaganda in Nazi Germany * 1935: The 7th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 10‚Äì16, 1935. It was called the \\"Rally of Freedom\\" (Reichsparteitag der Freiheit). \\"Freedom\\" referred to the reintroduction of compulsory military service and thus the German \\"liberation\\" from the Treaty of Versailles. Leni Riefenstahl made the film Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht (Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces) at this rally, and the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws. * 1936: The 8th Party Congress was known as the \\"Rally of Honour\\" (Reichsparteitag der Ehre, September 8‚Äì14). The remilitarization of the demilitarized Rhineland in March 1936 constituted the restoration of German honour in the eyes of many Germans. The film Festliches N√ºrnberg incorporated footage shot at this rally, as well as the rally of 1937. * 1937: The 9th Party Congress was called the \\"Rally of Labour\\" (Reichsparteitag der Arbeit, September 6‚Äì13). It celebrated the reduction of unemployment in Germany since the Nazi rise to power. * 1938: The 10th Party Congress was named the \\"Rally of Greater Germany\\" (Reichsparteitag Gro√üdeutschland, September 5‚Äì12).archive.org: page 1139ff. This was due to the annexation of Austria to Germany that had taken place earlier in the year. * 1939: The 11th Party Congress, scheduled for September 2‚Äì11, was given the name \\"Rally of Peace\\" (Reichsparteitag des Friedens). It was meant to reiterate the German desire for peace, both to the German population and to other countries. It was cancelled at short notice, as one day before the planned date, on September 1, Germany began its offensive against Poland (which ignited World War II) in Europe.  Propaganda films  Official films for the rallies began in 1927, with the establishment of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) film office. The most famous films were made by Leni Riefenstahl for the rallies between 1933 and 1935. Relating to the theme of the rally, she called her first movie Victory of Faith (Der Sieg des Glaubens). This movie was taken out of circulation after the Night of the Long Knives, although a copy survived in Britain and has recently been made available on the Internet Archive for public viewing. The rally of 1934 became the setting for the award-winning Triumph of the Will (Triumph des Willens). Several generals in the Wehrmacht protested over the minimal army presence in the film: Hitler apparently proposed modifying the film to placate the generals, but Riefenstahl refused his suggestion. She did agree to return to the 1935 rally and make a film exclusively about the Wehrmacht, which became Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht. The rallies for 1936 and 1937 were covered in Festliches N√ºrnberg, which was shorter than the others, only 21 minutes.  Books  There were two sets of official or semi-official books covering the rallies. The \\"red books\\" were officially published by the NSDAP and contained the proceedings of the \\"congress\\" as well as full texts of every speech given in chronological order. The \\"blue books\\" were published initially by Julius Streicher, the Gauleiter of Nuremberg, later by Hanns Kerrl, not by the party press. These were larger scale books that included the text of speeches and proceedings, as well as larger photographs. In addition to these, collections of Heinrich Hoffman's photographs were published to commemorate each Party congress, as well as pamphlets of Hitler's speeches. Both series of books are much sought after by collectors. Hoffman created 100-image series on the 1936, 1937, and 1938 rallies in stereoscopic 3D through his Raumbild-Verlag outfit.

He debuted as a professional boxer on July 2 of 1978 with a win over Darryl Jones in Stockton. He suffered his first defeat when he lost by a decision in Las Vegas to future world champion Joey Olivo, in Mercedes' third bout as a paid fighter. Mercedes' first of 11 fights in a row in Mexico came in 1979, when he lost by a knockout in seven rounds to Juan D√≠az. During that span of 11 fights in Mexico, he went 6-3-2, fighting in such places as Mexico City, Monterrey and Reynosa. He lost to Candido Tellez but also beat former world champion Guty Espadas, by a knockout in nine during that span. His first fight in the Dominican Republic was a 1982 rematch with Diaz, held in Santo Domingo. He won the fight by a decision in twelve rounds, to avenge his defeat at the hands of Diaz. Up until that moment, Mercedes' record was of 10 wins, 6 losses and 2 draws, reason why it was a little surprising to his fans when the WBC announced it would give Mercedes a chance at becoming a world champion, against two time world champion Freddie Castillo, who was in his second reign. The two boxers met on November 6 of 1982, at Los Angeles. Mercedes caused another surprise among many boxing fans by defeating Castillo by a decision in 15 rounds and becoming WBC and Lineal Flyweight champion. In his first defense, Mercedes put the titles on the line against the British boxer Charlie Magri. In round seven, the fight had to be stopped because of a cut suffered by Mercedes, which had been determined to be from a punch by Magri. Mercedes then lost his world Flyweight championships by a technical knockout in that round. After that, Mercedes kept on boxing, but had mixed fortunes. He managed to beat future world title challenger Alonzo Gonzalez by a decision, but lost to future world champion, Mexican German Torres by a knockout in the ninth round. Mercedes also lost a twelve-round decision to future world champion Raul Jibaro Perez, as well as being knocked out in the sixth round by former world Bantamweight champion Alberto Davila. Death A few days before Christmas in 1985, Mercedes was shot and killed by a policeman in his native La Romana, aged 28, after allegedly pulling a gun on the policeman. Mercedes had been drinking in a bar when he was shot to death. Confusion exists as to how this incident took place as some sources state the altercation happened after a car accident.http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mercedes.htm See also *List of flyweight boxing champions *List of WBC world champions References External links Eleoncio Mercedes - CBZ Profile 1957 births 1985 deaths Boxers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Olympic boxers of the Dominican Republic Flyweight boxers World boxing champions World flyweight boxing champions World Boxing Council champions People from La Romana, Dominican Republic Male murder victims Murdered boxers People murdered in the Dominican Republic Deaths by firearm in the Dominican Republic People shot dead by law enforcement officers Dominican Republic murder victims Dominican Republic male boxers ","title":"Eleoncio Mercedes"},{"id":"172562","text":"The Sigmund Freud Archives mainly consist of a trove of documents housed at the US Library of CongressSigmund Freud A Register of His Papers in the Sigmund Freud Collection in the Library of Congress Latest revision: 2006 November and in the former residence of Sigmund Freud during the last year of his life at 20 Maresfield Gardens in northwest London. They were at the center of a complicated scandal which is described in Janet Malcolm's book In the Freud Archives. Jeffrey Masson writes about it in Chapter Nine: \\"Disillusions\\" of his book Final Analysis. History After World War II Dr. Kurt R. Eissler (1909‚Äì1999) and a small group of psychoanalysts who knew Sigmund Freud personally, including Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, Bertram Lewin and Hermann Nunberg, decided to preserve Freud's letters and papers in a single archive. The Library of Congress, Dr. Eissler wrote, agreed in a legal \\"instrument\\" to accept as a donation all documents collected by the Archives, and to make them accessible to scholars. By the 1980s Dr. Eissler, with the help of Anna Freud, had collected thousands of tapes, letters and papers for that archive. (An exhibition of parts of the collection was held at the Library of Congress last year and will be at the Jewish Museum this year.) Kurt Eissler, 90, Director of Sigmund Freud Archives by Sarah Boxer, published: February 20, 1999 in New York Times The Archives were founded in 1951 by Dr. Eissler and directed by him for decades. Dr. Eissler prevented many well-meaning scholars from seeing many Freud documents claiming confidentiality, even when their donors had not requested nor demanded that confidentiality, nor was anyone a potential victim of the revelation of those documents. In 1974 the 65-year-old Dr. Eissler met Dr. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (born 1941), a 33-year-old Sanskrit scholar and psychoanalyst, at a meeting of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Eissler took a liking to Masson, appointed him his secretary, and meant to make him his successor at the Archives. Being an officer of the Sigmund Freud Archives Masson had 'administrative access' to all documents in the Archives, he was allowed to see anything he wanted breaking the seal whenever necessary. In 1981 Dr. Masson, who was then the Projects Director of the Archives, delivered a paper to the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society in New Haven, Connecticut. Dr. Masson said that Freud had abandoned his seduction theory -- the idea that adult neurosis is caused by childhood sexual abuse‚Äîfor personal rather than scientific reasons. By dropping the seduction theory, Dr. Masson concluded, \\"Freud began a trend away from the real world that, it seems to me, has come to a dead halt in the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis throughout the world.\\" Dr. Eissler was deeply shocked (\\"Just today Masud Khan called me from London and asked me to dismiss you from the Archives. The board members, all of them, or at least most of them, are asking for the same.\\")Eissler to Masson, p. 194 of Final Analysis and sought to dismiss Dr. Masson from his job at the Archives, which led to bilateral legal action and a well-publicized scandal. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives after a vote by the 13-member board of the Freud Archives - a nonprofit foundation controlling the vast public and private papers of Freud - not to renew Dr. Masson's contract as projects director for a second year starting in January.\\"Freud Archives Research Chief Removed in Dispute Over Yale Talk\\" by Ralph Blumenthal, New York Times November 9, 1981 The current director of the Archives is Dr. Harold P.

She is the author of Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (1981), In the Freud Archives (1984) and The Journalist and the Murderer (1990), among other books.  Background and personal  Malcolm was born in Prague in 1934, one of two daughters‚Äîthe other is the author Marie Winn‚Äîof a psychiatrist father (Josef Wiener a.k.a. Joseph A. Winn) and Hanna (n√©e Taussig). She has resided in the United States since her family emigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1939. Malcolm was educated at the University of Michigan and lives in New York City. Her first husband, Donald Malcolm, reviewed books for The New Yorker in the 1950s and 1960s. Her second husband, whom she wed in 1975, was long-time New Yorker editor Gardner Botsford who died at age 87 in September, 2004. Early Malcolm book jackets report her \\"living in New York with her husband and daughter.\\" Her daughter is also mentioned in the text of The Crime of Sheila McGough.  Masson case  Articles written by Malcolm, published in The New Yorker and in Malcolm's subsequent book In The Freud Archives, triggered a $10 million legal challenge by psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, the former project director for the Freud Archives. In his 1984 lawsuit, Masson claimed that Malcolm had libelled him by fabricating quotations attributed to him; these quotes, Masson contended, had brought him into disrepute. Malcolm claimed that Masson had called himself an \\"intellectual gigolo\\", and that he had slept with over 1,000 women. She also claimed that he said he wanted to turn the Freud estate into a haven of \\"sex, women and fun\\"; and claimed that he was, \\"after Freud, the greatest analyst that ever lived.\\" Malcolm was unable to produce all the disputed material on tape. The case was partially adjudicated before the Supreme Court, which held, against Malcolm, that the case could go forward for trial by jury. After a decade of proceedings, a jury finally decided in Malcolm's favor on November 2, 1994, on the grounds that, whether or not the quotations were genuine, more evidence would be needed to rule against Malcolm. In August 1995, Malcolm claimed to have discovered a misplaced notebook containing three of the disputed quotes. As reported in The New York Times, the author \\"declared in an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the notes were genuine.\\"  The Journalist and the Murderer  The thesis of The Journalist and the Murderer is contained in its first sentence: \\"Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\\"Malcolm, Janet, The Journalist and the Murderer, New York: Knopf, 1990. Malcolm's example was the popular non-fiction writer Joe McGinniss, author of The Selling of the President 1968, among others; while researching his non-fiction, true crime book Fatal Vision, McGinniss lived with the defense team of former Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald, then on trial for the 1970 murders of his two daughters and pregnant wife. In the published Fatal Vision, McGinniss concluded that MacDonald was a sociopath and had been unbalanced by amphetamines when he slew his family. McGinniss drew upon the work of the social critic Christopher Lasch to construct a portrait of MacDonald as a \\"pathological narcissist\\".Malcolm, The Journalist and the Murderer, pp. 28, 72-3. Malcolm contended that McGinniss was pressed into this strategy for professional and structural reasons ‚Äî by MacDonald's \\"lack of vividness\\"Malcolm, p.68 as a real-life character who would be carrying the book. \\"As every journalist will confirm,\\" Malcolm writes,Malcolm, pps. 71-3. > MacDonald's uninterestingness is not unusual at all ... When a journalist > fetches up against someone like [him], all he can do is flee and hope that a > more suitable subject will turn up soon. In the MacDonald-McGinniss case we > have an instance of a journalist who apparently found out too late that the > subject of his book was not up to scratch ‚Äî not a member of the wonderful > race of auto-fictionalizers, like Joseph Mitchell's Joe Gould and Truman > Capote's Perry Smith, on whom the \\"non-fiction novel\\" depends for its life > ... The solution that McGinniss arrived at for dealing with MacDonald's > characterlessness was not a satisfactory one, but it had to do. Per Malcolm, it was to conceal this deficit that McGinniss quoted liberally from Lasch's 1979 study The Culture of Narcissism. This, to her, was a professional sin. McGinniss's moral sin, his \\"indefensible\\" act in her view, was to pretend to a belief in MacDonald's innocence, long after he'd become convinced of the man's guilt. Malcolm's book created a sensation when in March 1989 it appeared in two parts in The New Yorker magazine.Scardino, Albert, The New York Times. \\"Ethic, Reporters and The New Yorker\\", March 21. 1989. \\"Janet Malcolm, a staff writer for The New Yorker, returned her magazine to the center of the long-running debate over ethics in journalism this month ... Her declarations provoked outrage among authors, reporters and editors, who rushed last week to distinguish themselves from the journalists Miss Malcolm was describing.\\" Roundly criticized upon first publication,See Friendly, Fred W., The New York Times Book Review, \\"Was Trust Betrayed?\\", February 25, 1990, and Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher, The New York Times, \\"Deception and Journalism: How Far to Go for the Story\\", February 22, 1990. the book is still controversial, although it has come to be regarded as a classic, according to Douglas McCollum.McCollum, Douglas, Columbia Journalism Review, \\"You Have The Right to Remain Silent\\", January, February, 2003. It ranks ninety-seventh in The Modern Library's list of the twentieth century's \\"100 Best Works of Nonfiction\\". McCollum wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review, \\"In the decade after Malcolm's essay appeared, her once controversial theory became received wisdom.\\" Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession The Freud scholar Peter Gay wrote of Malcolm's study of the modern psychoanalytic profession, \\"Janet Malcolm's witty and wicked Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession has been praised by psychoanalysts (with justice) as a dependable introduction to analytic theory and technique. It has the rare advantage over more solemn texts of being funny as well as informative\\".Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Times (London 1988) p. 763 In his 1981 New York Times review, Joseph Edelson wrote that Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession \\"is an artful book. It succeeds in part because Miss Malcolm brings to her work a keen eye for the surfaces - clothing, speech and furniture - that express character and social role. (She is the photography critic for The New Yorker). It succeeds because she has instructed herself so carefully in the technical literature. Above all, it succeeds because she has been able to engage Aaron Green in a simulacrum of the psychoanalytic encounter - he confessing to her, she (I suspect) to him, the two of them joined in an intricate minuet of revelation.\\" Public reputation Malcolm's penchant for controversial subjects and tendency to insert her beliefs and opinions into her narratives has brought her both admirers and critics. \\"Leaning heavily on the techniques of psychoanalysis, she probes not only actions and reactions but motivations and intent; she pursues literary analysis like a crime drama and courtroom battles like novels,\\" wrote Cara Parks in The New Republic. Parks praised Malcolm's \\"intensely intellectual style\\" as well as her \\"sharpness and creativity.\\" But in Esquire, Tom Junod characterized Malcolm as \\"a self hater whose work has managed to speak for the self-hatred (not to mention the class issues) of a profession that has designs on being 'one of the professions' but never will be.\\" Junod found her to be devoid of \\"journalistic sympathy\\" and observed, \\"Very few journalists are more animated by malice than Janet Malcolm.\\" He concluded that Malcolm is both \\"self-serving\\" and \\"utterly full of shit.\\" Works =Non-fiction= *Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (1981) *In The Freud Archives (1984) *The Journalist and the Murderer (1990) *The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath & Ted Hughes (1994) *The Crime of Sheila McGough (1999) *Reading Chekhov: A Critical Journey (2001) *Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice (2007) *Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial (2011) =Essay collections= *Diana & Nikon: Essays on the Aesthetic of Photography (1980) *The Purloined Clinic: Selected Writings (1992), which contains the essays \\"A Girl of the Zeitgeist\\" and \\"The Window Washer\\" *Forty-one False Starts: Essays on Artists and Writers (2013) *Nobody's Looking at You: Essays (2019) =Photography= *Burdock (2008) Awards and honors *2008 PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography, Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice *2013 National Book Critics Circle Award (Criticism) shortlist for Forty-One False Starts References Sources *Janet Malcolm by Craig Seligman, Salon.com, February 29, 2000  External links  NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH? * The Lives They Lived: Kurt Eissler, b. 1908; Keeper of Freud's Secrets, By JANET MALCOLM, Published: January 2, 2000 * Malcolm archive from The New York Review of Books * Janet Malcom Papers.

When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution. Otherwise, the optimization problem is to find the smallest number of graph edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum possible total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit. It can be solved in polynomial time. The problem was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Kwan Mei-Ko in 1960, whose Chinese paper was translated into English in 1962.. Translated in Chinese Mathematics 1: 273‚Äì277, 1962. The original name \\"Chinese postman problem\\" was coined in his honor; different sources credit the coinage either to Alan J. Goldman or Jack Edmonds, both of whom were at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards at the time.. A generalization is to choose any set T of evenly many vertices that are to be joined by an edge set in the graph whose odd-degree vertices are precisely those of T. Such a set is called a T-join. This problem, the T-join problem, is also solvable in polynomial time by the same approach that solves the postman problem. Undirected solution and T-joins The undirected route inspection problem can be solved in polynomial time by an algorithm based on the concept of a T-join. Let T be a set of vertices in a graph. An edge set J is called a T-join if the collection of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges in J is exactly the set T. A T-join exists whenever every connected component of the graph contains an even number of vertices in T. The T-join problem is to find a T-join with the minimum possible number of edges or the minimum possible total weight. For any T, a smallest T-join (when it exists) necessarily consists of \\\\tfrac{1}{2}T paths that join the vertices of T in pairs. The paths will be such that the total length or total weight of all of them is as small as possible. In an optimal solution, no two of these paths will share any edge, but they may have shared vertices. A minimum T-join can be obtained by constructing a complete graph on the vertices of T, with edges that represent shortest paths in the given input graph, and then finding a minimum weight perfect matching in this complete graph. The edges of this matching represent paths in the original graph, whose union forms the desired T-join. Both constructing the complete graph, and then finding a matching in it, can be done in O(n3) computational steps. For the route inspection problem, T should be chosen as the set of all odd-degree vertices. By the assumptions of the problem, the whole graph is connected (otherwise no tour exists), and by the handshaking lemma it has an even number of odd vertices, so a T-join always exists. Doubling the edges of a T-join causes the given graph to become an Eulerian multigraph (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree), from which it follows that it has an Euler tour, a tour that visits each edge of the multigraph exactly once. This tour will be an optimal solution to the route inspection problem. Directed solution On a directed graph, the same general ideas apply, but different techniques must be used. If the directed graph is Eulerian, one need only find an Euler cycle. If it is not, one must find T-joins, which in this case entails finding paths from vertices with an in-degree greater than their out-degree to those with an out-degree greater than their in-degree such that they would make in-degree of every vertex equal to its out-degree. This can be solved as an instance of the minimum-cost flow problem in which there is one unit of supply for every unit of excess in-degree, and one unit of demand for every unit of excess out- degree. As such it is solvable in O(V2E) time. A solution exists if and only if the given graph is strongly connected. Windy postman problem The windy postman problem is a variant of the route inspection problem in which the input is an undirected graph, but where each edge may have a different cost for traversing it in one direction than for traversing it in the other direction. In contrast to the solutions for directed and undirected graphs, it is NP-complete.. Applications Various combinatorial problems have been reduced to the Chinese Postman Problem, including finding a maximum cut in a planar graph and a minimum-mean length circuit in an undirected graph.A. Schrijver, Combinatorial Optimization, Polyhedra and Efficiency, Volume A, Springer. (2002). Variants A few variants of the Chinese Postman Problem have been studied and shown to be NP-complete. * The Chinese postman problem for mixed graphs: for this problem, some of the edges may be directed and can therefore only be visited from one direction. When the problem calls for a minimal traversal of a digraph (or multidigraph) it is known as the \\"New York Street Sweeper problem.\\" * The k-Chinese postman problem: find k cycles all starting at a designated location such that each edge is traversed by at least one cycle. The goal is to minimize the cost of the most expensive cycle. * The \\"Rural Postman Problem\\": solve the problem with some edges not required.

The algorithm was developed to efficiently apply many rules or patterns to many objects, or facts, in a knowledge base. It is used to determine which of the system's rules should fire based on its data store, its facts. The Rete algorithm was designed by Charles L. Forgy of Carnegie Mellon University, first published in a working paper in 1974, and later elaborated in his 1979 Ph.D. thesis and a 1982 paper Charles Forgy: Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem. In: Artificial Intelligence, vol. 19, pp. 17‚Äì37, 1982.. Overview A naive implementation of an expert system might check each rule against known facts in a knowledge base, firing that rule if necessary, then moving on to the next rule (and looping back to the first rule when finished). For even moderate sized rules and facts knowledge-bases, this naive approach performs far too slowly. The Rete algorithm provides the basis for a more efficient implementation. A Rete-based expert system builds a network of nodes, where each node (except the root) corresponds to a pattern occurring in the left- hand-side (the condition part) of a rule. The path from the root node to a leaf node defines a complete rule left-hand-side. Each node has a memory of facts which satisfy that pattern. This structure is essentially a generalized trie. As new facts are asserted or modified, they propagate along the network, causing nodes to be annotated when that fact matches that pattern. When a fact or combination of facts causes all of the patterns for a given rule to be satisfied, a leaf node is reached and the corresponding rule is triggered. Rete was first used as the core engine of the OPS5 production system language which was used to build early systems including R1 for Digital Equipment Corporation. Rete has become the basis for many popular rule engines and expert system shells, including Tibco Business Events, Newgen OmniRules, CLIPS, Jess, Drools, IBM Operational Decision Management, OPSJ, Blaze Advisor, BizTalk Rules Engine, Soar, Clara and Sparkling Logic SMARTS. The word 'Rete' is Latin for 'net' or 'comb'. The same word is used in modern Italian to mean network. Charles Forgy has reportedly stated that he adopted the term 'Rete' because of its use in anatomy to describe a network of blood vessels and nerve fibers.\\"Rete Algorithm Demystified! ‚Äì Part 1\\" by Carole-Ann Matignon The Rete algorithm is designed to sacrifice memory for increased speed. In most cases, the speed increase over na√Øve implementations is several orders of magnitude (because Rete performance is theoretically independent of the number of rules in the system). In very large expert systems, however, the original Rete algorithm tends to run into memory and server consumption problems. Other algorithms, both novel and Rete-based, have since been designed which require less memory (e.g. Rete* or Collection Oriented Match).  Description  The Rete algorithm provides a generalized logical description of an implementation of functionality responsible for matching data tuples (\\"facts\\") against productions (\\"rules\\") in a pattern-matching production system (a category of rule engine). A production consists of one or more conditions and a set of actions which may be undertaken for each complete set of facts that match the conditions. Conditions test fact attributes, including fact type specifiers/identifiers. The Rete algorithm exhibits the following major characteristics: * It reduces or eliminates certain types of redundancy through the use of node sharing. * It stores partial matches when performing joins between different fact types. This, in turn, allows production systems to avoid complete re-evaluation of all facts each time changes are made to the production system's working memory. Instead, the production system needs only to evaluate the changes (deltas) to working memory. * It allows for efficient removal of memory elements when facts are retracted from working memory. The Rete algorithm is widely used to implement matching functionality within pattern-matching engines that exploit a match-resolve-act cycle to support forward chaining and inferencing. * It provides a means for many-many matching, an important feature when many or all possible solutions in a search network must be found. Retes are directed acyclic graphs that represent higher-level rule sets. They are generally represented at run-time using a network of in-memory objects. These networks match rule conditions (patterns) to facts (relational data tuples). Rete networks act as a type of relational query processor, performing projections, selections and joins conditionally on arbitrary numbers of data tuples. Productions (rules) are typically captured and defined by analysts and developers using some high-level rules language. They are collected into rule sets which are then translated, often at run time, into an executable Rete. When facts are \\"asserted\\" to working memory, the engine creates working memory elements (WMEs) for each fact. Facts are n-tuples, and may therefore contain an arbitrary number of data items. Each WME may hold an entire n-tuple, or, alternatively, each fact may be represented by a set of WMEs where each WME contains a fixed-length tuple. In this case, tuples are typically triplets (3-tuples). Each WME enters the Rete network at a single root node. The root node passes each WME on to its child nodes, and each WME may then be propagated through the network, possibly being stored in intermediate memories, until it arrives at a terminal node. = Alpha network = The \\"left\\" (alpha) side of the node graph forms a discrimination network responsible for selecting individual WMEs based on simple conditional tests which match WME attributes against constant values. Nodes in the discrimination network may also perform tests that compare two or more attributes of the same WME. If a WME is successfully matched against the conditions represented by one node, it is passed to the next node. In most engines, the immediate child nodes of the root node are used to test the entity identifier or fact type of each WME. Hence, all the WMEs which represent the same entity type typically traverse a given branch of nodes in the discrimination network. Within the discrimination network, each branch of alpha nodes (also called 1-input nodes) terminates at a memory, called an alpha memory. These memories store collections of WMEs that match each condition in each node in a given node branch. WMEs that fail to match at least one condition in a branch are not materialised within the corresponding alpha memory. Alpha node branches may fork in order to minimise condition redundancy. = Beta network = The \\"right\\" (beta) side of the graph chiefly performs joins between different WMEs. It is optional, and is only included if required. It consists of 2-input nodes where each node has a \\"left\\" and a \\"right\\" input. Each beta node sends its output to a beta memory. In descriptions of Rete, it is common to refer to token passing within the beta network. In this article, however, we will describe data propagation in terms of WME lists, rather than tokens, in recognition of different implementation options and the underlying purpose and use of tokens. As any one WME list passes through the beta network, new WMEs may be added to it, and the list may be stored in beta memories. A WME list in a beta memory represents a partial match for the conditions in a given production. WME lists that reach the end of a branch of beta nodes represent a complete match for a single production, and are passed to terminal nodes. These nodes are sometimes called p-nodes, where \\"p\\" stands for production. Each terminal node represents a single production, and each WME list that arrives at a terminal node represents a complete set of matching WMEs for the conditions in that production. For each WME list it receives, a production node will \\"activate\\" a new production instance on the \\"agenda\\". Agendas are typically implemented as prioritised queues. Beta nodes typically perform joins between WME lists stored in beta memories and individual WMEs stored in alpha memories. Each beta node is associated with two input memories. An alpha memory holds WM and performs \\"right\\" activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME. A beta memory holds WME lists and performs \\"left\\" activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME list. When a join node is right-activated, it compares one or more attributes of the newly stored WME from its input alpha memory against given attributes of specific WMEs in each WME list contained in the input beta memory. When a join node is left-activated it traverses a single newly stored WME list in the beta memory, retrieving specific attribute values of given WMEs. It compares these values with attribute values of each WME in the alpha memory. Each beta node outputs WME lists which are either stored in a beta memory or sent directly to a terminal node. WME lists are stored in beta memories whenever the engine will perform additional left activations on subsequent beta nodes. Logically, a beta node at the head of a branch of beta nodes is a special case because it takes no input from any beta memory higher in the network. Different engines handle this issue in different ways. Some engines use specialised adapter nodes to connect alpha memories to the left input of beta nodes. Other engines allow beta nodes to take input directly from two alpha memories, treating one as a \\"left\\" input and the other as a \\"right\\" input. In both cases, \\"head\\" beta nodes take their input from two alpha memories. In order to eliminate node redundancies, any one alpha or beta memory may be used to perform activations on multiple beta nodes. As well as join nodes, the beta network may contain additional node types, some of which are described below. If a Rete contains no beta network, alpha nodes feed tokens, each containing a single WME, directly to p-nodes. In this case, there may be no need to store WMEs in alpha memories. = Conflict resolution = During any one match-resolve-act cycle, the engine will find all possible matches for the facts currently asserted to working memory. Once all the current matches have been found, and corresponding production instances have been activated on the agenda, the engine determines an order in which the production instances may be \\"fired\\". This is termed conflict resolution, and the list of activated production instances is termed the conflict set. The order may be based on rule priority (salience), rule order, the time at which facts contained in each instance were asserted to the working memory, the complexity of each production, or some other criteria. Many engines allow rule developers to select between different conflict resolution strategies or to chain a selection of multiple strategies. Conflict resolution is not defined as part of the Rete algorithm, but is used alongside the algorithm. Some specialised production systems do not perform conflict resolution. = Production execution= Having performed conflict resolution, the engine now \\"fires\\" the first production instance, executing a list of actions associated with the production. The actions act on the data represented by the production instance's WME list. By default, the engine will continue to fire each production instance in order until all production instances have been fired. Each production instance will fire only once, at most, during any one match- resolve-act cycle. This characteristic is termed refraction. However, the sequence of production instance firings may be interrupted at any stage by performing changes to the working memory. Rule actions can contain instructions to assert or retract WMEs from the working memory of the engine. Each time any single production instance performs one or more such changes, the engine immediately enters a new match-resolve-act cycle. This includes \\"updates\\" to WMEs currently in the working memory. Updates are represented by retracting and then re-asserting the WME. The engine undertakes matching of the changed data which, in turn, may result in changes to the list of production instances on the agenda. Hence, after the actions for any one specific production instance have been executed, previously activated instances may have been de-activated and removed from the agenda, and new instances may have been activated. As part of the new match-resolve-act cycle, the engine performs conflict resolution on the agenda and then executes the current first instance. The engine continues to fire production instances, and to enter new match-resolve-act cycles, until no further production instances exist on the agenda. At this point the rule engine is deemed to have completed its work, and halts. Some engines support advanced refraction strategies in which certain production instances executed in a previous cycle are not re- executed in the new cycle, even though they may still exist on the agenda. It is possible for the engine to enter into never-ending loops in which the agenda never reaches the empty state. For this reason, most engines support explicit \\"halt\\" verbs that can be invoked from production action lists. They may also provide automatic loop detection in which never-ending loops are automatically halted after a given number of iterations. Some engines support a model in which, instead of halting when the agenda is empty, the engine enters a wait state until new facts are asserted externally. As for conflict resolution, the firing of activated production instances is not a feature of the Rete algorithm. However, it is a central feature of engines that use Rete networks. Some of the optimisations offered by Rete networks are only useful in scenarios where the engine performs multiple match-resolve-act cycles. = Existential and universal quantifications = Conditional tests are most commonly used to perform selections and joins on individual tuples. However, by implementing additional beta node types, it is possible for Rete networks to perform quantifications. Existential quantification involves testing for the existence of at least one set of matching WMEs in working memory. Universal quantification involves testing that an entire set of WMEs in working memory meets a given condition. A variation of universal quantification might test that a given number of WMEs, drawn from a set of WMEs, meets given criteria. This might be in terms of testing for either an exact number or a minimum number of matches. Quantification is not universally implemented in Rete engines, and, where it is supported, several variations exist. A variant of existential quantification referred to as negation is widely, though not universally, supported, and is described in seminal documents. Existentially negated conditions and conjunctions involve the use of specialised beta nodes that test for non-existence of matching WMEs or sets of WMEs. These nodes propagate WME lists only when no match is found. The exact implementation of negation varies. In one approach, the node maintains a simple count on each WME list it receives from its left input. The count specifies the number of matches found with WMEs received from the right input. The node only propagates WME lists whose count is zero. In another approach, the node maintains an additional memory on each WME list received from the left input. These memories are a form of beta memory, and store WME lists for each match with WMEs received on the right input. If a WME list does not have any WME lists in its memory, it is propagated down the network. In this approach, negation nodes generally activate further beta nodes directly, rather than storing their output in an additional beta memory. Negation nodes provide a form of 'negation as failure'. When changes are made to working memory, a WME list that previously matched no WMEs may now match newly asserted WMEs. In this case, the propagated WME list and all its extended copies need to be retracted from beta memories further down the network. The second approach described above is often used to support efficient mechanisms for removal of WME lists. When WME lists are removed, any corresponding production instances are de-activated and removed from the agenda. Existential quantification can be performed by combining two negation beta nodes. This represents the semantics of double negation (e.g., \\"If NOT NOT any matching WMEs, then...\\"). This is a common approach taken by several production systems. = Memory indexing = The Rete algorithm does not mandate any specific approach to indexing the working memory. However, most modern production systems provide indexing mechanisms. In some cases, only beta memories are indexed, whilst in others, indexing is used for both alpha and beta memories. A good indexing strategy is a major factor in deciding the overall performance of a production system, especially when executing rule sets that result in highly combinatorial pattern matching (i.e., intensive use of beta join nodes), or, for some engines, when executing rules sets that perform a significant number of WME retractions during multiple match-resolve- act cycles. Memories are often implemented using combinations of hash tables, and hash values are used to perform conditional joins on subsets of WME lists and WMEs, rather than on the entire contents of memories. This, in turn, often significantly reduces the number of evaluations performed by the Rete network. = Removal of WMEs and WME lists = When a WME is retracted from working memory, it must be removed from every alpha memory in which it is stored. In addition, WME lists that contain the WME must be removed from beta memories, and activated production instances for these WME lists must be de-activated and removed from the agenda. Several implementation variations exist, including tree-based and rematch-based removal. Memory indexing may be used in some cases to optimise removal. = Handling ORed conditions = When defining productions in a rule set, it is common to allow conditions to be grouped using an OR connective. In many production systems, this is handled by interpreting a single production containing multiple ORed patterns as the equivalent of multiple productions. The resulting Rete network contains sets of terminal nodes which, together, represent single productions. This approach disallows any form of short-circuiting of the ORed conditions. It can also, in some cases, lead to duplicate production instances being activated on the agenda where the same set of WMEs match multiple internal productions. Some engines provide agenda de-duplication in order to handle this issue. = Diagram = The following diagram illustrates the basic Rete topography, and shows the associations between different node types and memories. Illustrates the basic Rete. * Most implementations use type nodes to perform the first level of selection on n-tuple working memory elements. Type nodes can be considered as specialized select nodes. They discriminate between different tuple relation types. * The diagram does not illustrate the use of specialized nodes types such as negated conjunction nodes. Some engines implement several different node specialisations in order to extend functionality and maximise optimisation. * The diagram provides a logical view of the Rete. Implementations may differ in physical detail. In particular, the diagram shows dummy inputs providing right activations at the head of beta node branches. Engines may implement other approaches, such as adapters that allow alpha memories to perform right activations directly. * The diagram does not illustrate all node-sharing possibilities. For a more detailed and complete description of the Rete algorithm, see chapter 2 of Production Matching for Large Learning Systems by Robert Doorenbos (see link below).  Alternatives  = Alpha Network = A possible variation is to introduce additional memories for each intermediate node in the discrimination network. This increases the overhead of the Rete, but may have advantages in situations where rules are dynamically added to or removed from the Rete, making it easier to vary the topology of the discrimination network dynamically. An alternative implementation is described by Doorenbos.Production Matching for Large Learning Systems from SCS Technical Report Collection, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University In this case, the discrimination network is replaced by a set of memories and an index. The index may be implemented using a hash table. Each memory holds WMEs that match a single conditional pattern, and the index is used to reference memories by their pattern. This approach is only practical when WMEs represent fixed-length tuples, and the length of each tuple is short (e.g., 3-tuples). In addition, the approach only applies to conditional patterns that perform equality tests against constant values. When a WME enters the Rete, the index is used to locate a set of memories whose conditional pattern matches the WME attributes, and the WME is then added directly to each of these memories. In itself, this implementation contains no 1-input nodes. However, in order to implement non- equality tests, the Rete may contain additional 1-input node networks through which WMEs are passed before being placed in a memory. Alternatively, non- equality tests may be performed in the beta network described below. = Beta Network = A common variation is to build linked lists of tokens where each token holds a single WME. In this case, lists of WMEs for a partial match are represented by the linked list of tokens. This approach may be better because it eliminates the need to copy lists of WMEs from one token to another. Instead, a beta node needs only to create a new token to hold a WME it wishes to join to the partial match list, and then link the new token to a parent token stored in the input beta memory. The new token now forms the head of the token list, and is stored in the output beta memory. Beta nodes process tokens. A token is a unit of storage within a memory and also a unit of exchange between memories and nodes. In many implementations, tokens are introduced within alpha memories where they are used to hold single WMEs. These tokens are then passed to the beta network. Each beta node performs its work and, as a result, may create new tokens to hold a list of WMEs representing a partial match. These extended tokens are then stored in beta memories, and passed to subsequent beta nodes. In this case, the beta nodes typically pass lists of WMEs through the beta network by copying existing WME lists from each received token into new tokens and then adding further WMEs to the lists as a result of performing a join or some other action. The new tokens are then stored in the output memory.  Miscellaneous considerations  Although not defined by the Rete algorithm, some engines provide extended functionality to support greater control of truth maintenance. For example, when a match is found for one production, this may result in the assertion of new WMEs which, in turn, match the conditions for another production. If a subsequent change to working memory causes the first match to become invalid, it may be that this implies that the second match is also invalid. The Rete algorithm does not define any mechanism to define and handle these logical truth dependencies automatically. Some engines, however, support additional functionality in which truth dependencies can be automatically maintained. In this case, the retraction of one WME may lead to the automatic retraction of additional WMEs in order to maintain logical truth assertions. The Rete algorithm does not define any approach to justification. Justification refers to mechanisms commonly required in expert and decision systems in which, at its simplest, the system reports each of the inner decisions used to reach some final conclusion. For example, an expert system might justify a conclusion that an animal is an elephant by reporting that it is large, grey, has big ears, a trunk and tusks. Some engines provide built-in justification systems in conjunction with their implementation of the Rete algorithm. This article does not provide an exhaustive description of every possible variation or extension of the Rete algorithm. Other considerations and innovations exist. For example, engines may provide specialised support within the Rete network in order to apply pattern-matching rule processing to specific data types and sources such as programmatic objects, XML data or relational data tables. Another example concerns additional time-stamping facilities provided by many engines for each WME entering a Rete network, and the use of these time-stamps in conjunction with conflict resolution strategies. Engines exhibit significant variation in the way they allow programmatic access to the engine and its working memory, and may extend the basic Rete model to support forms of parallel and distributed processing.  Optimization and performance  Several optimizations for Rete have been identified and described in academic literature. Several of these, however, apply only in very specific scenarios, and therefore often have little or no application in a general- purpose rules engine. In addition, alternative algorithms such as TREAT, developed by Daniel P. Mirankerhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=39946 \\"TREAT: a new and efficient match algorithm for AI production systems \\" LEAPS, and Design Time Inferencing (DeTI) have been formulated which may provide additional performance improvements. The Rete algorithm is suited to scenarios where forward chaining and \\"inferencing\\" is used to calculate new facts from existing facts, or to filter and discard facts in order to arrive at some conclusion. It is also exploited as a reasonably efficient mechanism for performing highly combinatorial evaluations of facts where large numbers of joins must be performed between fact tuples. Other approaches to performing rule evaluation, such as the use of decision trees, or the implementation of sequential engines, may be more appropriate for simple scenarios, and should be considered as possible alternatives. Performance of Rete is also largely a matter of implementation choices (independent of the network topology), one of which (the use of hash tables) leads to major improvements. Most of the performance benchmarks and comparisons available on the web are biased in some way or another. To mention only a frequent bias and an unfair type of comparison: 1) the use of toy problems such as the Manners and Waltz examples; such examples are useful to estimate specific properties of the implementation, but they may not reflect real performance on complex applications; 2) the use of an old implementation; for instance, the references in the following two sections (Rete II and Rete-NT) compare some commercial products to totally outdated versions of CLIPS and they claim that the commercial products may be orders of magnitude faster than CLIPS; this is forgetting that CLIPS 6.30 (with the introduction of hash tables as in Rete II) is orders of magnitude faster than the version used for the comparisons (CLIPS 6.04). Variants =Rete II= In the 1980s, Charles Forgy developed a successor to the Rete algorithm named Rete II.RETE2 from Production Systems Technologies Unlike the original Rete (which is public domain) this algorithm was not disclosed. Rete II claims better performance for more complex problems (even orders of magnitudeBenchmarking CLIPS/R2 from Production Systems Technologies), and is officially implemented in CLIPS/R2, a C/++ implementation and in OPSJ, a Java implementation in 1998. Rete II gives about a 100 to 1 order of magnitude performance improvement in more complex problems as shown by KnowledgeBased Systems CorporationKBSC benchmarks. Rete II can be characterized by two areas of improvement; specific optimizations relating to the general performance of the Rete network (including the use of hashed memories in order to increase performance with larger sets of data), and the inclusion of a backward chaining algorithm tailored to run on top of the Rete network. Backward chaining alone can account for the most extreme changes in benchmarks relating to Rete vs. Rete II. Rete II is implemented in the commercial product Advisor from FICO, formerly called Fair Isaac http://dmblog.fico.com/2005/09/what_is_rete_ii.html Jess (at least versions 5.0 and later) also adds a commercial backward chaining algorithm on top of the Rete network, but it cannot be said to fully implement Rete II, in part due to the fact that no full specification is publicly available. =Rete- III= In the early 2000s, the Rete III engine was developed by Charles Forgy in cooperation with FICO engineers. The Rete III algorithm, which is not Rete- NT, is the FICO trademark for Rete II and is implemented as part of the FICO Advisor engine. It is basically the Rete II engine with an API that allows access to the Advisor engine because the Advisor engine can access other FICO products.http://dmblog.fico.com/2005/09/what_is_rete_ii.html =Rete-NT= In 2010, Forgy developed a new generation of the Rete algorithm. In an InfoWorld benchmark, the algorithm was deemed 500 times faster than the original Rete algorithm and 10 times faster than its predecessor, Rete II. This algorithm is now licensed to Sparkling Logic, the company that Forgy joined as investor and strategic advisor, as the inference engine of the SMARTS product.

He was born in Hurworth, near Darlington, where his father, Dudley Emerson, also a mathematician, taught a school.  Biography  William himself had a small estate in Weardale called Castle Gate situated not far from Eastgate where he would repair to work throughout the summer on projects as disparate as stonemasonry and watchmaking. Unsuccessful as a teacher, he devoted himself entirely to studious retirement. Possessed of remarkable energy and forthrightness of speech, Emerson published many works which are singularly free from errata. In The Principles of Mechanics (1754) he shows a wind- powered vehicle in which the vertically mounted propeller gives direct power to the front wheels via a system of cogs. In mechanics he never advanced a proposition which he had not previously tested in practice, nor published an invention without first proving its effects by a model. He was skilled in the science of music, the theory of sounds, and the ancient and modern scales; but he never attained any excellence as a performer. He died on 20 May 1782 at his native village, where his gravestone bears epitaphs in Latin and Hebrew. Emerson dressed in old clothes and his manners were uncouth. He wore his shirt back to front and his legs wrapped in sacking so as not to scorch them as he sat over the fire. He declined an offer to become FRS because it would cost too much after all the expense of farthing candles he had been put to in the course of his life of study. Emerson rode regularly into Darlington on a horse like Don Quixote's, led by a hired small boy. In old age, plagued by the stone, he would alternately pray and curse, wishing his soul 'could shake off the rags of mortality without such a clitter-me-clatter.' Like his fellow County Durham savant John Bird, Emerson makes an appearance in Mason and Dixon by Thomas Pynchon.

It publishes a print edition four days a week on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during the academic year, and twice a week during the summer. Established in 1871, The Daily Californian is one of the oldest newspapers on the West Coast, and one of the oldest college newspapers in the United States. Current circulation is about 10,000 for a campus of roughly 35,000 students.  History  The Daily Californian became independent from UC Berkeley in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors over an editorial that encouraged readers to \\"take back\\" People's Park. Both sides came to an agreement, and The Daily Californian gained financial and editorial independence from the university and is now published by an independent corporation called the Independent Berkeley Students Publishing Company, Inc. The paper licenses its name from the Regents of the University of California. On November 24, 1982, three days after the November 20th Big Game (now known for The Play), early morning readers of the Daily Cal were chagrined to find in the headline of the front page: \\"NCAA Awards Big Game to Stanford.\\" Hundreds of copies of the Daily Cal with this fake headline had been strewn about campus in the wee hours. This was in fact a hoax perpetrated by aggrieved Stanford fans. A Daily Cal rack on the UC Berkeley campus The Daily Californian has a history of publishing spirited editorials, and in some cases editions containing controversial editorials have been subjected to newspaper theft. In 2002, Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates agreed to pay restitution after admitting to having thrown away a thousand copies of The Daily Californian after it endorsed his opponent, then-Mayor Shirley Dean. In May 2003, nearly 5,000 papers were stolen by students protesting coverage of the arrest of a Cal football player. The largest act of theft took place in November 1996 when the paper's senior editorial board endorsed Proposition 209. Nearly 23,000 papers were stolen on Election Day 1996, and in the following days copies of the paper were tossed off the balcony of the newspaper's office and burned in effigy. As a way to repair relations with campus community members angered by the publication of the editorial endorsing Proposition 209, editors at the Daily Cal established the nation's first regular college newspaper sex column. The column, now known colloquially as \\"Sex on Tuesday,\\" led to college papers across the country to create similar sex columns. On October 16, 2006, the Daily Cal launched its first blog, The Daily Clog, a student-life blog that accumulates various tidbits about Berkeley and college life. On August 25, 2008, the Daily Cal announced that it would no longer print a paper version of the newspaper on Wednesdays amidst a decline in advertising revenues and higher newspaper costs.  The Daily Californian Alumni Association  More than 400 former The Daily Californian staffers have joined The Daily Californian Alumni Association (DCAA) since its resurrection in August 1996. A unit of The Daily Californian Education Foundation, the DCAA exists to bring alumni of the newspaper together as well as to provide mentorship and financial support to the current student staff. The DCAA is one of the largest and most active alumni associations of any college newspaper. A chartered club of the California Alumni Association, the Daily Californian Alumni Association holds regular reunions and receptions across the country. Alumni are established and leading journalists in such news organizations as The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, People magazine, The Arizona Republic, The San Francisco Chronicle, Sports Illustrated, NBC News, USA Today and The Washington Post. Membership is open to all former staff members of The Daily Californian or student publications office staff (pre 1971).

A popular tourist destination, Sorrento is located on the Amalfi Coast at the south-eastern terminus of the Circumvesuviana rail line, within easy access from Naples and Pompeii. The town is widely known for its small ceramics, lacework and marquetry (woodwork) shops. The Sorrentine Peninsula has views of Naples, Vesuvius and the Isle of Capri. The Amalfi Drive, connecting Sorrento and Amalfi, is a narrow road along the high cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea. Ferries and hydrofoils connect the town to Naples, Amalfi, Positano, Capri and Ischia. Sorrento's sea cliffs. Limoncello, a digestif made from lemon rinds, alcohol, water and sugar, is produced in Sorrento along with citrus fruit, wine, nuts and olives. History =Roman and Greek origins= The Roman name for Sorrento was . Legends indicate a close connection between Lipara and Surrentum, as though the latter had been a colony of the former; and even through the Imperial period Surrentum remained largely Greek. The oldest ruins are Oscan, dating from about 600 BC. Before its control by the Roman Republic, Surrentum was one of the towns subject to Nuceria, and shared its fortunes up to the Social War; it seems to have joined in the revolt of 90 BC like Stabiae; and was reduced to obedience in the following year, when it seems to have received a colony. Numerous sepulchral inscriptions of Imperial slaves and freedmen have been found at Surrentum. An inscription shows that Titus in the year after the earthquake of 79 AD restored the horologium (clock) of the town and its architectural decoration. A similar restoration of an unknown building in Naples in the same year is recorded in an inscription from the last-named town. The most important temples of Surrentum were those of Athena and of the Sirens (the latter the only one in the Greek world in historic times); the former gave its name to the promontory. In antiquity, Surrentum was famous for its wine (oranges and lemons which are now widely cultivated there were not yet introduced in Italy in antiquity), its fish, and its red Campanian vases; the discovery of coins of Massilia, Gaul, and the Balearic Islands here indicates the extensive trade which it carried on. Vintage near Sorrento, Jacob Philipp Hackert, c. 1784. The position of Surrentum was very secure, protected by deep gorges. The only exception to its natural protection was on the south-west where it was defended by walls, the line of which is necessarily followed by those of the modern town. The arrangement of the modern streets preserves that of the ancient town, and the disposition of the walled paths which divide the plain to the east seems to date in like manner from Roman times. No ruins are now preserved in the town itself, but there are many remains in the villa quarter to the east of the town on the road to Stabiae, of which traces still exist, running much higher than the modern road, across the mountain; the site of one of the largest (possibly belonging to the Imperial house) is now occupied by the Hotel Victoria, under the terrace of which a small theatre was found in 1855; an ancient rock-cut tunnel descends hence to the shore. Remains of other villas may be seen, but the most important ruin is the reservoir of the (subterranean) aqueducts just outside the town on the east, which had no less than twenty-seven chambers each about . Greek and Oscan tombs have also been found. Another suburb lay below the town and on the promontory on the west of it; under the Hotel Sirena are substructions and a rock-hewn tunnel. To the north-west on the Capo di Sorrento is another villa, the so-called Bagni della Regina Giovanna, with baths, and in the bay to the south-west was the villa of Pollius Felix, the friend of Statius, which he describes in Silvae ii. 2, of which remains still exist. Farther west again are villas, as far as the temple of Athena on the promontory named after her at the extremity of the peninsula (now Punta Campanella). Neither of this nor of the famous temple of the Sirens are any traces existing. According to the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, Sorrento was founded by Liparus, son of Ausonus, who was king of the Ausoni and the son of Ulysses and Circe. The ancient city was probably connected to the Ausoni tribe, one of the most ancient ethnic groups in the area. In the pre-Roman age Sorrento was influenced by the Greek civilization: this can be seen in its plant and in the presence of the Athenaion, a great sanctuary, also, according to the legend, founded by Ulysses and originally devoted to the cult of the Sirens, hence Sorrento's name. =Middle Ages and modern era= View of Sorrento from above the harbour Sorrento became an archbishopric around 420 AD. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by the Ostrogoths and then returned to the Eastern Empire. The Lombards, who conquered much of southern Italy in the second half of the 6th century, besieged it in vain. In the following centuries the authority of the distant Empire of Byzantium faded; initially part of the substantially independent Duchy of Naples, later Sorrento became in turn an autonomous duchy in the 9th century. It fought against neighbouring/rival Amalfi, the Saracens and the nearby Lombardic duchies, such as that of Benevento, whose forces besieged it in 839, although Sorrento was able to resist with Neapolitan help. Sorrentine forces took part in the anti-Saracen leagues at the battles of Licosa (846) and Ostia (849). The duchy was ruled by figures elected by the people, which received honorary titles from the Byzantine Emperor. In 1035 the city was acquired by Guaimar IV of Salerno, who gave it to his brother Guy. After a brief return under the Duchy of Naples, it returned in Lombard hands with Gisulf II of Salerno; when the latter was defeated by Robert Guiscard, Sorrento entered the Norman sphere of influence: any residual independence was ended in 1137 when it was conquered by Roger II of Sicily, and annexed to the Kingdom of Sicily. On 13 June 1558 it was sacked by elements of the Ottoman navy under the command of Dragut and his lieutenant Piali, as part of the struggle between the Turks and Spain, which controlled the southern half of Italy at that time. 2,000 captives were reportedly taken away. This struggle was waged throughout the Mediterranean and lasted many decades. The attackers were not \\"pirates\\" as often characterised, though some may have been mercenaries from North Africa. The campaigns were conducted on the direct orders of Sultan Suleiman. The attack led to the construction of a new line of walls. The most striking event of the following century was the revolt against Spanish domination of 1648, led by Giovanni Grillo. In 1656 a plague struck the city. However, Sorrento remained one of the most important centres of southern Campania. Piazza Tasso. Sorrento entered into the Neapolitan Republic of 1799, but in vain. In the 19th century the economy of the city improved markedly, favoured by the development of agriculture, tourism and trade. A route connecting Sorrento to Castellammare di Stabia was opened under the reign of Ferdinand II (1830‚Äì1859). In 1861 Sorrento was officially annexed to the new Kingdom of Italy. In the following years it confirmed and increased its status of one of the most renowned tourist destinations of Italy, a trend which continued into the 20th century. Famous people who visited it include Lord Byron, Keats, Goethe, Henrik Ibsen and Walter Scott. Rites of Holy week The two main processions that take place in Sorrento on Good Friday are the Procession of Our Lady of Sorrows (or the \\"Visit in the Sepulchres\\"), organised by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of Saint Monica and the Procession of the Crucified Christ, organised by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of the Death. The first procession takes place at 3:30 a.m. on Holy (Maundy) Thursday and involves hundreds of participants dressed in hooded white gowns. The Madonna is carried aloft in the procession and is accompanied by several religious articles as she searches the town looking for her son. The procession starts in Corso Italia, turns through Piazza Tasso, and then visits each of the town's churches‚Äîstopping in each one for a short ceremony. The Madonna is accompanied by aides carrying incense, and a large male choir and band. The procession concludes at 5:30 a.m. The second procession occurs at 8 p.m. on Good Friday and reflects the Madonna's mourning as she finds her son dead. Hundreds of participants, dressed this time in hooded black gowns, march down Corso Italia and then wind through the smaller lanes of Sorrento. This second procession is much larger and better attended. Geography = Climate = Sorrento experiences a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mild climate and fertility of the Gulf of Naples made the region famous during Roman times, when emperors such as Claudius and Tiberius holidayed nearby. Temperatures can get as high as in April, as happened in 2013. Culture View of Vesuvius from Sorrento Sorrento has been visited by Lord Byron, John Keats, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Charles Dickens, Richard Wagner, Henrik Ibsen, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Sorrento was the birthplace of the poet Torquato Tasso, author of the Gerusalemme Liberata. The town was featured in the early 20th century song \\"Torna a Surriento\\" (Come Back to Sorrento) with lyrics by Giambattista De Curtis, brother of the song's composer, Ernesto De Curtis. In the 1920s, famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky lived in Sorrento. Songs that have featured Surrento prominently have included \\"Torna a Surriento\\" and \\"Caruso\\", a song composed in Sorrento, in the summer of 1985, by the Bolognese singer- songwriter Lucio Dalla, whose fifty-years ties with Sorrento are described in the novel by the Sorrentine writer, Raffaele Lauro, titled \\"Caruso The Song - Lucio Dalla and Sorrento\\", which was released in December 2014.

Early life Bell was born in County Durham in 1938, the son of a miner. He studied at the Hookergate Grammar School on School Lane in High Spen near Rowlands Gill, Gateshead. He later attended the Durham Pitmans College. He joined the Labour Party in 1964, and was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1970. He worked as an international lawyer in Paris until 1977, representing large multi-national companies. He contested Hexham at the 1979 general election, but was defeated by the Conservative MP and former Cabinet Minister Geoffrey Rippon. Parliamentary career Bell was elected to the City Council of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1980. In 1982, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Arthur Bottomley announced that he would step down at the next general election; Bell won the subsequent selection process to fight the seat at the 1983 general election. Bell comfortably held the seat, elected with a majority just short of 10,000 votes. At Westminster, Bell became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Roy Hattersley in 1983. He was promoted to the shadow frontbench in 1984 by Neil Kinnock as a Spokesman for Northern Ireland. However, he chose to resign his post after the Cleveland child abuse scandal which occupied two years of his life, after making unsubstantiated accusations of 'clinical error' against local paediatricians and child sexual abuse specialists. The paediatricians, Dr. Marietta Higgs and Dr. Geoffrey Wyatt, were later absolved and their forensic clinical work validated at a committee of inquiry overseen by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. After the 1992 general election and the election of John Smith as the Leader of the Labour Party, Bell returned to the shadow frontbenches as a spokesman for Trade and Industry. After the election of the Labour Government at the 1997 general election he was dropped from Labour's frontbench, but was appointed on the advice of Tony Blair as the Second Church Estates Commissioner, the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons, a position he held from 1997 to 2010. From 2000 to 2005 he was the Chairman of the Finance and Services Committee, which manages the annual budget of the House of Commons and its many employees. In 2005 he became a member of the Finance and Services Committee until 2008 when he served as chairman until 2010. Relatedly, from 2000 until 2010 he was a member of the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the administration of the House and the Members Estimate Committee that sets MPs' pay and pensions. He was a member of the Liaison Committee between 2000‚Äì10. He was a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee from 1997. Bell sat on the Members Estimates Committee at Parliament and was heavily involved representing MPs' interests in the MPs' expenses scandal of 2009. He was a member in Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority between 2009‚Äì10. A founder member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, he was a Treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Promotion of First Past the Post. and was Secretary of the Franco-British Parliamentary Relations Committee in the Commons. In February 2010 Bell was played by David Calder in the television film On Expenses. Criticism and controversy On 13 October 2009, he claimed on the BBC Today programme that the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal was marked by \\"retrospectivity\\", as Sir Thomas had changed the rules on expenses after MPs' claims had been submitted.\\"MPs' grievance over expenses letters\\" , BBC News, 13 October 2009. Stuart Bell featured in a film of the 2010 general election entitled ToryBoy The Movie made by John Walsh, which explored the candidate's selection process and the work that goes into an election campaign. Later in 2011, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper Teesside Gazette, asked \\"Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?\\" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office over three months. The Gazette story was picked up by national newspapers.

Laser cooling techniques rely on the fact that when an object (usually an atom) absorbs and re-emits a photon (a particle of light) its momentum changes. For an ensemble of particles, their thermodynamic temperature is proportional to the variance in their velocity. That is, more homogeneous velocities among particles corresponds to a lower temperature. Laser cooling techniques combine atomic spectroscopy with the aforementioned mechanical effect of light to compress the velocity distribution of an ensemble of particles, thereby cooling the particles. thumbupright200pxSimplified principle of Doppler laser cooling: { !valign=\\"top\\"1 A stationary atom sees the laser neither red- nor blue- shifted and does not absorb the photon. - !valign=\\"top\\"2 An atom moving away from the laser sees it red-shifted and does not absorb the photon. - !valign=\\"top\\"3.1 An atom moving towards the laser sees it blue-shifted and absorbs the photon, slowing the atom. - !valign=\\"top\\"3.2 The photon excites the atom, moving an electron to a higher quantum state. - !valign=\\"top\\"3.3 The atom re-emits a photon. As its direction is random, there is no net change in momentum over many absorption-emission cycles. } The first example of laser cooling, and also still the most common method (so much so that it is still often referred to simply as 'laser cooling') is Doppler cooling. Other methods of laser cooling include: * Sisyphus coolingLaser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms Nobel Lecture by William D. Phillips, Dec 8, 1997: * Resolved sideband cooling * Raman sideband cooling * Velocity selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT) * Gray molasses * Cavity mediated cooling * Use of a Zeeman slower * Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling  History  = Early attempts = At the advent of laser cooling techniques, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force (radiation pressure), however it wasn't until the turn of the twentieth century when studies by Lebedev (1901), Nichols (1901), and Hull (1903) experimentally demonstrated that force. Following that period, in 1933, Frisch exemplified the pressure exerted on atoms by light. Starting in the early 1970s, lasers were then utilized to further explore atom manipulation. The introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as the advent of laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s. Laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups: H√§nsch and Schawlow, and Wineland and Dehmelt. They both outlined a process of slowing heat-based velocity in atoms by \\"radiative forces.\\" In the paper by H√§nsch and Schawlow, the effect of radiation pressure on any object that reflects light is described. That concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas. These early proposals for laser cooling only relied on \\"scattering force\\", the name for the radiation pressure. In later proposals, laser trapping, a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force, would be introduced. In the late 70s, Ashkin described how radiation forces can be used to both optically trap atoms and simultaneously cool them. He emphasized how this process could allow for long spectroscopic measurements without the atoms escaping the trap and proposed the overlapping of optical traps in order to study interactions between different atoms. Closely following Ashkin's letter in 1978, two research groups: Wineland, Drullinger and Walls, and Neuhauser, Hohenstatt, Toscheck and Dehmelt further refined that work. In specific, Wineland, Drullinger, and Walls were concerned with the improvement of spectroscopy. The group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure. They cite a precedence for using radiation pressure in optical traps, yet criticize the ineffectiveness of previous models due to the presence of the Doppler effect. In an effort to lessen the effect, they applied an alternative take on cooling magnesium ions below the room temperature precedent. Using the electromagnetic trap to contain the magnesium ions, they bombarded them with a laser barely out of phase from the resonant frequency of the atoms. The research from both groups served to illustrate the mechanical properties of light. Around this time, laser cooling techniques had allowed for temperatures lowered to around 40 kelvins. = Modern advancements = William Phillips was influenced by the Wineland paper and attempted to mimic it, using neutral atoms instead of ions. In 1982, he published the first paper outlining the cooling of neutral atoms. The process he used is now known as the Zeeman slower and became one of the standard techniques for slowing an atomic beam. Now, temperatures around 240 microkelvins were reached. That threshold was the lowest researchers thought was possible. When temperatures then reached 43 microkelvins in an experiment by Steven Chu, the new low was explained by the addition of more atomic states in combination to laser polarization. Previous conceptions of laser cooling were decided to have been too simplistic. The major breakthroughs in the 70s and 80s in the use of laser light for cooling led to several improvements to preexisting technology and new discoveries with temperatures just above absolute zero. The cooling processes were utilized to make atomic clocks more accurate and to improve spectroscopic measurements, and led to the observation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures. The new state of matter, the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate, was observed in 1995 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle. Doppler cooling The lasers needed for the magneto-optical trapping of rubidium-85: (a) & (b) show the absorption (red detuned to the dotted line) and spontaneous emission cycle, (c) & (d) are forbidden transitions, (e) shows that if a cooling laser excites an atom to the F=3 state, it is allowed to decay to the \\"dark\\" lower hyperfine, F=2 state, which would stop the cooling process, if it were not for the repumper laser (f). Doppler cooling, which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap, is by far the most common method of laser cooling. It is used to cool low density gases down to the Doppler cooling limit, which for rubidium-85 is around 150 microkelvins. In Doppler cooling, initially, the frequency of light is tuned slightly below an electronic transition in the atom. Because the light is detuned to the \\"red\\" (i.e., at lower frequency) of the transition, the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source, due to the Doppler effect. Thus if one applies light from two opposite directions, the atoms will always scatter more photons from the laser beam pointing opposite to their direction of motion. In each scattering event the atom loses a momentum equal to the momentum of the photon. If the atom, which is now in the excited state, then emits a photon spontaneously, it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum, but in a random direction. Since the initial momentum change was a pure loss (opposing the direction of motion), while the subsequent change was random (i.e., not pure gain), the overall result of the absorption and emission process is to reduce the momentum of the atom, therefore its speed-- provided its initial speed was larger than the recoil speed from scattering a single photon. If the absorption and emission are repeated many times, the average speed, and therefore the kinetic energy of the atom, will be reduced. Since the temperature of a group of atoms is a measure of the average random internal kinetic energy, this is equivalent to cooling the atoms. Uses Laser cooling is primarily used to create ultracold atoms for experiments in quantum physics. These experiments are performed near absolute zero where unique quantum effects such as Bose-Einstein condensation can be observed. Laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms, but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems. In 2010, a team at Yale successfully laser-cooled a diatomic molecule. In 2007, an MIT team successfully laser-cooled a macro-scale (1 gram) object to 0.8 K.Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2007, April 8). Laser-cooling Brings Large Object Near Absolute Zero.

The Lamanites also play a role in the prophecies and revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants, another sacred text in the Latter Day Saint movement. In the Book of Mormon‚Äôs narrative, the Lamanites began as wicked rivals to the more righteous Nephites, but when the Nephite civilization became decadent, it lost divine favor and was destroyed by the Lamanites. Latter Day Saints have historically associated Lamanites with present-day Native American cultures.Terryl L. Givens, By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 146-147. Book of Mormon narrative According to the Book of Mormon, the family of Lehi, described as a wealthy Hebrew prophet; the family of Ishmael; and Zoram traveled from the Middle East to the Americas by boat in around 600 BC. Some time after the death of Lehi in the Americas, Nephi, a son of Lehi, was concerned that his brothers, Laman and Lemuel, were plotting to kill him and so he, his family, and his followers left and went into the wilderness. The followers of Nephi called themselves \\"Nephites\\" and referred to others as \\"Lamanites,\\" after Laman, Nephi's eldest brother. After the two groups separated from each other, the rebellious Lamanites were cursed and \\"cut off from the presence of the Lord.\\" They received a \\"skin of blackness\\" so they would \\"not be enticing\\" to the Nephites.Hugh Nibley, Lehi in the Desert (1950): 73‚Äì74. The Book of Mormon describes the animosity that the Lamanites held: > Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the > iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by > their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea; and > again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, > after they had crossed the sea. (Mosiah 10:12‚Äì13) The Book of Mormon also recounts that the Lamanites felt that they were wronged specifically by Nephi and so swore vengeance against his descendants: > [the Lamanites] were wroth with him [Nephi] because he departed into the > wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were > engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them. And thus > they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they > should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all > they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards > the children of Nephi. (Mosiah 10:16‚Äì17) After the two groups warred for centuries, the narrative states that Jesus Christ appeared to the more righteous Nephites and the Lamanites, who, by then, had converted in large numbers to righteousness before God. Soon after his visit, the Lamanites and Nephites merged into one nation and co-existed for two centuries in peace. The Book of Mormon further recounts, \\"There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\\" However, 84 years after the coming of Christ, \\"a small part of the people who had revolted from the church\\" started calling themselves Lamanites again. Those who remained were again identified as Nephites, but both groups were reported to have fallen into apostasy. The Book of Mormon recounts a series of large battles over two centuries, ending with the extermination of the Nephites by the Lamanites. Doctrine and Covenants The Doctrine and Covenants is composed of writings that adherents in the Latter Day Saint movement believe to be revelations from God. It is considered scripture in the sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement and says that God called Oliver Cowdery (D&C; 28:8) and later Peter Whitmer and Parley P. Pratt (D&C; 32:1‚Äì2) to teach the gospel to the Lamanites. Cowdery is given the power to build up God's church among them (D&C; 30:6). The men believed that God was referring to the Native Americans and began teaching among the Lenape. The Doctrine and Covenants also contains a prophecy that the Lamanites will \\"blossom as a rose\\" (D&C; 49:24) and that the city of Zion would be built on the borders by the Lamanites (D&C; 28:9), which was later identified as Missouri (D&C; 54:8). Proposed modern descendants Joseph Smith preaching to the Sac and Fox Indians who visited Nauvoo, Illinois, on August 12, 1841. Historically, Mormons have identified the Lamanites as the primary ancestors of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some publications of the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) have accepted that position.Lane Johnson, \\"Who and Where Are the Lamanites?\\", Ensign, December 1975, p. 15.Book of Mormon (LDS Church edition), \\"Introduction\\" In the 21st century, Mormon scholars who favor a limited geography model have disclaimed a primary genetic connection between the Lamanites and indigenous American peoples. However, the matter remains unsettled while the field of DNA ancestry continues to develop, and many Latter Day Saints believe that the Lamanites comprise some part, if not the primary origin, of Native Americans by stating that the Lamanites \\"are among the ancestors of the American Indians.\\" Prior to 2007, the non-canonical introduction to the Book of Mormon stated that the Lamanites were the \\"principal ancestors of the American Indians.\\" However, the church has stated, \\"Nothing in the Book of Mormon precludes migration into the Americas by peoples of Asiatic origin.\\" The non-canonical introduction to the 1981 LDS Church edition of the Book of Mormon states that \\"the Lamanites are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.\\"\\"Introduction,\\" Book of Mormon (LDS Church edition), 1981. The wording was changed in the 2006 Doubleday edition and the subsequent editions published by the LDS Church, to state only that the Lamanites \\"are among the ancestors of the American Indians.\\"\\"Introduction\\", Book of Mormon (LDS Church edition), online version. Many Latter Day Saints also consider Polynesian peoples and the other indigenous peoples of the Americas to be Lamanites.Spencer W. Kimball, \\"Of Royal Blood,\\" Ensign, July 1971, p. 7.\\"The Church in the Lamanite World: Scanning the Special Programs Created to Meet Lamanite Needs,\\" Ensign, December 1975, pp. 16, 20‚Äì24. A 1971 church magazine article claimed that Lamanites \\"consist of the Indians of all the Americas as well as the islanders of the Pacific.\\"\\"The Lamanites (Introduction),\\" Ensign, July 1971, p. 5. The existence of a Lamanite nation has received no support in mainstream science or archaeology. Genetic studies indicate that the indigenous Americans are related to the present populations in Mongolia, Siberia, and the vicinity,M. Raghavan et al., \\"Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans,\\" Nature, (July 2013) and Polynesians to those in Southeast Asia. Some Mormon scholars now view Lamanites as (1) one small tribe among many in the ancient Americas, the remainder of which are not discussed in the Book of Mormon, (2) a tribe that intermarried with indigenous Native Americans, or (3) a tribe that descended with modern Asians from common nomadic ancestry but diverged before Lehi's departure from Jerusalem. Impact on views on race Member of the Shivwits Band of Paiutes, in 1875, being baptized by Mormon missionaries. In the Book of Mormon, Lamanites are described as having received a \\"skin of blackness\\" to distinguish them from the Nephites. The \\"change\\" in skin color is often mentioned in conjunction with God's curse on the descendants of Laman for their wickedness and corruption: \\"And he had caused the cursing to come upon [the Lamanites], yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, and they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them\\" (2 Nephi 5:21). On the other hand, the Book of Mormon teaches that skin color is not a bar to salvation and that God \\"denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.\\" Elsewhere, the book condemns prejudice against people of dark skin: \\"O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God. Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness.\\" The non-canonical 1981 footnote text of the Book of Mormon closely linked the concept of \\"skin of blackness\\" with that of \\"scales of darkness falling from their eyes,\\" which suggests that the LDS Church has now interpreted both cases as being examples of figurative language.Marvin Perkins, \\"How to Reach African-Americans\\" , ldsgenesisgroup.org. Several Book of Mormon passages have been interpreted by some Latter Day Saints as indicating that Lamanites would revert to a lighter skin tone upon accepting the gospel. For example, at a 1960 LDS Church General Conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that the skin of Latter-day Saint Native American was gradually turning lighter: That view was buoyed by passages such as 2 Nephi 30:6, which in early editions of the Book of Mormon, read: \\"[T]heir scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and a delightsome people.\\" In 1840, with the third edition of the Book of Mormon, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, who adherents believe translated the writings of ancient prophets to become the Book of Mormon, changed the wording to \\"a pure and a delightsome people,\\" consistent with contemporary interpretation of the term \\"white\\" as used in scripture.\\"White ,\\" Def. 6, Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language (1828): \\"In a scriptural sense, purified from sin; sanctified. Psalm 51.\\" However, all future LDS Church printings of the Book of Mormon until 1981 continued from the second edition, saying the Lamanites would become \\"a white and delightsome people.\\"The 1841 and 1849 European editions (printed by the Twelve Apostles) were the Kirtland second edition with British spellings. Future LDS editions continued from the European editions until a major reworking in 1981, which adopted Smith's 1840 edit. See Eventually in the Book of Mormon narrative, the labels \\"Nephite\\" and \\"Lamanite\\" became terms of political convenience, and membership was both varied and fluid and not based on skin color. Within the first 200 years of the Nephites' 1,000 year chronology, the prophet Jacob stated that any who were enemies of his people were called Lamanites and that any who were friends were called Nephites: \\"But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.\\" =Book of Mormon chapter summaries= In December 2010, the LDS Church made changes to the non-canonical chapter summaries and to some of the footnotes in its online version of the Book of Mormon. In Second Nephi 5, the original wording was the following: \\"Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cursed, receive a skin of blackness, and become a scourge unto the Nephites.\\" The phrase \\"skin of blackness\\" and the passage was changed to \\"Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from the presence of the Lord, are cursed, and become a scourge unto the Nephites.\\"Fletcher Stack, Peggy. \\"Church removes racial references in Book of Mormon headings\\" , Salt Lake Tribune 2010-12-16. The second change appears in the summary of Mormon 5. Formerly, it included the phrase that \\"the Lamanites shall be a dark, filthy, and loathsome people.\\" The new version deleted the phrase \\"dark, loathsome, and filthy\\" and now reads \\"the Lamanites will be scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with them.\\" The changes are seen by some critics to be another step in the evolution of the text of the Book of Mormon to delete racist language from it. On the other hand, some believers in the Book of Mormon, such as Marvin Perkins, see the changes as better conforming the chapter headers and footnotes to the meaning of the text in light of the LDS Church's 1978 Revelation on Priesthood.Marvin Perkins, \\"Changes To LDS Scripture Headings & Footnotes\\" , blacklds.org, 2011-02-07. In an interview, a former Brigham Young University graduate student suggested that the changes were made for \\"clarity, a change in emphasis and to stick closer to the scriptural language\\".

The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain rescue; ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs; urban search and rescue in cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water. International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) is a UN organization that promotes the exchange of information between national urban search and rescue organizations. The duty to render assistance is covered by Article 98 of the UNCLOS. Definitions There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved and country in question. *Canadian Forces: \\"Search and Rescue comprises the search for, and provision of aid to, persons, ships or other craft which are, or are feared to be, in distress or imminent danger.\\" *United States Coast Guard: \\"The use of available resources to assist persons or property in potential or actual distress.\\" *United States Defense Department: A search is \\"an operation normally coordinated by a Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) or rescue sub- center, using available personnel and facilities to locate persons in distress\\" and rescue is \\"an operation to retrieve persons in distress, provide for their initial medical or other needs, and deliver them to a place of safety\\". History One of the world's earliest well-documented SAR efforts ensued following the 1656 wreck of the Dutch merchant ship Vergulde Draeck off the west coast of Australia. Survivors sought help, and in response three separate SAR missions were conducted, without success.Major, R. H. (editor) (1859) Early Voyages to Terra Australis, Now Called Australia, The Hakluyt Society, London (2001 facsimile edition on Google Books) On 29 November 1945, a Sikorsky R-5 performed the first civilian helicopter rescue operation in history, with Sikorsky's chief pilot Dmitry \\"Jimmy\\" Viner in the cockpit, using an experimental hoist developed jointly by Sikorsky and Breeze. All 5 crew members of an oil barge, which had run aground on Penfield Reef, were saved before the barge sank.Chen, C. Peter (editor), World War II Database , retrieved 8 July 2015 In 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 with 269 occupants was shot down by a Soviet aircraft near Sakhalin. The Soviets sent SAR helicopters and boats to Soviet waters, while a search and rescue operation was initiated by U.S., South Korean, and Japanese ships and aircraft in international waters, but no survivors were found. Rear Admiral Walter T. Piotti (Photo [7]), Commander of Task Force 71 of U.S. 7th Fleet, stated in his After Action Report (Department of the Navy, Commander, Surface Combat Force Seventh Fleet. CTF75/N32:kpm,4730,Ser 011, 15 November 1983) In July 2009, Air France Flight 447 was lost in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. An international SAR effort was launched, to no avail. A third effort nearly two years later discovered the crash site and recovered the flight recorders. In early 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 crashed under mysterious circumstances. Many nations contributed to the initial SAR effort, which was fruitless. In June 2014, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau commissioned the MV Fugro Equator to lead a three-month survey of the ocean bed, for which it had budgeted $60mn; at the same time, Malaysia announced it had spent $9.3mn to date on fuel and food in its own effort. The search for Flight 370 has become the largest SAR so far with the largest budget. Types of search and rescue Rescue rope training Search and Rescue students give the \\"I am all right\\" signal to let the SAR instructors know that they are ready for further instructions at the pool on board Naval Station San Diego. =Ground (Lowland) search and rescue= Ground search and rescue is the search for persons who are lost or in distress on land or inland waterways. People may go missing for a variety of reasons. Some may disappear voluntarily, due to issues like domestic abuse. Others disappear for involuntary reasons such as mental illness, getting lost, an accident, death in a location where they cannot be found or, less commonly, due to abduction. Ground search and rescue missions that occur in urban areas should not be confused with \\"urban search and rescue\\", which in many jurisdictions refers to the location and extraction of people from collapsed buildings or other entrapments. In most countries, the police are the primary agency for carrying out searches for a missing person on land. Some places have voluntary search and rescue teams that can be called out to assist these searches. =Mountain rescue= Mountain rescue relates to search and rescue operations specifically in rugged and mountainous terrain. =Cave rescue= Cave rescue is a highly specialized form of rescue for rescuing injured, trapped or lost cave explorers. =Urban search and rescue= Urban search and rescue (US&R; or USAR), also referred to as Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR), is the location and rescue of persons from collapsed buildings or other urban and industrial entrapments. Due to the specialized nature of the work, most teams are multi-disciplinary and include personnel from police, fire and emergency medical services. Unlike traditional ground search and rescue workers, most US&R; responders also have basic training in structural collapse and the dangers associated with live electrical wires, broken natural gas lines and other hazards. While earthquakes have traditionally been the cause of US&R; operations, terrorist attacks and extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes have also resulted in the deployment of these resources. =Combat search and rescue= Combat search and rescue (CSAR) is search and rescue operations that are carried out during war that are within or near combat zones. =Maritime search and rescue= US Navy rescue swimmer swims toward a stranded boat near Guam in 2019 Maritime search and rescue is carried out at sea to save sailors and passengers in distress, or the survivors of downed aircraft. The type of agency which carries out maritime search and rescue varies by country; it may variously be the coast guard, navy or voluntary organizations. When a distressed or missing vessel is located, these organizations deploy helicopters, rescue vessels or any other appropriate vessel to return them to land. In some cases, the agencies may carry out an air-sea rescue (ASR). This refers to the combined use of aircraft (such as flying boats, floatplanes, amphibious helicopters and non-amphibious helicopters equipped with hoists) and surface vessels.Algeo, John.

By nation =Australia= A rescue air crewman aboard Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service Lifesaver 1 in action. ;National The Australian search and rescue service is provided by three authorities; the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the State/Territory Police Jurisdictions. Basically the JRCC respond to national and international registered aircraft, off shore marine incidents and beacon activations. The ADF are responsible for Australian and foreign military personnel, vehicles, vessels and aircraft while within the Australian SRR. Police are responsible for coastal marine incidents, lost persons, unregistered aircraft, inland waterways, ports and identified beacons. The JRCC operates a 24-hour Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Canberra and is responsible for the national coordination of both maritime and aviation search and rescue. The JRCC is also responsible for the management and operation of the Australian ground segment of the Cospas-Sarsat distress beacon detection system. The JRCC's jurisdiction spans Australia and as well as covering 52.8 million square kilometres of the Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans constituting about 11% of the Earth's surface.Woolner, Derek (June 2008), Policing our ocean domain: establishing an Australian coast guard , Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited, retrieved 31 March 2014 The JRCC is staffed by SAR specialists who have a naval, merchant marine, air force, civil aviation or police service background. The JRCC also coordinates medical evacuations, broadcasts maritime safety information and operates the Australian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP). In coordinating search and rescue missions, the JRCC will call on assistance from organisations as appropriate,The first suggestion made to use helicopters in Australian searches for missing people, sea rescues, and general support during bush-fires, floods, etc. was made in a letter to the editor, written from the Brisbane suburb of Balmoral, and published in the Brisbane Courier- Mail at the end of 1953 (Value of Helicopter, (Letter to the Editor, from \\"Wake Up, Australia\\"), Courier Mail, (Thursday, 31 December 1953), p.2. ) such as the Defence forces, Border Protection Command, trained aviation organisations (Civil SAR Units), emergency medical helicopters, state Police services and trained Air Observers from the State Emergency Service. There are also other organisations, such as the non-profit Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service that is based at a number of sites around Australia and contracted by various authorities to deliver search and rescue services. ;State BSAR searchers at Mount Dom Dom. State Police in many states operate state-based search and rescue squads, such as the Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad, which provides specialist expertise, advice and practical assistance in land search and rescue on most terrain including snow and vertical cliff search and rescue. There are also state-based volunteer search and rescue groups such as the NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue in New South Wales and Bush Search and Rescue Victoria in Victoria. These state-based groups draw searchers from bushwalking, mountaineering and specialist rescue clubs within their State. A few groups respond on horseback as mounted search and rescue. The State Emergency Service is a collection of volunteer-based emergency organisations established in each state or territory which are responsible for many rescue efforts in urban and rural areas and in any rescue that results from flood or storm activity. In rural areas the SES conducts most bush search, vertical and road traffic rescues. In urban areas they assist the police and fire services with USAR. =Azerbaijan= Search and rescue operations in Azerbaijan are managed by the Ministry of Emergency Situations onshore in cooperation with the State Civil Aviation Administration in air and the State Maritime Administration offshore. =Belgium= Search and rescue duties along the Belgian part of the North Sea are executed by the Belgian Air Component.

The Department of National Defence (DND) has overall responsibility for the coordinated search and rescue system. SAR operations are organized by Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC). The JRCC are manned 24 hours a day by SAR Co-ordinators from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces. Authority for the provision of maritime SAR is assigned to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans by the Canada Shipping Act and the Canada Oceans Act. Ground and inland water search and rescue (GSAR) is the responsibility of provinces and territories with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and other police forces coordinating operations, often using volunteer GSAR teams operating in specific areas under provincial coordinating bodies. The Canada Shipping Act, most recently passed in 2001, is the framework document that funds international SAR activities.justice.gc.ca: \\"Canada Shipping Act, 2001 - S.C. 2001, c. 26\\" (s29), retrieved 31 May 2014 The Canadian Forces have five assigned SAR squadrons: *103 Search and Rescue Squadron, CFB Gander, CH-149 Cormorant *413 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Greenwood, CH-149 Cormorant & CC-130 Hercules *424 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Trenton, CH-146 Griffon & CC-130 Hercules *435 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Winnipeg, CC-130 Hercules *442 Transport and Rescue Squadron, CFB Comox, CH-149 Cormorant & CC-115 Buffalo Plus three Combat Support Squadrons with SAR roles: *417 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Cold Lake, CH-146 Griffon *439 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Bagotville, CH-146 Griffon *444 Combat Support Squadron, CFB Goose Bay, CH-146 Griffon Some municipalities and provinces have their own SAR units: * Halton Regional Police Service Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario * Toronto Police Service Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario * Peel Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario and rivers in Peel Region * Ontario Provincial Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Great Lakes (excluding Lake Michigan) and Georgian Bay * Durham Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Ontario and lakes within Durham Region * York Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Lake Simcoe * Niagara Regional Police Marine Unit - using marine craft on Niagara River and Lake Ontario * Vancouver Police Department - using marine craft on waterways around the City of Vancouver * Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (Toronto) - using land base equipment * Brockville Police Service Marine Patrol Unit - using a boat on the St. Lawrence River There are also volunteer non-profit associations that conduct SAR in Canada: * British Columbia, there are 80 community based volunteer Groups in B.C. providing GSAR services within assigned areas in conjunction with Police, ambulance and other agencies.

Internationally the Danish works mainly with Germany, Norway and Sweden. With the two latter, the annual exercises Baltic SAREX and Scan-SAR are conducted. SAR services in Denmark started in 1957 with seven Sikorsky S-55s. Their piston engines produced only and they had limited fuel capacity, so their operational range was short. To increase the operational area, Pembroke twin-engined fixed-wing aircraft were employed for search. These aircraft would localize the distressed person(s) and the S-55s would then rescue them. The SAR service was started for respond to fighter- plane crashes as 79 aircraft crashed, with 62 dead, in the period 1950-1955., but civilian SAR duties are also conducted. In 1962 eight ship-based A√©rospatiale Alouette IIIs were received. These were primarily meant for the ships patrolling the North Atlantic, but also supported the S-55s. In 1964 - 1965 the seven S-55s were replaced with eight Sikorsky S-61A helicopters. This helicopter was originally designed for anti-submarine warfare, but the Danish variant had the heavy dipping sonar equipment removed and extra fuel tanks added, giving the helicopters longer range. In 1977 radar was installed and in 1990 FLIR was added. Further avionics and navigation systems, including GPS, have also been added over time. In 1977 the naval air squadron was re- established as an independent squadron in the navy and had their Alouette IIIs replaced with Westland Lynx helicopters. Their primary operational area was still the North Atlantic, but they continued their support role, although this was reduced with the introduction of the S-61s. In 2006, the first of the S-61s was replaced by one of 14 new AgustaWestland EH101 Merlin helicopters. In 2007 the Danish Defence held a public display in Horsens, to raise awareness about rescue services and maritime safety. Maritime SAR is important because Denmark has a relative long coast line to its land mass. In 2008 the SAR forces in Denmark were equipped with eight EH-101, one or two Lynx, 34 naval home guard vessels and 21 rescue vessels as well as the naval vessels at sea. The EH-101s operate from bases in Aalborg, Skrydstrup and Roskilde. When the sea water temperatures are low a helicopter is also deployed to the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The Lynx operates from Karup. Maritime vessels are spread out through the entire coastline and on islands. The S-61s and EH-101s have a crew of six: Two pilots, a navigator, a flight engineer, a physician and a rescue swimmer. =Estonia= SAR training by the Estonian Border Guard. The Estonian Border Guard (Piirivalve) is the Estonian security authority responsible for the border security. It is the main support organisation for search and rescue missions in Estonia, and operates a small fleet of SAR vessels and helicopters. =Finland= In Finland local rescue services (i.e. fire departments) are responsible for land and inland water SAR, the Border Guard is responsible for maritime areas. These organizations alert and decide on the most suitable response for the location and situation. The country also has several volunteer organizations such as the volunteer fire department (VPK), the Finnish Lifeboat Institution (SMPS) and the Red Cross Finland (SPR). =Germany= DGzRS and a SeaKing helicopter of the German Navy Search and Rescue in German waters is conducted by the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service with air support by the German Navy and the German Air Force. All incoming requests are coordinated by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Bremen. The DGzRS is a non-governmental organization entirely supported by donations. Also the German Coast Guard provide SAR services. Besides the offshore Search And Rescue services, the German Air Force provides 3 SAR Command Posts on a 24/7 basis with the Bell UH-1D Huey. Further, the Technisches Hilfswerk is a key component of the German disaster relief framework. It is, among other things, regularly involved in urban search and rescue efforts abroad. =Hong Kong= Hong Kong GFS AS332 L2 Super Puma SAR helicopter HK GFS EC155 helicopter Royal Air Force Westland Wessex HC2 SAR helicopter off Hong Kong Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force A√©rospatiale SA 360 Dauphin SAR helicopter SAR operations are conducted by the Government Flying Service (GFS) and before 1993 by the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force.

As of 2020, the GFS fleet consists of nine aircraft including: * 2 BAe Jetstream 41 - for aerial SAR surveillance * 7 Airbus Helicopters H175 - for inshore and offshore SAR Other civilian search and rescue units in Hong Kong include: * Civil Aid Service - works in conjunction with the Hong Kong Fire Services Dept and the air support from the Government Flying Service, also provides mountain rescue service * Hong Kong Fire Services/Hong Kong Marine Police - various vessels and rescue divers - with air support from the GFS * Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre is responsible for coordinating other civil agencies in regards to marine SAR operations in waters around Hong Kong * Countryside Volunteer Search Team =Iceland= Icelandic Coast Guard Eurocopter AS-365N Dauphin 2 helicopter The Icelandic Coast Guard is responsible for coordinating all maritime and aviation search and rescue activities in the Icelandic Search and Rescue Region (SRR), that has the size of 1.9 million square kilometres. The Icelandic Coast Guard operates JRCC ICELAND in combination with the Coast Guard's operation centre, the maritime traffic service and the coastal radio stations. If aircraft crash site is located on land the control of the rescue operations is diverted to the Icelandic Police, which is responsible for SAR operations on land. The Icelandic Coast Guard (JRCC ICELAND) is the Cospas- Sarsat SAR Point of Contact. ISAVIA, which operates the Air Traffic Control in Iceland, is responsible for the aviation alerting services. The Icelandic Coast Guard operates maritime patrol aircraft, SAR helicopters and patrol vessels. The Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue (Slysavarnaf√©lagi√∞ Landsbj√∂rg) (ICESAR) is a volunteer organization with about 100 rescue teams located all around the island. ICESAR is a great support to SAR operations both on land and sea. All the rescue teams contain groups of specially trained individuals. A specialized INSARAG External Classification certified rubble rescue squad operates under the Icelandic Association of Search and Rescue. It was the first rescue squad to arrive in Haiti following the earthquake of 2010. =Indonesia= The National Search and Rescue Agency of Indonesia known in Indonesian as Badan Nasional Pencarian dan Pertolongan abbreviated \\"BASARNAS\\", is a government agency responsible for conducting search and rescue duties nationally in Indonesia.

One of the new S-92 helicopters is located at each of the four IRCG bases, with one spare replacement aircraft being rotated between bases. The Irish Coast Guard are launching a tender for a future SAR Aviation Contract, which is one of several tenders for similar services . The Irish Air Corps provide top cover for search and rescue over land or sea and is available for maritime and mountain rescue if needed. The Irish Naval Service frequently assists the other agencies in search and rescue. Its patrol ships at sea and the communications center at Haulbowline maintain a 24-hour watch on all distress frequencies. =Israel= Helicopter of Magen David Adom SAR in Israel is the responsibility of the IDF Home Front Command Search and Rescue (SAR). The unit was established at its current strength in 1984, combining all the specialist units that were involved with SAR until that time. The SAR unit is a rapid mobilization force and has an airborne transport and deployment capability for its personnel and equipment. The unit is composed of reserve personnel, with a regular cadre based at the Bahad 16 Unit training facility. With a focus on urban SAR, the unit operates specialized equipment, including a locally developed device for locating persons trapped under rubble by detecting seismic and acoustic emissions given off by the victims. The SAR unit also uses Search and rescue dogs specially trained to locate people buried under debris.

The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for Air Traffic SAR within Kenya's waterways and aerospace respectively. =Macau= Macau's maritime SAR is conducted by two units: The Macau Marine Department and responsible for maritime SAR within Macau's waterways. The Macau Search and Rescue Coordination Centre is under the Vessel Traffic Control Centre of Macao of the Maritime Administration of Macau. = Malaysia = MMEA's Eurocopter AS365 N3 Dauphin used for SAR and surveillance. For ground rescue, Malaysia has two main SAR units, Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) which reports to the National Security Council and Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department (FRDM) Special Tactical Operation and Rescue Team of Malaysia (STORM) unit. They are usually supported by the jungle experts, the aboriginal police unit; Senoi Praaq, Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) VAT 69 Commando, Malaysian Armed Force special operations force and Malaysian Civil Defence Force. Both SMART and STORM together with other Fire and Rescue Department Special Operations Forces are often involved in international SAR missions. Maritime SAR is the responsibility of Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and FRDM together with support from the Marine Operations Force and the Malaysian Armed Forces. =Malta= The AFM's search and rescue launches Melita I and Melita II have been used for search and rescue operations since 1999. The responsibility for SAR at sea in the Malta Search and Rescue Region falls under the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM). It is carried out by maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters and vessels under the co-ordination, command and control of the Rescue Co- ordination Centre. The AFM, in close collaboration with the US Coast Guard, also runs a Search and Rescue Training Centre for International Students ref> in Maritime SAR Mission Co-ordination and Planning. To date more than 30 foreign students from 15 countries including Albania, Cameroon, Croatia, Equatorial Guinea and Kenya have attended these courses. Malta is also in talks with Libya about enhancing SAR cooperation between the two countries. =Netherlands= SAR responsibility in the Netherlands is held by the Netherlands Coastguard, carried out by vessels and aircraft from various organisations among which mostly the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution, the Dutch Lifeguard Association, the Ministry of Transport and Water Management and the Ministry of Defence (Netherlands). =New Zealand= New Zealand's Search and Rescue Region extends from the South Pole to the southern border of the Honolulu region, including Norfolk, Tonga, Samoa, and Cook Islands. Smaller searches are controlled by the local police, who call on LandSAR for land-based operations, such as for lost hikers known as tramping in New Zealand, and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard for coastal maritime incidents. Larger maritime search and rescue events, as well as reports of overdue aircraft, fall under the control of the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), based in Avalon, which coordinates response from local coastguard, helicopter operators, merchant marine, air force and naval resources. Urban Search and Rescue falls primarily within the domain of the Fire and Emergency New Zealand, particularly the three USAR Taskforce groups based in Palmerston North, Christchurch, and Auckland. These teams draw together numerous specialists and organisations to achieve an integrated multi-agency response. Among those organisations that act in a support capacity for FENZ are Response Teams (NZRTs). These are regional rescue groups of professional volunteers that train to a minimum industry standard of USAR Category 1R (USAR Responder), which is also standard for FENZ firefighters. Response Teams are registered with the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM), and assist their local MCDEM Groups and communities in emergencies to supplement full-time emergency services. Their additional capabilities, which vary among different teams, include: high angle rope rescue, storm response, swift water response, medics, welfare, and rural fire support. Many Response Teams were deployed to assist in the rescue and recovery effort of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Other resources: *Westpac Rescue Helicopter (New Zealand) - charitable organization *New Zealand Land SAR Search Dogs - the official NZ search dogs group providing land search & rescue services under NZ Land SAR, wilderness and avalanche rescue dogs. =Norway= The veteran Norwegian rescue ship Biskop Hvoslef The search and rescue helicopters are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), who fly 12 Westland Sea Kings.

All of the above coordinate closely with each other providing a comprehensive search and rescue service. The Portuguese area of responsibility comprises the Lisbon and Santa Maria Flight Information Regions (FIR). Gendarmerie Search and Rescue Battalion Command Turkey =Poland= A Polish Navy W-3 Sok√≥≈Ç SAR helicopter hoists a crew member In Poland most search and rescue operations are undertaken by the airborne units of the Polish Armed Forces. The Navy currently has the largest SAR fleet of helicopters and also operates a number of small vessels for the purpose of rescuing crewmen of stricken ships. There is also, however a semi- governmental organisation known as the 'Morska S≈Çu≈ºba Poszukiwania i Ratownictwa' (Maritime Search and Rescue Service) which provides the vast majority of seaborne services to vessels in distress; the service is currently (as of 2010) in the process of overhauling and replacing a large portion of its fleet of lifeboats. Other civilian search and rescue units in Poland include: * G√≥rskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, GOPR (Mountain Volunteer Search and Rescue) * Tatrza≈Ñskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, TOPR (Tatra Mountains Volunteer Search and Rescue) * Wodne Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, WOPR (Water Volunteer Search and Rescue) - operating on inland and coastal waters = South Africa = Search and Rescue services are offered by various government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations organisations in South Africa. There is no single organisation responsible for urban, wilderness, swift water, aviation or maritime/sea rescue. Aviation and maritime incidents are the responsibility of the South African Search and Rescue Organization (SASAR). SASAR is a voluntary organization that functions under the auspices of the Department of Transport. Its main role is to search for, assist and carry out rescue operations for the survivors of aircraft or vessel accidents. Depending on the nature of the accident, the RCC's (ARCC or MRCC) coordinate the search and rescue missions. These operations are carried out by other government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations.

The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is an organization aiming at saving lives and recovering property at sea, much the same as the Norwegian Norsk Selskab til Skibbrudnes Redning. The society operates 68 search and rescue stations and some 185 ships manned by 2100 volunteers, of those more than 300 are on call at any time, and can respond within 15 minutes. In 2011, the volunteers turned out to an emergency 3274 times. The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is involved 70% of the number SAR missions in Swedish waters. =Switzerland= REGA Agusta A109 K2. REGA (Schweizerische REttungsflugwacht / Garde A√©rienne / Guardia Aerea) is the air rescue service which provides emergency medical assistance in Switzerland, notably in mountains but also in cases of life-threatening emergencies elsewhere. They will also return a citizen to Switzerland from a foreign country if they are in need of urgent medical care. Rega was established on 27 April 1952 by Dr. Rudolf Bucher, who thought that the Swiss rescue organisation needed a specialised air sub-section. =Taiwan= National Airborne Service Corps (NASC; ) is the agency of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of China responsible for executing and providing support for search and rescue, disaster relief, emergency medical service, transportation, monitoring, reconnaissance and patrol in Taiwan. Coast Guard Administration (CGA; ) is charged with maintaining coastal waters and the pelagic zone patrols, smuggling and stowaway crackdowns, maritime rescues, natural resource conservation, and public services. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces. = Turkey = Search and Rescue operators in Turkey are primarily: Civil * Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency ; also known as AFAD * AKUT Search and Rescue Association * GEA Search and Rescue Association is a group of search and rescue, ecology and social campaigners, founded in 1994, made up of volunteer members. * AKA * Arama Kurtarma ve Acil Yardƒ±m Derneƒüi (AKAY) * Orta Doƒüu Arama-Kurtarma, Daƒücƒ±lƒ±k ve Doƒüa Sporlarƒ± Derneƒüi (ORDOS) * NAK Arama & Kurtarma * Ulusal Acil Durum Arama ve Kurtarma Derneƒüi - National Emergency Search and Rescue Association (NESAR) * UMKE * MUGLA 911 Search and Rescue Research Associations.

There is a network of local volunteer agencies that can be called out to assist these searches, which are part of the Association of Lowland Search And Rescue. Other voluntary agencies exist to provide specialist search and rescue services, such as the Cave Rescue Organisation and Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland. These organisations are usually called out indirectly by the police. For example, the British Cave Rescue Council advises that if someone goes missing in a cave, callers should contact the local police who will then summon cave rescue. Urban search and rescue units are run by the fire services. Her Majesty's Coastguard are in charge of maritime search and rescue missions. The Coastguard is one of the four emergency services that can be contacted on 999. Their role is to initiate and coordinate the searches. Lifeboats are provided by volunteer agencies, most often by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Aircraft for an air-sea rescue were originally provided by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Under the programme UK-SAR, they are now operated under contract by Bristow Helicopters. The Maritime & Coastguard Agency are launching a tender for their second generation UK search and rescue aviation programme (UKSAR2G) , which is one of several tenders for similar services .

Most day-to-day SAR missions in the US are run by the County Sheriffs, except in states like Alaska, where the State Highway Patrol oversees SAR. They in turn, can request help from state and national resources, if they think they need them. A typical Sheriff's Office has a volunteer SAR team that matches the terrain and population of that county. SAR members are typically trained in the Incident Command System (ICS), first aid, and the outdoor skills needed in that terrain and climate. Most of this article is about the federal response to assist large complicated SAR missions. In January 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the National Response Framework which serves as the guiding document for a federal response during a national emergency. Search and Rescue is divided into 4 primary elements, while assigning a federal agency with the lead role for each of the 4 elements. * Structural Collapse- USAR: Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency * Waterborne: United States Coast Guard, United States Coast Guard Auxiliary * Inland-wilderness: United States Department of Interior, National Park Service * Aeronautical: United States Air Force via the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and USAF rescue wings, groups and squadrons in the Air Combat Command, Pacific Air Forces (for Alaska and Hawaii), Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard; the Civil Air Patrol in its role as the USAF Auxiliary; and the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps, both Active and Reserve (secondary missions for land-based USN maritime patrol and reconnaissance squadrons and land-based and sea-based USN/USMC helicopter squadrons) SAR standards adopted by agencies having jurisdiction are developed primarily by non-governmental organizations, including ASTM International and National Fire Protection Association. These standards are adopted also by training and certification organizations such as Mountain Rescue Association and National Association for Search and Rescue to develop training that will meet or exceed those standards. Within ASTM International, standards specific to SAR are developed by Technical Committee F32 on Search and Rescue. Formed in 1988, the committee had 85 current members and jurisdiction of 38 approved standards. =Vietnam= Under command of the Central Government: * National Committee of Search and Rescue is responsible for searching, rescuing and disaster relief.C·ª¶A TH·ª¶ T∆Ø·ªöNG CH√çNH PH·ª¶ S·ªë 780/TTg NG√ÄY 23 TH√ÅNG 10 NƒÇM 1996 V·ªÄ VI·ªÜC TH√ÄNH L·∫¨P ·ª¶Y BAN QU·ªêC GIA T√åM KI·∫æM - C·ª®U N·∫†N TR√äN KH√îNG V√Ä TR√äN BI·ªÇN (Vietnamese language) * Central Committee of Prevention of Natural Disasters is responsible for analyzing information and monitoring disaster relief processes.

She is currently the spokesperson of Feminist Initiative, a political party she co-formed in 2005. She served as leader of the Swedish Left Party from 1993 until January 2003. She remained a member of the Left Party until 2004, when she left to focus entirely on her feminist political work following a tax evasion scandal. She remained an independent member of the Riksdag until 2006. Schyman has become known for controversial ideas, such as special male-taxation. Leader of the Left Party In 1993, Schyman was elected leader of the Left Party. Schyman's greatest asset was her appeal to the voters, and her party more than doubled its number of MPs during her leadership. She gained popularity for her candor: for example, she was open about her struggle with alcoholism and supported an initiative to make the Riksdag an alcohol-free workplace.Ther√©sia Erneborg, \\"Gudrun Schyman: Det √§r alkohol-industrins vinstintressen som styr,\\" Dagen March 1, 2003, retrieved July 26, 2011 During her period as party president, the party adopted feminism as an ideological basis.

Jules Joseph Bonnot (October 14, 1876 ‚Äì April 28, 1912) was a French anarchist bank robber famous for his involvement in a criminal anarchist organization dubbed \\"The Bonnot Gang\\" by the French press. He viewed himself as a professional and avoided bloodshed, preferring to outwit his targets. Often posing as a businessman, his taste in expensive clothing earned him the pseudonym \\"Le Bourgeois\\" among comrades. Youth Bonnot was born on October 14, 1876 in Pont-de-Roide, a town in Doubs, France (the same d√©partement in which anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was born). At the age of five, his mother died, leaving Bonnot in the care of his father (a factory worker) and grandmother. As a teenager, Bonnot served time in prison on two occasions (the latter, for assaulting a police officer) and was compelled to leave his work at the factory after being accused of stealing copper shavings. At the age of 21, Bonnot was conscripted for service in France's infantry, where he served three years as a truck auto mechanic. He was an excellent rifleman and left the army as a corporal first class. Criminal path Bonnot and his family Bonnot was married to Sophie-Louise Burdet in August 1901, but soon ran into problems at work. He associated with anarchists and was blacklisted as an agitator. After moving to Geneva, Bonnot acquired a job, but was fired after he hit his boss with an iron bar. In 1907, Sophie left Bonnot, taking their child with her. In 1908, Bonnot began to associate with anarcho-individualists involved in counterfeiting. Along with several Italians, he began forging ten- franc pieces and carrying out minor thefts and burglaries. Eventually, using Bonnot's automotive skill, they progressed to the theft of luxury-cars in France and Switzerland. In 1910, Bonnot began posing as a businessman in order to visit the homes of wealthy lawyers in Lyon. He would 'case' the property and then return to rob it. The Bonnot Gang Photomontage of the Bonnot gang In December 1911, having moved to Paris to avoid arrest, Bonnot joined a criminal anarchist affinity group led by Octave Garnier. On December 21, the gang made national news when they robbed a messenger of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Bank in broad daylight and then fled in a limousine (the first ever criminal use of a \\"get-away\\" car). They were branded \\"les bandits en auto\\" by the press and a wave of panic swept the nation. Although Bonnot was never the leader of the group, the gang was dubbed the \\"Bonnot Gang\\" by the press after Bonnot appeared, armed with a Browning automatic, in the office of the Le Petit Parisien to file a complaint about the daily paper's coverage of the group. Bonnot was quoted as having stated, \\"We'll burn off our last round against the cops, and if they don't care to come, we'll certainly know how to find them.\\" This show of bravado coupled with the gang's criminal activities led to a general state of hysteria within middle-class French society. Death Bonnot dead. In an effort to escape capture, the gang split up in April 1912. On April 24, three policemen surprised Bonnot in the apartment of a suspected fence. He shot at the officers, killing Louis Jouin, the vice-chief of the French police (S√ªret√© Nationale), and wounding another officer before fleeing over the rooftops. Part of the 100,000 franc reward was later given to the widow of Jouin. On April 28, police tracked Bonnot (now France's \\"most wanted\\" criminal) to a house in the Paris suburb of Choisy-le-Roi. They besieged the residence with 500 armed police officers, soldiers, firemen, military engineers and a lynch mob of local citizens. Armed with three Brownings and a Bayard pistol, Bonnot succeeded in wounding three police officers. By noon, after sporadic firing failed to extract Bonnot from the house, Paris Police Chief Louis L√©pine ordered the building bombed, using a dynamite charge. The explosion demolished the front of the building. Barely conscious, lying underneath a mattress, Bonnot was shot ten times in the upper body before L√©pine shot him non-fatally in the head. Afterwards police had to prevent the spectators from lynching Bonnot. They simply told the crowd that Bonnot was already dead. Bonnot was moved to the Hotel-Dieu and pronounced dead at 1:15 PM. He was buried in an unmarked grave and police refused to release his last will and testament. Although demonized by large sections of French society (including most of the Left), Bonnot's death was mourned by those sympathetic to individualist anarchism. The French movie La Bande √† Bonnot (1968; Bonnot's Gang) is loosely based on the gang's escapades. The last days of Bonnot are a part of storyline in the French movie The Tiger Brigades (Les Brigades du Tigre, 2006). Bonnot is played by Jacques Gamblin. References * Cacucci, Pino.

Composed of individuals who identified with the emerging illegalist milieu, the gang used cutting-edge technology (including automobiles and repeating rifles) not yet available to the French police. Originally referred to by the press as simply \\"The Auto Bandits\\", the gang was dubbed \\"The Bonnot Gang\\" after Jules Bonnot gave an interview at the office of Le Petit Parisien, a popular daily paper. Bonnot's perceived prominence within the group was later reinforced by his high-profile death during a shootout with French police in Choisy-le-Roi.  Members  The Bonnot Gang originally consisted of a group of French anarchists centered around the individualist anarchist magazine l'Anarchie. The group was founded by Octave Garnier, Raymond Callemin, and Ren√© Valet. It was Garnier's idea to use automobiles in the service of a daring criminal act. Jules Bonnot joined them in December 1911.

The gang's political and social perspective was heavily influenced by Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as well as Max Stirner, Ludwig B√ºchner, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Bonnot's ideas were more part with late anarchist Ravachol.  Crime spree  Illustration of the robbery of Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Bank in Chantilly on March 25, 1912 The first robbery by Bonnot's Gang was on December 21, 1911 at the AB Branch of Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Bank, located at 148 rue Ordener in the 18th Arrondissement of Paris. They shot a collection clerk in the neck and lung (yet he survived), snatched his cash bags, then escaped in an automobile (a Delaunay-Belleville) they had stolen a week before. RobbersBonnot, Octave Garnier, Eug√®ne Dieudonn√© and Raymond Callemingot earnings equal to 5,126 francs, but the rest of it was composed of securities. On December 28, 1911, the gang broke into a gun shop in the Paris center. A few days later, on the night of January 2, 1912, they entered the home of the wealthy M. Moreau and murdered both him and his maid. The take was equal to 30,000 francs. The National Police did its best to catch the gang. They were able to arrest one man based on their registry of anarchist organisations. The Gang fled temporarily to Belgium, where they sold the stolen automobile and tried to carjack another. In the process they shot a Belgian policeman. The gang continued their automobile thefts and robberies, shooting two more policemen in the process. Automobiles were not yet common so the gang usually stole still expensive cars from garages, not from the street. By March 1912, police had arrested many of the gang's supporters and knew many of the members' faces and names. In March 1912, gang member and would-be leader Octave Garnier sent a mocking letter to the S√ªret√©with his fingerprints. In those days, the French police still did not yet use fingerprinting. On March 25, 1912, the gang stole a de Dion-Bouton automobile in the Forest of S√©nart south of Paris by shooting the driver through the heart.Richard Parry: The Bonnot gang. Rebel Press, 1987, , p. 115. They drove into Chantilly north of Paris where they robbed the local branch of Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Bank fatally shooting two bank cashiers and severely wounding a bookkeeper. They escaped in their stolen automobile as two policemen tried to catch them, one on horseback and the other on a bicycle. S√ªret√© Chief Xavier Guichard took the matter personally. Even politicians became concerned, increasing police funding by 800,000 francs. Banks began to prepare for forthcoming robberies and many cashiers armed themselves. The Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale promised a reward of 100,000 francs for information that would lead to arrests.  Pursuit and capture  On March 30, police arrested Andr√© Soudy at the English Channel coast, where he announced that he did not care whether he died of tuberculosis or by guillotine. √âdouard Carouy was arrested April 3. Raymond Callemin was arrested April 7, and police had to prevent an angry mob from lynching him on the spot. √âtienne Monnier was arrested in Paris on April 24. By the end of that month, police had arrested 28 gang members and supporters. Still, Bonnot, Octave Garnier and Ren√© Valet remained at large. On April 24, three police officers surprised Bonnot in the apartment of a suspected fence. He shot at the officers, killing one and wounding another, and then fled over the rooftops. Part of the 100,000 francs reward was later given to the widow of the police officer killed (Louis Jouin, the vice-chief of the French National Police). On April 28, police had tracked Bonnot to a converted garage in the Paris suburb of Choisy-le-Roi. The building had only one entrance so it was easy for Bonnot to keep the police at bay. They besieged the place with 500 armed police officers, soldiers (with one brand new Hotchkiss machine gun), firefighters, military engineers and private gun- owners. By noon, after a sporadic firing from both sides, Paris Police Chief Louis L√©pine sent three police officers to put a dynamite charge under the house. The explosion demolished the front of the building. Bonnot was hiding in the middle of a rolled mattress and tried to shoot back until L√©pine shot him non-fatally in the head. Afterwards police again had to prevent the spectators from lynching Bonnot. They simply told the crowd that Bonnot was already dead and had been buried in a secret grave. In fact, he was fatally injured but was taken to the H√¥tel-Dieu hospital and survived for around another hour. On the evening of 14 May, Octave Garnier and Rene Valet were besieged in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne by a large force including 300 police officers and gendarmes and 800 soldiers. S√ªret√© Chief Xavier Guichard himself led the siege. The firing from both sides was intense, and at 2 am, Guichard decided to blow the place up. Garnier died in the explosion, but Valet tried to keep firing despite his wounds.  Trial  The trial of the gang's survivors began on February 3, 1913. Victor Serge was sentenced to five years for robbery. All the others were initially sentenced to death. The sentence of Eug√®ne Dieudonn√© was commuted to life imprisonment. Sentences of √âdouard Carouy and Marius Metge were commuted to life imprisonment at hard labor. Carouy later committed suicide. Metge was sent to a penal colony. Raymond Caillemin, √âtienne Monier and Andr√© Soudy refused to plead for clemency and they were executed by guillotine.  Aftermath  Caricature of the Bonnot gang In the aftermath of the collapse of the Bonnot Gang, French authorities used the threat of anarchist violence as the pretext for a substantial expansion in law enforcement power. Hundreds of raids were carried out against known anarchists and sympathizers (similar in scale to the Palmer Raids in the United States). Although the actions of the gang were not widely supported, even within the anarchist milieu, the mainstream press called for a general crackdown on left-wing revolutionary activity. French anarchist communists attempted to distance themselves from illegalism and individualist anarchism as a whole. In August 1913, the F√©d√©ration Communiste-Anarchistes (FCA) condemned individualism as bourgeois and more in keeping with capitalism than communism. Nevertheless, the Bonnot Gang found some sympathy from the French working-class. As many as one hundred thousand people visited Nogent- sur-Marne (the site of the shoot-out that ended the lives of Garnier and Valet) and merchants in Paris sold souvenirs depicting the bandits. The Bonnot Gang remains one of France's best known anarchist groups.  See more  * La Bande √† Bonnot, 1968 film * Les Brigades du Tigre  References  =Further reading= * Cacucci, Pino.

The regiment was founded in 1675 and dissolved in 1806 after the Prussian defeat by Napoleon. Throughout the reign of the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia (1688‚Äì1740) the unit was known as the \\"Potsdamer Riesengarde\\" (\\"giant guard of Potsdam\\") in German, but the Prussian population quickly nicknamed them the Lange Kerle (\\"long fellows\\"). Regiment's history Prussian Langer Kerl by Johann Christof Merck, 1718 The Regiment was founded with a strength of two battalions in 1675 as ‚ÄúRegiment Kurprinz‚Äù under the command of Prince Frederick of Brandenburg, the later King Frederick I of Prussia. In 1688 the later King Frederick William I of Prussia became the nominal Commander of the Regiment. After Frederick William I ascended to the throne in 1713, he proceeded to strengthen his military, including hiring 40,000 mercenaries. He had already begun to recruit taller soldiers and needed several hundred more recruits each year. As the number of tall soldiers increased, the regiment earned its nickname \\"Potsdam Giants\\". The original required height was 6 Prussian feet (about ),meyers.de well above average then and now. The king was about tall himself.militaergeschichte.de He tried to obtain them by any means, including recruiting them from the armies of other countries. The Emperor of Austria, Russian Tsar Peter the Great and even the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire sent him tall soldiers in order to encourage friendly relations. Several soldiers were given by Tsar Peter I as a gift in return for the famous Amber Room.Rolf Fuhrmann: Die Langen Kerls - Die preussische Riesengarde 1675/1713-1806, Zeughaus Verlag, Berlin 2007 Pay was high, but not all giants were content, especially if they were forcibly recruited, and some attempted desertion or suicide. Frederick tried to pair these men with tall women, in order to breed giants. In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin mentions this attempt as the only case in which \\"certain male and female have been intentionally picked out and matched\\". Although Prussia briefly intervened in the Great Northern War, the Potsdam Giants never saw battle during his reign. Some sources state that there was a military reason to create a regiment of \\"long fellows\\" because loading a muzzleloader is easier to handle for a taller soldier.J√ºrgen Kloosterhuis: Legend√§re ‚Äûlange Kerls‚Äú. Quellen zur Regimentskultur der K√∂nigsgrenadiere Friedrich Wilhelms I., 1713‚Äì1740, Berlin 2003, Another source states that many of the men were unfit for combat due to their gigantism.Kurt Zeisler: Die Langen Kerls. Das Leib- und Garderegiment Friedrich Wilhelms I., Frankfurt/Main 1993 The king trained and drilled his own regiment every day. He liked to paint their portraits from memory. He tried to show them to foreign visitors and dignitaries to impress them. At times he would try to cheer himself up by ordering them to march before him, even if he was in his sickbed. This procession, which included the entire regiment, was led by their mascot, a bear. He once confided to the French ambassador that \\"The most beautiful girl or woman in the world would be a matter of indifference to me, but tall soldiers‚Äîthey are my weakness\\". Their uniform was not in any way idiosyncratic for the time, consisting of a red mitre, a Prussian blue jacket with gold lacing, scarlet breeches and white gaiters. One of the tallest soldiers, the Irishman James Kirkland, was reportedly Potsdam at Marco Polo in height. Kirkland's fellow Irishman, the poet Tom√°s √ì Caiside, also served in the regiment. Daniel Cajanus, the famous Finnish giant, was also a member of the regiment. When the king died in 1740, the regiment consisted of 3,200 men. However, his successor Frederick the Great did not share his father's sentiments about the regiment, which seemed to him an unnecessary expense. The regiment was largely disbanded and most of its soldiers were integrated into other units. The regiment itself was downgraded to a battalion (Garde ‚Äì Grenadier No. 6) and employed during the War of the Austrian Succession at Hohenfriedberg in 1745 and at Rossbach, Leuthen, Hochkirch, Liegnitz, and Torgau throughout the Seven Years' War. The battalion surrendered near Erfurt and Prenzlau after the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806 and was disbanded.  Tradition  Since 1990, a private association at Potsdam has tried to draw on the tradition of the \\"Lange Kerls\\" and preserve the memory of that unit. References J.N.W. Bos. 2000.

At the 2001 census, it had a population of 4,816, falling to 4,299 at the 2011 Census. Wickham has a wide and well- proportioned square lined with historic buildings and is designated a conservation area. It was the fording place of the River Meon on the Roman road between Noviomagus Regnorum (Chichester) and Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and the inferred divergent point of the route to Clausentum (Bitterne). The Roman road from Wickham to Chichester is still followed today by local roads, passing behind Portsdown Hill to the north of Portsmouth Harbour and then onwards via Havant. In contrast, the route to Winchester is mostly likely lost through neglect in the Dark Ages, before present field patterns emerged. There have been a reasonable number of sites identified nearby associated with Romano-British industry. These have mainly been pottery kilns focused around the limit of navigation of the River Hamble, near Botley. It is also here that a ford on the Clausentum road has been identified. Wickham has occasionally been hypothesised as an alternative to Nursling (on the River Test) or Neatham (near Alton) for the Roman station Onna listed in the Antonine Itinerary. However, no definite location for Onna has been determined. It was the birthplace of William of Wykeham, founder of Winchester College and New College, Oxford. The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Wickham. The village was an intermediate station on the Meon Valley Railway, a late Victorian route, until the line closed in 1955. At one time this railway was conceived as a direct route from London to the Isle of Wight. The closed line is now established as a cycle path and bridleway along the valley of the River Meon. A traditional gypsy horse fair is held annually every 20 May, or another day if a Sunday, in the village square. History =Early settlements= The Romans established a settlement at Wickham, on the road from the Roman centres of Chichester and Winchester. Iron works have been found northeast of the village, and various Roman finds to the southwest. It was in Saxon Britain that the first written mention of the village appears, in a Royal Charter document dated 826. Recent excavation (1965‚Äì70) at the Manor House showed its grounds had dwellings and huts, evidence of Saxon settlement. =Post-Norman Conquest= After the Norman Conquest, King William granted the Manor of Wickham to Hugo de Port and the Village appeared in the Doomsday Book of 1086, as part of the Titchfield Hundred. The present church of St Nicholas dates from 1126 and was run by the Canons of Titchfield. In 1269, King Henry III granted a charter to Roger de Scures, the Lord of The Manor at the time, for markets to be held on a Thursday. It is from this time that the layout of the village as we now know it began to emerge. Wickham also had a fair which attracted buyers and sellers from a wide area. Wickham fair (often referred to Wickham Horse Fair) is still held each year on 20 May. St Nicholas Church in WickhamThe Church of St Nicholas in Wickham was built in the early 12th century (although there has probably been a church on the site since the 7th century when the people of Hampshire were first converted to Christianity), however the church was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. =Industrialisation and Victorian Wickham= In the 18th century, there was a tanning industry in Wickham and in the 18th and 19th centuries a brewing industry. Both needed a supply of fresh water, which was readily available from the River Meon. In 1801, Wickham had a population of 901 and compared to most of the villages in Hampshire it was a large community. In 1820, Chesapeake Mill was built with timber taken from an American ship , which was captured in the War of 1812. Sir Richard Grindall who commanded at the battle of Trafalgar is buried in Wickham churchyard. In 1903, a branch railway was built from Fareham through Wickham, to Droxford and Alton. It was closed to passengers in 1955 and the line converted to a footpath. The original station platforms can still be found. In 1978, Wickham was twinned with the French village of Villiers-Sur-Mer. Wickham Vineyard opened in 1984. In 1990, an old brewery and village hall in Wickham were converted into flats called Riverside Mews. The brewery shut in 1910 and the buildings were given to Wickham Parish Council to use as a village hall. Culture and events =Wickham Festival= The Oysterband headlining the first Wickham Festival in 2006 Farmland north of Wickham serves as the venue for the award-winning Wickham Festival, which is an annual 4-day music event. The first Wickham Festival was held from 3‚Äì6 August 2006 in the Community Centre and environs. Artists performing included Daby Blade from Senegal, Spiers and Boden, Los Pacaminos, Richard Thompson, Shooglenifty, Sparks, Oysterband, Fiddlers' Bid, Osibisa, Flook, Steeleye Span and The Larry Love Showband. After briefly moving to Stokes Bay in 2008 and 2009, the festival returned to Wickham in 2010, where it has remained ever since.http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/wickham- festival-to-return-with-the-levellers-1-1245668  Portsmouth News  Wickham Festival To Return with the Levellers Wickham Festival has expanded over the years, and has featured performances from such artists as James Blunt, 10cc, Wilko Johnson, The Proclaimers, KT Tunstall, Hugh Cornwell and Lightning Seeds. =Taste Of Wickham= Taste of Wickham is a food festival, first held in Wickham's medieval square in 2014. The festival offers local produce, barbecues, tasters and cookery demonstrations, and has attracted crowds of over 4,000 people to the village. Taste of Wickham returned in 2015, with increased numbers of stalls, crafts and musical displays. =Wickham horse fair= England's biggest and oldest horse fair takes place in Wickham on 20 May every year. It is one of just two major horse-trading events in the country and can trace its history back to the 13th century. Ever since, crowds have gathered annually in the village to trade secrets, meet with friends and parade their stock. The fair includes bareback parades with ponies decorated with ribbons. = Wickham Charity Beer Festival = Originally started by the community centre, after the first year the beer festival was handed to a group who have kept it going until the end of 2019 where it now is being handed back the community centre. The beer festival picks a couple of charity to donate too for each event, there are usually two events a year, one near the beginning or middle of April which is a two-day festival and then in October near the beginning or middle of October for one day. Shopping Chesapeake Mill Wickham's village square has bars, restaurants, shops and hotels. Bay Tree Walk is a shopping walk. The Chesapeake Mill is a former water mill which is a retail centre. Sport and leisure Wickham has a community centre \\"Wickham Community Centre\\". Wickham has a tennis club. The village has a public skatepark and a floodlit astroturf pitch located behind the Community Centre. The Meon Valley Railway Line is a 17.5 km (11 mi) recreational bridleway that runs through the village. The trail follows part of the bed of the former Meon Valley Railway (Alton to Fareham), which closed in 1968. It ends at West Meon due to removal of the former viaduct across the Meon Valley, and the presence of tunnels further north.

He founded New College, Oxford, and New College School in 1379, and founded Winchester College in 1382. He was also the clerk of works when much of Windsor Castle was built. Early life William of Wykeham (born William Longe) was the son of John Longe, a freeman from Wickham in Hampshire. He was educated at a school in Winchester, and probably enjoyed early patronage from two local men, Sir Ralph Sutton, constable of Winchester Castle, and Sir John Scures, lord of the manor of Wickham, and then from Thomas Foxley, Constable of Windsor Castle. In 1349, Wykeham was described as a chaplain when he was appointed rector of Irstead in Norfolk, a position which was in the gift of the Crown.Mackenzie E. C. Walcott \\"William of Wykeham, His Colleges\\" p. 10 Builder William became secretary to the constable of Winchester Castle and in that capacity learned about building. This led to architectural work for King Edward III, for whom he reconstructed Windsor Castle whilst residing at Bear's Rails in Old Windsor. William developed a reputation for the administration and supervision of royal building works during the reign of Edward III. By May 1356, he was clerk of the works for houses being built for the Crown at Henley on the Heath in Surrey and Easthampstead in Berkshire, and he was appointed surveyor of the long-running works to develop Windsor Castle in October 1356. He rapidly rose in royal service, and in July 1359 he was appointed chief keeper and surveyor of Windsor Castle, Leeds Castle, Dover Castle, and Hadleigh Castle, and many royal manors, including Sheen, Eltham and Langley, effectively in the office later called clerk of the king's works. He also took charge of the building works at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. State administrator under Edward III William's career took a turn by 1361, when he became a royal secretary, part of the administration of the royal finances, and by 1363 he was a royal councillor. He was present when the Treaty of Br√©tigny was agreed in Calais in 1360. In January 1361, Edward III and John II of France jointly to petitioned Pope Innocent VI, to make William a canon at Lincoln Cathedral. He was appointed Justice in Eyre south of the Trent along with Peter Atte Wode in 1361, a position he held until about 1367. William was ordained in 1362 and paid for his services by being given the incomes of various churches. For instance, in April 1363, Edward III presented him to the archdeaconry of Lincoln, a move that was approved by Pope Urban V in November 1363 only after representations from Sir Nicholas de Loveyne, the king's ambassador to the papal court. By 1366, William held two benefices and eleven prebends, with an annual income exceeding ¬£800. William had shown considerable talent as an administrator and in June 1363 was appointed Lord Privy SealFryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 94 and then in October 1366 he was elected Bishop of Winchester,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 277 Pope Urban V approved his appointment in July 1367, and he was consecrated at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 10 October 1367 and enthroned at Winchester Cathedral in July 1368. In 1367 he was appointed Chancellor of England.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 86 He struggled to find the funds necessary to pay the army fighting against France after conflict resumed in 1369. He lost the favour of the king, who turned to William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and he resigned as Chancellor in 1371. As Edward III aged and weakened, William maintained good relationships with Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, John of Gaunt and Edward, the Black Prince. He remained politically important, and was one of four bishops appointed to the new royal council in May 1376 after Latimer was impeached during the Good Parliament. His friendship with the Earl of March led to a long conflict with John of Gaunt, who supported Latimer. Latimer was pardoned by king in October 1376, and William found himself charged with financial irregularities and mismanagement towards the end of the year. He was banished from court and the income from his church properties was seized in late 1376, but he was pardoned by the new king Richard II in July 1377, weeks after Edward III died. (Richard was the son of Edward, the Black Prince, who had died in June 1376, a year before his father.) Richard II Under Richard II, William resumed his position as a royal councillor. Although he took the side of the Lords Appellant in their disputes with the king in 1388, he also managed to maintain good relations with the king, and served as Chancellor again from May 1389 to September 1391. After years of supporting poor scholars at Oxford University, he founded New College, which was granted a royal charter in 1379. He also founded a grammar school, Winchester College, in Winchester, obtaining a papal bull in 1378 and a royal licence in 1382. Construction work began in Oxford in 1380, and in Winchester in 1387, under the architect William Wynford. At both colleges, William stipulated daily prayers for Richard II and his queen, William and his parents, and his former patrons, Sir Ralph Sutton, Sir John Scures, and Thomas Foxley. The funds to endow the colleges, and pay for the building works, came from William's lucrative church positions, discounting of exchequer tallies (that is, speculation on tax revenues due to the king), exporting wool, and using his influence to obtain papal approval for the acquisition of the income of the \\"alien priories\\" that belonged to monasteries in France, which were confiscated by the crown during the Hundred Years' War. He also started the rebuilding of the nave of Winchester Cathedral in 1394. William was concentrating on his foundation by the time Henry IV deposed Richard II in 1399, but he welcomed the new king in Winchester in 1400. Death and legacy William died at Bishop's Waltham in Hampshire on 27 September 1404 and was buried in his chantry chapel on the south side of the nave in Winchester Cathedral. At the time of his death, he was one of the richest men in England. Much of his wealth went into the schools he patronised, but he also contrived to leave a fortune to a nephew, whose descendants include the Twisleton- Wykeham-Fiennes family and the Longe family. William's motto was 'Manners makyth man'. This, along with a coat of arms, were assumed by him and not acquired by descent. His biography was written by Bishop Lowth. He was also written about by Lord Brougham in his 'Old England's Worthies' (1857) and by Froissart. 'Manners Makyth Man' is also the motto of the establishments Wykeham founded, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.

Crusoe was notable for its method of achieving x86 compatibility. Instead of the instruction set architecture being implemented in hardware, or translated by specialized hardware, the Crusoe runs a software abstraction layer, or a virtual machine, known as the Code Morphing Software (CMS). The CMS translates machine code instructions received from programs into native instructions for the microprocessor. In this way, the Crusoe can emulate other instruction set architectures (ISAs). This is used to allow the microprocessors to emulate the Intel x86 instruction set. In theory, it is possible for the CMS to be modified to emulate other ISAs. Transmeta demonstrated Crusoe executing Java bytecode by translating the bytecodes into instructions in its native instruction set. The addition of an abstraction layer between the x86 instruction stream and the hardware means that the hardware architecture can change without breaking compatibility, just by modifying the CMS. For example, Transmeta Efficeon ‚Äî a second-generation Transmeta design ‚Äî has a 256-bit-wide VLIW core versus the 128-bit core of the Crusoe. Crusoe performs in software some of the functionality traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. instruction re-ordering), resulting in simpler hardware with fewer transistors. The relative simplicity of the hardware means that Crusoe consumes less power (and therefore generates less heat) than other x86-compatible microprocessors running at the same frequency. A 700 MHz Crusoe ran x86 programs at the speed of a 500 MHz Pentium III x86 processor, although the Crusoe processor was smaller and cheaper than the corresponding Intel processor. Description A Transmeta CPU from a Fujitsu Lifebook P series laptop The Crusoe was available in two cores: the TM3200 for embedded applications and the TM5400 for low-power personal computing. Both were based on the same architecture but differed in clock frequency and peripheral support. The TM3200 operated at clock frequencies of 333‚Äì400 MHz. It has a 64 KB instruction cache, a 32 KB data cache and no L2 cache. The TM3200 has an integrated memory controller supports only SDRAM and a PCI interface. It measures 77 mm¬≤ and uses a 1.5 V power supply, dissipating less than 1.5 W of power (typical). The TM5400 operated at clock frequencies of 500‚Äì800 MHz. Unlike the TM3200, the TM5400 has LongRun power reduction technology. It has a 64 KB instruction cache, a 64 KB data cache and a 256 KB unified L2 cache. The integrated memory controller supports both SDRAM and DDR SDRAM. It also has a PCI interface. It measures 73 mm¬≤ and uses a 1.10 V 1.6f V power supply, dissipating 0.5‚Äì1.5 W typically and a maximum of 6 W. As Transmeta was a fabless semiconductor company, that is, they did not have the facilities to fabricate their designs, both were fabricated by IBM Microelectronics, the semiconductor business of International Business Machines (IBM). IBM fabricated the Crusoe in a 0.18 ¬µm CMOS process with five levels of copper interconnect. The Crusoe is a VLIW microprocessor that executes bundles of instructions, termed molecules by Transmeta. Each molecule contains multiple instructions, termed atoms. The Code Morphing Software translates x86 instructions into native instructions. The native instructions are 32 bits long. Instructions that meet a set of conditions can be executed simultaneously and are combined to form a 64- or 128-bit molecule containing two or four atoms, respectively. In the event that there are not enough instructions to fill a molecule, the software inserts NOPs as padding to fill out empty slots. This is required in all VLIW architectures and is criticised for being inefficient, which is why there are molecules of two separate lengths. Transmeta Crusoe, new generation processor provide variable operating modes. Due to dynamic core they vary voltage and frequency dynamically under dynamic load. Frequency range and dynamic voltage provides for 300 MHz-1.20 V, 400 MHz-1.23 V, 500 MHz-1.35 V,600 MHz-1.53 V,700 MHz-1.75 V, 800 MHz-2.00 V, 900 MHz-2.35, 1000 MHz- 2.80 V. They can vary these ranges depending upon the load. For optimum or minimum load the respective frequencies and voltages get changed.

The term was allegedly coined by DJ Olive to describe the music being produced by a community of artists based in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York in 1994. The word \\"Illbient\\" combines the hip hop slang term \\"ill\\" (a positive expression: bad meaning good) and \\"ambient\\". Though there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by interesting dub-wise layering of soundscapes, hip hop-influenced use of samples and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses all genres of world groove and electronic music.

The incapable, less capable or less preferred hand is called the non- dominant hand.. (\\"Nondominant\\" is one of 945 words listed under \\"non-\\") Right- handedness is the most common form, and about 90% of the world's population is right-handed. Handedness is often defined by which hand one writes with, as it is fairly common for people to prefer to do some tasks with each hand. There are examples of true mixed-handedness; however, it is rare, with most people preferring one hand for most purposes. Most of the current research would suggest that left handedness has an epigenetic marker, a combination of genetics, biology and the environment. Because the vast majority of the population is right-handed, many devices are designed for use by a right- handed person, which makes their use by left-handed people more difficult. In many countries across the world, left-handed people are or were required to write with their right hand. Left-handed people are also more prone to various health problems. However, left-handed people have an advantage in sports that involve aiming at a target, because their opponents will be more accustomed to the right-handed majority. As a result, they are over-represented in baseball, tennis, fencing, cricket, and boxing.  Types  * Right-handedness is by far the most common type. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 90% of the world population is right-handed. * Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. * Cross-dominance or mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is very uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. * Ambidexterity, equal ability to use both hands, is rare. A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand.  Measurement  Handedness may be measured behaviourally (performance measures) or through questionnaires (preference measures). The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory has been used since 1971 but contains many dated questions and is hard to score. The longer Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire is not widely accessible. More recently, the Flinders Handedness Survey (FLANDERS) has been developed to measure handedness.  Causes  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. = Division of labor = One common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left- handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left- handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized. = Genetic factors = Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus of UCL. However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus. From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. Brandler and Paracchini suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function). In 2019, Wiberg et al. performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci. Three of these loci are in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development. = Epigenetic factors = Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. = Prenatal hormone exposure = Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in- utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies \\"suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance\\". = Prenatal vestibular asymmetry = Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. = Ultrasound = Another theory is that ultrasound may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness.  Developmental timeline  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. Children aged 18 to 36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi- manipulation tasks than simple grasping. The decrease in handedness variability for 36-to-48-month-old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. Scharoun and Bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years.  Correlation with other factors  = Intelligence = In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand, Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. Writing in Scientific American, McManus states that, > Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed > people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not > noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right- > handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations > and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly > larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in > music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a > significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those > who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as > violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess > mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence for left-handers being overrepresented amongst those with higher cognitive skills, such as Mensa members and higher-performing takers of SAT and MCAT tests, was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented among those with lower cognitive skills and those with mental impairments, with those with Intellectual disability (ID) being roughly twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. Moreover, Ntolka and Papadatou-Pastou in a systematic review and meta-analysis found that it is right-handers who have higher IQ scores, but this difference is negligible (about 1.5 points).  Early childhood intelligence  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18‚Äì24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects. =Music= In two studies, Diana Deutsch found that left- handers, particularly those with mixed hand preference, performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks. There are also handedness differences in perception of musical patterns. Left-handers as a group differ from right-handers, and are more heterogeneous than right- handers, in perception of certain stereo illusions, such as the octave illusion, the scale illusion, and the glissando illusion. =Health= Left- handed people are much more likely to have several specific physical and mental disorders and health problems. For example: Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handedness. A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, while another study demonstrated that left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's disease in women, but not in men. Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater in post-menopausal women. At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease, and are more likely to have reduced longevity from cardiovascular causes. Left- handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. One systematic review concluded: \\"Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system\\". As handedness is a highly heritable trait associated with various medical conditions, and because many of these conditions could have presented a Darwinian fitness challenge in ancestral populations, this indicates left-handedness may have previously been rarer than it currently is, due to natural selection. However, on average, left- handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive, interactive sports, which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations. = Income = In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. However, more recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people. = Left-handedness and sports = Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing, about half the participants are left- handed. The term southpaw is sometimes used to refer to a left-handed individual, especially in baseball and boxing. Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations: * In cricket, the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor (i.e., even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average (i.e., right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram). * In baseball, a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. While studies of handedness show that only 10% of the general population is left-handed, the proportion of left-handed MLB players is closer to 39% of hitters and 28% of pitchers, according to 2012 data. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right- handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. ** Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pick off baserunners at first base. ** Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder. For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: * In four wall handball, typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor. * In handball, left- handed players have an advantage on the right side of the field when attacking, getting a better angle, and that defenders might be unused to them. Since few people are left-handed, there is a demand for such players. * In water polo, the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score. Left-handed drivers are usually on the right side of the field, because they can get better angles to pass the ball or shoot for goal. * Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. * In American football, the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line. Tight ends, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \\"blind side,\\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several notable left-handed quarterbacks. * In bowling, the oil pattern used on the bowling lane breaks down faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes. = Gender = According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio. = Sexuality and gender identity = A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, though findings are mixed. A 2001 study also found that children who are assigned male at birth but have different gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found \\"elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness\\". Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among pedophiles. A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. = Mortality rates in combat = A study at Durham University ‚Äî which examined mortality data for cricketers whose handedness was a matter of public record ‚Äî found that left-handed men were almost twice as likely to die in war as their right-handed contemporaries. The study theorised that this was because weapons and other equipment was designed for the right-handed. ‚ÄúI can sympathise with all those left-handed cricketers who have gone to an early grave trying desperately to shoot straight with a right-handed Lee Enfield .303,‚Äù wrote a journalist reviewing the study in the cricket press. The findings echo those of previous American studies, which found that left-handed US sailors were 34% more likely to have a serious accident than their right- handed counterparts. = Episodic memory etc= A high level of handedness is associated with poorer episodic memory, and with poorer communication between brain hemispheres, which may give poorer emotional processing, although bilateral stimulation may reduce such effects. = Corpus callosum = A high level of handedness is associated with a smaller corpus callosum whereas low handedness with a larger one.  In culture  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, \\"For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers.\\" As a child British King George VI (1895-1952) was naturally left-handed. He was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He was not expected to become king, so that was not a factor. McManus noted that, as the Industrial Revolution spread across Western Europe and the United States in the 19th century, workers needed to operate complex machines that were designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen. While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. =Negative connotations and discrimination= Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left- handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \\"right\\" also means \\"correct\\" or \\"proper\\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand. The Latin adjective sinister or sinistra (as applied to male or female nouns ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†Latin nouns are gender specific) means \\"left\\" as well as \\"unlucky\\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \\"sinister\\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \\"ambisinister\\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'. There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \\"left-handed\\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \\"left-handed compliment\\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In French, gauche means both \\"left\\" and \\"awkward\\" or \\"clumsy\\", while droit(e) (cognate to English direct and related to \\"adroit\\") means both \\"right\\" and \\"straight\\", as well as \\"law\\" and the legal sense of \\"right\\". The name \\"Dexter\\" derives from the Latin for \\"right\\", as does the word \\"dexterity\\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon. Black magic is sometimes referred to as the \\"left- hand path\\". Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China, Japan and both North and South Korea), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order, developed for the comfortable use of right- handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right- to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right- handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. In the Soviet Union, all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system.–ê. –ü. –ß—É–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤, –í. –î. –ú–∏—à–∏–µ–≤. // –õ–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –°–°–°–† –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ 70-—Ö –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ 80-—Ö –≥–æ–¥–æ–≤. –ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ª–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –Ω–µ–π—Ä–æ–ø—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–π—Ä–æ–ø—Å–∏—Ö–∏–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∏. –•—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—è. –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫, 2010, 192 —Å.–ê. –ü. –ß—É–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ï. –ê. –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤. // –ú–∏—Ä –ª–µ–≤–æ—Ä—É–∫–∏—Ö. –ö–∏–µ–≤. 2008. = International Left-Handers Day = International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, \\"an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.\\" It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right- handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, \\"in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 ‚Äì including left-v- right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!\\"  In other animals  Kangaroos and other macropod marsupials show a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. 'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike placental mammals, they lack a corpus callosum. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males tend to be left-handed.

It is located within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park and is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful areas in Argyll and in Scotland as a whole.  Location  The village is surrounded by several Corbetts in the Arrochar Alps (Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles), including Benn Donich, The Brack and Cnoc Coinnich and local waterways are the River Goil and the Donich Water. Distant view of Lochgoilhead The area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years, with the original name for the area being 'Kil nam brathairan' from the Gaelic for 'Church of the brothers'. There are Neolithic remains in the area, including nearby cup marks and a well-preserved corn kiln. The area is associated with the history of Clan Campbell, who drove the Lamonts from the area in the fourteenth century. Lochgoilhead used to be an important stop on the route between Glasgow and Inverary, as travellers would arrive by boat and continue by coach to St Catherine's, where they would board a second boat to cross Loch Fyne. Lochgoilhead is situated in the Cowal Peninsula and access to the village is either via the A83 with a turning off the 'Rest and be Thankful', or the A815 from Dunoon. Both roads are single track. Travel times from Glasgow, to the south east, are approximately 90 minutes. The village has a population of about 400, with around a third of the houses being holiday rental properties or second homes. There is a large holiday village run by Drimsynie estates which nearly doubles the population of Lochgoilhead in high season. Employment in the area is largely related to agriculture, forestry and tourism, with rates of unemployment at approximately the national average. Rates of self-employment are twice the Scottish average. The village has a Post Office/Shop and a small Costcutter supermarket. There is a church, a village hall which hosts a number of community events, a primary school and a doctor's surgery. Drinks, meals and accommodation are available at the Goil Inn. Accommodation and many other amenities such as a gym, swimming pool and restaurants are available at the Drimsynie Holiday village. The area has many associations with outdoor activities, including the National Activity Centre for the Scouting Association and the Ardroy Outdoor Centre. There are many famous local walks including the Donich Circular and parts of the Cowal way (a view of Lochgoilhead can be seen on the home page for the Cowal Way website). The area is also incredibly rich in wildlife; red squirrel, pine marten, otters, red deer and badgers are common, as well as seals and porpoises in the loch and eagles and buzzards on the hills. Wildcats used to be common in the area but may now be extinct locally. There are a number of books about local history available, including 'Loch Goil ‚Äì A slice out of paradise' (the name is a quote from the famous mountaineer WH Murray), 'Loch Goil ‚Äì looking back' by Iain Smart and Rod/Tricia Philips, and 'The Lochgoil and Lochlong Steamboat Company' by Iain Smart. There is a community website and the local newspaper 'The Wee Goil' is published monthly. Parts of the film From Russia with Love were filmed locally, and Sean Connery stayed at the Goil Inn (then the Lochgoilhead Hotel). Restless Natives also shows scenes near Lochgoilhead.  Lochgoilhead Hum  A low frequency noise (LFN) was first reported by residents of the village late in 2015. The source of the noise has not been confirmed despite months of effort and investigation, earning the village a place on the World Hum Database. Similar reports of noise have been recorded on this database from Garelochhead and the out-skirts of Helensburgh - near the MOD facility at Faslane. Sound reports taken using specialized equipment (3rd Octave) in Lochgoilhead have measured high decibel, low frequency noise at three locations: * MOD Noise Range - This range is operated on behalf of the MOD by QinetiQ, and includes a floating lab located in the middle of the loch, between The Lodge and Drimsynie Hotel. Until recently the lab was only occupied during trials, but as of late 2015 substantial new equipment was installed and the lab is now permanently occupied and frequently in use. The volume of MOD traffic on the loch has increased substantially over the last year - submarines and frigates have in fact been spotted/photographed on the loch recently. Sound reports taken on the shore near the lab when it is in use have shown LFN of up to 50 dB. * Corrow Farm - This farm houses the Estate Office for Drimsynie Hotel and the Head Office for Drimsynie Construction. It is also a working farm, using new generating equipment which run almost constantly and generates LFN of up to 60 dB. * Waste Water Treatment Works - This plant, operated by ScottishWater, is located at the edge of the village where it expels into the Donich River. When the plant pumps/turbines are in operation LFN of up to 60 dB has been recorded.  Lochgoilhead Fever  An outbreak of non-pneumonic legionellosis due to Legionella micdadei in 1988 became known as Lochgoilhead fever (similar to Pontiac fever), the source of which was traced to a local hotel/spa. Two more minor outbreaks have occurred since - the most recent being in 2006, affecting only one resident and two visitors - following use the facilities at the same hotel/spa.

His seven-volume Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the fells of the English Lake District. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the Coast to Coast Walk, a 192-mile long-distance footpath devised by Wainwright which remains popular today. Life Buttermere parish churchalt=black stone plaque reading: Pause and remember Alfred Wainwright: Fellwalker, guide book author and illustrator who loved this valley. Lift you eyes to Haystacks his favourite place. 1907-1991 Alfred Wainwright was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, into a family which was relatively poor, mostly because of his stonemason father's alcoholism.Wainwright: The Man Who Loved the Lakes, Martin Wainwright, BBC Books, He did very well at school (first in nearly every subject)BBC 4 documentary, February 2007 although he left at the age of 13. While most of his classmates were obliged to find employment in the local mills, Wainwright started work as an office boy in Blackburn Borough Engineer's Department. He spent several years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in accountancy which enabled him to further his career at Blackburn Borough Council. Even when a child Wainwright walked a great deal, up to 20 miles at a time; he showed a great interest in drawing and cartography, producing his own maps of England and his local area. In 1930, at the age of 23, Wainwright saved up for a week's walking holiday in the Lake District with his cousin Eric Beardsall. They arrived in Windermere and climbed the nearby Orrest Head, where Wainwright saw his first view of the Lakeland fells. This moment marked the start of what he later described as his love affair with the Lake District. In 1931 he married his first wife, Ruth Holden, a mill worker, with whom he had a son, Peter. In 1941 Wainwright moved closer to the fells when he took a job (and a pay cut) at the Borough Treasurer's office in Kendal, Westmorland. He lived and worked in the town for the rest of his life, serving as Borough Treasurer from 1948 until he retired in 1967. His first marriage ended when Ruth left three weeks before he retired (suspecting him of infidelity) and they divorced. In 1970 he married Betty McNally (1922‚Äì2008), a divorcee, who became his walking companion and who carried his ashes to Innominate Tarn at the top of Haystacks.A. Wainwright, Memoirs of a Fellwanderer (Frances Lincoln, London, 1993) Wainwright was a lifelong Blackburn Rovers fan and a founder member of the Blackburn Rovers Supporters Club.The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007, The Wainwright Society He had no time for organised religion, and was agnostic. On Desert Island Discs, he described himself as having once been shy but having grown up to be antisocial and would avoid speaking to others, even lone walkers on fell tops. Wainwright died in 1991 of a heart attack. According to his biographer, Hunter Davies, he left everything, including his house and royalty income, to Betty. His son Peter received nothing. Pictorial Guides Book One of the Pictorial Guide Wainwright started work on the first page of his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells on 9 November 1952.W.R. Mitchell, \\"Solo walks and evening work: Wainwright remembered\\" in Dave Hewitt (ed.), A Bit of Grit on Haystacks (Disley: Millrace, 2004), p. 23 He planned the precise scope and content of the seven volumes and worked conscientiously and meticulously on the series for the next 13 years at an average rate of one page per evening. According to Wainwright, in his autobiography Fellwanderer, he initially planned the series for his own interest rather than for publication. When he published his first book it was privately, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher. His friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration, and his name appears as publisher on the early impressions. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd), agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although the printing was done by the Westmorland Gazette in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, the Westmorland Gazette became his publisher, and its name appears on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. Wainwright's books were in turn taken over by Michael Joseph in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003, the rights were bought by Frances Lincoln. Between 2005 and 2009, all the Pictorial Guides were updated for the first time, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions were made by Chris Jesty, and the publishers used an imitation font of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes were the inclusion of photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs on the front covers, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and footpaths shown in red on the maps. These revised versions are titled 'Second Editions'. Revised editions of Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, A Coast to Coast Walk, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland, Pennine Way Companion, Walks in Limestone Country and Walks on the Howgill Fells were published by Frances Lincoln between 2010 and 2014, with the amendments again being made by Chris Jesty. The publishers announced in 2014 that Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion, was working on the third edition of the Pictorial Guide, with the first volume, The Eastern Fells, published on 26 March 2015 followed by The Far Eastern Fells on 8 October 2015. These revised versions are titled 'Walkers Editions'. Subsequent volumes in the series to have been revised are The Central Fells (published 2016), The Southern Fells (2017) and The Northern Fells (2018); The North Western Fells and The Western Fells are due to be published in the spring of 2019 and 2020 respectively. Later works Wainwright followed the Pictorial Guides in 1968 with the Pennine Way Companion, applying the same detailed approach to Britain's first long- distance footpath. This was for many years a leading guide to the Pennine Way, rivalling the official guide book by Tom Stephenson. Wainwright's book consists of a continuous strip map of the route with accompanying commentary, with an unusual quirk: because the route goes from south to north (bottom to top on a map), contrary to normal reading order, the map and commentary start at the bottom of the last page and work upwards and backwards towards the front of the book. The guide was prepared with the aid of four helpers (Harry Appleyard, Len Chadwick, Cyril Moore and Lawrence Smith) and its preparation was affected by the major outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in 1966 and 1967, which closed access to many of the moors. In 1972 Wainwright devised the west‚Äìeast Coast to Coast Walk, as an alternative to the north‚Äìsouth Pennine Way. The Coast to Coast, he declares in his guidebook, which follows the same format as the Pennine Way Companion, \\"puts the Pennine Way to shame\\" for scenic beauty, variety and interest.A. Wainwright, A Coast to Coast Walk (London: Frances Lincoln, [1973] 2003). The 190-mile route traverses the north of England from St. Bees to Robin Hood's Bay, passing through the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors national parks. The Outlying Fells of Lakeland (an idea he had previously rejected), published in 1974, was his last major guidebook. Thereafter he concentrated on sketchbooks of larger-size line drawings until his eyesight began to fail in the mid-1980s. His Ex-Fellwanderer, an autobiographical work published in 1987, was intended to be his last written work, but he continued to lend his name and some written commentary to a series of \\"coffee table books\\" featuring the photography of Derry Brabbs. Television and radio By the mid-1980s Wainwright was a TV personality; he featured in three television series for the BBC, presented by farmer and broadcaster Eric Robson and devised, directed and produced by Richard Else. A BBC documentary about Wainwright's life was broadcast on Sunday 25 February 2007 on BBC Four, before a four-part series of walks. This first series covered Blencathra by Sharp Edge, Castle Crag, Haystacks and Scafell Pike from Seathwaite. The second series, broadcast in 2007, included Catbells, Crinkle Crags, Helm Crag, Helvellyn from Patterdale, High Street from Mardale and Pillar. A six-part series entitled Wainwright Walks: Coast to Coast was broadcast on BBC Four in April and May 2009 and on BBC2 from 21 July 2009, and presented by Julia Bradbury. A Granada TV series Wainwright Country included Eagle Crag, Great Calva, Knott Rigg, Pike O'Blisco, Stybarrow Dodd, Thornthwaite Crag and Yewbarrow. In 2010, Eric Robson presented a BBC Radio 4 documentary called \\"The Man behind the Mountains\\" (16 October 2010).Archive on Four: The Man Behind the Mountains (BBC website - retrieved 18 October 2010). Wainwright Walks Series One was released on DVD in June 2007 and Series Two was released in January 2008. Wainwright Walks: Coast to Coast was released on DVD in June 2009. Influence Innominate Tarn on Haystacks, Wainwright's favourite fell, where his ashes were scattered. Wainwright's Pictorial Guides have been in continuous publication since they were written and have sold more than two million copies. Although a number of more up-to-date guides are on the market, his books remain among the most popular for their depth, detail and unique style. His division of the Lake District into seven areas, and choice of fells to include, have been followed in whole or in part by subsequent writers such as Mark Richards.Mark Richards website The Coast to Coast Walk is one of the most popular long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom despite its lack of official status, and has spawned various guidebooks by other authors. In 2003 it was voted the second best walk in the world in a survey of experts conducted by Country Walking magazine.\\"Coast walk tops trek to Everest\\", BBC News, 23 November 2004, . Retrieved 22 October 2006. The popularity of Wainwright's books of drawings and large-format photographic books has not matched that of the guides. The 214 fells described in the Pictorial Guides are now generally known as the Wainwrights, and visiting them all is a common form of peak bagging. The Long Distance Walkers Association maintains a register of walkers who have completed the Wainwrights; there were 674 people on the list, of whom 40 had completed more than once.Long Distance Walkers Association ‚Äì Hill Walkers Register . Retrieved 7 March 2008. Dave Hewitt estimates that the total number of completers could be over 50% higher than the LDWA's figure.Dave Hewitt, \\"Interlude: A few thoughts on Fellbagging\\" in Hewitt (ed.), A Bit of Grit on Haystacks (Disley: Millrace, 2004), pp. 87‚Äì88 The Ramblers Association reported in 2008 that a boy of six years, four months and 27 days had become the youngest person to complete the Wainwrights. In April 2009 a boy aged five completed the round and became the third member of his family to do so after his older sisters held the 'Youngest 214 Completer' previously.Online Fellwalking Club - Regal Regans Claim the 214 Crown! Wainwrights On The Air is a scheme whereby amateur radio enthusiasts aim to make contact with or from the Wainwright summits. Plaque in Wainwright's Yard, Kendal Wainwright was a supporter of animal rights and explained that the publisher of his books gave most of the profits from his books to animal charities. In 1972 he became chairman of Animal Rescue Cumbria, and donated enough money to enable the foundation in 1984 of Kapellan, a shelter for stray cats and dogs in Kendal. After his death the society was renamed \\"Animal Rescue Cumbria ‚Äì The Wainwright Shelter\\". The Wainwright Society was inaugurated in 2002, with the aim of keeping alive the fellwalking traditions and ideas promoted by Alfred Wainwright through his guidebooks and other publications. On 27 June 2008 a landmark road bridge, in Blackburn, was opened and named the Wainwright Bridge in his honour. John Burland, founder of the Wainwright Society, wrote and devised a dramatic presentation of his life and works which was presented at the Wildman Theatre at Ilkley Playhouse as part of the Ilkley Literature Festival on 15 October 2009. During 2010 and 2011 a further 17 presentations were made. In 2013, a memorial toposcope was unveiled on the hills near his home town of Blackburn. A pedestrian area of Kendal, including the office of Wainwright's first publisher the Westmorland Gazette, is named Wainwright's Yard and features a display of pages from his books.

He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity as the most perfect of all knights. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the Lancelot‚ÄìGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. His name should not be mistaken with Galehaut, a different knight from Arthurian legend. Origins The story of Galahad and his quest for the Holy Grail is a relatively late addition to the Arthurian legend. Galahad does not feature in any romance by Chr√©tien de Troyes, or in Robert de Boron's Grail stories, or in any of the continuations of Chr√©tien's story of the mysterious castle of the Fisher King. He first appears in a 13th-century Old French Arthurian epic, the interconnected set of romances known as the Vulgate Cycle. \\"Gallad's\\" left The original conception of Galahad, whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the Vulgate Cycle, may derive from the mystical Cistercian Order. According to some interpreters, the philosophical inspiration of the celibate, otherworldly character of the monastic knight Galahad came from this monastic order set up by St. Bernard of Clairvaux.Pauline Matarasso, The Redemption of Chivalry. Geneva, 1979. The Cistercian-Bernardine concept of Catholic warrior asceticism that so distinguishes the character of Galahad also informs St. Bernard's projection of ideal chivalry in his work on the Knights Templar, the Liber ad milites templi de laude novae militiae. Significantly, in the narratives, Galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross, the very same emblem given to the Knights Templar by Pope Eugene III. In medieval literature =Conception and birth= The life of Galahad portrayed in a stained glass window at St. Mary & St. George Anglican Church in Jasper, Alberta The circumstances surrounding Galahad's conception derive from the earlier parts of Grail prose cycles. It takes place when King Arthur's greatest knight, Lancelot, mistakes Elaine of Corbenic for his secret mistress, Queen Guinevere. In the French tale used by Thomas Malory, King Pelles has already received magical foreknowledge that Lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world, the knight chosen by God to discover the Holy Grail. Pelles also knows that Lancelot will only lie with his one true love, Guinevere. Destiny will have to be helped along a little; therefore, a conclusion which prompts Pelles to seek out \\"one of the greatest enchantresses of the time,\\" Dame Brusen, who gives Pelles a magic ring that makes Elaine take on the appearance of Guinevere and enables her to spend a night with Lancelot. On discovering the deception, Lancelot draws his sword on Elaine, but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together, he is immediately forgiving; however, he does not marry Elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to Arthur's court. The young Galahad is born and placed in the care of a great aunt, who is an abbess at a nunnery, to be raised there. According to the 13th-century Old French Prose Lancelot (part of the Vulgate Cycle), \\"Galahad\\" was Lancelot's original name, but it was changed when he was a child. At his birth, therefore, Galahad is given his father's own original name. Merlin prophesies that Galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the Holy Grail. Pelles, Galahad's maternal grandfather, is portrayed as a descendant of Joseph of Arimathea's brother-in-law Bron also known as Galahad (Galaad), whose line had been entrusted with the Grail by Joseph. =Knighthood and the Grail Quest= Sir Galahad by left Upon reaching adulthood, Galahad is reunited with his father Lancelot, who knights his son after being defeated by him. Galahad is then brought to King Arthur's court at Camelot during Pentecost, where he is accompanied by a very old knight who immediately leads him over to the Round Table and unveils his seat at the Siege Perilous, an unused chair that has been kept vacant for the sole person who will succeed in the quest of the Holy Grail. For all others who have aspired to sit there, it has proved to be immediately fatal. Galahad survives this test, witnessed by Arthur who, upon realising the greatness of this new knight, leads him out to the river where a magic sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading \\"Never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side I ought to hang; and he shall be the best knight of the world.\\" (The embedding of a sword in a stone is also an element of the legends of Arthur's original sword, the sword in the stone. In Malory's version, this is the sword that had belonged to Balin.) Galahad accomplishes this test with ease, and Arthur swiftly proclaims him to be the greatest knight ever. Galahad is promptly invited to become a Knight of the Round Table, and soon afterwards, Arthur's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the Grail. The quest to seek out this holy object is begun at once. All of the Knights of the Round Table set out to find the Grail.Vinaver, Eugene, 1971. Malory: Works. Oxford University Press. The Tale of the Sankgreal, Briefly Drawn out of French, which is a Tale Chronicled for One of the Truest and one of the Holiest that is in this World. 1. \\"The Departure\\". pp. 515‚Äì524. It is Galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the Grail; the rest of the knights follow him. Arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus, for he discerns that many will never be seen again, dying in their quest. Arthur fears that it is the beginning of the end of the Round Table. This might be seen as a theological statement that concludes that earthly endeavours must take second place to the pursuit of the holy. Galahad, in some ways, mirrors Arthur, drawing a sword from a stone in the way that Arthur did. In this manner, Galahad is declared to be the chosen one. Galahad at the Castle of Maidens, an 1890 painting by Edwin Austin Abbey Further uniquely among the Round Table, Galahad is capable of doing more miracles, such as banishing demons and healing the sick. For the most part he travels alone during the Grail Quest, smiting (and often sparing) his enemies, rescuing fellow knights including Percival and saving maidens in distress, until he is finally reunited with Bors and Percival. These three knights then come across Percival's sister, who leads them to the mystical Ship of Solomon which they use to cross the sea to an island where Galahad finds King David's sword. =Ascension to Heaven= Grail, an 1895 painting by Edwin Austin Abbeyalt= After many adventures, Galahad and Percival find themselves in the mystical castle of Corbenic at the court of Pelles and Eliazar, his son. These men bring Galahad into a room where he is finally allowed to see the Holy Grail. Galahad is asked to take the vessel to the holy island Sarras. After seeing the Grail, Galahad, however, makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing. So it is, while making his way back to Arthur's court, Galahad is visited by Joseph of Arimathea, and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die. Galahad bids Percival and Bors farewell, after which angels appear to take him to Heaven, an ascension witnessed by Bors and Percival. While it is not explicit that the Holy Grail is never to be seen again on Earth, it is stated (in Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) that there has since then been no knight capable of obtaining it. Galahad's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the Holy Grail was predicted before his birth, not only by Pelles but also by Merlin, who once had told Uther Pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the \\"table of Joseph\\", but that he was not yet born. At first this knight was believed to be Percival; however it is later discovered to be Galahad. Galahad's conception is later glossed by Malory: \\"And so by enchantment [Elaine] won the love of Lancelot, and certainly she loved him again passing well.\\" Galahad was conceived for the divine purpose of seeking the Holy Grail,Waite, Arthur. The Holy Grail: The Galahad Quest in the Arthurian Literature. New York: University Books, 1961. but this happened through pure deceit; under a cloak of deception that was very similar, in fact, to that which led to the conception of Arthur and of Merlin himself. Despite this, Galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the Holy Grail. Galahad, in both the Lancelot-Grail cycle and in Malory's retelling, is exalted above all the other knights: he is the one worthy enough to have the Holy Grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven. Victorian portrayals =Tennyson= Alfred Turner with quotation from Tennyson and list of fallen Old Victorians; World War I memorial at Victoria College, Jersey. The figure of Galahad was frequently used in British military propaganda during WWI and World War IIhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv136bvg0 In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Galahad's incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the Holy Grail are traced back to his piety. According to the legend, only pure knights may achieve the Grail. While in a specific sense, this \\"purity\\" refers to chastity, Galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result, he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him. This quality is reflected in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem \\"Sir Galahad\\": > My good blade carves the casques of men, / My tough lance thrusteth sure, / > My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure.Tennyson, > Alfred Lord: Wordsworth Poetry Library, 1994. The Works of Alfred Lord > Tennyson. Wordsworth Editions Limited. Sir Galahad, published 1834. pp. > 181‚Äì182. Beginning of the first stanza. Camelot Project Galahad is able to conquer all of his enemies because he is pure. In the next verse of this poem, Tennyson continues to glorify Galahad for remaining pure at heart, by putting these words into his mouth: > I never felt the kiss of love, / Nor maiden's hand in mine. Galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course, sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal: > Then move the trees, the copses nod, / Wings flutter, voices hover clear / > \\"O just and faithful knight of God! / Ride on! the prize is near.\\" Tennyson's poem follows Galahad's journey to find the Holy Grail but ends while he is still riding, still seeking, still dreaming; as if to say that the quest for the Holy Grail is an ongoing task. Unlike many other portrayals of the legend of Sir Galahad, Tennyson has Sir Galahad speak in the first person, gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest, rather than just the details of his battles, as in Malory. =William Morris= Sir Galahad by alt= Sir Galahad's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by William Morris in his poems The Chapel in Lyoness, published in 1856, and Sir Galahad, a Christmas Mystery,Sir Galahad, a Christmas Mystery Camelot Project published in 1858. Unlike Malory and Tennyson's pure hero, Morris creates a Galahad who is emotionally complex, conflicted, and palpably human. In A Christmas Mystery, written more than twenty years after Tennyson's Sir Galahad, Galahad is \\"fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human,\\" and tries to reconcile his longing for earthly delights, such as the romantic exploits of Sir Palomydes and his father Sir Lancelot, and the \\"more austere spiritual goal to which he has been called.\\" In the companion piece The Chapel in Lyoness, a knight lies dying in winter \\"in a bizarre realization of Galahad's nightmare vision of his own fate\\". Galahad then \\"saves\\" the knight with a kiss before he finally expires. It is here that Galahad progresses from \\"a somewhat self-centred figure\\" to \\"a savior capable of imparting grace\\". Morris‚Äô poems place this emotional conflict at centre stage, rather than concentrating upon Galahad's prowess for defeating external enemies, and the cold and the frost of a Christmas period serve to reinforce his \\"chilly isolation\\". The poem opens on midwinter's night; Sir Galahad has been sitting for six hours in a chapel, staring at the floor. He muses to himself: > Night after night your horse treads down alone / The sere damp fern, night > after night you sit / Holding the bridle like a man of stone, / Dismal, > unfriended: what thing comes of it?Morris, William. 1858. Sir Galahad, A > Christmas Mystery. Camelot Project Sixth stanza. Twentieth century and later Statue of Sir Galahad on Parliament Hill in Ottawa: \\"Erected by the people to commemorate the act of heroism of Henry Albert Harper. In attempting to save the life of Miss Bessie Blair he was carried with her into the waters of the Ottawa River. It was December 6, 1901. He was 28 years old.\\" =Literature= * A poem by Thomas de Beverly published in 1925, \\"The Birth of Sir Galahad\\", tells of the events leading up to the conception of Sir Galahad, his birth and a visit soon afterwards by Sir Bors, to see Elaine and the baby Galahad. Sir Bors sees a vision of the Holy Grail whilst in a chapel with the baby and his mother. Of the three knights who are untainted by sin ‚Äì Sir Perceval, Sir Bors, and Sir Galahad ‚Äì Galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honour of attaining the Holy Grail.Thomas de Beverly. 1925. The Birth of Galahad. Camelot Project This is similar to God declaring that King David had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the Jerusalem Temple, this honour falling only to his son King Solomon.1 Chronicles, Ch. 22, 8, ‚Äì quoted in Alec G. Warner, Biblical Motives in Twentieth Century Literature\\" in Barbara Kid (ed.) \\"New Essays on British and American Literature\\", New York, 1982. *Edmund Wilson's story \\"Galahad\\", published in 1927, presents a humorous story about the attempted seduction of a virginal high school student by a debutante. * In John Erskine's novel Galahad: Enough of His Life to Explain His Reputation, Galahad's main tutor for his knightly training is Queen Guinevere. Erskine follows Malory's text through Galahad's childhood. Just as in Le Morte d'Arthur, Galahad grows up in the court of his mother Elaine and travels to King Arthur's court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight. When Galahad arrives at the court, Guinevere is upset with Lancelot because he does not want to be her lover any more and she takes an interest in the young knight, persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties. At first Galahad seems content with just being an ordinary Knight of the Round Table, going out on quests and saving maidens in distress. Guinivere is the main contributor to Galahad's destiny in this work. She says, \\"You'll waste your life if you don't accomplish something new, something entirely your own.\\"Erskine 192 This is Galahad's motivation to seek the Grail. * Matt Cohen satirises Galahad's virtuous character in his short story \\"Too Bad Galahad\\". Cohen describes Galahad as the perfect knight who does no harm. In part, \\"Galahad's virtue is a compensation for Lancelot's indiscretion\\". However, Cohen, instead of glorifying Galahad's virtuous character, makes it into a weakness. He writes that Galahad tried to \\"swear and kill and wench with the rest of the knights but he could never really get into it.\\" Cohen's Galahad is not well liked by the other knights because he is so perfect and seems unapproachable. Cohen pokes fun at Galahad's \\"calling\\" by saying that his life would be wasted if he failed to remain pure and holy in order to be the bearer of the Holy Grail. * Thomas Berger's Arthur Rex portrays Galahad differently. In most works, Galahad is depicted as an emblem of perfection. Berger shows Galahad's arrival to court in a more satirical light. Gawain comments that he cannot tell whether he is male or female. Berger shows that even though Galahad is in fact the greatest knight in the world, he does not appear to be. Appearance versus reality is a common theme throughout this novel. In most versions of the story of Sir Galahad, Galahad's death comes about after his greatest achievement, that of the Holy Grail. In Arthur Rex, however, Galahad is killed in a battle where he mistakes his own father Lancelot for a Saxon. Galahad is too weak and sleeps through most of the battle and, when he does wake up, he kills his father as well as being killed himself. Just like the Grail, perfection is unattainable; only glimpses of the Grail and of perfection can be seen. * In the Everworld fantasy novel series by K. A. Applegate, the character David Levin fights with the Sword of Galahad, after witnessing Sir Galahad's death. David is the self-appointed leader of the protagonists and takes on all the burdens of the group, being troubled by his past in which he was cowardly and feeling he must prove himself to be a man ‚Äì in which could be seen some parallels with Galahad's life. * In Ayn Rand's novel We the Living, the character Andrei Taganov, an honest and idealistic revolutionary Communist, sacrifices his career and resorts to blackmail in order to save the life of Leo, the lover of Kira‚Äîthe woman that Andrei loves; though hating Leo and intensely jealous of him, Andrei puts Kira's happiness before his own. The villain Pavel Syerov calls Andrei in derision \\"Sir Galahad of the blackmail sword\\";Ayn Rand, We the Living, Part Two, Ch. KIV. thereupon, Andrei accepts the comparison as appropriate. *The Lady of the Lake, the final book of The Witcher saga by Andrzej Sapkowski, features Knight Galaad of Caer Benic, working for King Arthur. At the very beginning of the story, as a denizen of a parallel world, he encounters Cirilla of Cintra and calls her the Lady of the Lake. *In Sam Selvon‚Äôs 1956 novel The Lonely Londoners, central character Moses Aloesa meets fellow Trinidadian √©migr√© Henry Oliver and nicknames him Galahad. * Neil Gaiman's short story \\"Chivalry\\" from Smoke & Mirrors includes Galahad in his quest for the Holy Grail. =Music= * Joan Baez uses the legend metaphorically in her song \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\", which is about the courtship of her sister. * The band America mentions Galahad (\\"... or the tropic of Sir Galahad\\") in the chorus for the song \\"Tin Man\\". * On his EP To the Yet Unknowing World, Josh Ritter has a song titled \\"Galahad\\", which jokes about Galahad's chastity and the 'virtue' of his supposed purity. *In Mili's album Miracle Milk, in the song \\"Ga1ahad and Scientific Witchery\\", Galahad is portrayed as a knight who was reanimated by a witch. *Marty Stuart uses part of the last stanza in the outro of the concept album The Pilgrim. Johnny Cash speaks as God, describing the Pilgrim as a just and faithful knight, before singing the final line of the album. =Film and television= * Galahad is portrayed by Michael Palin in Monty Python and The Holy Grail. The movie makes a satire of Galahad's purity as his chastity is put to the test when he finds a castle full of sexually charged nuns. * In the 1998 miniseries Merlin, the title character meets Galahad and his parents while looking for a suitable regent for Camelot while Arthur searches for the Grail. Merlin brings Lancelot back with him, and after the sorrows that subsequently befall Camelot, the Lady of the Lake reveals that Merlin was meant to pick Galahad, and that his mistake proves how human he truly is. * Galahad is portrayed by Hugh Dancy in the 2004 action adventure King Arthur. * John Larroquette played an elderly yet immortal Galahad (now known as Jenkins) in the TV series The Librarians. * Galahad is a Knightmare frame piloted by the Knight of One, Bismarck Waldstein, in the anime Code Geass. * In the film Kingsman: The Secret Service and its sequel, Galahad is the code name of Colin Firth's character Harry Hart, later assumed by Taron Egerton's character, Gary \\"Eggsy\\" Unwin. =Games= *He is represented by Silver the Hedgehog in the 2009 video game Sonic and the Black Knight. * In the 2015 video game The Order: 1886, the main character is an heir to the title of Sir Galahad, and is therefore referred to as such. *In the video game Fate/Grand Order, Galahad is a Heroic Spirit that was fused with a girl, making the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight, under the class of Shielder. * The card game Android: NetrunnerFantasy Flight Games features a card named Galahad.

Floyd D. Rose invented the locking vibrato in 1976, the first of its kind, and it is now manufactured by a company of the same name. The Floyd Rose gained popularity in the 1980s through guitarists like Eddie Van Halen, Neal Schon, Brad Gillis, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Alex Lifeson, who used its ability to stay in tune even with extreme changes in pitch. Its tuning stability comes through the double-locking design that has been widely regarded as revolutionary; the design has been listed on Guitar Worlds \\"10 Most Earth Shaking Guitar Innovations\\" and Guitar Players \\"101 Greatest Moments in Guitar History 1979‚Äì1983.\\" History Floyd D. Rose first started working on what became the Floyd Rose Tremolo in 1976. He was playing in a rock band at the time, inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Deep Purple. He frequently used the vibrato bar but couldn't make his guitars stay in tune using traditional approaches like lubricating the nut, or winding the strings as little as possible around the tuning pegs. At the time, Rose made and sold jewelry, and so had the skills and tools to fabricate small metal parts. After noticing the strings moved freely with the regular nut design, he made a brass nut that locked the strings in place with three U-shaped clamps. He installed this nut in his 1957 Fender Stratocaster. Later he improved this design by using hardened steel‚Äîotherwise the strings wore the clamps down too quickly‚Äîand redesigned the bridge, which also locked the strings with clamps. Rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts, which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time, such as Eddie Van Halen. Other well-known guitarists who picked it up early were Neal Schon, who purportedly got serial number 3, Brad Gillis (serial number 4), and Steve Vai. The first patent was awarded in 1979, ‚Äî bridge mechanism patent; and shortly afterward, Rose made an agreement with Kramer Guitars because he could no longer keep up with demand manufacturing the bridges by hand. Kramer's guitar models with the Floyd Rose bridge became very popular, leading them to drop the earlier Rockinger vibrato in favor of the Floyd Rose between June 1982 and January 1983. The Floyd Rose design's popularity led to other companies making similar bridges, thus violating the patent. Notably, courts found that the Kahler Tremolo System infringed on Floyd Rose's patents, and awarded a judgment in excess of $100M against Gary Kahler. Floyd Rose and Kramer went on to make licensing agreements with other manufacturers, and there are now several different models available based on the double-locking design. Because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design, and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut. ‚Äî first fine tuners and saddle patent; ‚Äî second fine tuners and saddle patent; In January 1991, Kramer's exclusive distribution agreement with Rose ended when Fender announced they would be the new exclusive distributor of Floyd Rose products. While Fender used Floyd Rose-licensed vibrato systems previously, this move allowed Fender to offer a few models with the original Floyd Rose Tremolo, such as the Richie Sambora Signature Strat in 1991, the Floyd Rose Classic Stratocaster in 1992 and the Set-Neck Floyd Rose Strat in 1993. Floyd Rose collaborated with Fender to design a Fender Deluxe Locking Tremolo, introduced in 1991 on the Strat Plus Deluxe, the USA Contemporary Stratocaster, and the Strat Ultra. Fender used the Floyd Rose-designed locking vibrato system on certain humbucker- equipped American Deluxe and Showmaster models until 2007. In 2005, distribution of the Floyd Rose Original reverted to Floyd Rose, whereas the patented designs were licensed to other manufacturers to use. Principles The basic principles of the action of a double-locking floating bridge are shown. Its proportions are exaggerated to demonstrate the effect. Position I illustrates the normal position of an ideally tuned Floyd Rose bridge. The bridge (orange) balances on a pivot point, being pulled counter-clockwise by the strings' tension and clockwise by typically one to five springs. Controlled by special tuning screws (purple), these two forces are balanced such that the bridge's surface is parallel to the guitar body (olive). The strings are locked tightly with a special mechanism at the nut (green) as well as at the bridge (turquoise), hence \\"double-locking\\". Position II illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pushed down towards the guitar body. The bridge rotates around a pivot point counter-clockwise and the tension in each string decreases, lowering the pitch of each string. The sound of any notes being played becomes flat. While the tension of the strings decreases, the tension of the springs increases. It is the balance between string-tension and spring-tension, as well as the fact that the strings end at the bridge saddles and nut (eliminating \\"play\\" in the string, which would negatively affect tuning), that brings the strings reliably back into tune when force on the bar is removed. Position III illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pulled up away from the guitar body. The bridge rotates clockwise, tension in the strings increases, the pitch of the sound increases and so notes sound sharper than normal. Due to the limitations on the assembly's movement imposed by the guitar's body, the amount of available pitch change is much larger when the bar is depressed than when it is lifted. Note that when using the vibrato bar, string action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard) is affected, and this can sometimes cause the strings to unintentionally touch the frets and create unwanted sounds on instruments set up with extremely low action and heavily recessed vibrato installations. Advantages and disadvantages The main advantage of the Floyd Rose vibrato system is its double-locking design. This makes the guitar stay in tune through large pitch changes, e.g., forcing the vibrato bar all the way down to the guitar body, or pulling up on the bar to raise the tone by as much as a fifth or a seventh. A typical bridge set-up has it \\"float\\"‚Äîso the player can both raise and lower the pitch with the vibrato bar. However, if a string breaks, the balance of tensions on the bridge is disrupted, leaving the bridge out of position and therefore the guitar out of tune. Moreover, since the tension of one string affects the tension of all the others, it can take several iterations through the tuning process before the instrument is tuned. Some players, including Eddie Van Halen, prefer to instead have a \\"half- floating\\" bridge, which allows only downwards motion. This means the cavity of the tremolo pocket is not fully milled away underneath‚Äîand if the tension of the rear springs is slightly stronger than the tension of the strings, the tremolo always rests flush with the body. In this set-up, a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings, as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string doesn't make the bridge move, since it already presses against the body of the guitar. This also allows fitting a device to the bridge that can drop the low E-string down to D to extend the tonal variety of the guitar, even during live performance. Bending, however, still affects the rest of the strings, which makes some double-stop techniques more difficult to achieve. The bridge's effect on the tone of the guitar is a topic of much disagreement. Some players find that the Floyd Rose bridge has a \\"thin\\" tone, which has led to the development of replacement sustain blocks. These blocks are generally larger in size than the standard block and may be constructed from a similar brass alloy or an alternative like titanium or copper. According to reviews this modification might lead to a preferable change in the tonal quality of the guitar. Models and varieties Floyd Rose Pro Licensed Ibanez Floyd Rose variant Floyd Rose SpeedLoader * Floyd Rose Original is the oldest model still in production. Since 1977, production models bearing this name are mostly the same as the first model, with only minor changes. Note that the name \\"Floyd Rose Original\\" is used to differentiate this system from \\"Floyd Rose Licensed\\". The first Original Floyds were double locking, but had no fine tuners, so players had to unclamp the nut every time they retuned the guitar. * Floyd Rose II is a lower end version of the Original Floyd used mostly on import and mid-range instruments. Originally, Floyd IIs were single locking, locking only at the nut. Later versions were made double locking, but used weaker materials than the Original Floyd Rose, making them less dependable. * Floyd Rose Pro is a low-profile version of Floyd Rose Original. The bridge and arm design is changed in such a way that the guitarist's hand is generally closer to the strings while holding the vibrato arm. The bridge has a narrower string spacing (0.400 inches or 10.16 mm in this design versus 0.420 inches or 10.66 mm of the Floyd Rose Original). * Floyd Rose SpeedLoader Tremolo is a redesign developed in 1995‚Äì1999 and introduced around 2003 that combines Floyd Rose Original with the SpeedLoader system, and requires special strings and is manufactured under license of McCabe US Patents for \\"macrotuners\\", ie. full-range tuners. * Floyd Rose 1000 and Floyd Rose Special is made with the same design as the Original but manufactured in South Korea. The Floyd Rose 1000 is built with the same materials as the Original, however the Floyd Rose Special utilizes substitute materials such as zinc alloy saddles instead of steel and a zinc alloy sustain block instead of brass which significantly decreases the cost of the Special model. * Fender Deluxe Locking Tremolo. A specially designed system that was made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in 1991 in conjunction with Floyd Rose, utilizing locking tuners, a modified Fender 2-point synchronized vibrato with locking bridge saddles and a special low-friction LSR Roller Nut that lets strings slide during vibrato use. This is a double locking system, except the other locking point is at the tuner instead of nut. =Floyd Rose Licensed Models= Previously, all similar double locking vibrato systems were produced under license from Floyd Rose, and marked as such, but in 2003 the relevant patents expired. * Yamaha Finger Clamp is a variety of Floyd Rose that have built-in levers, and thus when tuning, no allen keys are needed. Available on the RGX520DZ, RGX620DZ and CV820 Wes Borland signature model. * Vigier Floyd Rose created by Vigier guitars at the beginning of the '90s, this system uses force-tolerant needle bearings for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced tuning stability. The ball-bearing and global tuner features are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe‚Äîsee U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841. * Kahler 2700 Series (Killer, Steeler, and Spyder) made in the late 80's by Kahler, designed by David Petschulat, this system used a knife-edge fulcrum bridge (unlike the typical Kahler cam system). The string locks at the bridge were embossed FLOYD ROSE LIC. * Ibanez Edge is Ibanez's Floyd Rose variant. There are 4 primary versions: Edge, LoPro Edge, EdgePro, and EdgeZero with numbered variants denoting budget models of the main lines, and also \\"Double\\" variants of many of these, the moniker denoting the inclusion of Piezo pickups. The Edge and LoPro Edge were discontinued in 2003 but were subsequently reintroduced on the signature models of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. (Some special edition guitars used these trems prior to their reintroduction; however, the vibratos used were NOS, rather than production runs.) These two vibratos, whether old or new, bear a mark of Floyd Rose Licensing, as they are produced using the same tooling, by Japanese guitar parts manufacturer Gotoh. * Ibanez Zero Resistance uses a ball-bearing mechanic instead of knife-edge as the joint, and a stop-bar to help the guitar stay in tune after diving the vibrato. Ibanez claims this system improves tuning stability after breaking a string.Ibanez - ZR Tremolo guide These springs, including their orientation, are referred to as the ZPS system, with variants numbered 1 to 3, and are also present as part of the EdgeZero design. The ball-bearing and global tuner features are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe‚Äîsee U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841. * Ibanez Fixed Edge, while it still uses the locking nut and locking bridge, was mounted on top of the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a familiar feel to vibrato users, and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar. Popular use Alex Lifeson of Rush playing a Gibson Les Paul Custom with a Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo The Floyd Rose Tremolo rose to popularity in the early 1980s. Many popular artists quickly adopted the device, making it difficult to measure how much each individual artist contributed to that popularity. Most sources consider Eddie Van Halen a pioneer of Floyd Rose usage. Other players frequently cited as influential Floyd Rose users are Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Kirk Hammett, Brad Gillis, Tom Morello, Allan Holdsworth, and Dimebag Darrell.Reinventing The Squeal References Patents Floyd Rose holds a number of patents on floating bridge design: * ‚Äî bridge mechanism patent; * ‚Äî first fine tuners and saddle patent; * ‚Äî second fine tuners and saddle patent; * ‚Äî spring and claw mechanism; * ‚Äî early patent for a tremstopper device; * ‚Äî patent for Floyd Rose Pro, low-profile version; External links * Floyd Rose website *Floyd Rose Interview for NAMM Oral History Program Guitar bridges 1977 musical instruments ","title":"Floyd Rose"},{"id":"172666","text":"The Big Red One is a 1980 epic war film written and directed by Samuel Fuller starring Lee Marvin alongside an ensemble supporting cast including Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Siegfried Rauch, Bobby Di Cicco, and Kelly Ward. Based on Fuller's own experiences, it was produced independently on a low budget, shot on location in Israel as a cost-saving measure. It was heavily cut on its original release, but a restored version, The Big Red One: The Reconstruction, premi√®red at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, seven years after Fuller's death. Fuller wrote a book, with the same title, which was more a companion novel than a novelization of the film, although it features many of the scenes that were originally cut. Background Patch of the United States Army's 1st Infantry Division. Fuller was a World War II veteran and served with the 1st Infantry Division, which is nicknamed The Big Red One for the red numeral \\"1\\" on the Division's shoulder patch. He received the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart during his service. He was present at the liberation of the Falkenau concentration camp. Plot In November 1918, a private (Lee Marvin), using his trench knife, kills a surrendering German soldier. When he returns to his company's headquarters, the private is told that the \\"war's been over for four hours.\\" In November 1942, the soldier, now a sergeant in the \\"Big Red One,\\" leads his squad of infantrymen through North Africa; they are initially fired on by a Vichy French general, who is then overpowered by his French troops who are loyal to Free France. Over the next two years, the squad serves in campaigns in Sicily, where they are given intelligence by Matteo (Matteo Zoffoli), who provides the location of a Tiger I tank, and are fed by grateful Sicilian women; Omaha Beach, at the start of the Normandy Campaign; the liberation of France, where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum; and the invasion of western Germany. The sergeant's German counterpart, Schroeder (Siegfried Rauch), participates in many of the same battles and displays a ruthless loyalty to Hitler and Germany. At different times, he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers, but not murderers. During the advance across northern France, the squad crosses the same field where the sergeant killed the surrendering German, where a memorial now stands. Schroeder has sprinkled his own men among the German dead from a recent battle, however, the sergeant smells a trap and checks out the bodies in the burned out tank. Noticing that the piping on the German uniforms is not consistent he silences the living Germans in the tank. Feigning orders from his commander on the radio, the sergeant begins leading his mean away, while quietly telling them that there are living Germans about. One of the German troops shoots prematurely and is killed by Schroeder. The Germans are wiped out by the squad with only minor injuries, and Schroeder makes good his escape. While patching up their wounded, a French couple arrives on a motorcycle and sidecar. The husband dies of his previous wounds, but not before begging the sergeant to help his pregnant wife. The squad clears the tank and puts the woman in labor in the tank. After a somewhat comical series of attempts to help the mother give birth, a child is born. The squad's final action in the war is the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night, having just buried a young boy he had befriended earlier after liberating the camp. Schroeder approaches, attempting to surrender, but the sergeant stabs him. His squad then arrives, and informs him that the \\"war's been over for four hours.\\" This time, as the squad walks away, Private Griff (Mark Hamill) notices that Schroeder is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment.

Fuller directed Merrill's Marauders as a dry run for the film. When Fuller argued with Jack L. Warner and his studio over cuts they made to Merrill's Marauders, the plans for The Big Red One were dropped.Fuller, Samuel. A Third Face. Alfred A. Knopf (2002) In the project's early stages, at Jack L. Warner's urging John Wayne was lined up to play the sergeant, but Fuller felt that he was not right for the role. Peter Bogdanovich helped set up the film at Paramount Pictures, which paid Fuller to write a script. However, when Paramount head Frank Yablans left the studio, the project was in turnaround. It shifted over to Lorimar with Bogdanovich to produce (he says Fuller wanted him to play the Robert Carradine part) but then Bogdanovich pulled out and brought in Gene Corman to produce.John Gallagher, \\"Between Action and Cut\\", August 2004 accessed 3 June 2013 = The Reconstruction = The restored version, dubbed \\"The Reconstruction,\\" adds 47 minutes to the film's running time, bringing it much closer to the form Fuller imagined before the studio took it away from him.

Lloyd is considered alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most influential film comedians of the silent film era. Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and \\"talkies\\", between 1914 and 1947. His bespectacled \\"Glasses\\" characterAusterlitz, Saul (2010). Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film Comedy. Chicago Review Press. p. 28. . was a resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States. His films frequently contained \\"thrill sequences\\" of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) is considered one of the most enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd performed the lesser stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right handAn American Comedy; Lloyd and Stout; 1928; page 129 (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, and was almost undetectable on the screen). He was far more prolific than Chaplin (releasing 12 feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four), and made more money overall ($15.7 million to Chaplin's $10.5 million). Early life Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard, Nebraska, the son of James Darsie Lloyd and Sarah Elisabeth Fraser. His paternal great-grandparents were Welsh. In 1910, after his father had several business venture failures, Lloyd's parents divorced and his father moved with his son to San Diego, California. Lloyd had acted in theater since a child, but in California he began acting in one-reel film comedies around 1912. Career =Silent shorts and features= Lloyd worked with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and his first role was a small part as a Yaqui Indian in the production of The Old Monk's Tale. At the age of 20, Lloyd moved to Los Angeles, and took up roles in several Keystone Film Company comedies. He was also hired by Universal Studios as an extra and soon became friends with aspiring filmmaker Hal Roach. Lloyd began collaborating with Roach who had formed his own studio in 1913. Roach and Lloyd created \\"Lonesome Luke\\", similar to and playing off the success of Charlie Chaplin films. Lloyd hired Bebe Daniels as a supporting actress in 1914; the two of them were involved romantically and were known as \\"The Boy\\" and \\"The Girl\\". In 1919, she left Lloyd to pursue her dramatic aspirations. Later that year, Lloyd replaced Daniels with Mildred Davis, whom he would later marry. Lloyd was tipped off by Hal Roach to watch Davis in a movie. Reportedly, the more Lloyd watched Davis the more he liked her. Lloyd's first reaction in seeing her was that \\"she looked like a big French doll\\". 1917 advertisement featuring Lloyd as \\"Lonesome Luke\\", with Snub Pollard and Bebe Daniels By 1918, Lloyd and Roach had begun to develop his character beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his \\"Glass\\" character (often named \\"Harold\\" in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The \\"Glass\\" character is said to have been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn- rimmed glasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque \\"Lonesome Luke\\". \\"When I adopted the glasses,\\" he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, \\"it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable.\\" Unlike most silent comedy personae, \\"Harold\\" was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character's debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd's Kids. Grandma's Boy (1922) On Sunday, August 24, 1919, while posing for some promotional still photographs in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he picked up what he thought was a prop bomb and lit it with a cigarette. It exploded and mangled his right hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was in the act of lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, \\"I thought I would surely be so disabled that I would never be able to work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive.' I still think so.\\" Beginning in 1921, Roach and Lloyd moved from shorts to feature-length comedies. These included the acclaimed Grandma's Boy, which (along with Chaplin's The Kid) pioneered the combination of complex character development and film comedy, the highly popular Safety Last! (1923), which cemented Lloyd's stardom (and is the oldest film on the American Film Institute's List of 100 Most Thrilling Movies), and Why Worry? (1923). Although Lloyd performed many athletic stunts in his films, Harvey Parry was his stunt double for the more dangerous sequences. Lloyd and Roach parted ways in 1924, and Lloyd became the independent producer of his own films. These included his most accomplished mature features Girl Shy, The Freshman (his highest-grossing silent feature), The Kid Brother, and Speedy, his final silent film. Welcome Danger (1929) was originally a silent film but Lloyd decided late in the production to remake it with dialogue. All of these films were enormously successful and profitable, and Lloyd would eventually become the highest paid film performer of the 1920s. They were also highly influential and still find many fans among modern audiences, a testament to the originality and film-making skill of Lloyd and his collaborators. From this success he became one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. =Talkies and transition= In 1924, Lloyd formed his own independent film production company, the Harold Lloyd Film Corporation, with his films distributed by Path√© and later Paramount and Twentieth Century-Fox. Lloyd was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The Milky Way (1936) Released a few weeks before the start of the Great Depression, Welcome Danger was a huge financial success, with audiences eager to hear Lloyd's voice on film. Lloyd's rate of film releases, which had been one or two a year in the 1920s, slowed to about one every two years until 1938. The films released during this period were: Feet First, with a similar scenario to Safety Last which found him clinging to a skyscraper at the climax; Movie Crazy with Constance Cummings; The Cat's-Paw, which was a dark political comedy and a big departure for Lloyd; and The Milky Way, which was Lloyd's only attempt at the fashionable genre of the screwball comedy film. To this point the films had been produced by Lloyd's company. However, his go- getting screen character was out of touch with Great Depression movie audiences of the 1930s. As the length of time between his film releases increased, his popularity declined, as did the fortunes of his production company. His final film of the decade, Professor Beware, was made by the Paramount staff, with Lloyd functioning only as actor and partial financier. On March 23, 1937, Lloyd sold the land of his studio, Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company, to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The location is now the site of the Los Angeles California Temple. Lloyd produced a few comedies for RKO Radio Pictures in the early 1940s but otherwise retired from the screen until 1947. He returned for an additional starring appearance in The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, an ill-fated homage to Lloyd's career, directed by Preston Sturges and financed by Howard Hughes. This film had the inspired idea of following Harold's Jazz Age, optimistic character from The Freshman into the Great Depression years. Diddlebock opened with footage from The Freshman (for which Lloyd was paid a royalty of $50,000, matching his actor's fee) and Lloyd was sufficiently youthful-looking to match the older scenes quite well. Lloyd and Sturges had different conceptions of the material and fought frequently during the shoot; Lloyd was particularly concerned that while Sturges had spent three to four months on the script of the first third of the film, \\"the last two-thirds of it he wrote in a week or less\\". The finished film was released briefly in 1947, then shelved by producer Hughes. Hughes issued a recut version of the film in 1951 through RKO under the title Mad Wednesday. Such was Lloyd's disdain that he sued Howard Hughes, the California Corporation and RKO for damages to his reputation \\"as an outstanding motion picture star and personality\\", eventually accepting a $30,000 settlement. =Radio and retirement= In October 1944, Lloyd emerged as the director and host of The Old Gold Comedy Theater, an NBC radio anthology series, after Preston Sturges, who had turned the job down, recommended him for it. The show presented half-hour radio adaptations of recently successful film comedies, beginning with Palm Beach Story with Claudette Colbert and Robert Young. Lloyd in 1946, when he was appointed to the Shriners' publicity committee Some saw The Old Gold Comedy Theater as being a lighter version of Lux Radio Theater, and it featured some of the best-known film and radio personalities of the day, including Fred Allen, June Allyson, Lucille Ball, Ralph Bellamy, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Herbert Marshall, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Jane Wyman, and Alan Young. But the show's half-hour format‚Äîwhich meant the material might have been truncated too severely‚Äîand Lloyd's sounding somewhat ill at ease on the air for much of the season (though he spent weeks training himself to speak on radio prior to the show's premiere, and seemed more relaxed toward the end of the series run) may have worked against it. The Old Gold Comedy Theater ended in June 1945 with an adaptation of Tom, Dick and Harry, featuring June Allyson and Reginald Gardiner and was not renewed for the following season. Many years later, acetate discs of 29 of the shows were discovered in Lloyd's home, and they now circulate among old-time radio collectors. Lloyd remained involved in a number of other interests, including civic and charity work. Inspired by having overcome his own serious injuries and burns, he was very active as a Freemason and Shriner with the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. He was a Past Potentate of Al-Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles, and was eventually selected as Imperial Potentate of the Shriners of North America for the year 1949‚Äì50.\\"Harold LLoyd\\" \\"In 1949, Harold's face graced the cover of TIME Magazine as the Imperial Potentate of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, their highest-ranking position. He devoted an entire year to visiting 130 temples across the country giving speeches for over 700,000 Shriners. The last twenty years of his life he worked tirelessly for the twenty-two Shriner Hospitals for Children and in the 1960s, he was named President and Chairman of the Board.\\" At the installation ceremony for this position on July 25, 1949, 90,000 people were present at Soldier Field, including then sitting U.S. President Harry S Truman, also a 33¬∞ Scottish Rite Mason. In recognition of his services to the nation and Freemasonry, Bro. Lloyd was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour in 1955 and coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, 33¬∞, in 1965. He appeared as himself on several television shows during his retirement, first on Ed Sullivan's variety show Toast of the Town June 5, 1949, and again on July 6, 1958. He appeared as the Mystery Guest on What's My Line? on April 26, 1953, and twice on This Is Your Life: on March 10, 1954 for Mack Sennett, and again on December 14, 1955, on his own episode. During both appearances, Lloyd's hand injury can clearly be seen. On November 6, 1956, The New York Times reported \\"Lloyd's Career Will Be Filmed.\\" It said, as first step, Lloyd will write the story of his life for Simon and Schuster. Then, the movie to be produced by Jerry Wald for 20th Century-Fox, will limit the screenplay to Lloyd's professional career. Tentative title for both: ‚ÄúThe Glass Character,‚Äù based on Lloyd wearing heavy, tortoise-shell glasses as a trademark. Neither project materialized. Lloyd studied colors and microscopy, and was very involved with photography, including 3D photography and color film experiments. Some of the earliest 2-color Technicolor tests were shot at his Beverly Hills home (these are included as extra material in the Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection DVD Box Set). He became known for his nude photographs of models, such as Bettie Page and stripper Dixie Evans, for a number of men's magazines. He also took photos of Marilyn Monroe lounging at his pool in a bathing suit, which were published after her death. In 2004, his granddaughter Suzanne produced a book of selections from his photographs, Harold Lloyd's Hollywood Nudes in 3D! (). Lloyd also provided encouragement and support for a number of younger actors, such as Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner, and particularly Jack Lemmon, whom Harold declared as his own choice to play him in a movie of his life and work. =Renewed interest= Movie poster for World of Comedy, Lloyd's compilation of film clips from the silent and sound eras, 1962 Lloyd kept copyright control of most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement. Lloyd did not grant cinematic re-releases because most theaters could not accommodate an organist to play music for his films, and Lloyd did not wish his work to be accompanied by a pianist: \\"I just don't like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos.\\" Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyd's price was high: \\"I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That's a high price, but if I don't get it, I'm not going to show it. They've come close to it, but they haven't come all the way up\\". As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more widely distributed. Lloyd's film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned. In the early 1960s, Lloyd produced two compilation films, featuring scenes from his old comedies, Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy and The Funny Side of Life. The first film was premiered at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, where Lloyd was f√™ted as a major rediscovery. The renewed interest in Lloyd helped restore his status among film historians. Throughout his later years he screened his films for audiences at special charity and educational events, to great acclaim, and found a particularly receptive audience among college audiences: \\"Their whole response was tremendous because they didn't miss a gag; anything that was even a little subtle, they got it right away.\\" Lloyd's crypt in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale. Following his death, and after extensive negotiations, most of his feature films were leased to Time-Life Films in 1974. As Tom Dardis confirms: \\"Time-Life prepared horrendously edited musical- sound-track versions of the silent films, which are intended to be shown on TV at sound speed [24 frames per second], and which represent everything that Harold feared would happen to his best films\\". Time-Life released the films as half-hour television shows, with two clips per show. These were often near- complete versions of the early two-reelers, but also included extended sequences from features such as Safety Last! (terminating at the clock sequence) and Feet First (presented silent, but with Walter Scharf's score from Lloyd's own 1960s re-release). Time-Life released several of the feature films more or less intact, also using some of Scharf's scores which had been commissioned by Lloyd. The Time-Life clips series included a narrator rather than intertitles. Various narrators were used internationally: the English- language series was narrated by Henry Corden. The Time-Life series was frequently repeated by the BBC in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, and in 1990 a Thames Television documentary, Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius was produced by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, following two similar series based on Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.Documentary: Harold Lloyd ‚Äî The Third Genius. Composer Carl Davis wrote a new score for Safety Last! which he performed live during a showing of the film with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra to great acclaim in 1993. The Brownlow and Gill documentary was shown as part of the PBS series American Masters, and created a renewed interest in Lloyd's work in the United States, but the films were largely unavailable. In 2002, the Harold Lloyd Trust re-launched Harold Lloyd with the publication of the book Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian by Jeffrey Vance and Suzanne Lloyd and a series of feature films and short subjects called \\"The Harold Lloyd Classic Comedies\\" produced by Jeffrey Vance and executive produced by Suzanne Lloyd for Harold Lloyd Entertainment. The new cable television and home video versions of Lloyd's great silent features and many shorts were remastered with new orchestral scores by Robert Israel. These versions are frequently shown on the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) cable channel. A DVD collection of these restored or remastered versions of his feature films and important short subjects was released by New Line Cinema in partnership with the Harold Lloyd Trust in 2005, along with theatrical screenings in the US, Canada, and Europe. Criterion Collection has subsequently acquired the home video rights to the Lloyd library, and have released Safety Last!, The Freshman, and Speedy. In the June 2006 Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program book for Safety Last!, film historian Jeffrey Vance stated that Robert A. Golden, Lloyd's assistant director, routinely doubled for Harold Lloyd between 1921 and 1927. According to Vance, Golden doubled Lloyd in the bit with Harold shimmy shaking off the building's ledge after a mouse crawls up his trousers. Personal life Lloyd married his leading lady Mildred Davis on February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles, California.Los Angeles, California, County Marriages 1850-1952 They had two children together: Gloria Lloyd (1923‚Äì2012) and Harold Clayton Lloyd Jr. (1931‚Äì1971). They also adopted Gloria Freeman (1924‚Äì1986) in September 1930, whom they renamed Marjorie Elizabeth Lloyd but was known as \\"Peggy\\" for most of her life. Lloyd discouraged Davis from continuing her acting career. He later relented but by that time her career momentum was lost. Davis died from a heart attack in 1969, two years before Lloyd's death. Though her real age was a guarded secret, a family spokesperson at the time indicated she was 66 years old. Harold Jr. died from complications of a stroke three months after his father. The Lloyds in 1936 (left to right): Peggy, Harold Jr., Harold, Gloria, and Mildred In 1925, at the height of his movie career, Lloyd entered into Freemasonry at the Alexander Hamilton Lodge No. 535 of Hollywood, advancing quickly through both the York Rite and Scottish Rite, and then joined Al Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles. He took the degrees of the Royal Arch with his father. In 1926, he became a 32¬∞ Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Los Angeles, California. He was vested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honor (KCCH) and eventually with the Inspector General Honorary, 33rd degree. Lloyd's Beverly Hills home, \\"Greenacres\\", was built in 1926‚Äì1929, with 44 rooms, 26 bathrooms, 12 fountains, 12 gardens, and a nine-hole golf course. A portion of Lloyd's personal inventory of his silent films (then estimated to be worth $2 million) was destroyed in August 1943 when his film vault caught fire. Seven firemen were overcome while inhaling chlorine gas from the blaze. Lloyd himself was saved by his wife, who dragged him to safety outdoors after he collapsed at the door of the film vault. The fire spared the main house and outbuildings. After attempting to maintain the home as a museum of film history, as Lloyd had wished, the Lloyd family sold it to a developer in 1975. The grounds were subsequently subdivided but the main house and the estate's principal gardens remain and are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films like Westworld and The Loved One. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Death Lloyd died at age 77 from prostate cancer on March 8, 1971, at his Greenacres home in Beverly Hills, California. He was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries His former co-star Bebe Daniels died eight days after him, and his son Harold Lloyd Jr. died three months after him.D'Agostino 1994. pp. 54-55.  Honors  In 1927, his was only the fourth concrete ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, preserving his handprints, footprints, and autograph, along with the outline of his famed glasses (which were actually a pair of sunglasses with the lenses removed). The ceremony took place directly in front of the Hollywood Masonic Temple, which was the meeting place of the Masonic lodge to which he belonged. Lloyd was honored in 1960 for his contribution to motion pictures with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1503 Vine Street. In 1994, he was honored with his image on a United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. In 1953, Lloyd received an Academy Honorary Award for being a \\"master comedian and good citizen\\". The second citation was a snub to Chaplin, who at that point had fallen foul of McCarthyism and had his entry visa to the United States revoked. Regardless of the political overtones, Lloyd accepted the award in good spirit. Lloyd's birthplace in Burchard, Nebraska is maintained as a museum and open by appointment.

Sentenced to life in prison, he remained incarcerated until he was released on health grounds in 1957. He died three years later. Early life Funk was born into a merchant family in 1890 in Danzkehmen (present-day Sosnowka in the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast) near Trakehnen in East Prussia. He was the only one of the Nuremberg defendants who was born in the former eastern territories of Germany. He was the son of Wiesenbaumeister Walther Funk the elder and his wife Sophie (n√©e Urbschat). He studied law, economics, and philosophy at the Humboldt University of Berlin and the University of Leipzig. In World War I, he joined the infantry, but was wounded and subsequently discharged as medically unfit for service in 1916. Following the end of the war, he worked as a journalist, and in 1924 he became the editor of the centre-right financial newspaper the Berliner B√∂rsenzeitung. In 1920, Funk married Luise Schmidt-Sieben. Political life Kristallnacht of November 1938, smashed window front of Jewish shop Nazi gold in Merkers Salt Mine Funk, who was a nationalist and anti-Marxist, resigned from the newspaper in the summer of 1931 and joined the Nazi Party, becoming close to Gregor Strasser, who arranged his first meeting with Adolf Hitler. Partially because of his interest in economic policy, he was elected a Reichstag deputy in July 1932, and within the party, he was made chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy in December 1932, a post that he did not hold for long. After the Nazi Party came to power, he stepped down from his Reichstag position and was made Chief Press Officer of the Third Reich, a post which involved censorship of anything deemed critical of Nazi policies. His boss was Joseph Goebbels. Third Reich career In March 1933, Funk was appointed as a State Secretary (Staatssekret√§r) at the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (Reichsministerium f√ºr Volksaufkl√§rung und Propaganda).Memoirs by Franz von Papen, London, 1952, p. 312. In the summer of 1936 when Hitler commissioned Albert Speer for the rebuilding of central Berlin, it was Funk who proposed his new title of \\"Inspector-General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Federal Capital\\".Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer, London, 1970, p. 76. In 1938, Funk became Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics (Wirtschaftsbeauftragter), as well as Reich Minister of Economics (Reichswirtschaftsminister) replacing Hjalmar Schacht, who had resigned on 26 November 1937. Schacht had been engaged in a power struggle with Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, who wanted to tie the ministry more closely to his Four Year Plan Office.My First Seventy-Six Years, by Hjalmar Schacht, London 1955, p. 377. Online Between April 1938-March 1939 Funk was also a Director of the Swiss-based multi-national Bank of International Settlements,Bank of International Settlements, \\"Ninth Annual Report: 1 April 1938 ‚Äì 31 March 1939\\" pp. 135‚Äì37 and in January 1939, Hitler appointed Funk as President of the Reichsbank. Funk recorded that by 1938 the German state had confiscated Jewish property worth two million marks, using decrees from Hitler and other top Nazis to force German Jews to leave their property and assets to the State if they emigrated, such as the Reich Flight Tax. Funk was present at a great many important meetings, including that held in the Great Hall of the [still extant] Air Ministry on 13 February 1942 chaired by Field-Marshall Erhard Milch about the four year plan, which embraced the entire economy. 30 crucial people were present. Funk sat to the right of Milch, at his request. After much debate Albert Vogler said \\"there must be one man able to make decisions. Industry did not care who it was.\\" After further discussion Funk stood up and nominated Milch as that man. Speer whispered to Milch this was not a good idea and Milch declined. Five days later Hitler conferred the role on Speer. As he and Funk walked Hitler back to his apartment in the Chancery Funk promised Speer that he would place everything at his disposal and do all in his power to help him. Speer relates that Funk \\"kept the promise, with minor exceptions.\\"Speer, 1970, pp. 200‚Äì02. Funk was appointed to the Central Planning Board in September 1943 and subsequently joined Robert Ley, Speer and Goebbels in the struggle against the influence on Hitler by Martin Bormann.Speer, 1970, p. 263. Funk and Milch were again together for Goering's birthday party on 12 January 1944 when Funk, as he did every year, delivered the birthday speech at the banquet.Speer, 1970, p. 322. Nuremberg As Minister of Economics Funk assisted the pace of rearmament, and subsequently as Reichsbank President accepted from the SS the gold rings of Nazi concentration camp victims from Buchenwald eyeglasses from Auschwitz victims luggage taken from Auschwitz victims Funk was tried with other Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg trials. He was accused by Allied prosecutors of having been closely involved in the State confiscation and disposal of the property of German Jews; and of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity. He argued that, despite his employment titles, he had very little power in the regime. He did however, admit to signing the laws that \\"aryanized\\" Jewish property and in that respect claimed to be \\"morally guilty\\". At the Nuremberg trials American Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson labeled Funk as \\"The Banker of Gold Teeth\\", referring to the practice of extracting gold teeth from Nazi concentration camp victims, and forwarding the teeth to the Reichsbank for melting down to yield bullion. Many other gold items were stolen from victims, such as jewellery, eyeglasses and finger rings. Other items stolen from the victims included their clothing, furniture, artwork and paintings, as well as any wealth in stocks, shares, businesses and companies. Such business assets were taken by aryanization with often large and profitable businesses sold for less than their true worth. The monetary proceeds of auctions of such assets as furniture were passed to the Reichsbank in Max Heiliger accounts for use by the Nazi state or the SS. Even the hair of the victims was taken by shaving either just before or just after their murder. When clothing was distributed after the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen, blood stains were often visible at and near the bullet holes. Funk was clearly distressed during the proceedings and cried during presentation of evidence such as the murders carried out in the Nazi concentration camps, and needed sleeping pills at night. Hjalmar Schacht relates that he, Funk and von Papen formed a close intimate circle at Nuremburg. He felt Funk was unable to comprehend the serious nature of the duties which he had undertaken. Schacht believed that there were many matters of which Funk had no knowledge whatsoever and that he gave a poor performance in the witness-box.Schacht, 1955, pp. 455‚Äì56. However Albert Speer gave a different version of events. He said that when he first came into contact with Funk at Nuremberg \\"he looked extremely worn and downcast.\\" But \\"Funk reasoned skillfully and in a way that stirred my pity\\" in the witness box.Speer, 1970, pp. 508, 515. G√∂ring meanwhile described Funk as \\"an insignificant subordinate\\", but documentary evidence and his wartime biography Walther Funk, A Life for the Economy were used against him during the trial, leading to his conviction on counts 2, 3 and 4 of the indictment and his sentence of life imprisonment. Funk was held at Spandau Prison along with other senior Nazis. He was released on 16 May 1957 because of ill health. He made a last-minute call on Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer and Baldur von Schirach before leaving the prison. He died three years later in D√ºsseldorf of diabetes. Culture Schacht, who knew Funk well, said he was \\"extraordinarily musical\\" being \\"a first-rate connoisseur of music whose personal preferences in life were decidedly for the artistic and literary.\\" At a dinner when he sat next to Funk, the orchestra played a melody by Franz Leh√°r. Funk remarked \\"ah! Leh√°r ‚Äì the Fuhrer is particularly fond of his music.\\" Schacht replied, jokingly, \\"its a pity that Leh√°r is married to a Jewess\\" to which Funk immediately responded \\"that's something the Fuhrer must not know on any account!Schacht, 1955, pp. 340‚Äì41, 456. Speer relates how Hitler played for him a record of Liszt's Les Pr√©ludes and said \\"this is going to be our victory fanfare for the Russian campaign. Funk chose it!\\"Speer, 1970, p. 180.

InterBase is distinguished from other RDBMSs by its small footprint, close to zero administration requirements, and multi-generational architecture. InterBase runs on the Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris operating systems as well as iOS and Android. Technology InterBase is a SQL-92-compliant relational database and supports standard interfaces such as JDBC, ODBC, and ADO.NET. =Small footprint= A full InterBase server installation requires around 40 MB on disk. A minimum InterBase client install requires about 400 KB of disk space. =Embedded or server= InterBase can be run as an embedded database or regular server. =Data controller friendly inbuilt encryption= Since InterBase XE, InterBase includes 256bit AES strength encryption that offers full database, table or column data encryption. This assists data controllers conform with data protection laws around at-rest data by providing separated encryption / db access to the database and ensuring the database file is encrypted wherever it resides. The separation of the encryption also enables developers to just develop the application rather than worry about the data visible from a specific user login. =Multi-generational architecture= Concurrency control To avoid blocking during updates, Interbase uses multiversion concurrency control instead of locks. Each transaction will create a version of the record. Upon the write step, the update will fail rather than be blocked initially. Rollbacks and recovery InterBase also uses multi-generational records to implement rollbacks rather than transaction logs. Drawbacks Certain operations are more difficult to implement in a multi-generational architecture, and hence perform slowly relative to a more traditional implementation. One example is the SQL \`COUNT\` verb. Even when an index is available on the column or columns included in the \`COUNT\`, all records must be visited in order to see if they are visible under the current transaction isolation. History =Early years= InterBase Software‚Äîoriginally known as Groton Database Systems‚Äîwas born in Ann Harrison's spare room. Ann was the first junior programmer for the company and worked on nearly every component between version 0 and 3.3.http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/27151 The InterBase On-Disk Structure Jim Starkey was working at DEC on their DATATRIEVE 4th generation language 4GL product when he came up with an idea for a system to manage concurrent changes by many users. The idea dramatically simplified the existing problems of locking which were proving to be a serious problem for the new relational database systems being developed at the time. Starkey, however, had the idea after he had spun off his original relational database project to another group and a turf war ensued. Starkey left the company after shipping the first version of the Rdb/ELN product. Although InterBase's implementation is much more similar to the system described by Reed in his MIT dissertation than any other database that existed at the time and Starkey knew Bernstein from his previous position at the Computer Corporation of America and later at DEC, Starkey has stated that he arrived at the idea of multiversion concurrency control independently. In the same comment, Starkey says: > The inspiration for multi-generational concurrency control was a database > system done by Prime that supported page level snapshots. The intention of > the feature was to give a reader a consistent view of the database without > blocking writers. The idea intrigued me as a very useful characteristic of a > database system. He had heard that the local workstation vendor Apollo Computer was looking for a database offering on their Unix machines, and they agreed to fund development. With their encouragement he formed Groton Database Systems (named after the town, Groton, Massachusetts, where they were located) on Labor Day 1984 and started work on what would eventually be released as InterBase. In 1986 Apollo suffered a corporate shakeup and decided to exit the software business, but by this time the product was making money. =The road to Borland= Between 1986 and 1991 the product was gradually sold to Ashton- Tate, makers of the famous dBASE who were at the time purchasing various database companies in order to fill out their portfolio. The company was soon in trouble, and Borland purchased Ashton-Tate in 1991, acquiring InterBase as part of the deal. =Open source= In early 2000, Borland announced that InterBase would be released under open-source, and began negotiations to spin off a separate company to manage the product. When the people who were to run the new company and Borland could not agree on the terms of the separation, InterBase remained a Borland product, and the source code for InterBase version 6 was released under a variant of the Mozilla Public License in mid-2000. With the InterBase division at Borland under new management, the company released a proprietary version of InterBase version 6 and then 6.5. Borland released several updates to the open source code before announcing that it would no longer actively develop the open source project. Firebird, an open source fork of the InterBase 6 code, however, remains in active development. In 2001, a backdoor was discovered (and fixed) in the software that had been present in all versions since 1994. =CodeGear= On February 8 of 2006, Borland announced the intention to sell their line of development tool products, including InterBase, Delphi, JBuilder, and other tools , but instead of selling the divisions, Borland spun them out as a subsidiary on 14 November 2006. InterBase, along with IDE tools such as Delphi and JBuilder were included in the new company's product lineup. Then on 7 May 2008, Borland and Embarcadero Technologies announced that Embarcadero had \\"signed a definitive asset purchase agreement to purchase CodeGear.\\" The acquisition, for approximately $24.5 million, closed on 30 June 2008. =Recent releases= At the end of 2002, Borland released InterBase version 7, featuring support for SMP, enhanced support for monitoring and control of the server by administrators, and more. Borland released InterBase 7.1 in June 2003, 7.5 in December 2004, and 7.5.1 on June 1, 2005. In September 2006, Borland announcedBorland‚Äôs Developer Tools Group Introduces InterBase 2007 the availability of InterBase 2007. Its new features include point in time recovery via journaling (which also allows recoverability without the performance penalty of synchronous writes), incremental backup, batch statement operations, new Unicode character encodings, and a new ODBC driver. In September 2008, Embarcadero announcedEmbarcadero Announces High-Performance InterBase SMP 2009 Database the availability of InterBase 2009. Its new features include full database encryption, selective column-level data encryption and over-the-wire encryption offering secure TCP/IP communication via Secure Socket Layer (SSL). In September 2010, Embarcadero announcedEmbarcadero‚Äôs New InterBase XE Offers Advanced Security and Scalability with Near-Zero Administration the availability of InterBase XE. Its new features include a 64 bit client and server, improved security, improved scalability, support for dynamic SQL in stored procedures, and optimized performance of large objects with stream methods. In 2013/2014 Embarcadero added iOS and then Android to the available supported platforms in InterBase XE3. Additionally InterBase IBLite was released - a run time royalty free edition of InterBase covering Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. In December 2014, embarcadero released InterBase XE7 offering a brand new, patent pending change tracking technology called \\"Change Views.\\". Added Ubuntu to the certified Linux platforms and also added 64bit Linux support. Additional 64bit transaction ID's were introduced and new distinguished data dumps enabling rapid updates of read only copies of the master database. In March 2017, Embarcadero released InterBase 2017. InterBase 2017 includes InterBase ToGo for Linux, Server wide monitoring support for InterBase Server, a number of language enhancements (including derived tables and common table expressions, truncate table for faster data removal), enhancements to Change Views for expanding a subscription with a table wide scope, new transaction isolation levels and transaction wait time management.

It was formerly in the historic county of Peeblesshire or Tweeddale. Etymology The name \\"Innerleithen\\" comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning \\"confluence of the Leithen\\", because it is here that the river joins the Tweed. The prefix \\"Inner-/Inver-\\" (Inbhir-) is common in many Scottish placenames, such as Inverness and Inverurie. At this confluence, the Tweed flows approximately west-east, and the Leithen Water flows from the north. Layout The layout of the town is dominated by the surrounding hills. To the north the peaked hill of Lee Pen (502m), and its southerly spur Caerlee Hill (258m). To the east the rounded hill of Pirn Craig (363m) - locally known as \\"Rocky\\" - and its townward spur of Windy Knowe (155m), also known as \\"Pirn Hill\\", and to the south, beyond the Tweed, the extended of ridge of Plora Craig rises sharply from the southerly bank. Thus the town has grown in an inverted 'T' shape north up the valley of the Leithen and east-west along north bank flood plain of the Tweed. History The area occupied by the town has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. The remains of an Iron-Age hill fort are visible atop Caerlee Hill, in the form of defensive ditchworks. Ditchworks are also visible on the hill of Windy Knowe and, whilst there is some local speculation that these belong to an unusual round Roman hill fort, they are in fact typical of an indigenous Iron Age hill fort. Crop marks from aerial photographs of the 1950s suggest the existence of a semi- permanent Roman marching camp on the flood plain by the river Tweed at Toll Wood (near Traquair) and at nearby Eshiels. The town is said to have been founded by an itinerant pilgrim monk called St. Ronan in A.D.737, who came to Innerleithen via the River Tweed in a coracle. Monks would certainly have travelled the natural route of the Clyde and Tweed valleys on their way between the religious centres of Iona and Holy Island. A Celtic stone carved with cup and rings/channels, known as the Runic Cross (although there are neither runes on it, nor any evidence that it was a cross shaft) was found on the slopes of the Leithen valley suggesting that a church existed during the Early Middle Ages. The stone can be viewed in the courtyard of the parish church on Leithen Road. Saint Ronan's Wells. In the local legend of the town's founding \\"St. Ronan Cleik't the Deil by the hind leg and banished him\\", possibly a metaphor for the monks bringing Christian learning back into these regions. The legend was actually formalised by Sir Walter Scott and was later instigated in a town festival called \\"The Cleikum Ceremonies\\" in 1901. This was seen as a way to prevent the legends and folktales of the region from dying out. Scott wrote about the town in his 1824 novel St. Ronan's Well. The Ceremonies continue to this day as part of St. Ronans Borders Games, also known as 'Games Week' (although, in reality, this is a 10-day-long festival). The Border Games date from 1827 and are the oldest organised sports meeting in Scotland. These happen in the first and second week in July and draw significant local and tourist participation. Accounts of Innerleithen date from the 12th century, when it was recorded as \\"Inverlethane\\". It is said that a son of King Malcolm IV of Scotland (who was staying at Traquair House on a hunting trip), drowned accidentally in a deep pool at the confluence of the rivers Leithen and Tweed. The body was recovered by locals and taken to the church, in recognition of which the King bestowed the right of sanctuary to the land. The pool where the drowning is alleged to have taken place is still known locally as \\"The Droont Pool\\". However, it should be borne in mind that Malcolm IV is reported to have died childless at the age of twenty five, so the tale is questionable. Later written accounts of the town date from the 15th century when it is referred to as \\"Henderleithen\\", and at this point it is recorded as a hamlet within the Parish of Traquair, which with its major baronial house was centre of the Parish. The industrial revolution and wool milling saw Innerleithen outgrow Traquair and become the larger village. Innerleithen's population rose from 1130 (1861 census) to it current level of over 2500. At one point it had five significant wool mills (or hosieries). Of these, only one, Caerlee Mills remained with a reduced workforce of 33 after its owners JJ & HB Cashmere went into administration in 2010, finally closing in April 2013. The industries which have supplanted the wool industry and allowed the town keep growing have been primarily tourism, of which Mountain Biking plays a huge part, and secondly timber and forestry. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population now commutes to work, including to Edinburgh some 30 miles north. The town has a football team Vale of Leithen who were established in 1891 and play in the Scottish Lowland League. They play their games at the town's Victoria Park. Tourism Robert Smail's Printing Works typifies the buildings on the main street. Tourist attractions within the town include Robert Smail's Printing Works and St. Ronans Wells, and nearby Traquair House. Popular tourist activities in the area include golfing (the town has a 9-hole golf course), walking and mountain biking with 2 excellent routes including a world standard downhill route. The area is famous for fly fishing (both trout and salmon), and there is a fish ladder near the golf course, just outside the town boundary on Leithen Road. This proves a popular stopping point for locals and visitors to watch the autumn and winter runs of salmon. The town has several small hotels including the Traquair Arms Hotel and the St. Ronans Hotel. There are also numerous private houses offering bed and breakfast, a camp site and a caravan site. The town hosts the annual Innerleithen Music Festival in the Memorial Hall. In addition, it has an active amateur operatic society which stages an annual production. To get to Innerleithen from Edinburgh, follow the A701, then A703 south from Edinburgh, and at Peebles turn east onto the A72. The town is also served by the First Bus no. 62 service which runs between Edinburgh and Melrose via Penicuik, Peebles, Innerleithen and Galashiels. Innerleithen has several bookshops, the largest of which holds nearly 19,000 titles and is one of the largest in the Scottish Borders. Innerleithen is also popular for mountain biking and, together with Glentress, forms one of Forestry and Land Scotland's \\"7 Stanes\\". It is very popular with downhill bikers and has hosted national events since the early 1990s. Current gems include the \\"Matador\\" and \\"Make or Break\\". In addition to the downhill trails, there is a long cross- country loop that climbs to the top of the Minch Moor before descending through some excellent trails. The Innerleithen XC trails are more demanding than those found at Glentress. Since 2003, the town has held a music festival every August. Acts that have played at the festival include Eddi Reader, Julie Fowlis, Dougie MacLean, Karine Polwart, Karen Matheson and Old Blind Dogs.http://innerleithenmusicfestival.org/info/previous-festivals/ Notable people *Alexander Tait (poet) (b.1720), known as 'Sawney Tait' was a contemporary and associate of Robert Burns and David Sillar. *Murray Davidson (b. 1988), Scottish international footballer who played for Livingston F.C. and St Johnstone F.C.

The site covers an area of about . Stones from the ruins of the ancient structures were reused for residential construction of the agricultural village of Rockstone Pond in modern times, but the ancient site did not come to the attention of archeologists until 1963. The Old Northern Highway connects Altun Ha to Belize's Northern Highway, and the site is accessible for tourism. The largest of Altun Ha's temple-pyramids, the \\"Temple of the Masonry Altars\\", is high. A drawing of this structure is the logo of Belize's leading brand of beer, \\"Belikin\\". Etymology According to the Belize Institute of Archaeology, the site's name means \\"Rockstone Water,\\" and is a Yucatec Mayan approximation of the name of the nearby village of Rockstone Pond. In Yucatec Mayan, haltun is a stone water deposit or cistern, and ha means water. An ancient emblem glyph for the site has been identified, but its phonetic reading is not currently known. Archaeological investigations and rediscovery In 1961, W.R. Bullard conducted excavations led by the Royal Ontario Museum, at Baking Pot and San Estevan, and although no excavations took place, the site was initially called ‚ÄúRockstone Pond.‚Äù In 1963, quarrying activity by local villagers led to the recovery of a large, elaborately carved jade pendant. The current commissioner of archaeology, Hamilton Anderson, notified David M. Pendergast and a reconnaissance trip was made in 1963. Starting in 1964, an archaeological team led by Dr. David Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum began extensive excavations and restorations of the site, which continued through 1970. There was a total of 40 months of excavation with a field season in 1971 of ceramic and laboratory analysis.Pendergast, David M.1979 Excavations at Altun Ha, Belize, 1964-1970, Volume 1. Royal Ontario Museum. Setting Altun Ha lies on the north-central coastal plain of Belize, in a dry tropical zone. The site was very swampy during its pre-Columbian occupation, with very few recognizable water sources. Currently, the only recognizable natural water source is a creek beyond the northern limit of the mapped area. The water sources used during occupation were Gordon Pond, which is the main reservoir, and the Camp Aguada, which is located in the site center. The site may have contained two chultuns, but provenience is lost since they are used in modern times. The site itself consists of a central precinct composed of Groups A and B. Groups A and B and Zones C, D, and E consist of the nucleated area, with Zones G, J, K, M, N making part of the suburban area. The site does not contain any stela, suggesting that stelae were not part of ceremonial procedures. There are two recorded causeways, one in Zone C and one connecting Zone E and Zone F. The Zone C causeway does not connect to any structures, but is probably related to Structure C13, and was perhaps used for ceremonial purposes. The other causeway connected the two zones where water sources were located, and was constructed for topographical reasons, specifically to traverse areas of swampy land; it may have been impassable without raised walkways. Occupational history Altun Ha was occupied for many centuries, from about 900 B.C. to A.D. 1000. Most of the information on Altun Ha comes from the Classic Period from about A.D. 400 to A.D. 900, when the city was at its largest. =Preclassic= The earliest structures found at Altun Ha, found in Zone C, are two round platforms that date to about BC 900‚àí800, structures C13 and C17. Structure C13 contains remnants of postholes and several burials, while C17 has traces of burning, or fire. Structure C13 was an early religious building, with Zone C inhabitants being of relatively high status.Pendergast, David M.1982 Excavations at Altun Ha, Belize, 1964-1970, Volume 2. Royal Ontario Museum. The Late Preclassic had a population increase and large public structures were built. The first of these was structure F8 in AD 200. Although this structure was constructed at the end of the Preclassic, the majority of the archaeological evidence dates to the Early Classic. This structure has a two-element stair composed of small steps with stairside outsets that were perhaps devoted to innovation. F8 also had a three-stage development. =Early Classic= One of the most important finds in the Early Classic comes from structure F8, specifically tomb F8/1. The tomb was placed here about fifty years after the construction of the structure. It contained the remains of an adult male who was interred with a jade and shell necklace, a pair of jade earflares, two shell disks, a pair of pearls, five pottery vessels, and fifty- nine valves of Spondylus shells. Bib head beads in the necklace are associated with southern Mesoamerica. The ceramics for the most part reflect the pattern that was being established at other burials in Altun Ha. Above the burial, however, the roof showed association to the large Mexican site Teotihuacan. The burial was capped with over 8,000 pieces of chert debitage and 163 formal chert tools. The ritual offering, or cache, also contained jade beads, Spondylus valves, puma and dog teeth, slate laminae, and a large variety of shell artifacts. The clear association to Teotihuacan however, comes from the 248 Pachuca green obsidian objects and the 23 ceramic jars, bowls and dishes.Pendergast, David M. 1971 Evidence of Early Teotihucan-Lowland Maya Contact at Altun Ha. American Antiquity 36(4):pp. 455-460. The obsidian is of the Miccaotli or Early Tlamimilolpa phase, suggesting that this symbolism was still important and dominant at Teotihuacan. This offering may be of importance to Teotihuacan because of the associations that the ruler in the burial had with central Mexico or the association that the entire Altun Ha community had with Teotihuacan.Pendergast, David M. 2003 Teotihuacan at Altun Ha: Did It Make a Difference? in The Maya and Teotihuacan : reinterpreting early classic interaction, edited by Geoffrey E. Braswell, 1st ed. pp 235-247 University of Texas Press, Austin. There is also evidence of contact and trading with the other side of Mesoamerica in the intermediate area. An offering in the central ceremonial precinct contained an undecorated lidded limestone vessel with jadeite objects, two pearls, laminae of crystalline hematite, Spondylus shell beads, and a tumbaga gold-copper alloy bead representing a jaguar claw. This deposit has been dated to about 500. Traditionally, it was not believed that the Maya had gold during the Classic period; gold was restricted to the Postclassic. This is in part because many believed that gold was not naturally occurring in the Maya area, but recent investigations have shown that placer gold can be found in the streams of the upland zone of western Belize. The Maya most likely did not use metallurgy because of a lack of techniques, which may have been due to the fact that yellow in Maya ideology represent dying plant life and crop failure. This artifact is also identical with other artifacts of the Cocle in central Panama. The Cocle had a sufficient amount of metalworking by 500, and surely played a role in trade relationships beyond Panama. This discovery also shows that important trade networks were set up much earlier than previously thought.Pendergast, D. M. 1970 Tumbaga Object from the Early Classic Period, Found at Altun Ha, British Honduras (Belize). Science 168(3927):pp. 116-118. =Late Classic= In general, the elite burials at Altun Ha during the Late Classic can be characterized by large amounts of jade. Over 800 pieces of jade have been recovered at the site. More than 60 of these pieces are carved. The beginning of the Late Classic at Altun Ha had one of the most interesting burials in the Maya lowlands. Structure B-4 has tombs with many jade artifacts, including a large jade plaque with a series of twenty glyphs in the phase six construction level. In the 1968 field season, after excavating many tombs in Structure B-4, also called the Temple of the Masonry Altars, the seventh phase of construction revealed the most elaborate tomb at the site nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Sun God‚Äôs Tomb‚Äù. The Sun God's Tomb The Sun God's Tomb is in Structure B-4, also called the Temple of the Masonry Altars. Structure B-4 is in Group B, which is part of the central precinct at Altun Ha, and has a height of 16 meters. Phase VII, the level where this tomb is, is dated to about 600‚àí650, which is at the beginning of the Late Classic period. The tomb is the seventh and earliest in B-4, which made the excavators designate this burial Tomb B-4/7.Pendergast, David M. 1969 Altun Ha, British Honduras (Belize): the Sun God's tomb [by] David M. Pendergast. Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto. Tomb B-4/7 contained the skeleton of an adult male with many offerings. The body was fully extended dorsally with the skull facing south- southwest. The person had a height of 170‚Äì171 cm, with the recovered skeletal materials consisting of a fragment of the skull, the mandible, long bones, five teeth, two vertebrae, five carpal bones, the patellas, and miscellaneous metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges. The bulk of the interpretations, research, and interest in this tomb have undoubtedly been on the artifacts that were contained in this particular burial. In the initial study, Pendergast classifies these artifacts between perishables and non-perishables. The perishable artifacts that are in the burial that the researchers were able to recognize include a wooden platform that the body was placed on, felid skins, cloth, matting, cordage, rods, stuccoed objects, red pigment, and gray clay. Not all perishable objects have been interpreted for their original use in the burial, but some have clear associations. The entire tomb was covered in cloth, with textile impressions noted on the pottery. Red pigment was distributed throughout, with evidence of it on most of the jade. The researchers documented 43 non-perishable artifacts. These include ceramic bowls; shell beads; jadeite anklets, bracelets and beads; pearls; pyrite and hematite artifacts; and, the most outstanding of all, a carved jade head of the Sun God, Kinich Ahau. The head has a height of 14.9 cm, a circumference of 45.9 cm and a weight of 4.42 kg. It was placed at the pelvis of the body, with the face of the jade boulder facing the skull. The Sun God's Tomb marks the starting point for tomb construction in Structure B-4 during the Late Classic period. The unusual form of this tomb shows the distinctive cultural aspects of Altun Ha and the Caribbean zone compared to the inland Classic Maya sites. Pendergast suggests that with so much jade found at the site, the jade head may have been carved at the site with imported jade. The giant jade head also suggests that this small site had a strong status as a trade or ceremonial center. Pendergast suggests that this tomb contained a priest that was associated with the Sun God and that Structure B-4 was dedicated to this deity, based on this one artifact. More recent research, however, has shown that this interpretation may be incorrect: it suggests that this giant jade head is a Jester God. When drawing this figure spread out on a plane, the figure on this carving shows more of a resemblance to a bird deity with maize iconography, not Kinich Ahau.Taube, Karl 1998 The Jade Hearth: Centrality, Rulership, and the Classic Maya Temple. In Function and Meaning in Classic Maya Architecture, edited by Stephen D. Houston, pp. 427-478. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington D.C. The Jester God is an early symbol of Maya rulership and is usually seen iconographically in the head, or in this case the jade head. With so many artifacts associated with this tomb, it is clear that the male buried in here was of great importance.Fields, Virginia M. 1991 The Iconographic Heritage of the Maya Jester God. In Sixth Palenque Round Table, 1986, edited by Merle Greene Robertson and Virginia M. Fields. Electronic version. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. The Jester God argument is a better fit for what this person represented, which would also correlate with this being the first tomb constructed in Structure B-4. Stuccoed Jester God face on Structure B4, similar to the face on the Jade Head Terminal Classic By 700, modifications in the Central Precinct became rarer, and in Plaza B only Structures B4 and B6 were modified regularly, while Plaza A was still being modified extensively. By 850, structures B5 and A8 were completely abandoned. Gradual abandonment of the site began in 800, except for Zone E, which actually reached its peak usage and occupation between 700 and 800.Yermakhanova, Olga A., 2005 Kingship, Structures and Access Patterns on the Royal Plaza at the Ancient Maya City of Altun Ha, Belize: The Construction of a Maya GIS. Unpublished Master‚Äôs Thesis, Department of Geography and Anthropology, Louisiana State University. Structure D2 is located at the edge of the site's Central Precinct and is dated to the Late-Terminal Classic. This structure in particular yielded a stemmed bifacial blade of Pachuca green obsidian in a post-abandonment offering. The form, size and manufacturing characteristics are very similar to those found in F8. Two possible explanations for the context of this artifact are that the blade could have been produced long after the decline of Teotihuacan, or was reused from an earlier time period. =Postclassic= In the Postclassic, Structures A1 and A5 were solely used for depositing the dead. By the beginning of the eleventh century, the site of Altun Ha was completely abandoned. During the Late Postclassic after 1225, however, there was a renewed limited occupation at Altun Ha which lasted probably until the fifteenth century. Lamanai-related Postclassic ceremonial vessels were excavated atop B-4. Diet at Altun Ha The diet at Altun Ha was a maize based (C-4) diet, but there was also a large marine component to their diet compared to other sites in the Maya area. The marine/reef resources were more important here than in other regions. Between the Preclassic and Early Classic, there was a dramatic increase of maize consumption, which researchers argue is an indication of a rise in intensive maize agriculture at the beginning of the Early Classic. The individuals with the highest recognized status during this time period also had the highest intake of maize. In the Late Classic, more maize was consumed in the central precinct than in the outer zones, and Zone C had a higher degree of reef resources than in other areas. In the Postclassic, a higher portion of terrestrial animals were consumed, possibly deer or dogs.White, Christine D., David M. Pendergast, Fred J. Longstaffe, and Kimberley R. Law 2001 Social Complexity and Food Systems at Altun Ha, Belize: The Isotopic Evidence. Latin American Antiquity 12(4):pp. 371-393. Caches at Altun Ha Caches occur in two categories at Altun Ha. The largest class is in communally built structures that were dedicated to public ritual, the second occurs in residential structures with usually a single-family focus. The primary axis was the principal determinant of cache position in communally built structures. The primary axis functioned as the main avenue of communication with deities. In other public and domestic contexts, there are offerings that are away from the primary axis, and this is based on a matter of exclusion. Late Preclassic caches at Altun Ha can be defined by the round platform. Jade objects become significant in offerings by 450‚àí300 BC. Classic Period caching practices at Altun Ha consisted of single, highly varied offerings in context with structural modification. The caches during this time period had a high scale of ceremonial value and made a forceful statement of the site's prominence.Pendergast, David M., Intercession with the Gods: Caches and Their Significance at Altun Ha and Lamanai, Belize 1998 in The sowing and the dawning : termination, dedication, and transformation in the archaeological and ethnographic record of Mesoamerica, edited by Shirley Boteler Mock, 1st ed.

Ismailism rose at one point to become the largest branch of Shƒ´ ªism, climaxing as a political power with the Fatimid Caliphate in the tenth through twelfth centuries. Ismailis believe in the oneness of God, as well as the closing of divine revelation with Muhammad, whom they see as \\"the final Prophet and Messenger of God to all humanity\\". The IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ and the Twelvers both accept the same initial Imams. After the death of Muhammad ibn Isma ªil in the 8th century CE, the teachings of Ismailism further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning (batin) of the Islamic religion. With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic (zahir) oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shi ªi Islam developed into two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismaili group focusing on the mystical path and nature of God, with the \\"ImƒÅm of the Time\\" representing the manifestation of esoteric truth and intelligible reality, with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (sharia) and the deeds and sayings (sunnah) of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams who were guides and a light to God.

From the beginning, the Shia asserted the right of Ali, cousin of Muhammad, to have both political and spiritual control over the community. This also included his two sons, who were the grandsons of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. The conflict remained relatively peaceful between the partisans of  ªAli and those who asserted a semi-democratic system of electing caliphs, until the third of the Rashidun caliphs, Uthman was killed, and  ªAlƒ´, with popular support, ascended to the caliphate. Soon after his ascendancy, Aisha, the third of Muhammad's wives, claimed along with Uthman's tribe, the Ummayads, that Ali should take Qisas (blood for blood) from the people responsible for Uthman's death.  ªAli voted against it as he believed that the situation at the time demanded a peaceful resolution of the matter. Both parties could rightfully defend their claims, but due to escalated misunderstandings, the Battle of the Camel was fought and Aisha was defeated but was respectfully escorted to Medina by Ali. Following this battle, Muawiya, the Umayyad governor of Syria, also staged a revolt under the same pretences.  ªAli led his forces against Muawiya until the side of Muawiya held copies of the Quran against their spears and demanded that the issue be decided by Islam's holy book.  ªAli accepted this, and an arbitration was done which ended in his favor. A group among Ali's army believed that subjecting his legitimate authority to arbitration was tantamount to apostasy, and abandoned his forces. This group was known as the Khawarij and  ªAli wished to defeat their forces before they reached the cities where they would be able to blend in with the rest of the population. While he was unable to do this, he nonetheless defeated their forces in subsequent battles. Regardless of these defeats, the Kharijites survived and became a violently problematic group in Islamic history. After plotting an assassination against  ªAli, Muawiya, and the arbitrator of their conflict,  ªAli was successfully assassinated in 661 CE, and the ImƒÅmate passed on to his son Hasan and then later his son Husayn, or according to the Nizari IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´, the Imamate passed temporarily to Hasan, who was an Entrusted Imam (al-imam al-mustawda), and afterwards to Husayn who was the Permanent Imam (al-imam al-mustaqarr). The Entrusted Imam is an Imam in the full sense except that the lineage of the Imamate must continue through the Permanent Imam. However, the political caliphate was soon taken over by Muawiya, the only leader in the empire at that time with an army large enough to seize control. Even some of Ali's early followers regarded him as \\"an absolute and divinely guided leader who could demand of them the same kind of loyalty that would have been expected for the Prophet.\\"Maria Masse Dakake, The Charismatic Community, 57 For example, one of Ali's supporters who also was devoted to Muhammad said to him: \\"our opinion is your opinion and we are in the palm of your right hand.\\"Maria Masse Dakake, The Charismatic Community, 58 The early followers of  ªAli seem to have taken his guidance as \\"right guidance\\" deriving from Divine support. In other words,  ªAli's guidance was seen to be the expression of God's will and the Quranic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of  ªAli was known as walayah and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams. In the first century after Muhammad, the term sunnah was not specifically defined as \\"Sunnah of the Prophet\\" but was used in connection to Abu Bakr,  ªUmar, Uthman, and some Umayyad Caliphs. The idea of \\"Hadith\\" or traditions ascribed to Muhammad was not mainstream nor was Hadith criticism. Even the earliest legal texts by Malik b. Anas and Abu Hanifa employ many methods including analogical reasoning and opinion and do not rely exclusively on hadith. Only in the 2nd century does the Sunni jurist al-Shafi ªi first argue that only the sunnah of Muhammad should be a source of law and that this sunnah is embodied in Hadiths. It would take another one hundred years after al-Shafi ªi for Sunni Muslim jurists to fully base their methodologies on prophetic Hadiths.Adis Duderija, \\"Evolution in the Concept of Sunnah during the First Four Generations of Muslims in Relation to the Development of the Concept of an Authentic ·∏§adƒ´th as based on Recent Western Scholarship\\", Arab Law Quarterly 26 (2012) 393-437http://repository.um.edu.my/28465/1/ALQ_026_04_01-Duderija%20(5).pdf Meanwhile, Imam Shia Muslims followed the Imams' interpretations of Islam as normative without any need for Hadiths and other sources of Sunni law such as analogy and opinion. =Karbala and afterward= The Battle of Karbala After the death of Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn and his family were increasingly worried about the religious and political persecution that was becoming commonplace under the reign of Muawiya's son, Yazid. Amidst this turmoil in 680, Husayn along with the women and children of his family, upon receiving invitational letters and gestures of support by Kufis, wished to go to Kufa and confront Yazid as an intercessor on part of the citizens of the empire. However, he was stopped by Yazid's army in Karbala during the month of Muharram. His family was starved and deprived of water and supplies, until eventually the army came in on the tenth day and martyred Husayn and his companions, and enslaved the rest of the women and family, taking them to Kufa. This battle would become extremely important to the Shi ªi psyche. The Twelvers as well as Musta'li IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ still mourn this event during an occasion known as Ashura. The Nizari IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´, however, do not mourn this in the same way because of the belief that the light of the ImƒÅm never dies but rather passes on to the succeeding ImƒÅm, making mourning arbitrary. However, during commemoration they do not have any celebrations in Jamatkhana during Muharram and may have announcements or sessions regarding the tragic events of Karbala. Also, individuals may observe Muharram in a wide variety of ways. This respect for Muharram does not include self-flagellation and beating because they feel that harming one's body is harming a gift from Allah. Ambigram depicting Muhammad and Ali written in a single word. The 180 degrees inverted form shows both words. The beginnings of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ Da øwah After being set free by Yazid, Zaynab bint Ali, the daughter of Fatimah and Ali and the sister of Hasan and Husayn, started to spread the word of Karbala to the Muslim world, making speeches regarding the event. This was the first organized da øwah of the Shia, which would later develop into an extremely spiritual institution for the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s. After the poisoning of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin by Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 713, Shiism's first succession crisis arose with Zayd ibn  ªAlƒ´'s companions and the Zaydƒ´s who claimed Zayd ibn  ªAlƒ´ as the ImƒÅm, whilst the rest of the Shia upheld Muhammad al-Baqir as the ImƒÅm. The Zaidis argued that any sayyid or \\"descendant of Muhammad through Hasan or Husayn\\" who rebelled against tyranny and the injustice of his age could be the ImƒÅm. The Zaidis created the first Shi ªi states in Iran, Iraq, and Yemen. In contrast to his predecessors, Muhammad al-Baqir focused on academic Islamic scholarship in Medina, where he promulgated his teachings to many Muslims, both Shia and non-Shia, in an extremely organized form of Da øwah. In fact, the earliest text of the Ismaili school of thought is said to be the Umm al-kitab (The Archetypal Book), a conversation between Muhammad al- Baqir and three of his disciples.S.H. Nasr (2006), Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy, State University of New York Press, p. 146 This tradition would pass on to his son, Ja'far al- Sadiq, who inherited the ImƒÅmate on his father's death in 743. Ja'far al-Sadiq excelled in the scholarship of the day and had many pupils, including three of the four founders of the Sunni madhhabs. However, following al-Sadiq's poisoning in 765, a fundamental split occurred in the community. Isma ªil ibn Jafar, who at one point was appointed by his father as the next Imam, appeared to have predeceased his father in 755. While Twelvers argue that either he was never heir apparent or he truly predeceased his father and hence Musa al- Kadhim was the true heir to the Imamate, the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s argue that either the death of Isma ªil was staged in order to protect him from Abbasid persecution or that the Imamate passed to Muhammad ibn Isma ªil in lineal descent. =Ascension of the Dais= A Persian miniature depicting Shams Tabrizi in a circa 1503 copy of his disciple Rumi's poem, the \\"Diwan-e Shams-e Tabriz-i\\". Shams Tabrizi is believed to have been an Ismaili Dai and his relationship with Rumi a symbolic manifestation of the sacred relationship between the guide and the guided. For some partisans of IsmƒÅ øƒ´l, the ImƒÅmate ended with IsmƒÅ øƒ´l ibn Ja'far. Most Ismailis recognized Muhammad ibn Isma ªil as the next Imam and some saw him as the expected Mahdi that Ja'far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ ImƒÅms according to the Nizari and Mustaali found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded Abbasid Caliphate, which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 CE. At this point, some of the Ismaili community believed that Muhammad ibn Ismail had gone into the Occultation and that he would one day return. A small group traced the Imamat among Muhammad ibn Ismail's lineal descendants. With the status and location of the ImƒÅms not known to the community, the concealed Ismaili Imams began to propagate the faith through DƒÅ øiyy≈´n from its base in Syria. This was the start of the spiritual beginnings of the Da øwah that would later play important parts in the all Ismaili branches, especially the Nizaris and the Musta'lis. The Da'i was not a missionary in the typical sense, and he was responsible for both the conversion of his student as well as the mental and spiritual well being. The Da'i was a guide and light to the ImƒÅm. The teacher-student relationship of the Da'i and his student was much like the one that would develop in Sufism. The student desired God, and the Da'i could bring him to God by making him recognize the ImƒÅm, who possesses the knowledge of the Oneness of God. The Da'i and Imam were respectively the spiritual mother and spiritual father of the Isma ªili believers. Ja ªfar bin Man·π£≈´r al-Yaman's The Book of the Sage and Disciple is a classic of early FƒÅ·π≠imid literature, documenting important aspects of the development of the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ da ªwa in tenth-century Yemen. The book is also of considerable historical value for modern scholars of Arabic prose literature as well as those interested in the relationship of esoteric Shƒ´ ªism with early Islamic mysticism. Likewise is the book an important source of information regarding the various movements within tenth-century Shƒ´ ªism leading to the spread of the FƒÅ·π≠imid-Isma ªƒ´lƒ´ da ªwa throughout the medieval Islamicate world, and the religious and philosophical history of post-FƒÅ·π≠imid Musta ªlƒ´ branch of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lism in Yemen and India. Shams Tabrizi and Rumi is a famous example of the importance of the relationship between the guide and the guided, and Rumi dedicated much of his literature to Shams Tabrizi and his discovery of the truth. =The Qarmatians= While many of the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ were content with the Dai teachings, a group that mingled Persian nationalism and Zoroastrianism surfaced known as the Qarmatians. With their headquarters in Bahrain, they accepted a young Persian former prisoner by the name of Abu'l-Fa·∏çl al-Isfahani, who claimed to be the descendant of the Persian kings as their Mahdi, and rampaged across the Middle-East in the tenth century, climaxing their violent campaign by stealing the Black Stone from the Kaaba in Mecca in 930 under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi. Following the arrival of the Al- Isfahani, they changed their qibla from the Kaaba in Mecca to the Zoroastrian- influenced fire. After their return of the Black Stone in 951 and a defeat by the Abbasids in 976 the group slowly dwindled off and no longer has any adherents. =The Fatimid Caliphate= Al-Hakim Mosque in Cairo, Egypt, erected by al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, an IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ ImƒÅm and Fatimid Caliph. Rise of the Fatimid Caliphate The political asceticism practiced by the ImƒÅms during the period after Muhammad ibn Ismail was to be short lived and finally concluded with the ImƒÅmate of Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, who was born in 873. After decades of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s believing that Muhammad ibn Ismail was in the Occultation and would return to bring an age of justice, al-Mahdi taught that the ImƒÅms had not been literally secluded, but rather had remained hidden to protect themselves and had been organizing the Da'i, and even acted as Da'i themselves. After raising an army and successfully defeating the Aghlabids in North Africa and a number of other victories, al-Mahdi Billah successfully established a Shi ªi political state ruled by the ImƒÅmate in 910. This was the only time in history where the Shi ªa Imamate and Caliphate were united after the first Imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib. In parallel with the dynasty's claim of descent from  ªAlƒ´ and FƒÅ·π≠imah, the empire was named \\"Fatimid\\". However, this was not without controversy, and recognizing the extent that IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ doctrine had spread, the Abbasid Caliphate assigned Sunni and Twelver scholars the task to disprove the lineage of the new dynasty. This became known as the Baghdad Manifesto and it traces the lineage of the Fatimids to a Jewish blacksmith. The Middle East under Fatimid rule The Fatimid Caliphate at its peak. The Fatimid Caliphate expanded quickly under the subsequent ImƒÅms. Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Yemen, Hejaz and the Tihamah. Under the Fatimids, Egypt flourished and developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages. The Fatimids promoted ideas that were radical for that time. One was promotion by merit rather than genealogy. Also during this period the three contemporary branches of Ismailism formed. The first branch (Druze) occurred with the al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Born in 985, he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. A religious group that began forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and refused to acknowledge his successor. Later to be known as the Druze, they believe Al-Hakim to be the manifestation of God and the prophesied Mahdi, who would one day return and bring justice to the world. The faith further split from Ismailism as it developed unique doctrines which often class it separately from both Ismailism and Islam. Arwa al-Sulayhi was the Hujjah in Yemen from the time of Imam al Mustansir. She appointed the Dai in Yemen to run religious affairs. Ismaili missionaries Ahmed and Abadullah (in about 1067 CE (460 AH))The Bohras, By: Asgharali Engineer, Vikas Pub. House, p.109,101 were also sent to India in that time. They sent Syedi Nuruddin to Dongaon to look after southern part and Syedi Fakhruddin to East Rajasthan, India., Mullahs on the Mainframe.., By Jonah Blank, p.139The Isma ªilis: Their History and Doctrines By Farhad Daftary; p.299 The second split occurred following the death of al-Mustansir Billah in 1094 CE. His rule was the longest of any caliph in both the Fatimid and other Islamic empires. After he died, his sons Nizar, the older, and al- Musta'li, the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty. Nizar was defeated and jailed, but according to Nizari sources his son escaped to Alamut, where the Iranian IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ had accepted his claim. The Mustaali line split again between the Taiyabi and the Hafizi, the former claiming that the 21st ImƒÅm and son of al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah went into occultation and appointed a DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq to guide the community, in a similar manner as the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ had lived after the death of Muhammad ibn Ismail. The latter claimed that the ruling Fatimid caliph was the ImƒÅm. However, in the Mustaali branch, the Dai came to have a similar but more important task. The term DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq () literally means \\"the absolute or unrestricted missionary\\". This dai was the only source of the ImƒÅm's knowledge after the occultation of al-Qasim in Mustaali thought. According to Taiyabi Ismaili tradition, after the death of ImƒÅm al-Amƒ´r, his infant son, at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim, about 2 years old, was protected by the most important woman in Musta'li history after Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah. She was Arwa al-Sulayhi, a queen in Yemen. She was promoted to the post of hujjah long before by ImƒÅm Mustansir at the death of her husband. She ran the dawat from Yemen in the name of Imaam Tayyib. She was instructed and prepared by ImƒÅm Mustansir and ran the dawat from Yemen in the name of Imaam Tayyib, following ImƒÅms for the second period of Satr. It was going to be on her hands, that ImƒÅm Tayyib would go into seclusion, and she would institute the office of the DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq. Zoeb bin Moosa was first to be instituted to this office. Dai continued in Yemen up to 24th Dai Yusuf who shifted Dawat to India. . Before the shift of Dawat in India Dai's representative were known as Wali-ul-Hind. Syedi Hasan Feer was one of the prominent Ismaili wali of 14th century. The line of Tayyib Dais that began in 1132 is still continuing under the main sect known as Dawoodi Bohra (see list of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra). The Mustaali split several times over disputes regarding who was the rightful DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq, the leader of the community within The Occultation. After the 27th Dai, Syedna Dawood bin Qutub Shah, there was another split; the ones following Syedna Dawood came to be called Dawoodi Bohra, and followers of Suleman were then called Sulaimani. Dawoodi Bohra's present Dai al Mutlaq, the 53rd, is Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, and he and his devout followers tread the same path, following the same tradition of the Aimmat Fatimiyyeen. The Sulaymani are mostly concentrated in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with some communities in the South Asia. The Dawoodi Bohra and Alavi Bohra are mostly exclusive to South Asia, after the migration of the Da'wah from Yemen to India. Other groups include Atba-i-Malak and Hebtiahs Bohra. Mustaali beliefs and practices, unlike those of the Nizari and Druze, are completely compatible with mainstream Islam, representing a continuation of Fatimid tradition and fiqh. Decline of the Caliphate In the 1040s, the Zirid dynasty (governors of the Maghreb under the Fatimids) declared their independence and their conversion to Sunni Islam, which led to the devastating Banu Hilal invasions. After about 1070, the Fatimid hold on the Levant coast and parts of Syria was challenged by first Turkish invasions, then the First Crusade, so that Fatimid territory shrunk until it consisted only of Egypt. Damascus fell to the Seljuk Empire in 1076, leaving the Fatimids only in charge of Egypt and the Levantine coast up to Tyre and Sidon. Because of the vehement opposition to the Fatimids from the Seljuks, the Ismaili movement was only able to operate as a terrorist underground movement, much like the Assassins. After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo had his general, Saladin, seize Egypt in 1169, forming the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty. This signaled the end of the Hafizi Mustaali branch of Ismailism as well as the Fatimid Caliphate. =Alamut= Hassan-i Sabbah Very early in the empire's life, the Fatimids sought to spread the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ faith, which in turn would spread loyalty to the ImƒÅmate in Egypt. One of their earliest attempts was taken by a missionary by the name of Hassan-i Sabbah. Hassan-i Sabbah was born into a Twelver family living in the scholarly Persian city of Qom in 1056 CE. His family later relocated to the city of Tehran, which was an area with an extremely active IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ Da øwah. He immersed himself in IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ thought; however, he did not choose to convert until he was overcome with an almost fatal illness and feared dying without knowing the ImƒÅm of his time. Afterwards, Hassan-i Sabbah became one of the most influential Dais in IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ history; he became important to the survival of the Nizari branch of Ismailism, which today is its largest branch. Legend holds that he met with ImƒÅm al-Mustansir Billah and asked him who his successor would be, to which he responded that it would be his eldest son Nizar (Fatimid Imam). Hassan-i Sabbah continued his missionary activities, which climaxed with his taking of the famous citadel of Alamut. Over the next two years, he converted most of the surrounding villages to Ismailism. Afterwards, he converted most of the staff to Ismailism, took over the fortress, and presented Alamut's king with payment for his fortress, which he had no choice but to accept. The king reluctantly abdicated his throne, and Hassan-i Sabbah turned Alamut into an outpost of Fatimid rule within Abbasid territory. The Hashasheen / Assassiyoon Surrounded by the Abbasids and other hostile powers and low in numbers, Hassan-i Sabbah devised a way to attack the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´'s enemies with minimal losses. Using the method of assassination, he ordered the murders of Sunni scholars and politicians who he felt threatened the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed on the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message to mean that he was marked for death. When an assassination was actually carried out, the Hashasheen would not be allowed to run away; instead, to strike further fear into the enemy, they would stand near the victim without showing any emotion and departed only when the body was discovered. This further increased the ruthless reputation of the Hashasheen throughout Sunni-controlled lands. The English word, assassination, is said to have been derived from the Arabic word Hashasheen. It means both \\"those who use hashish\\", and one of the Shiite Ismaili sects in the Syria of the eleventh century. Threshold of the ImƒÅmate View of Alamut besieged. After the imprisonment of Nizar by his younger brother Ahmad al Mustaali, various sources indicate that Nizar's son Ali Al-Hadi ibn Nizaral-HƒÅdƒ´ survived and fled to Alamut. He was offered a safe place in Alamut, where Hassan-Al-Sabbah welcomed him. However, it is believed this was not announced to the public and the lineage was hidden until a few ImƒÅms later. It was announced with the advent of ImƒÅm Hassan II. In a show of his ImƒÅmate and to emphasize the interior meaning (the batin) over the exterior meaning (the zahir), Imam Hasan announced the Qiyamah (spiritual resurrection) ‚Äì the beginning of a new era in which the spiritual meaning of the religious law was revealed and practiced openly. He prayed with his back to Mecca, as did the rest of the congregation, who prayed behind him, and ordered the community to break their Ramadan fasting with a feast at noon. He made a speech saying that the Imam had brought his murids to the qiyamah from the shariah. Afterwards his descendants ruled as the ImƒÅms at Alamut until its destruction by the Mongols. Destruction by the Mongols Though it had successfully warded off Sunni attempts to take it several times, including one by Saladin, the stronghold at Alamut soon met its destruction. By 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite many of the once antagonistic Mongol tribes into a ruthless, but nonetheless unified, force. Using many new and unique military techniques, Genghis Khan led his Mongol hordes across Central Asia into the Middle East, where they won a series of tactical military victories using a scorched earth policy. A grandson of Genghis Khan, Hulagu Khan, led the devastating attack on Alamut in 1256, only a short time before sacking the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad in 1258. As he would later do to the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, he destroyed IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ as well as Islamic religious texts. The ImƒÅmate that was located in Alamut along with its few followers were forced to flee and take refuge elsewhere. =Aftermath= After the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate and its bases in Iran and Syria, the three currently living branches of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ generally developed geographically isolated from each other, with the exception of Syria (which has both Druze and Nizari) and Pakistan and the rest of South Asia (which had both Mustaali and Nizari). The Musta'li progressed mainly under the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ adhering Yemeni ruling class well into the 12th century, until the fall of the last Sulayhid dynasty, Hamdanids (Yemen) and Zurayids rump state in 1197 AD, then they shifted their dawat to India under the Dai al Mutlaq, working on behalf of their last Imam, Taiyyab, and are known as Bohra. From India, various groups spread mainly to south Asia and eventually to the Middle East, Europe, Africa and America. The Nizari have maintained large populations in Syria, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and they have smaller populations in China and Iran. This community is the only one with a living ImƒÅm, whose title is the Aga Khan. Badakhshan, which includes parts of northeastern Afghanistan and southeastern Tajikistan, is the only part of the world where Ismailis make up the majority of the population.Ismaili Muslims in the remote Pamir mountains The Druze mainly settled in Syria and Lebanon and developed a community based upon the principles of reincarnation through their own descendants. Their leadership is based on community scholars, who are the only individuals allowed to read their holy texts. There is controversy over whether this group falls under the classification of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´sm or Islam because of its unique beliefs. The Tajiks of Xinjiang, being Ismaili, were not subjected to being enslaved in China by Sunni Muslim Turkic peoples because the two peoples did not share a common geographical region. . The Burusho people of Pakistan are also Nizaris. However, due to their isolation from the rest of the world, Islam reached the Hunza about 350 years ago. Ismailism has been practiced by the Hunza for the last 300 years. The Hunza have been ruled by the same family of kings for over 900 years. They were called Kanjuts. Sunni Islam never took root in this part of central Asia so even now, there are less than a few dozen sunnis living among the Hunza. =Ismaili historiography= One of the most important texts in Ismaili historiography is the  øUyun al-akhbar, which is a reference source on the history of Ismailism that was composed in 7 books by the Tayyibi Musta ªlian Ismaili da ªi-scholar, Idris Imad al-Din (born ca. 1392). This text presents the most comprehensive history of the Ismaili imams and da ªwa, from the earliest period of Muslim history until the late Fatimid era. The author, Idris Imad al-Din, descended from the prominent al-Walid family of the Quraysh in Yemen, who led the Tayyibi Musta ªlian Ismaili da ªwa for more than three centuries. This gave him access to the literary heritage of the Ismailis, including the majority of the extant Fatimid manuscripts transferred to Yemen. The  ªUyun al-akhbar is being published in 7 volumes of annotated Arabic critical editions as part of an institutional collaboration between the Institut Fran√ßais du Proche Orient (IFPO) in Damascus and The Institute of Ismaili Studies (IIS) in London. This voluminous text has been critically edited based on several old manuscripts from The Institute of Ismaili Studies' vast collection. These academic editions have been prepared by a team of Syrian and Egyptian scholars, including Dr Ayman F¬≠ Sayyid, and this major publication project has been coordinated by Dr Nader El-Bizri (IIS) and Dr Sarab Atassi-Khattab (IFPO). Beliefs =View on the Quran= IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s believe the Quran was sent to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il in Arabic) over the course of 23 years. They believe that the Imam has the authority to interpret the Quran in relation to the present time. =The Ginans and Qasidas= The Ginans are Nizari religious texts. They are written in the form of poetry by Pirs to interpret the meanings of Quranic ayat into the languages of South Asia, especially Gujarati and Urdu. In comparison to Ginans, IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s of other origins, such as Persians, Arabs, and Central Asians, have qasidas () written in Persian by missionaries such as Nasir Khusraw and Hasan bin Sabah =Reincarnation (Druze)= Belief in reincarnation exists in the Druze faith, an offshoot of Ismailism. The Druze believe that members of their community can only be reincarnated within the community. It is also known that Druze believe in five cosmic principles, represented by the five-colored Druze star: intelligence/reason (green), soul (red), word (yellow), precedent (blue), and immanence (white). These virtues take the shape of five different spirits which, until recently, have been continuously reincarnated on Earth as prophets and philosophers including Adam, the ancient Greek mathematician and astronomer Pythagoras, the ancient Pharaoh of Egypt Akhenaten, and many others. The Druze believe that, in every time period, these five principles were personified in five different people who came down together to Earth to teach humans the true path to God and enlightenment, but that with them came five other individuals who would lead people away from the right path into \\"darkness.\\" =Numerology= IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s believe numbers have religious meanings. The number seven plays a general role in the theology of the IsmƒÅ'ƒ´liyya, including mystical speculations that there are seven heavens, seven continents, seven orifices in the skull, seven days in a week, and so forth. =Imamate= zƒÅhir meaning apparent, and the bƒÅtin, meaning hidden. For this sect, the ImƒÅm is the manifestation of truth, and hence he is their path of salvation to God. Classical IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ doctrine holds that divine revelation had been given in six periods (daur) entrusted to six prophets, who they also call Natiq (Speaker), who were commissioned to preach a religion of law to their respective communities. Whereas the Natiq was concerned with the rites and outward shape of religion, the inner meaning is entrusted to a Wasi (Representative). The Wasi would know the secret meaning of all rites and rules and would reveal them to a small circles of initiates. The Natiq and the Wasi are in turn succeeded by a line of seven ImƒÅms, who guard what they received. The seventh and last ImƒÅm in any period becomes the Natiq of the next period. The last ImƒÅm of the sixth period, however, would not bring about a new religion of law but rather supersede all previous religions, abrogate the law and introduce din Adama al-awwal (\\"the original religion of Adam\\") practised by Adam and the angels in paradise before the fall, which would be without ritual or law but consist merely in all creatures praising the creator and recognizing his unity. This final stage was called the Qiyamah. =Pir and Dawah= Just as the ImƒÅm is seen by Ismailis as the manifestation of the first-created Light, during the period between the ImƒÅmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the relationship between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the ImƒÅm to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned to love the ImƒÅm, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir. The Imam is the Pir in Nizari Ismailism. =ZƒÅhir= In Ismailism, things have an exterior meaning, what is apparent. This is called zƒÅhir. =BƒÅtin= In Ismailism, things have an interior meaning that is reserved for a special few who are in tune with the ImƒÅm, or are the ImƒÅm himself. This is called bƒÅtin.Ismaili Esoteric Interpretation of the Qur ºan ='Aql= As with other Shia, IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s believe that the understanding of God is derived from the first light in the universe, the light of 'Aql, which in Arabic roughly translates as 'Intellect' or to 'bind' (Latin: Intellectus). It is through this Universal Intellect ('aql al- kull) that all living and non-living entities know God, and all of humanity is dependent and united in this light. Contrastingly, in Twelver thought this includes the Prophets as well, especially Muhammad, who is the greatest of all the manifestations of 'Aql. God, in Isma ªili metaphysics, is seen as above and beyond all conceptions, names, and descriptions. He transcends all positive and negative qualities, and knowledge of God as such is above all human comprehension. Read more at: Ismaili Musim Teachings on Tawhid from Primary Sources For the Shia, the Light (nur) of the Imamate is the Universal Intellect, and consequently, the Imam on earth is the focus of manifestation (mazhar) of the Intellect. =Dasond (Zakat)= The Ismailis have submitted the Quranic zakat (see Quran 9:103), which is a purification due and not charitable alms, to the Imams since the death of Muhammad. The zakat rates historically differed depending on the asset type: 2.5% of animals, 5% of minerals, and 10% of crops. Among Khoja Ismailis, the zakat is 12.5% of cash income and among other Ismailis of Iran, Syria, Central Asia, and China, the zakat is 10% of cash income and other %s of non-cash assets like crops and livestock.The Essential Ismaili & Ismaili Gnosis, \\"What is the Concept of Zakat (Dasond)\\" The entire zakat amount is given to the Ismaili Imam through his representatives in the Jamatkhanas, called Mukhi-Sahibs. The zakat/dasond funds are used exclusively for the benefit of the community ‚Äî and for the expenses the Office of the Imamat incurs in this work. And even though the Imam has a right to a portion of those funds, personally, in fact the reverse happens and the Imam supplements Imamat funds from his personal resources, sometimes by an additional 150%. This has been documented in several interviews of the present Aga Khan. Walayah Walayah is translated from Arabic as \\"guardianship\\" and denotes \\"Love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Aimmat and ImƒÅm uz Zaman, and the Dai.\\" It also denotes Ta'at (following every order without protest, but with one's soul's happiness, knowing that nothing is more important than a command from God and that the command of His vicegerents is His Word). In IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and he manifests himself in the forms of Prophets and ImƒÅms; to be guided to his path, one requires a messenger or a guide: a Dai. For the true mawali of the Imam and Dai, heaven is made obligatory. And only with this crucial walayat, they believe, will all the other pillars and acts ordained by Islam be judged or even looked at by God. Taharah or Shahada =Taharah= A pillar which translates from Arabic as \\"purity.\\" As well as a pure soul, it includes bodily purity and cleanliness; without Taharat of the body, clothes and ma'salla, Salaat will not be accepted. =Shahada= In place of Taharah, the Druze have the Shahada, or affirmation of faith. Salat Zakat A pillar which translates as \\"charity.\\" With the exception of the Druze sect, the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s' form of zakat resembles the Zakat of other Muslims. Along with zakat, the Twelvers also pay khums, which is 1/5 of one's unspent money at the end of the year. IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s pay a tithe of 12.5%, which is used for development projects in the eastern world, primarily to benefit IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s and, by extension, other communities living in that area. Sawm A pillar which is translated as \\"fasting.\\" Sunni and Shi ªite Muslims fast by abstaining from food, drink from dawn to sunset as well purifying the soul by avoiding sinful acts and doing good deeds, e.g., not lying, being honest in daily life, not backbiting, etc., for 30 days during the holy month of Ramadan (9th month of the Islamic calendar). In contrast, the Nizari and Musta'ali sects believe in a metaphorical as well as a literal meaning of fasting. The literal meaning is that one must fast as an obligation, such as during Ramadan, and the metaphorical meaning is seeking to attain the Divine Truth and striving to avoid worldly activities which may detract from this goal. In particular, IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s believe that the esoteric meaning of fasting involves a \\"fasting of the soul\\", whereby they attempt to purify the soul simply by avoiding sinful acts and doing good deeds. Still, many Nizari Ismailis around the world fast during the month of Ramadan every year. In addition, the Nizari also fast on \\"Shukravari Beej\\" which falls on a Friday that coincides with the New Moon. Hajj Many Ismaili sects do not ascribe to mainstream Islamic beliefs regarding the Hajj, considering it instead to metaphorically mean visiting the Imam himself, that being the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. Since the Druze do not follow shariah, they do not believe in a literal pilgrimage to the Kaaba in Mecca as other Muslims do, while the Mustaali (Bohras) as well as the Nizaris still hold on to the literal meaning as well, performing hajj to the Ka'aba and also visiting the Imam (or in a secluded time like today, the Dai, who is the representative or vicegerent of the Imam) to be Hajj-e Haqiqi. Jihad For the Isma ªilis, jihad is the last of the Seven Islamic Pillars, and for them it means a struggle against one's own soul; striving toward righteousness, and sometimes as struggle in warfare. However, Isma ªilis will stress that none but their Imam uz Zaman [Imam of the Time] can declare war and call his followers to fight. Branches Khawlah, not Fatimah.) Nizari symbol of the Agha Khan. The largest part of the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ community, the Qasim-Shahi Nizari IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s, today accept Prince Karim Aga Khan IV as their 49th ImƒÅm, who they claim is descended from Mu·∏•ammad through his daughter FƒÅ·π≠imah az-Zahra and 'Ali, Mu·∏•ammad's cousin and son-in-law. The 46th IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ ImƒÅm, Aga Hassan  ªAlƒ´ Shah, fled Iran in the 1840s after being blamed for a failed coup against the Shah of the Qajar dynasty. Aga Hassan  ªAlƒ´ Shah settled in Mumbai in 1848. =Islamic marriage contract reforms by the Aga Khan III=  History  The Nizari Ismaili Imams (known as the Aga Khans since the 18th century have used their power to institute reforms in the status and treatment of women in the community. Aga Khan III, the 48th Nizari Ismaili Imam, was passionate in this movement. He came into his role at an early age, due to his father's early death, so his mother, Lady Ali Shah, played an influential role during his early years. The influence of women during his rule continued in his later years with his wife Umm Habiba. Imam Aga Khan III ruled from 1885 to 1957 and the current 49th Imam, his grandson, Imam Aga Khan IV commenced his rule in 1957. A majority of Aga Khan III's efforts sought to reform Islamic marriage contract laws which have significantly contributed to improving the status of women within the Nizari Ismaili community.  Reforms (on marriage, divorce, segregation and education)  The focus of Imam Aga Khan III's message was to promote the idea that women were free and independent. In a message to his followers in 1926, he proclaimed that: \\"I do not want Ismaili women dependent on anyone‚Äîtheir parents, husbands, or anyone except God...I have no doubt that the whole spirit and teaching of my ancestor the Holy Prophet encouraged the evolution of all legitimate freedom and legitimate equality before men and women\\". He encouraged women to participate in social and political affairs and criticized veiling as well as gender segregation, including the acts of pardah (masking of oneself from the public) and zenana (restraint on women from leaving the home). Aga Khan III believed economic independence was key to achieving this equality and freedom. By becoming educated and earning their own livelihood, women would no longer be a burden on their parents or spouses. He proclaimed: \\"I am trying to guide our young women's lives into entirely new channels. I want to see them able to earn their livings in trades and professions, so that they are not economically dependent on marriage, nor a burden on their fathers and brother[s]\\". In effect, marriage would no longer be imposed on women due to economic necessity. With this independence, Ismaili women possess greater choice and will when it comes to marriage. The Aga Khan III realized that education was at the forefront of this reform and encouraged parents who only had enough money to send one child to school to send their daughters. And this advocacy for education was not limited to elementary literacy. To ensure girls had access to education, there was a minimum marriageable age instituted (for both boys and girls) and child marriage was banned. Moreover, marriage against the will of the bride was outlawed as brides were to sign their marriage contracts according to their choice. Other reforms in marriage laws included decisions on polygamy and divorce. In 1905, polygamy was permitted with the condition of the \\"maintenance of the first wife\\" and later that was changed to only be allowed for specific reasons. In 1962, polygamy was outlawed within the Nizari Ismaili community. Women were allowed to divorce their husbands and for a husband to divorce his wife, he was required to stand before a council which ultimately decided whether the divorce was granted or denied. Additionally, Aga Khan III took efforts to eliminate and mitigate the stigma around divorces and divorced women.  Barriers to Realization of Reforms  A discrepancy exists between the rights offered to women through these reforms and the actual realization of the practice of those rights. Cultural norms and views continue to guide many members of the community who criticize the reforms as being influenced from western values. The Aga Khan responded to this critique by claiming that: \\"While the words of the Koran remain the same, every generation, every century, every period must have a new and different interpretation of the past, otherwise Islam will die and will not survive the competition of some healthy less rigid competitors\\". Additional barriers to practice of reforms include the fact that the councils implementing the forms are often majority male who may still adhere to patriarchal norms. The laws of the countries in which Ismaili women reside also impact the implementation of reforms. Sharia law, common in most Sunni majority countries, is often in contrast to the Ismaili reforms and so residents of these countries must adhere to the country's rules and regulations. The situation of Ismaili women depends on factors including their government and its laws, economic ability, resource availability, and global conditions. =Muhammad-Shahi Nizari/Mumini= The offshoot of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis who follow the elder son of Shams al-Din (Nizari) Mu·∏•ammad d. 1310, the 28th Qasim-Shahi Imam, named  ªAlƒÅ º ad-Dƒ´n Mumin ShƒÅh d. 1337 (26th Imam of the Muhammad-Shahi or Mumini Nizari Ismailis) and his son Muhammad Shah d 1404, the twenty seventh Imam. They follow this line of Imams until the disappearance of the 40th Imam al-Amir Muhammad al-Baqir in 1796 when they lost contact with him while he resided in India. The bulk of this group joined the Qasim-Shahi Nizaris led by the Aga Khan in 1887. There are 15,000 followers of this line of Nizari Imams in Syria today, locally called the Jafariyah who follow the Shafi‚Äòi Fiqh in the absence of their Imam. There is also a historical dispute as to whether Imam Qasim Shah was a brother or a paternal uncle to  ªAlƒÅ º ad-Dƒ´n Mumin ShƒÅh. The most famous Imam of this line of Nizari Imams was Shah Tahir bin Radi al- Din II al-Husayni ad-Dakkani, the 31st Imam who died in 1549. He was famous for converting the sultan of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate Burhan Nizam Shah I to Shia Islam. His father the 30th Imam Radi al-Din II bin Tahir who died in 1509, came from Sistan to Badakshan and established his rule of the region. He was killed and a regional Timurid dynasty ruler Mirza Khan established his rule over the region. Musta'ali In time, the seat for one chain of the Dai was split between India and Yemen as the community split several times, each recognizing a different Dai. Today, the Dawoodi Bohras, which constitute the majority of the Mustaali IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ accept Mufaddal Saifuddin as the 53rd DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq. The Dawoodi Bohras are based in India, along with the Alavi Bohra. Minority groups of the Sulaymani, however, exist in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In recent years, there has been a rapprochement between the Sulaymani, Dawoodi and Alavi Mustaali sub-sects. The Mustaali sects are the most traditional of the three main groups of IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´, maintaining rituals such as prayer and fasting more consistently with the practices of other Shi ªi sects. It is often said that they resemble Sunni Islam even more than Twelvers do, though this would hold true for matters of the exterior rituals (zahir) only, with little bearing on doctrinal or theological differences. =Dawoodi Bohra= The divisions of the Mustaali, sometimes referred to as Bohras. The Dawoodi Bohras are a very close-knit community who seek advice from the Dai on spiritual and temporal matters. Dawoodi Bohras is headed by the DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq, who is appointed by his predecessor in office. The DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq appoints two others to the subsidiary ranks of mƒÅz≈´n (Arabic Ma æ·∏è≈´n ŸÖÿ£ÿ∞ŸàŸÜ) \\"licentiate\\" and MukƒÅsir (). These positions are followed by the rank of ra'sul hudood, bhaisaheb, miya-saheb, shaikh-saheb and mulla-saheb, which are held by several of Bohras. The 'Aamil or Saheb-e Raza who is granted the permission to perform the religious ceremonies of the believers by the DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq and also leads the local congregation in religious, social and community affairs, is sent to each town where a sizable population of believers exists. Such towns normally have a masjid (commonly known as mosque) and an adjoining jamaa'at-khaana (assembly hall) where socio-religious functions are held. The local organizations which manage these properties and administer the social and religious activities of the local Bohras report directly to the central administration of the DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq. While the majority of Dawoodi Bohras have traditionally been traders, it is becoming increasingly common for them to become professionals. Some choose to become Doctors, consultants or analysts as well as a large contingent of medical professionals. Dawoodi Bohras are encouraged to educate themselves in both religious and secular knowledge, and as a result, the number of professionals in the community is rapidly increasing. Dawoodi Bohras believe that the education of women is equally important as that of men, and many Dawoodi Bohra women choose to enter the workforce. Al Jamea tus Saifiyah (The Arabic Academy) in Mumbai, Surat, Nairobi and Karachi is a sign to the educational importance in the Dawoodi community. The Academy has an advanced curriculum which encompasses religious and secular education for both men and women. Today there are approximately one million Dawoodi Bohra. The majority of these reside in India and Pakistan, but there is also a significant diaspora residing in the Middle East, East Africa, Europe, North America and the Far East. The ordinary Bohra is highly conscious of his identity, and this is especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the back like the hood of a jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community. They believe that straying away from the community implies straying away from Ma'ad ‚Äì the ultimate objective of this life and the meaning of the teachings of Islam, which is to return to where all souls comes from and re-unite with Allah. Besides, converting someone to Islam has high spiritual and religious significance as doctrines espouse that making someone a Muslim or Mu'min confers the Sawab (reward of good deeds) equivalent to that of 40 Hajjs and 40 Umrahs (visiting Mecca and the Kaaba during days other than that of Hajj). The position of Da'i al-Mutlaq is currently disputed after the demise of the 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Mohammed Burhanuddin. Two claimants emerged for the position of 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq, Mufaddal Saifuddin and Khuzaima Qutbuddin, and a case is pending in the Bombay High Court to resolve the matter. Qutbuddin has since died and appointed his son Taher Fakhruddin as his successor. Besides speaking the local languages, the Dawoodis have their own language called LisƒÅnu l-DƒÅ ªwat \\"Tongue of the DƒÅ ªwat\\". This is written in the Persian alphabet but is derived from Urdu, Gujarati and Arabic and Persian. =Sulaymani= Founded in 1592, the Sulaymani are mostly concentrated in Yemen but are also found in Pakistan and India. The denomination is named after its 27th Da ªƒ´, Sulayman bin Hassan. They are referred and prefer to be referred as Ahle-Haq Isma ªilis and Sulaymanis and not with the Bohras suffix. The total number of Sulaymanis currently are around 300,000, mainly living in the eastern district of Jabal Haraz in northwest Yemen and in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Beside the Banu Yam of Najran, the Sulaymanis are in Haraz, among the inhabitants of the Jabal Maghariba and in Hawzan, Lahab and Attara, as well as in the district of Hamadan and in the vicinity of Yarim. In India there are between 3000 and 5000 Sulaymanis living mainly in Vadodara, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Surat. In Punjab, Pakistan, there is a well-established Sulaymani community in Sind. Some ten thousand Sulaymanis live in rural areas of Punjab known to the Sulaymani as Jazeera-e Sind; these Sulaymani communities have been in the Jazeera-e Sind from the time of Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mu'izz li- Din Allah when he sent his Da ªƒ´s to Jazeera-e Sind. There are also some 900‚Äì1000 Sulaymanis mainly from South Asia scattered around the world, in the Persian Gulf States, United States, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. =Alavi Bohra= The  ªAlavi Bohras, popularly and incorrectly known as Alya Bohras, follow a different line of succession of Du ºaat (missionaries) from the 29th da ºi onwards after the split from Da ºudi Bohras in Ahmedabad in 1621 CE. They believe the rightful da ºi was a grandson of the 28th da ºi named  ªAli Shams al-Din b. Ibrahim (d. 1046 AH/1637 CE). They are named after this  ªAli, calling themselves  ªAlavis, and their mission ad-Da ºwat ul-Haadiyat ul- ªAlaviyah.ad-Da'wat ul-Haadiyat ul-'Alaviyah is the Spiritual Seat, Divine Mission and Heavenly Call of Da'i of Alavi Bohras linked to the first Prophet of Islam, Maulaana Adam and the First Creation of Allaah, the Intellect ('aql) Three da ºis later, in 1110 AH/1699 CE, the seat of the  ªAlavi Da ºwat was moved from Ahmedabad to Vadodara by 32nd da ºi, acting on the will of 31st da ºi (except for a brief interlude in Surat for 20 years 1158-1178 AH/1745-1764 CE). Since then Vadodara remains the headquarters of the  ªAlavis to this day. The  ªAlavi Bohras have a library of 450 Isma ªili manuscripts, some up to 500 years old, at their centre in Vadodara. Currently  ªAlavi Bohras are a close-knit organized community numbering approximately 8000, with the majority of them settled in Vadodara, where they have their own locality. They have their own masjids and musafirkhanas in places like Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Nadiad in India. Some have migrated to the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, UAE and Europe. Like majority of Bohra communities,  ªAlavi Bohras are mostly traders and dominate the optical and furniture market in Vadodara. They are now increasingly venturing into professions such as law, medicine, engineering, business management, computer sciences. Beings Isma ªili-Taiyebis they follow strictly Fatimid spiritual hierarchical set-up, law, dress code, customs, beliefs, eating hadits, life- style, ethics and customary traditions etc. While lesser known and smallest in number, Alavi Bohras have their spiritual and temporal head as the 45th dƒÅ øƒ´ al-mu·π≠laq, Haatim Zakiyuddin. The doctrines of Alavi Bohras is centered in the recognition of Imam. It continues to be the most important foundation among Bohras. In fact, dai al-mutlaq acts as a direct representative of the concealed Imam as he receives required guidance from him. During this time of the concealment of 21st Fatimid Imam at-Taiyeb and his progeny, the religious hierarchy of the Alavi Bohras is headed by the DƒÅ ªƒ´ al-Mutlaq, who is appointed by his predecessor in office and similar as of Dawoodi Bohra. =Hebtiahs Bohra= The Hebtiahs Bohra are a branch of Mustaali Ismaili Shi ªa Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 39th Da'i al-Mutlaq in 1754. =Atba-i-Malak= The Atba-i Malak jamaat (community) are a branch of Mustaali Ismaili Shi ªa Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq, under the leadership of Abdul Hussain Jivaji. They have further split into two more branches, the Atba-i-Malak Badar and Atba-i-Malak Vakil. = Progressive Dawoodi Bohra = The Progressive Dawoodi Bohra is a reformist sect within Musta'li Ismai'li Shi ªa Islam that broke off circa 1977. They disagree with mainstream Dawoodi Bohra, as led by the Da'i al-Mutlaq, on doctrinal, economic and social issues. Offshoots Chart depicting Ismailism and its offshoots. =Druze= While on one view there is a historical nexus between the Druze and IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s, any such links are purely historical and do not entail any modern similarities, given that one of the Druze's central tenets is trans- migration of the soul (reincarnation) as well as other contrasting beliefs with IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´sm and Islam. Druze is an offshoot of Ismailism. Many historical links do trace back to Syria and particularly Masyaf. =Satpanth= Satpanth is a subgroup of Nizari Ismailism and Ismaili Sufism formed by conversions from Hinduism 700 years ago by Pir Sadardin (1290-1367) and 600 years ago in the 15th century by his grandson Pir Imam Shah (1430-1520), they differ slightly from the Nizari Khojas in that they reject the Aga Khan as their leader and are known more commonly as Imam-Shahi. There are villages in Gujarat which are totally 'Satpanthi' such as Pirana near Ahmedabad where Imam Shah is buried. It is also the older form of Nizari Ismaili practice originating from the Kutch community of Gujarat. Pir Sadardin gave the first converts to Ismailism the name 'Satpanth' because they were the followers of the 'True Path.' They were then given the title of Khoja to replace their title of Thakkar. Extinct branches =B√∂sz√∂rm√©ny= According to the historian Yaqut al-Hamawi, the B√∂sz√∂rm√©ny (Izmaelita or Ismaili/Nizari) denomination of the Muslims who lived in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 10‚Äì13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary. However following the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary their community was Christianized by the end of the 13th century. =Hafizi= This branch held that whoever the political ruler (caliph) of the Fatimid Caliphate was, was also the Imam of the Time, after the reign of Al-Amir, Al-Hafiz was recognized as the Imam of the Time as well as his descendants. The Hafizi Ismaili sect had 26 Imams. The Hafizi sect lived on into the 14th century AD with adherents in Northern Egypt and Syria but had died out by the 15th century AD. =Seveners= A branch of the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ known as the Sab'ƒ´yah \\"Seveners\\" hold that IsmƒÅ øƒ´l's son, Muhammad ibn Ismail, was the seventh and final IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ Imam, who is said to be in the Occultation. However, most scholars believe this group is either extremely small or non-existent today. The Qaramita were the most active branch of the Seveners. Contemporary Ismailism Inclusion in Amman Message and Islamic Ummah The Amman Message, which was issued on 9 November 2004 (27th of Ramadan 1425 AH) by King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, called for tolerance and unity in the Muslim world. Subsequently, the \\"Amman Message\\" Conference took place in Amman, Jordan on 4‚Äì6 July 2005 and a three-point declaration was issued by 200 Muslim academics from over 50 countries focusing on the three issues of: # Defining who is a Muslim; # Excommunication from Islam (takfir); and # Principles related to delivering religious edicts (fatƒÅwa). The three-point declaration (later known as The Three Points of the Amman Message) included both the Ja'fari and Zaydi Shia madhƒÅhib (schools of jurisprudence) among the eight schools of jurisprudence that were listed as being in the Muslim fold and whose adherents were therefore to be considered as Muslim by definition and therefore cannot be excluded from the world community of Muslims. The Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Ismailis, was invited to issue a religious edict for and on behalf of the Ismailis, which he did by a letter explicitly stating that the Ismailis adhered to the Ja'fari school as well as other schools of close affinity including the Sufi principles concerned with personal search for God. The summarization by Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad explicitly delineates on page 11 the place of the Ismailis as being within the Ja'fari school as stated by the Aga Khan. Ismailism amongst Shia Islam The Shia belief throughout its history split over the issue of the Imamate. The largest branch are the Twelvers, followed by the Zaidi and Ismaili and Kaysanite. All the groups follow a different line of Imamate linked together as shown in chart below. =A schematic of the development of important branches = 135px Ismailis in the internet era With the advent of new technologies and way of communications, the office of Ismaili Imamat has made necessary use of the internet and social media in order to keep Ismailis (referred to as Jamat) across the globe updated about new happenings related to the Imam. On April 17, 2016, the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) was successfully delegated the .ismaili TLD. Saudi Arabia argued to ICANN for rejection of the .ismaili TLD among 31 other TLDs. The application was rejected by ICANN. = .ismaili = Following the delegation of the .ismaili TLD, the official website of Ismaili Muslim community was moved from theismaili.org to the.ismaili. The website publishes regular news, event updates, articles and hosts live videos. = the.ismaili on social media = The office of Ismaili Imamat maintains official presence across five social media networks including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. All of the profiles are verified through relevant official authorities. = The Ismaili magazine = The offices of Ismaili imamat in various countries publish a monthly magazine under the name of The Ismaili followed by the country name. For example, The Ismaili Pakistan.

According to the 2010 census, Belize City has a population of 57,169 people in 16,162 households. It is at the mouth of the Haulover Creek, which is a distributary of the Belize River. The Belize River empties into the Caribbean Sea five miles from Belize City on the Philip Goldson Highway on the coast of the Caribbean. The city is the country's principal port and its financial and industrial hub. Cruise ships drop anchor outside the port and are tendered by local citizens. The city was almost entirely destroyed in 1961 when Hurricane Hattie swept ashore on October 31. It was the capital of British Honduras (as Belize was then named) until the government was moved to the new capital of Belmopan in 1970. History Belize City was founded as \\"Belize Town\\" in 1638 by English lumber harvesters. It had been a small Maya city called Holzuz. Belize Town was ideal for the English as a central post because it was on the sea and a natural outlet for local rivers and creeks down which the British shipped logwood and mahogany. Belize Town also became the home of the thousands of African slaves brought in by the English (later the British, beginning in 1707) to toil in the forest industry. It was the coordination site for the 1798 Battle of St. George's Caye, won by the British against would-be invaders, and the home of the local courts and government officials up to the 1970s. For this reason, historians often say that \\"the capital was the colony\\", because the center of British control was here. This sentiment remains true today. Even though people like Antonio Soberanis, George Price and Evan X Hyde all lobbied to take their movements outside, and other ethnic groups such as the Garifuna and Mestizos sprang up elsewhere in the country, people looked to Belize Town for guidance. =Natural disasters= Belize City has been directly struck by two hurricanes since 1900, the 1931 hurricane and 1961's Hurricane Hattie, and at various times areas of the city have burnt down, the most recent being the 1999 Albert Street fire that burnt out Mikado's, and a 2004 fire that destroyed the Paslow Building. The city was also hit hard by Hurricane Richard in 2010 and by the 2016 Hurricane Earl. Fires on the Northside and Southside have burnt out great stretches of housing, but the fire department was able to quench most of these. The city is also susceptible to flooding in the rainy season. Location and geographic setting Belize population density and low elevation coastal zones. Belize City is especially vulnerable to sea level rise. Belize City spreads out Mile 6 on the Western Highway and Mile 5 on the Northern Highway, at the Haulover Bridge. The city proper is usually divided into two areas: Northside, bounded by Haulover Creek and ending in the east at the Fort George area, and Southside, extending to the outskirts of the city and the port area including downtown. Politically, it is divided into ten constituencies. =Cityscape= Freetown, the westernmost constituency on Northside, is home to the Belama, Coral Grove, Buttonwood Bay and Vista Del Mar suburbs. Within the city proper it extends up to around the former Belize Technical College area. Caribbean Shores includes Kings' Park, a small suburb north and west of Freetown Road, West Landivar, home to two of the University of Belize's three city campuses, and residential University Heights. Pickstock inhabits the banks of the Haulover Creek extending to Barrack Road. St. John's Cathedral stands on the southern end of Albert Street. St. John's is the oldest Anglican Church in Central America, and one of the oldest buildings in Belize. The orange bricks came to Belize aboard British ships as ballast. Construction began in 1812, and the church was completed in 1820. St. John's is the only Anglican cathedral in the world outside England where the crowning of kings took place. Fort George is perhaps the most colonial area in the city and contains Memorial Park, the Baron Bliss Grave and Baron Bliss Lighthouse and the Museum of Belize. On the Southside, Lake Independence, Collet and Port Loyola are home to some of the city's poorest residents. \\"London bridges\\", rickety wooden pallets linking dwellings, and low-strung poles are not uncommon here. On the east side of Central American Boulevard are Mesopotamia, Queen's Square and Albert, which are slightly better. Albert contains the downtown streets of Albert and Regent Streets. =Bridges and other infrastructure= Swing Bridge in Belize City is the only functioning, manually operated swing bridge in the world. The divisions of the city are linked by four bridges: the Swing Bridge, at Market Square and North Front Street; the Belchina Bascule Bridge at the Douglas Jones Street and Youth for the Future Drive junction; the Belcan Bridge linking Central American Boulevard and the roundabout leading to the Northern Highway and Caribbean Shores, and a recently built fourth bridge linking Fabers' Road and the southern Lake Independence/Port Loyola area to the Belama and northwest suburbs of the city. Numerous smaller bridges link individual streets. The three main canals running in Belize City, are Haulover Creek, Burdon Canal and Collet Canal. All of them run through Southside. Climate Belize City features a tropical monsoon climate, with warm and humid conditions throughout the course of the year. The city has a lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. However, as is the characteristic of several cities with tropical monsoon climates, Belize City sees some precipitation during its dry season. March is Belize City's driest month with only 48 mm of precipitation observed, a somewhat unusual month for a city with this climate type. Typically the driest month for a city with a tropical monsoon climate is the month after the winter solstice, which in Belize City would be January. Average monthly temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from 24 ¬∞C to 28 ¬∞C. Educational institutions Belize City has more educational institutions at every level than any other city in Belize. Most city children in Belize attend high school. The only three schools that are not coed are on the Northside: Saint John's College (boys), Saint Catherine's Academy (girls) and Pallotti High School (girls). One Southside school that was previously all girls, Sadie Vernon Technical (Belize Continuation), became coed in 2005. http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=1386&frmsrch;=1 There are three other private schools in Belize City: Belize Elementary School and its continuation Belize High School behind it, both on Princess Margret Drive, and the Hummingbird Elementary School. Culture Belize City's culture is considered similar to that of Caribbean capital cities such as St. George's, Grenada, or Georgetown, Guyana. Always busy in the daytime, the city has the hustle and bustle one would associate with a city of 70,800. Notable cultural events include Garifuna Settlement Day (November 19), Belize City Carnival (September), Baron Bliss Day (March 9). Museums in the city include the Bliss Institute, Image Factory Art Foundation and Gallery, the Maritime Museum and the Museum of Belize. There is an annual Street Art Festival. Economy The majority of working Belizeans travel to work in downtown offices or else ply their trade on the street sides. Belize City is home to branches of all the major banks of Belize and the Central Bank, as well as nearly all insurance centers, marketplaces and the like. Belize City is the hub for both national and international air, sea and road travel. =Port of Belize= The city is home to the Port of Belize, the country's main port facility. Government Belize City is operated by a mayor-council form of government. The Belize City Council is composed of 10 councillors (generally reflecting the ten constituencies of Belize City) and a mayor, all elected in municipal elections held every third year in March. After the most recent municipal elections in 2018, the mayor is Bernard Wagner of the People's United Party. The city is also home to the House of Culture, formerly the official residence of the Governor-General of Belize until 1984. The Supreme Court of Belize still sits in Belize City. Transportation Belize City will have railway lines southwestward to Spanish Lookout via Belmopan and northward to Orange Walk Town. Feasibility studies are being conducted by CRECG. =Air travel= The city is served by Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport, in Ladyville, northwest of Belize City, and by Belize City Municipal Airport, within the city itself. In popular culture The City of Belize has been featured in two movies and one TV show: The Dogs of War (1980), starring Christopher Walken, and The Mosquito Coast (1986), starring Harrison Ford, and Amazon Prime TV show Mad Dogs (2015) Sister cities * Ann Arbor, United States * Evanston, United States * Kaohsiung, Taiwan * Yeosu, South Korea * Prairie View, United States See also * Isaiah Emmanuel Morter * Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital * List of Belize-related topics * Belize City First Church of the Nazarene References =Notes= External links *History of Belize City *Online Magazine on Belize City *History of Belize City *Belize City Council *Belize City Visitor Information *Belize City Interactive map with Points of Interest Belize River Populated places in Belize District Populated coastal places in Belize Port settlements in Central America Port cities in the Caribbean Populated places established in 1638 1638 establishments in New Spain ","title":"Belize City"},{"id":"172705","text":"Ann Clare Boothe Luce (March 10, 1903Clare Boothe Luce's authorized biographer has corrected the misperception, encouraged by Luce herself, that she was born a month later: \\"I tracked down her New York birth certificate and found that she was born not on April 10, 1903 but on March 10‚Äîand not on Riverside Drive but in the less genteel environs of West 125th Street. I told her about the dates and she stared at me. 'Mother always said I was born at Easter. Anyway ... people born under the Aries sign are much more lighthearted and gay than those born under Pisces.'\\" Sylvia Jukes Morris, \\"In Search of Clare Boothe Luce\\", The New York Times Magazine, January 31, 1988 ‚Äì October 9, 1987) was an American author, politician, U.S. Ambassador and public conservative figure. She was the first American woman appointed to a major ambassadorial post abroad. A versatile author, she is best known for her 1936 hit play The Women, which had an all-female cast. Her writings extended from drama and screen scenarios to fiction, journalism and war reportage. She was the wife of Henry Luce, publisher of Time, Life, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated. Politically, Luce was a leading conservative in later life and was well known for her anti- communism. In her youth, she briefly aligned herself with the liberalism of President Franklin Roosevelt as a prot√©g√© of Bernard Baruch, but later became an outspoken critic of Roosevelt.Morris 1997, pp. 191‚Äì98. Although she was a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance in World War II, she remained outspokenly critical of British colonialism in India.Clare Boothe Luce, Address to the India League of America, August 9, 1943, Clare Boothe Luce Papers, Library of Congress (hereafter CBLP-LC). Known as a charismatic and forceful public speaker, especially after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946, she campaigned for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie to Ronald Reagan. Early life Luce was born Ann Clare Boothe in New York City on March 10, 1903, the second child of Anna Clara Schneider (also known as Ann Snyder Murphy, Ann Boothe, and Ann Clare Austin) and William Franklin Boothe (also known as \\"John J. Murphy\\" and \\"Jord Murfe\\").Morris 1997, pp. 15‚Äì32. Her parents were not married and would separate in 1912. Her father, a sophisticated man and a brilliant violinist,Morris 1997, pp. 17‚Äì18, 152‚Äì53. instilled in his daughter a love of literature, if not of music, but had trouble holding a job and spent years as a travelling salesman. Parts of young Clare's childhood were spent in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, Chicago, Illinois, and Union City, New Jersey as well as New York City.Morris 1997, pp. 29‚Äì42. Clare Boothe had an elder brother, David Franklin Boothe. Clare Boothe as a young socialite in the 1920s She attended the cathedral schools in Garden City and Tarrytown, New York, graduating first in her class in 1919 at 16. Her ambitious mother's initial plan for her was to become an actress. Clare understudied Mary Pickford on Broadway at age 10, and had her Broadway debut in Mrs. Henry B. Harris' production of \\"The Dummy\\" in 1914, a detective comedy. She then had a small part in Thomas Edison's 1915 movie, The Heart of a Waif.Morris 1997, pp. 49‚Äì52. After a tour of Europe with her mother and stepfather, Dr. Albert E. Austin, whom Ann Boothe married in 1919, she became interested in the women's suffrage movement, and she was hired by Alva Belmont to work for the National Woman's Party in Washington, D.C. and Seneca Falls, New York.Morris 1997, pp. 110‚Äì14, 120‚Äì21. Highly intelligent, ambitious, and blessed with a deceptively fragile blonde beauty, the young Clare soon abandoned ideological feminism to pursue other interests. She wed George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire heir to a New York clothing fortune, on August 10, 1923, at the age of 20. They had one daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw (1924‚Äì1944). According to Boothe, Brokaw was a hopeless alcoholic, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1929.Morris 1997, pp. 130‚Äì31, 146‚Äì48. George Brokaw remarried, to Frances Villiers Seymour. After his death in 1935, now Frances Brokaw, she remarried to actor Henry Fonda, and became the mother of Jane and Peter Fonda. On November 23, 1935, she married Henry Luce, the publisher of Time, Life, and Fortune. She thereafter called herself Clare Boothe Luce, a frequently misspelled name that was often confused with that of her exact contemporary Claire Luce, a stage and film actress. As a professional writer, Luce continued to use her maiden name. In 1939 she commissioned Frida Kahlo to paint a portrait of the late Dorthy Hale. Kahlo produced The Suicide Of Dorthy Hale, Luce was appalled and almost destroyed it. Isamu Noguchi persuaded her not to, the painting now at Phoenix Art Museum.Frida by Hayden Herrera On January 11, 1944, her only child, Ann Clare Brokaw, a 19-year-old senior at Stanford University, was killed in an automobile accident.\\"Ann Brokaw Dies in Auto Collision\\", The New York Times, January 12, 1944. Accessed August 2, 2009. As a result of the tragedy, Luce explored psychotherapy and religion. After grief counseling with Father Fulton Sheen, she was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1946.The New York Times, February 17, 1946. She became an ardent essayist and lecturer in celebration of her faith, and she was ultimately honored by being named a Dame of Malta. As a memorial to her daughter, beginning in 1949 she funded the construction of a Catholic church in Palo Alto for use by the Stanford campus ministry. The new Saint Ann Chapel was dedicated in 1951. It was sold by the diocese in 1998 and in 2003 became a church of the Anglican Province of Christ the King.\\"A Spiritual Home Finds Salvation\\" , Stanford Magazine, July/August, 2006. Accessed August 2, 2009. Ann Brokaw graduated cum laude from Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia at the age of 17 and went to Stanford University as a way to see the western United States. While at Stanford she was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Marriage to Henry Luce The marriage between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was by any standard extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination.Morris 1997, pp. 284‚Äì85, 306‚Äì08, 357‚Äì64. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally).Morris 1997, pp. 283‚Äì84, 291. Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, but the question of how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since he did not want to be accused of nepotism. It has been reported that their marriage was sexually \\"open.\\" Nasah, David 2012 Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy Penguin Clare Luce's lovers included Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, Randolph Churchill, General Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., General Charles Willoughby,Morris, Sylvia Jukes 2014 Price of Fame: The Honorable Clare Booth Luce Random House and Roald Dahl. Joseph P. Kennedy was the father of several United States politicians. Clare Luce at times provided advice to the campaigns of John F. Kennedy, who became the 35th U.S. president. Dahl, who became a very successful author after the war, was at the time a dashing young RAF fighter pilot, temporarily assigned to Washington. He was part of a plan developed by spymaster Sir William Stephenson (code name \\"Intrepid\\"), intended to weaken American isolationist thinking by influencing, among others, American journalists and politicians. Dahl was > \\". . . instructed to romance Clare, who was thirteen years his senior, to > see if, with the right kind of encouragement, she could warm to the British > position.\\" The very tall (6'6\\") and athletic Dahl later claimed he found his affair with Clare to be so physically demanding that he had begged the British ambassador to relieve him of the task, but the Ambassador told him he must continue.Jennet Conant. The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring in Wartime Washington. Simon & Schuster. New York. 2008. pp. 120-121 In the early 1960s, both Luces were friends of philosopher, author, and LSD advocate Gerald Heard. They tried LSD one time under his careful supervision. Although taking LSD never turned into a habit for either of the Luces, a friend (and biographer of Clare), Wilfred Sheed, wrote that Clare made use of it at least several times.Sheed, Wilfred 1982 Clare Boothe Luce. Berkley: New York, p. 125 The Luces stayed together until Henry's death from a heart attack in 1967. As one of the great \\"power couples\\" in American history, they were bonded by their mutual interests and complementary, if contrasting, characters. They treated each other with unfailing respect in public, never more so than when he willingly acted as his wife's consort during her years as Ambassador to Italy. She was never able to convert him to Catholicism (he was the son of a Presbyterian missionary) but he did not question the sincerity of her faith, often attended Mass with her, and defended her when she was criticized by his fellow Protestants. In the early years of her widowhood, she retired to the luxurious beach house that she and her husband had planned in Honolulu, but boredom with life in what she called \\"this fur-lined rut\\"Sylvia Jukes Morris, \\"In Search of Clare Boothe Luce\\", The New York Times Magazine, January 31, 1988. brought her back to Washington, D.C. for increasingly long periods. She made her final home there in 1983. Writing career The Women A writer with considerable powers of invention and wit, Luce published Stuffed Shirts, a promising volume of short stories, in 1931. Scribner's magazine compared the work to Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies for its bitter humor. The New York Times found it socially superficial, but praised its \\"lovely festoons of epigrams\\" and beguiling stylishness: \\"What malice there may be in these pages has a felinity that is the purest Angoran.\\"Morris 1997, pp. 188‚Äì89. The book's device of characters interlinked from story to story was borrowed from Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio (1919), but it impressed Andre Maurois, who asked Luce's permission to imitate it.Morris 1997, p. 182. Luce also published many magazine articles. Her real talent, however, was as a playwright. After the failure of her initial stage effort, the marital melodrama Abide With Me (1935), she rapidly followed up with a satirical comedy, The Women. Deploying a cast of no fewer than 40 actresses who discussed men in often scorching language, it became a Broadway smash in 1936 and, three years later, a successful Hollywood movie. Toward the end of her life, Luce claimed that for half a century, she had steadily received royalties from productions of The Women all around the world. Later in the 1930s, she wrote two more successful, but less durable plays, also both made into movies: Kiss the Boys Goodbye and Margin for Error. The latter work \\"presented an all-out attack on the Nazis' racist philosophy\\"Lyons (1989), Clare Boothe Luce, Author and Diplomat, p. 61. Its opening night in Princeton, New Jersey, on October 14, 1939, was attended by Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. Otto Preminger directed and starred in both the Broadway production and screen adaptation.Morris 1997, pp. 351‚Äì55, 368. Much of Luce's famously acid wit (\\"No good deed goes unpunished\\",The famous quip was first quoted in print by Luce's social secretary Letitia Baldrige in Roman Candle (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1956), 129: \\"When I would entreat her to engage in resolving a specific case, she replied, 'No good deed goes unpunished, Tish, remember that.'\\" Oscar Wilde, Billy Wilder, and Andrew W. Mellon have also been cited as sources, but without written evidence. \\"Widowhood is a fringe benefit of marriage\\", \\"A hospital is no place to be sick\\") can be traced back to the days when, as a wealthy young divorcee in the early 1930s, she became a caption writer at Vogue and then, associate editor and managing editor of Vanity Fair. She not only edited the works of such great humorists as P. G. Wodehouse and Corey Ford but also contributed many comic pieces of her own, signed and unsigned. Her humor, which she retained into old age, was one of the pillars of Clare's character. General Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang welcome Clare Boothe Luce, April 1942 Another branch of Luce's literary career was that of war journalism. Europe in the Spring was the result of a four-month tour of Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and France in 1939‚Äì1940 as a correspondent for Life magazine. She described the widening battleground of World War II as \\"a world where men have decided to die together because they are unable to find a way to live together.\\" In 1941, Luce and her husband toured China and reported on the status of the country and its war with Japan. Her profile of General Douglas MacArthur was on the cover of Life on December 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. After the United States entered the war, Luce toured military installations in Africa, India, China, and Burma, compiling a further series of reports for Life. She published interviews with General Harold Alexander, commander of British troops in the Middle East, Chiang Kai-shek, Jawaharlal Nehru, and General Stilwell, commander of American troops in the China-Burma-India theater. Her lifelong instinct for being in the right place at the right time and easy access to key commanders made her an influential figure on both sides of the Atlantic. She endured bombing raids and other dangers in Europe and the Far East. She did not hesitate to criticize the unwarlike lifestyle of General Sir Claude Auchinleck's Middle East Command in language that recalled the barbs of her best playwriting. One draft article for Life, noting that the general lived far from the Egyptian front in a houseboat, and mocking RAF pilots as \\"flying fairies\\", was discovered by British Customs when she passed through Trinidad in April 1942. It caused such Allied consternation that she briefly faced house arrest.Morris 1997, p. 458. Coincidentally or not, Auchinleck was fired a few months later by Winston Churchill. Her varied experiences in all the major war theaters qualified her for a seat the following year on the House Military Affairs Committee after she was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1942. Luce never wrote an autobiography but willed her enormous archive of personal papers to the Library of Congress. Political career =House of Representatives= In 1942, Luce won a Republican seat in the United States House of Representatives representing Fairfield County, Connecticut, the 4th Congressional District. She based her platform on three goals: \\"One, to win the war. Two, to prosecute that war as loyally and effectively as we can as Republicans. Three, to bring about a better world and a durable peace, with special attention to post-war security and employment here at home.\\" She took up the seat formerly held by her late stepfather, Dr. Albert Austin. An outspoken critic of Roosevelt's foreign policy, Luce was supported by isolationists and conservatives in Congress, and she was appointed early to the prestigious House Military Affairs Committee. Although she was by no means the only female representative on the floor, her beauty, wealth, and penchant for slashing witticisms caused her to be treated patronizingly by colleagues of both sexes.William Miller, Fishbait (New York, 1977), 67; Clare Boothe Luce to Pearl S. Buck, July 20, 1959, Clare Boothe Luce Papers, Library of Congress She made a sensational debut in her maiden speech, coining the phrase \\"globaloney\\" to disparage Vice President Henry Wallace's recommendation for airlines of the world to be given free access to US airports.\\"America in the Post-War Air World\\", speech by Clare Boothe Luce, Congresswoman from Connecticut, delivered in the House of Representatives, Washington D.C., February 9, 1943. Vital Speeches of the Day, 1943, 331‚Äì36. She called for repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, comparing its \\"doctrine of race theology\\" to Adolf Hitler's,Palm Beach Post, July 7, 1943. advocated aid for war victims abroad, and sided with the administration on issues such as infant-care and maternity appropriations for the wives of enlisted men. Nevertheless, Roosevelt took a dislike to her and campaigned in 1944 to attempt to prevent her re-election, publicly calling her \\"a sharp-tongued glamor girl of forty.\\"New York Sun, November 8, 1944. She retaliated by accusing Roosevelt of being \\"the only American president who ever lied us into a war because he did not have the political courage to lead us into it.\\"The New York Times, October 14, 1944. During her second term, Luce was instrumental in the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission and, during the course of two tours of Allied battlefronts in Europe, she campaigned for more support of what she considered to be America's forgotten army in Italy. She was present at the liberation of several Nazi concentration camps in April 1945, and after V-E Day, she began warning against the rise of international Communism as another form of totalitarianism, likely to lead to World War III. In 1946, she was the co-author of the Luce‚ÄìCeller Act of 1946, which permitted Indians and Filipinos permission to immigrate to the US, introducing a quota of 100 immigrants from each country, and allowed them ultimately to become naturalized citizens.Harold A. Gould, Sikhs, Swamis, Students and Spies: The India Lobby in the United States, 1900-1946, Sage Publications, 2006, pp. 393-431. =Ambassador to Italy= Clare Boothe Luce, ambassador to Italy, with husband Henry Luce (1954) Luce returned to politics during the 1952 presidential election and she campaigned on behalf of Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower, giving more than 100 speeches on his behalf. Her anti- Communist speeches on the stump, radio, and television were effective in persuading a large number of traditionally Democratic-voting Catholics to switch parties and vote Eisenhower. For her contributions Luce was rewarded with an appointment as Ambassador to Italy, a post that oversaw 1150 employees, 8 consulates, and 9 information centers. She was confirmed by the Senate in March 1953, the first American woman ever to hold such an important diplomatic post. Italians reacted skeptically at first to the arrival of a female ambassador in Rome, but Luce soon convinced those of moderate and conservative temper that she favored their civilization and religion. \\"Her admirers in Italy-and she had millions- fondly referred to her as la Signora, 'the lady'\\". The country's large Communist minority, however, regarded her as a foreign meddler in Italian affairs. She was no stranger to Pope Pius XII, who welcomed her as a friend and faithful acolyte.A popular joke of the time alleged that Luce urged Pius XII to be tougher on communism in defense of the Church, prompting the Pontiff to reply, \\"You know, Mrs. Ambassador, I am a Catholic too.\\" Over the course of several audiences since 1940, Luce had impressed Pius XII as one of the most effective secular preachers of Catholicism in America.Fr. Wilfred Thibodeau to Clare Boothe Luce, August 12, 1949, Luce Papers, Library of Congress. In 1957, Luce was awarded the Laertare Medal as an outstanding Catholic layperson. She also received honorary degrees from both Fordham and Temple universities. Her principal achievement as ambassador was to play a vital role in negotiating a peaceful solution to the Trieste Crisis of 1953‚Äì1954, a border dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia that she saw as potentially escalating into a war between East and West. Her sympathies throughout were with the Christian Democratic government of Giuseppe Pella, and she was influential on the Mediterranean policy of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, another anticommunist. Although Luce regarded the abatement of the acute phase of the crisis in December 1953 as a triumph for herself, the main work of settlement, finalized in October 1954, was undertaken by professional representatives of the five concerned powers (Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Yugoslavia) meeting in London.Osvaldo Croci, \\"The Trieste Crisis, 1953\\", Ph.D. thesis, McGill University, 1991. As ambassador, Luce consistently overestimated the possibility that the Italian left would mount a governmental coup and turn the country communist unless the democratic center was buttressed with generous American aid. Nurturing an image of her own country as a haven of social peace and prosperity, she threatened to boycott the 1955 Venice Film Festival if the American juvenile delinquent film Blackboard Jungle was shown. Around the same time, she fell seriously ill with arsenic poisoning. Sensational rumors circulated that the ambassador was the target of extermination by agents of the Soviet Union. Medical analysis eventually determined that the poisoning was caused by arsenate of lead in paint dust falling from the stucco that decorated her bedroom ceiling. The episode debilitated Luce physically and mentally, and she resigned her post in December 1956.\\"Foreign Relations: Arsenic for the Ambassador\\", Time Magazine, July 23, 1956 Upon her departure, Rome's Il Tempo concluded \\"She has given a notable example of how well a woman can discharge a political post of grave responsibility.\\" In 1957, she was awarded the Laetare Medal by the university of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics. A United States Defense Department historical study declassified in 2016 revealed that during her time as Ambassador, Boothe Luce oversaw a covert financial support program for centrist Italian governments aimed at weakening the Italian Communist Party's hold on labor unions. Great appreciator of Italian haute couture, she was a frequent visitor and client of the ateliers Gattinoni, Ferdinandi, Schuberth and Sorelle Fontana in Rome. =Ambassador to Brazil= In 1959, President Eisenhower nominated a recovered Luce to be the US Ambassador to Brazil. She began to learn enough of the Portuguese language in preparation for the job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband urged her to decline the appointment, noting that it would be difficult for her to work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador. She had served only four days, from April 28 to May 1, 1959, and she had never left American soil. =Political life after office= After Fidel Castro led a revolution in Cuba in 1959, Luce and her husband began to sponsor anticommunist groups. This support included funding Cuban exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba in the early 1960s.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 322. Fonzi, Gaeton. The Last Investigation, (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), pp. 53‚Äì54. Luce's continuing anticommunism as well as her advocacy of conservatism led her to support Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona as the Republican candidate for president in 1964. She also considered but rejected a candidacy for the United States Senate from New York on the Conservative party ticket. That same year, which also saw the political emergence of her future friend Ronald Reagan, marked the voluntary end of Henry Luce's tenure as editor-in-chief of Time. The Luces retired together, establishing a winter home in Arizona and planning a final move to Hawaii. Her husband, Henry, died in 1967 before that dream could be realized, but she went ahead with construction of a luxurious beach house in Honolulu, and, for some years, she led an active life in Hawaii high society. In 1973, President Richard Nixon named her to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). She remained on the board until President Jimmy Carter succeeded President Gerald Ford in 1977. By then, she had put down roots in Washington, D.C., that would become permanent in her last years. In 1979, she was the first woman to be awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point. President Reagan reappointed Luce to PFIAB. She served on the board until 1983. In 1986, Luce was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. =Presidential Medal of Freedom= President Reagan awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983. She was the first female member of Congress to receive this award. Upon presenting her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Reagan said this of Luce: Death Luce died of brain cancer on October 9, 1987, at age 84, at her Watergate apartment in Washington, D.C. She is buried at Mepkin Abbey, South Carolina, a plantation that she and Henry Luce had once owned and given to a community of Trappist monks. She lies in a grave adjoining those of her mother, her daughter, and her husband. Legacy =Feminism= Revered in her later years as a heroine of the feminist movement, Luce had mixed feelings about the role of women in society. As a Congresswoman in 1943, she was invited to co-sponsor a submission of the Equal Rights Amendment, offered by Representative Louis Ludlow of Indiana, but claimed that the invitation got lost in her mail.Bridgeport [CT] Herald, February 28, 1943. Luce never ceased to advise women to marry and provide supportive homes for their husbands. (During her ambassadorial years, at a dinner in Luxembourg attended by many European dignitaries, Luce was heard declaiming that all women wanted from men was \\"babies and security.\\")C. L. Sulzberger, A Long Row of Candles (Macmillan, New York, 1969), 916. Yet, her own professional career as a successful editor, writer, playwright, reporter, legislator, and diplomat remarkably showed how a woman of humble origins and no college education could raise herself to an escalating series of public heights. Luce bequeathed a large part of her personal fortune of some $50 million to an academic program, the Clare Boothe Luce Program, designed to encourage the entry of women into technological fields traditionally dominated by men. Because of her determination and unwillingness to let her gender stand in the way of her personal and professional achievements, Luce is considered to be an influential role model by many women. Starting from humble beginnings, Luce never allowed her initial poverty or her male counterparts' lack of respect to keep her from achieving as much as if not more than many of the men surrounding her. In 2017, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. =Clare Boothe Luce Program= Since 1989, the Clare Boothe Luce Program (CBLP) has become a significant source of private funding support for women in science, mathematics, and engineering. All awards must be used exclusively in the United States (not applicable for travel or study abroad). Student recipients must be U.S. citizens and faculty recipients must be citizens or permanent residents. Thus far, the program has supported more than 1,500 women. The terms of the bequest require the following criteria: # at least fifty percent of the awards go to Roman Catholic colleges, universities, and one high school (Villanova Preparatory School) # grants are made only to four-year degree- granting institutions, not directly to individuals The program is divided into three distinct categories: # undergraduate scholarships and research awards, # graduate and post-doctoral fellowships, and # term support for tenure-track appointments at the assistant or associate professorship level. =Conservatism= The Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute (CBLPI) was founded in 1993 by Michelle Easton. The non-profit think tank seeks to advance American women through conservative ideas and espouses much the same philosophy as that of Clare Boothe Luce, in terms of both foreign and domestic policy. The CBLPI sponsors a program that brings conservative speakers to college campuses such as conservative commentator, Ann Coulter. The Clare Boothe Luce Award, established in 1991 in memory of Luce, is The Heritage Foundation's highest award for distinguished contributions to the conservative movement.

Time summarized and interpreted the week's news; Life was a picture magazine of politics, culture, and society that dominated American visual perceptions in the era before television; Fortune reported on national and international business; and Sports Illustrated explored the world of sports. Counting his radio projects and newsreels, Luce created the first multimedia corporation. He envisaged that the United States would achieve world hegemony, and, in 1941, he declared the 20th century would be the \\"American Century\\".Editorial (1941-02-17) The American Century, Life Magazine Early life Luce was born in Tengchow (now Penglai), Shandong, China, on April 3, 1898, the son of Elizabeth Root Luce and Henry Winters Luce, who was a Presbyterian missionary. He received his education in various Chinese and English boarding schools, including the China Inland Mission Chefoo School. Career At 15, he was sent to the US to attend the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, where he edited the Hotchkiss Literary Monthly. There, he first met Briton Hadden, who would become a lifelong partner. At the time, Hadden served as editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, and Luce worked as an assistant managing editor. Both went on to Yale College, where Hadden served as chairman and Luce as managing editor of The Yale Daily News. Luce was also a member of Alpha Delta Phi and Skull and Bones. After being voted \\"most brilliant\\" of his class and graduating in 1920, he parted ways with Hadden to embark for a year on historical studies at Oxford University, followed by a stint as a cub reporter for the Chicago Daily News. In December 1921, Luce rejoined Hadden to work at The Baltimore News. Recalling his relationship with Hadden, Luce later said, \\"Somehow, despite the greatest differences in temperaments and even in interests, we had to work together. We were an organization. At the center of our lives -- our job, our function -- at that point everything we had belonged to each other.\\" Magazines Nightly discussions of the concept of a news magazine led Luce and Hadden, both age 23, to quit their jobs in 1922. Later that same year, they partnered with Robert Livingston Johnson and another Yale classmate to form Time Inc. Having raised $86,000 of a $100,000 goal, they published the first issue of Time on March 3, 1923. Luce served as business manager while Hadden was editor-in-chief. Luce and Hadden annually alternated year-to-year the titles of president and secretary-treasurer while Johnson served as vice president and advertising director. In 1925, Luce decided to move headquarters to Cleveland, while Hadden was on a trip to Europe. Cleveland was cheaper, and Luce‚Äôs first wife, Lila, wanted to leave New York. When Hadden returned, he was horrified and moved Time back to New York. Upon Hadden's sudden death in 1929, Luce assumed Hadden's position. Luce launched the business magazine, Fortune, in February 1930 and acquired Life in order to relaunch it as a weekly magazine of photojournalism in November 1936; he went on to launch House & Home in 1952 and Sports Illustrated in 1954. He also produced The March of Time weekly newsreel. By the mid-1960s, Time Inc. was the largest and most prestigious magazine publisher in the world. (Dwight Macdonald, a Fortune staffer during the 1930s, referred to him as \\"Il Luce\\", a play on the Italian Dictator Mussolini, who was called \\"Il Duce\\".) President Franklin D. Roosevelt, aware that most publishers were opposed to him, issued a decree in 1943 that blocked all publishers and media executives from visits to combat areas; he put General George Marshall in charge of enforcement. The main target was Luce, who had long opposed Roosevelt. Historian Alan Brinkley argued the move was \\"badly mistaken\\" and said had Luce been allowed to travel, he would have been an enthusiastic cheerleader for American forces around the globe. However, stranded in New York City, Luce's frustration and anger expressed themselves in blatant partisanship.Alan Brinkley, The Publisher: Henry Luce and his American Century (2010) pp. 302‚Äì03 Luce, supported by Editor-in-Chief T. S. Matthews, appointed Whittaker Chambers as acting Foreign News editor in 1944, despite the feuds that Chambers had with reporters in the field.Brinkley, The Publisher: Henry Luce and his American Century (2010) pp. 322‚Äì93 Luce, who remained editor-in-chief of all his publications until 1964, maintained a position as an influential member of the Republican Party.\\"Henry R. Luce: End of a Pilgrimage\\". Time. March 10, 1967 An instrumental figure behind the so-called \\"China Lobby\\", he played a large role in steering American foreign policy and popular sentiment in favor of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, in their war against the Japanese. (The Chiangs appeared in the cover of Time eleven times between 1927 and 1955.) It has been reported that Luce, during the 1960s, tried LSD and reported that he had talked to God under its influence.Maisto, Stephen A., Galizio, Mark, & Connors, Gerald J. (2008). Drug Use and Abuse: Fifth Edition. Belmont: Thomson Higher Education. Once ambitious to become Secretary of State in a Republican administration, Luce penned a famous article in Life magazine in 1941, called \\"The American Century\\", which defined the role of American foreign policy for the remainder of the 20th century (and perhaps beyond). An ardent anti-Soviet, he once demanded John Kennedy invade Cuba, later to remark to his editors that if he did not, his corporation would act like Hearst during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The publisher would advance his concepts of US dominance of the \\"American Century\\" through his periodicals with the ideals shared and guided by members of his social circle, John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State and his brother, director of the CIA, Allen Dulles. Family Luce Memorial Chapel, Tunghai University, Taiwan. Luce met his first wife, Lila Hotz, while he was studying at Yale in 1919. They married in 1923 and had two children, Peter Paul and Henry Luce III, before divorcing in 1935. In 1935 he married his second wife, Clare Boothe Luce, who had an 11-year-old daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw, whom he raised as his own. He died in Phoenix, Arizona in 1967. At his death, he was said to be worth $100 million in Time Inc. stock. Most of his fortune went to the Henry Luce Foundation, where his son Henry III served as chairman and chief executive for many years. During his life, Luce supported many philanthropies such as Save the Children Federation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and United Service to China, Inc. He is interred at Mepkin Plantation in South Carolina. He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 32¬¢ Great Americans series (1980‚Äì2000) postage stamp. Luce was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1977. Designed by I. M. Pei, the Luce Memorial Chapel, on the campus of Tunghai University, Taiwan, was constructed in memoriam of Henry Luce's father. Henry R. Luce Hall at Yale University, home to the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, was erected by the Henry R. Luce foundation in his honor.

Accessed 23 June 2015. until September 1981, when it gained full independence as Belize. British Honduras was the last continental possession of the United Kingdom in the Americas. The colony grew out of the Treaty of Versailles (1783) between Britain and Spain, which gave the British rights to cut logwood between the Hondo and Belize rivers. The Convention of London (1786) expanded this concession to include the area between the Belize and Sibun rivers. In 1862, the Settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras was declared a British colony called British Honduras, and the Crown's representative was elevated to a lieutenant governor, subordinate to the governor of Jamaica.Bolland, Nigel. \\"Belize: Historical Setting\\".

Maya emigration and conflict As the British consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century, they encountered resistance from the Maya. In the second half of the 19th century, however, a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the Maya. During the Caste War in Yucat√°n, a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855, thousands of refugees fled to the British settlement. The Legislative Assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the Maya to own land. The Maya could only rent land or live on reservations. Nevertheless, most of the refugees were small farmers, who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar, rice, corn, and vegetables in the Northern District (now Corozal and Orange Walk districts). In 1857, the town of Corozal, then six years old, had 4,500 inhabitants, second in population only to Belize Town, which had 7,000 inhabitants. Some Maya who had fled the strife in the north, but had no wish to become British subjects, settled in the remote Yalbac Hills, just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest. By 1862, about 1,000 Maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area, with the center in San Pedro. One group of Maya, led by Marcos Canul, attacked a mahogany camp on the Bravo River in 1866, demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land. A detachment of British troops sent to San Pedro was defeated by the Maya later that year. Early in 1867, more than 300 British troops marched into the Yalbac Hills and destroyed the Mayan villages, provision stores, and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district. The Maya returned, however, and in April 1870, Canul and his men marched into Corozal and occupied the town. Two years later, Canul and 150 men attacked the barracks at Orange Walk. After several hours of fighting, Canul's group retired. Canul, mortally wounded, died on 1 September 1872. That battle was the last serious attack on the colony. In the 1880s and 1890s, Mop√°n and Kekch√≠ Maya fled from forced labour in Guatemala and came to British Honduras. They settled in several villages in southern British Honduras, mainly around San Antonio in Toledo District. The Maya could use Crown lands set aside as reservations, but these people lacked communal rights. Under the policy of indirect rule, a system of elected alcaldes (mayors), adopted from Spanish local government, linked these Maya to the colonial administration. However, the remoteness of the area of British Honduras in which they settled, combined with their largely subsistence way of life, resulted in the Mop√°n and Kekch√≠ Maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the Maya of the north. The Mop√°n and Kekch√≠ Maya maintained their languages and a strong sense of identity. But in the north, the distinction between Maya and Spanish was increasingly blurred, and a Mestizo culture emerged. In different ways and to different degrees, then, the Maya who returned to British Honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities. By the end of the 19th century, the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place: Protestants largely of African descent, who spoke either English or Creole, lived in Belize Town; the Roman Catholic Maya and Mestizos spoke Spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west; and the Roman Catholic Garifuna who spoke English, Spanish, or Garifuna and settled on the southern coast. Formal establishment of the colony, 1862‚Äì1871 The forestry industry's control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy. In many parts of the Caribbean, large numbers of former slaves, some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops, became landowners. British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land. Nevertheless, land ownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. Rather than the former slaves, it was the Garifuna, Maya and Mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century British Honduras. These groups either rented land or lived as squatters. However, the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods. Landownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century. Exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870, the lowest level since the beginning of the century. Mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports, but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s. Major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class, the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of British landownership. The British Honduras Company emerged as the predominant landowner of the Crown colony. The firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a London merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company. The firm expanded, often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land. Largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, and that at a time of severe depression in the economy. Large landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony's revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce, but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite. Moreover, the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from Mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps, whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection. These conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the Legislative Assembly, which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue. Unable to agree among themselves, the members of the Legislative Assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct British rule in return for the greater security of Crown colony status. The new constitution was inaugurated in April 1871 and the Legislative Council became the new legislature. Colonial order, 1871‚Äì1931 Under the new constitution of 1871, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Council, consisting of five ex- officio or \\"official\\" and four appointed or \\"unofficial\\" members, governed British Honduras. This constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century. The change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of British companies and to the Colonial Office in London. In 1875, the British Honduras Company became the Belize Estate and Produce Company, a London-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony. The new company was the chief force in British Honduras's political economy for over a century. This concentration and centralisation of capital meant that the direction of the colony's economy was henceforth determined largely in London. It also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite. By about 1890, most commerce in British Honduras was in the hands of a clique of Scottish and German merchants, most of them newcomers. This clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered British Honduras's dependence on Britain. The European minority exercised great influence in the colony's politics, partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed Legislative Council. The manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company, for example, was automatically a member of the council, while members of the emerging Creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council. The Creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election (as had occurred in Canada and New Zealand) in the hope of winning seats, but the Legislative Council refused. In 1892, the Governor appointed several Creole members, but whites remained the majority. In 1919 demobilised Creole servicemen protested British racism, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest, which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect. In the 1920s, the Colonial Office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the Governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council's assent. But the council rejected these provisos, and the issue of restoring elections was postponed. Despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and coconuts failed. In 1894 mahogany workers rioted against a cut in their real wages caused by devaluation, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped. Creoles, who were well-connected with businesses in the United States, challenged the traditional political-economic connection with Britain as trade with the United States intensified. Men such as Robert S. Turton, the Creole chicle buyer for Wrigley's, and Henry I. Melhado, whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during prohibition, became major political and economic figures. In 1927, Creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of British landowners, (except for the manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company) on the Legislative Council. The participation of this Creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation. These changes accelerated with such force in the 1930s that they ushered in a new era of modern politics. Genesis of modern politics, 1931‚Äì1954 Destruction from the right The Great Depression shattered the colony's economy, and unemployment increased rapidly. The Colonial Report for 1931 stated that \\"contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle, which form the mainstay of the Colony, practically ceased altogether, thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work\\". On top of this economic disaster, the worst hurricane in the country's recent history demolished Belize Town on 10 September 1931, killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing. The British relief response was tardy and inadequate. The British government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the Governor with reserve powers, or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the Governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid. Meanwhile, people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses. The economy continued to decline in 1932 and 1933. The total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929. The Belize Estate and Produce Company survived the depression years because of its special connections in British Honduras and London. Since 1875 various members of the Hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company. Sir Samuel Hoare, a shareholder and former director, had been a British cabinet member and a friend of Leo Amery, the British secretary of state for the colonies. In 1931, when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression, family member Oliver V.G. Hoare contacted the Colonial Office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the United States. The British government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of US$200,000 to erect a sawmill in Belize Town. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. The government accepted some virtually worthless land in lieu of taxes and in 1935 capitulated completely, reducing the tax to its former rate and annulling the landowners' arrears by making them retroactive to 1931. But small landowners had paid their taxes, often at a higher rate. Robert Turton, the Creole millionaire who made his fortune from chicle exports, defeated C.H. Brown, the expatriate manager of the company, in the first elections for some of the Legislative Council seats in 1936. After the elections, the Governor promptly appointed Brown to the council, presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony's chief business. But Brown's defeat by Turton, one of the company's chief local business rivals, marked the decline of old British enterprises in relation to the rising Creole entrepreneurs with their United States commercial connections. Meanwhile, the Belize Estate and Produce Company drove Maya villagers from their homes in San Jose and Yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves. Investigators of labour conditions in the 1930s were appalled to discover that workers received rations of inferior flour and mess pork and tickets to be exchanged at the commissaries, in lieu of cash wages. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The law governing labour contracts, the Masters and Servants Act of 1883, made it a criminal offence for a labourer to breach a contract. The offence was punishable by twenty-eight days of imprisonment with hard labour. In 1931 the Governor, Sir John Burdon, rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a minimum wage and sickness insurance. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. The poor responded in 1934 with a series of demonstrations, strikes, petitions and riots that marked the beginning of modern politics and the independence movement. =Labour disturbances= Riots, strikes and rebellions had occurred before, during and after the period of slavery, but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals. A group calling itself the Unemployed Brigade marched through Belize Town on 14 February 1934, to present demands to the Governor and started a broad movement. Poor people, in desperation, turned to the Governor, who responded by creating a little relief work‚Äîstone-breaking for US$0.10 a day. The Governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates. The leaders of the Unemployed Brigade gave up hope of further action and resigned. The unemployed, demanding a cash dole, turned to Antonio Soberanis G√≥mez (1897‚Äì1975), who denounced the Unemployed Brigade's leaders as cowards. He said that he would continue fighting for the cause and that he was not afraid to die. In his most famous quote, he said, \\"I'd rather be a dead hero than a living coward\\". At a meeting on 16 March 1934, he took over the movement, which became the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA). For the next few weeks, Soberanis and his colleagues in the LUA attacked the Governor and his officials, the rich merchants, and the Belize Estate and Produce Company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people. The workers demanded relief and a minimum wage. They couched their demands in broad moral and political terms that began to define and develop a new nationalistic and democratic political culture. Soberanis was jailed under a new sedition law in 1935. Still, the labour agitation achieved a great deal. Of most immediate importance was the creation of relief work by a Governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances. Workers built more than 300 kilometres of roads. The Governor also pressed for a semi-representative government. But when the new constitution was passed in April 1935, it included the restrictive franchise demanded by the appointed majority of the Legislative Council, which had no interest in furthering democracy. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. Poor people, therefore, could not vote; they could only support members of the Creole middle classes that opposed big-business candidates. The Citizens' Political Party and the LUA endorsed Robert Turton and Arthur Balderamos, a Creole lawyer, who formed the chief opposition in the new council of 1936. Working-class agitation continued, and in 1939 all six seats on the Belize Town Board (the voting requirements allowed for a more representative electorate) went to middle- class Creoles who appeared more sympathetic to labour. The greatest achievements of the agitation of the 1930s were the labour reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalised in 1941, but the laws did not require employers to recognise these unions. Furthermore, the penal clauses of the old Masters and Servants Act rendered the new rights ineffectual. Employers among the unofficial members at the Legislative Council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in August 1941, but the Employers and Workers Bill passed on 27 April 1943, finally removed breach-of- labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled British Honduras's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions. The General Workers' Union (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the People's United Party (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions. The same period saw an expansion in voter eligibility. Between 1939 and 1954, less than 2 percent of the population elected six members in the Legislative Council of thirteen members. In 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000. The proportion of voters increased slightly in 1945, partly because the minimum age for women voters was reduced from thirty to twenty-one years. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. Finally, in 1954 British Honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement. This development was a prelude to the process of constitutional decolonisation. =Independence movement= The origins of the independence movement also lay in the 1930s and 1940s. Three groups played important roles in the colony's politics during this period. One group consisted of working-class individuals and emphasised labour issues. This group originated with Soberanis's LUA between 1934 and 1937 and continued through the GWU. The second group, a radical nationalist movement, emerged during World War II. Its leaders came from the LUA and the local branch of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. The group called itself variously the British Honduras Independent Labour Party, the People's Republican Party and the People's National Committee. The third group consisted of people such as the Christian Social Action Group (CSAG) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a \\"Natives First\\" campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government. In 1947 a group of graduates of the elite Catholic Saint John's College formed the CSAG and won control of the Belize City Council. One member of this group, George Cadle Price, topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a British proposal for a federation of its colonies in the Caribbean. Price was an eclectic and pragmatic politician whose ideological position was often obscured under a cloak of religious values and quotations. He remained the predominant politician in the country from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1996. The CSAG also started a newspaper, the Belize Billboard edited by Philip Goldson and Leigh Richardson. The event that precipitated Price's political career and the formation of the PUP, was the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar on 31 December 1949. In September 1949, the British government devalued the British pound sterling. In spite of repeated denials by the Governor that the British Honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the British pound, devaluation was nevertheless effected by the Governor, using his reserve powers in defiance of the Legislative Council. The Governor's action angered the nationalists because it reflected the limits of the legislature and revealed the extent of the colonial administration's power. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras's working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods‚Äîespecially food‚Äîimported from the United States. Devaluation thus united labour, nationalists and the Creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration. On the night that the Governor declared the devaluation, the People's Committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured. Before the end of January 1950, the GWU and the People's Committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation, labour legislation, the proposed West Indies Federation, and constitutional reform. The GWU was the only mass organisation of working people, so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union. In fact, the GWU president, Clifford Betson was one of the original members of the People's Committee. On 28 April 1950, the middle-class members of the People's Committee (formerly members of the CSAG) took over the leadership of the union and gave Betson the dubious honorific title of \\"patriarch of the union\\". On 29 September 1950, the People's Committee was dissolved and the People's United Party (PUP) formed in its place. =Rise of the PUP= Between 1950 and 1954, the People's United Party consolidated its organisation, established its popular base, and articulated its primary demands. Belize Billboard editors Philip Goldson and Leigh Richardson were prominent members of the PUP and gave the party their full support through anti-colonial editorials. A year later, George Price, the secretary of the PUP, became vice-president of the GWU. The political leaders took control of the union to use its strength, and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s. The PUP concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms, including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test, an all- elected Legislative Council, an Executive Council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature, the introduction of a ministerial system, and the abolition of the Governor's reserve powers. In short, PUP pushed for representative and responsible government. The colonial administration, alarmed by the growing support for the PUP, retaliated by attacking two of the party's chief public platforms. In July 1951, the Governor dissolved the Belize City Council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of King George VI. Then, in October, the Governor charged Belize Billboard publishers and owners, including Richardson and Goldson, with sedition. The Governor jailed them for twelve months with hard labour. Soon after, PUP leader John Smith resigned because the party would not agree to fly the British flag at public meetings. The removal of three of four chief leaders was a blow to the party, but the events left Price in a powerful position. In 1952 he comfortably topped the polls in Belize City Council elections. Within just two years, despite persecution and division, the PUP had become a powerful political force, and George Price had clearly become the party's leader. The colonial administration and the National Party, which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed the PUP as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of the PUP, however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The Governor and the National Party failed in their attempts to discredit the PUP on the issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of president Jacobo Arbenz. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism‚Äîa vote for the PUP was a vote in favour of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. The PUP gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda. Decolonisation and the border dispute with Guatemala 1965 map of British Honduras British Honduras faced two obstacles to independence: British reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves, and Guatemala's complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory. By 1961, the United Kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence, foreign affairs, internal security, and the terms and conditions of the public service. On 1 June 1973, the colony's name was changed to Belize in anticipation of independence. The stalemate in the protracted negotiations between the UK and Guatemala over the future status of Belize led Belizeans after 1975 to seek the international community's assistance in resolving issues associated with independence. Even after Belize became independent in 1981, however, the territorial dispute remained unsettled. The territorial dispute's origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which Great Britain acceded to Spain's assertion of sovereignty while British settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill- defined area. The 1786 Convention of London, which affirmed Spanish sovereignty was never renegotiated, but Spain never attempted to reclaim the area after 1798. At the centre of Guatemala's oldest claim was the 1859 treaty between the United Kingdom and Guatemala. From Britain's viewpoint, this treaty merely settled the boundaries of an area already under British dominion. Guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that Guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions, including the construction of a road from Guatemala to the Caribbean coast. The UK never built the road, and Guatemala said it would repudiate the treaty in 1884 but never followed up on the threat. The dispute appeared to have been forgotten until the 1930s when the government of General Jorge Ubico claimed that the treaty was invalid because the road had not been constructed. Britain argued that because neither the short-lived Central American Federation (1821‚Äì1839) nor Guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the British presence in the 19th century, British Honduras was clearly under British sovereignty. In its constitution of 1945, however, Guatemala stated that British Honduras was the twenty-third department of Guatemala. In February 1948, Guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory, and the British responded by deploying two companies from 2nd Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment. Since 1954 a succession of military and right-wing governments in Guatemala frequently whipped up nationalist sentiment, with incursions in 1957 and 1958.British Honduras . Britains- smallwars.com. Belize and Guatemala Negotiations between Britain and Guatemala began again in 1961, but the elected representatives of British Honduras had no voice in these talks. As a result, in 1965 the United States President Lyndon Johnson agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave Guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security, defence and external affairs. All parties in British Honduras, however, denounced the proposals. A series of meetings, begun in 1969, ended abruptly in 1972 when tensions flared over a possible Guatemalan invasion. Talks resumed in 1973, but broke off again in 1975 when tensions flared once more. Between 1975 and 1981, the Belizean and British governments, frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in Guatemala, began to state their case for self-determination at international forums such as a meeting of the heads of Commonwealth of Nations governments in Jamaica, the conference of ministers of the Nonaligned Movement in Peru, and at meetings of the United Nations (UN). The support of the Nonaligned Movement proved crucial and assured success at the UN. Latin American governments initially supported Guatemala, however Cuba, Mexico, Panama and Nicaragua later declared unequivocal support for an independent Belize. Finally, in November 1980, with Guatemala completely isolated, the UN passed a resolution that demanded the independence of Belize, with all its territory intact, before the next session of the UN in 1981. A last attempt was made to reach an agreement with Guatemala prior to the independence of Belize and a proposal, called the Heads of Agreement, was initialled on 11 March 1981. However, the Guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations, and the opposition in Belize engaged in violent demonstrations against it. With the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing, the opposition's morale fell and independence came to Belize on 21 September 1981, without an agreement with Guatemala. Government Before 1884 the colonial administration of British Honduras was rather haphazard. In the early days, the colonists governed themselves under a public meeting system, similar to the town meeting system used in New England. A set of regulations called \\"Burnaby's Code\\" was adopted in 1765, which continued in force until 1840, when an executive council was created. Also in 1840, the colony formally became known as British Honduras, although it was also referred to as \\"the Belize\\". In 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly, part of which was elected by a restricted franchise. The assembly was presided over by the British superintendent, an office created in 1784. From 1749 until 1884, British Honduras was governed as a dependency of the British colony of Jamaica. Upon its designation as a Crown colony in 1871, a Lieutenant Governor under the Governor of Jamaica replaced the superintendent, and a nominated legislative council replaced the legislative assembly. When the colony was finally severed from the administration of Jamaica in 1884, it gained its own Governor. In 1935 legislative franchise was reintroduced with a lower income qualification. Universal adult franchise was adopted in 1954, and a majority of seats in the legislature were made elective. A ministerial system was introduced in 1961, and the colony achieved self-government status in 1964. Economy Forestry dominated the economy of British Honduras. Initially, the focus was upon logwood, which was used in dye manufacture. Falling prices for logwood in the 1770s led to a shift toward logging mahogany, which would dominate the economy until the mid-20th century. As the logging of mahogany was far more labour-intensive, this also led to a significant increase of the importation of African slaves to the colony, mainly from Britain's Caribbean colonies. Due largely to extremely harsh working conditions, the colony experienced four slave revolts, the first in 1765 and the last in 1820. Slavery was finally abolished in 1838. Exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay, as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax policies and trade restrictions. Colonial officials provided incentives during the 1860s that resulted in a large influx of Americans from the Southern United States, especially Louisiana, during and after the American Civil War. The Confederate settlements in British Honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed. The lack of diversification in the economy left the colony very susceptible to swings in the mahogany market. The Great Depression of the 1930s and an especially destructive hurricane in 1931, further depressed the economy and already low living conditions. From 1914 on, the forestry industry was in steady decline, except for a brief revival during World War II (1939‚Äì1945). In the 1950s agriculture finally became a dominant part of economy, and in the 1970s fishing became significant. Land reform after World War II aided this expansion of the economy. Demographics By the time of the colony's 1790 census, three-quarters of the population of British Honduras were a mixed-race people known as \\"Creole people\\". They were the ancestors of the original Belizean-Creole population, who were, and still are, the biological offspring of European men and enslaved African women. The Europeans who sired the original Belizean-Creole people consisted mainly of British, Portuguese, Spanish and French men. The abolition of the slave trade in 1807, high death rates and low birth rates substantially reduced the ethnic African portion of the population. The white portion of the population remained consistently at around 10%. The largest portion of the population became the Mestizo people, now about 50% of modern Belize. The Mayans are still present in Belize and comprise around 11% of the population. The population of the colony was always fairly small. In 1790 it was around 4,000. In 1856 it was estimated to be 20,000. By 1931 this figure grew to just over 50,000, and in 1946 to just under 60,000. However, by 1970 the population doubled to just under 120,000. On the eve of independence in 1980, the population stood at over 145,000.

It is produced mainly in Fujian, China and in Pinglin District, New Taipei, Taiwan. Its name in Chinese, literally \\"the wrapped kind\\", refers to a practice of wrapping the leaves in paper during the drying process that has largely been discontinued due to advancement in tea processing. At its best, baozhong gives off a floral and melon fragrance and has a rich, mild taste. The picking season of this famous Taiwan \\"spring tea\\" () usually begins around the end of March. Before 1873, oolong tea was widely sold in Mainland China and Taiwan, but after an economic slump, some tea companies stopped selling oolong tea because of decreasing demand. At this time, tea companies moved production from Taiwan to Fuzhou and began producing baozhong tea. Baozhong tea is referred to as \\"flower tea\\" because of its fragrant smell. Health benefits Together with green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, baozhong tea has been shown to have antioxidant activity and antimutagenic properties. Tea catechins are important antioxidants and one study found baozhong tea to have over three times the amount of these compounds relative to black tea, although it was found to have less than green or oolong teas. Baozhong tea in Taiwan Farmers from Taiwan imported trees and growing techniques from Fujian during the nineteenth century. The name of baozhong tea means ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù tea and refers to the former paper package style. The most popular kinds of baozhong tea are from the Nankang and Wenshan regions. It has been produced since about 1885, but today very little is grown. Wenshan Baozhong Tea is also one of the ten most popular teas in Taiwan. Characteristics The appearance of baozhong tea is similar to a rope and is curled up. It has a deep green color with tiny grayish white spots. The oxidation is between 8 and 12%. It has a delicate fragrance similar to fresh flowers. The taste is not harsh and its sweet flavor has a moisturizing effect.The Ultimate Guide to Chinese TeaTaiwan's Tea Culture (in Chinese) References Green tea Oolong tea Taiwanese tea Chinese tea grown in Fujian ","title":"Baozhong tea"},{"id":"172716","text":"Roman caltrop at the Westphalian Museum of Archeology (German: Westf√§lisches Museum f√ºr Arch√§ologie), Herne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany A caltrop (also known as caltrap, galtrop, cheval trap, galthrap, galtrap, calthrop, jackrock or crow's footBattle of Alesia (Caesar's conquest of Gaul in 52 BC)), Battlefield Detectives program, (2006), rebroadcast: 2008-09-08 on History Channel International (13;00-14:00 hrs EDST); Note: No mention of name caltrop at all, but illustrated and given as battle key to defend Roman lines of circumvallation per recent digs evidence.) is an area denial weapon made up of two or more sharp nails or spines arranged in such a manner that one of them always points upward from a stable base (for example, a tetrahedron). Historically, caltrops were part of defences that served to slow the advance of troops, especially horses, chariots, and war elephants, and were particularly effective against the soft feet of camels. In modern times, caltrops are effective when used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires. Name The modern name \\"caltrop\\" is derived from the Latin (foot- trap), such as in the French usage . The synonymous Latin word provides part of the modern scientific name of a plant commonly called the caltrop, Tribulus terrestris, whose spiked seed case can injure feet and puncture tires. This plant can also be compared to Centaurea calcitrapa, which is also sometimes referred to as the \\"caltrop\\". A water plant with similarly-shaped spiked seeds is called the \\"water caltrop\\", Trapa natans. History A 16th-century caltrop Caltrops were known to the Romans as or sometimes as , the latter meaning \\"jagged iron\\" (literally \\"iron jagged thing\\"). They were also used in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. The late Roman writer Vegetius, referring in his work De re militari to scythed chariots, wrote: Another example of the use of caltrops was found in Jamestown, Virginia, in the United States:American Heritage. , March 1963. The Japanese version of the caltrop is called \\"makibishi\\". Makibishi were sharp spiked objects that were used in feudal Japan to slow pursuers and also were used in the defence of samurai fortifications. Iron makibishi were called \\"tetsubishi\\", while the makibishi made from the dried seed pod of the water caltrop, or water chestnut (genus Trapa), formed a natural type of makibashi called \\"tennenbishi\\". Both types of makibishi could penetrate the thin soles of shoes, such as the waraji sandals, which were commonly worn in feudal Japan.Samurai, Warfare and the State in Early Medieval Japan, Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P. 119. Similar devices Crows feet boards studded with spikes. These were laid on the ground to prevent the enemy from approaching the defences. This board was used by the Russian Army during the Battle of Balaclava. On display at Royal Engineers Museum, Kent. Exploding gunpowder caltrops from the Yuan Dynasty at the National Museum of China Tetrapods\\" (caltrop-shaped concrete structures) used as riprap along a seawall along the Marine Drive waterfront at Mumbai. Punji sticks perform a similar role to caltrops. These are sharpened sticks placed vertically in the ground. Their use in modern times targets the body and limbs of a falling victim by means of a pit or tripwire. During the Second World War, large caltrop-shaped objects made from reinforced concrete were used as anti-tank devices, although it seems that these were rare. Much more common were concrete devices called dragon's teeth, which were designed to wedge into tank treads. Large ones weighing over are still used defensively by the army to deny access to wheeled vehicles, especially in camp areas. As dragon's teeth are immobile, the analogy with the caltrop is inexact. Another caltrop- like defence during World War II was the massive steel, freestanding Czech hedgehog; the works were designed as anti-tank obstacles, and could also damage landing craft and warships that came too close to shore. These were used by the Germans to defend beaches at Normandy and other coastal areas. Tetrapods are concrete blocks shaped like caltrops, which interlock when piled up. They are used as riprap in the construction of breakwaters and other sea defences, as they have been found to let the water pass through them and interrupt natural processes less than some other defenses. Modern uses =Tyre deflation device= Caltrop used by the US Office of Strategic Services. The hollow spikes puncture self-sealing rubber tyres. The hole in the center allows air to escape even if the other end of the tube is sealed by soft ground. Researchers have tried to develop a caltrop-like device to deflate vehicle tyres in a manner useful to law enforcement agencies or the military. =World War I= During service in World War I, Australian Light Horse troops collected caltrops as keepsakes. These caltrops were either made by welding two pieces of wire together to form a four-pointed star or pouring molten steel into a mould to form a solid, seven-pointed star. The purpose of these devices was to disable horses. They were exchanged with French troops for bullets. The Australian Light Horse troops referred to them as \\"Horse Chestnuts\\". =World War II= Caltrops were used extensively and effectively during World War II. The modifications and variants produced by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of the United States are still in use today within special forces and law enforcement bodies. The Germans dropped crowsfeet. These were made from two segments of sheet metal welded together into a tetrapod with four barbed points and then painted in camouflage colours. They came in two sizes with a side length of either . They were dropped from aircraft in containers the same size as a 500 kg bomb and were dispersed by a small explosive charge. They were used to attack airfields and roads with a view to bursting tyres. =Labour activists= Caltrops have been used at times during labour strikes and other disputes. Such devices were used by some to destroy the tyres of management and replacement workers. Caltrops, referred to as \\"jack rocks\\" in news articles, were used during the Caterpillar strike of the mid-1990s, puncturing tyres on vehicles crossing the picket line in Peoria. Because of their small size and the difficulty proving their source, both the company and the United Auto Workers blamed each other. Collateral damage included a school bus and a walking mail carrier. In Illinois, the state legislature passed a law making the possession of such devices a misdemeanor. Symbolic use III Corps A caltrop has a variety of symbolic uses and is commonly found as a charge in heraldry. For instance, the Finnish noble family Fotangel (Swedish for 'caltrop') had arms gules, three caltrops argent. It has also been adopted by military units: the caltrop is the symbol of the US Army's III Corps, which is based at Fort Hood, Texas. III Corps traces its lineage to the days of horse cavalry, which used the caltrop as a defensive area denial weapon. The caltrop is also the symbol of the United States Marine Corps' 3rd Division, formed on 16 September 1942. The Savannah Association annually commemorate \\"Operation Savannah\\" a battle from 1975 to 1976 in the South African Border War also known as the Namibian War of Independence. The battle involved a covert intervention by the South African Defence Force's (SADF) during the interrelated Angolan War of Independence, subsequent Angolan Civil War and Namibian War of Independence. During this battle many South African soldiers earned the Honoris Crux for bravery against Angolan and Cuban forces. Their insignia was a caltrop.

It is published by Fortune Media Group Holdings, owned by Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon. The publication was founded by Henry Luce in 1929. The magazine competes with Forbes and Bloomberg Businessweek in the national business magazine category and distinguishes itself with long, in- depth feature articles. The magazine regularly publishes ranked lists, including the Fortune 500, a ranking of companies by revenue that it has published annually since 1955. The magazine is also known for its annual Fortune Investor's Guide. History Fortune was founded by The Atlantic Monthly Company co-founder Henry Luce in 1929 as \\"the Ideal Super-Class Magazine\\", a \\"distinguished and de luxe\\" publication \\"vividly portraying, interpreting and recording the Industrial Civilization\\".Fortune prospectus. By Henry Luce. Fortune, September 1929, Volume One, Number Zero. Briton Hadden, Luce's business partner, was not enthusiastic about the idea ‚Äì which Luce originally thought to title Power ‚Äì but Luce went forward with it after Hadden's sudden death on February 27, 1929.Henry Luce & His Time by Joseph Epstein, Commentary, Vol. 44, No. 5, November 1967. In late October 1929, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred, marking the onset of the Great Depression. In a memo to the Time Inc. board in November 1929, Luce wrote: \\"We will not be over-optimistic. We will recognize that this business slump may last as long as an entire year.\\" The publication made its official debut in February 1930. Its editor was Luce, managing editor Parker Lloyd-Smith, and art director Thomas Maitland Cleland.\\"Current Magazines\\". The New York Times. February 2, 1930. Single copies of the first issue cost US$1 ($ in ). An urban legend says that Cleland mocked up the cover of the first issue with the $1 price because no one had yet decided how much to charge; the magazine was printed before anyone realized it, and when people saw it for sale, they thought that the magazine must really have worthwhile content. In fact, there were 30,000 subscribers who had already signed up to receive that initial 184-page issue. By 1937, the number of subscribers had grown to 460,000, and the magazine had turned half million dollars in annual profit. At a time when business publications were little more than numbers and statistics printed in black and white, Fortune was an oversized 11\\"√ó14\\", using creamy heavy paper, and art on a cover printed by a special process.Background . Fortune was also noted for its photography, featuring the work of Margaret Bourke-White, Ansel Adams, and others. Walker Evans served as its photography editor from 1945 to 1965. During the Great Depression, the magazine developed a reputation for its social conscience, for Walker Evans and Margaret Bourke-White's color photographs, and for a team of writers including James Agee, Archibald MacLeish, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Alfred Kazin, hired specifically for their writing abilities. The magazine became an important leg of Luce's media empire; after the successful launch of Time in 1923 and Fortune in 1930, Luce went on to launch Life in 1936 and Sports Illustrated in 1954. From its launch in 1930 to 1978, Fortune was published monthly. In January 1978, it began publishing biweekly. In October 2009, citing declining advertising revenue and circulation, Fortune began publishing every three weeks. As of 2018, Fortune is published 14 times a year. Marshall Loeb was named managing editor in 1986. During his tenure at Fortune, Loeb was credited with expanding the traditional focus on business and the economy with added graphs, charts, and tables, as well as the addition of articles on topics such as executive life and social issues connected to the world of business, including the effectiveness of public schools and on homelessness. During the years when Time Warner owned Time Inc., Fortune articles (as well as those from Money magazine) were hosted at CNNMoney.com. In June 2014, after Time Inc. spun off from its corporate parent, Fortune launched its own website at Fortune.com. On November 26, 2017, it was announced that Meredith Corporation would acquire Time Inc. in a $2.8 billion deal. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2018. On November 9, 2018, it was announced that Meredith Corporation was selling Fortune to Thai billionaire Chatchaval Jiaravanon for $150 million. Jiaravanon is affiliated with the Thailand-based conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, which has holdings in agriculture, telecommunications, retail, pharmaceutical, and finance.

The Call Level Interface defines how a program should send SQL queries to the database management system (DBMS) and how the returned recordsets should be handled by the application in a consistent way. Developed in the early 1990s, the API was defined only for the programming languages C and COBOL. The interface is part of what The Open Group, publishes in a part of the X/Open Portability Guide, termed the Common Application Environment, which is intended to be a wide standard for programming open applications, i.e., applications from different programming teams and different vendors that can interoperate efficiently. SQL/CLI provides an international standard implementation-independent CLI to access SQL databases. Client-server tools can easily access databases through dynamic-link libraries (DLL). It supports and encourages a rich set of client-server tools. The most widespread use of the CLI standard is the basis of the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) specification, which is widely used to allow applications to transparently access database systems from different vendors. The current version of the API, ODBC 3.52, incorporates features from both the ISO and X/Open standards. Examples of languages that support Call Level Interface are ANSI C, C#, Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), Java, Pascal, and Fortran. History The work with the Call Level Interface began in a subcommittee of the US-based SQL Access Group (SAG)http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/call-level+interface In 1992, it was initially published and marketed as Microsoft's ODBC API. The CLI specification was submitted as to the ISO and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards committees in 1993. The standard has the book number and the internal document number is C451. ISO SQL/CLI is an addendum to 1992 SQL standard (SQL-92). It was completed as ISO standard ISO/IEC 9075-3:1995 Information technology‚ÄîDatabase languages‚ÄîSQL‚ÄîPart 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI). The current SQL/CLI effort is adding support for SQL3. In the fourth quarter of 1994, control over the standard was transferred to the X/Open Company, which significantly expanded and updated it. The X/Open CLI interface is a superset of the ISO SQL CLI.

It is the capital of Belize's Stann Creek District. Dangriga is served by the Dangriga Airport. Commonly known as the \\"culture capital of Belize\\" due to its influence on punta music and other forms of Garifuna culture, Dangriga is the largest settlement in southern Belize.Stann Creek Belize - Home Of Culture Capital Dangriga, Belize.com. (accessed 21 June 2015) History Dangriga was settled before 1832 by Garinagu (Black Caribs, as they were known to the British) from Honduras. For years it was the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City, but in recent years has been surpassed by San Ignacio, Belmopan and Orange Walk Town. Since the early 1980s Gar√≠funa culture has undergone a revival, as part of which the town's name of Dangriga, a Gar√≠funa word meaning \\"standing waters\\", became more widely used (but was initially adopted around 1975). Demographics The population is mostly a mixture of Garinagu, Kriols and Mestizos. According to the Statistical Institute of Belize, Dangriga's population in 2010 was 8,767 ‚Äì 4,302 males and 4,465 females. Culture Dangriga is home to the Garifuna, a cultural and ethnic group, descendants of shipwrecked slaves and native Caribs. The Garifuna have adopted the Carib language but kept their African musical and religious traditions, while holding a central place in the history of the Catholic church and Catholic education in Belize. Dangriga is also where the Caribbean music, Punta Rock, originated and where some of Belize's folk bands can be found. In November each year there is a week-long festivity leading up to Garifuna Settlement Day, attended by Garifuna people from around the region. It includes a torchlit parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the monument of the patriot and social activist Thomas Vincent Ramos, selection of Miss Garifuna, parades and special church services, and The T.V. Ramos Classic Bike Race. The 19 November is Garifuna Settlement Day.

It is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in those lipids known as glycerides. Due to having antimicrobial and antiviral properties it is widely used in FDA approved wound and burn treatments. It can also be used as an effective marker to measure liver disease. It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a humectant in pharmaceutical formulations. Owing to the presence of three hydroxyl groups, glycerol is miscible with water and is hygroscopic in nature. Structure Although achiral, glycerol is prochiral with respect to reactions of one of the two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the stereospecific numbering labels the molecule with a \\"sn-\\" prefix before the stem name of the molecule. Production Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs in triglycerides, esters of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids. The hydrolysis, saponification, or transesterification of these triglycerides produces glycerol as well as the fatty acid derivative: Triglycerides can be saponified with sodium hydroxide to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or soap. Typical plant sources include soybeans or palm. Animal-derived tallow is another source. Approximately 950,000 tons per year are produced in the United States and Europe; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced per year in the United States alone from 2000 to 2004. The EU directive 2003/30/EC set a requirement that 5.75% of petroleum fuels are to be replaced with biofuel sources across all member states by 2010. It was projected in 2006 that by the year 2020, production would be six times more than demand, creating an excess of glycerol. Glycerol from triglycerides is produced on a large scale, but the crude product is of variable quality, with a low selling price of as low as 2-5 U.S. cents per kilogram in 2011. It can be purified, but the process is expensive. Some glycerol is burned for energy, but its heat value is low. Crude glycerol from the hydrolysis of triglycerides can be purified by treatment with activated carbon to remove organic impurities, alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters, and ion exchange to remove salts. High purity glycerol (> 99.5%) is obtained by multi-step distillation; a vacuum chamber is necessary due to its high boiling point (290 ¬∞C). =Synthetic glycerol= Although usually not cost-effective, glycerol can be produced by various routes from propylene. The epichlorohydrin process is the most important: it involves the chlorination of propylene to give allyl chloride, which is oxidized with hypochlorite to dichlorohydrins, which reacts with a strong base to give epichlorohydrin. This epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol. Chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide. :600px Because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats, where glycerol is a waste product, the market for glycerol is depressed. Thus, synthetic processes are not economical. Owing to oversupply, efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors, such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin. (See the Chemical intermediate section of this article). Applications =Food industry= In food and beverages, glycerol serves as a humectant, solvent, and sweetener, and may help preserve foods. It is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods (e.g., cookies), and as a thickening agent in liqueurs. Glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves. As a sugar substitute, it has approximately 27 kilocalories per teaspoon (sugar has 20) and is 60% as sweet as sucrose. It does not feed the bacteria that form plaques and cause dental cavities. As a food additive, glycerol is labeled as E number E422. It is added to icing (frosting) to prevent it from setting too hard. As used in foods, glycerol is categorized by the U.S. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a carbohydrate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric macronutrients excluding protein and fat. Glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar, but a lower glycemic index and different metabolic pathway within the body, so some dietary advocates accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with low-carbohydrate diets. It is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as erythritol and xylitol which have a cooling effect, due to its heating effect in the mouth, if the cooling effect is not wanted. =Medical, pharmaceutical and personal care applications= A bottle of glycerin purchased at a pharmacy Personal lubricants commonly contain glycerol Glycerol is an ingredient in products such as hair gel Glycerol suppositories used as laxatives Glycerin is mildly antimicrobial and antiviral and is an FDA approved treatment for wounds. The Red Cross reports that an 85% solution of glycerin shows bactericidal and antiviral effects, and wounds treated with glycerin show reduced inflammation after roughly 2 hours. Due to this it is used widely in wound care products, including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care. It is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns, and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts. There is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns, and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin. Glycerol is used in medical, pharmaceutical and personal care preparations, often as a means of improving smoothness, providing lubrication, and as a humectant. Ichthyosis and xerosis have been relieved by the topical use of glycerin. It is found in allergen immunotherapies, cough syrups, elixirs and expectorants, toothpaste, mouthwashes, skin care products, shaving cream, hair care products, soaps, and water-based personal lubricants. In solid dosage forms like tablets, glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent. For human consumption, glycerol is classified by the U.S. FDA among the sugar alcohols as a caloric macronutrient. Glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing. Glycerol is a component of glycerin soap. Essential oils are added for fragrance. This kind of soap is used by people with sensitive, easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizing properties. It draws moisture up through skin layers and slows or prevents excessive drying and evaporation. Taken rectally, glycerol functions as a laxative by irritating the anal mucosa and inducing a hyperosmotic effect, expanding the colon by drawing water into it to induce peristalsis resulting in evacuation. It may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume (2‚Äì10 ml) enema. Alternatively, it may be administered in a dilute solution, e.g., 5%, as a high volume enema. Taken orally (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste), glycerol can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in the internal pressure of the eye. This can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure. Glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting. The glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein, carbohydrate, or glycoprotein molecules. =Botanical extracts= When utilized in \\"tincture\\" method extractions, specifically as a 10% solution, glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants (tinctures). It is also used as an \\"alcohol-free\\" alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions. It is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology. Alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties. Such products are not \\"alcohol-free\\" in a scientific or FDA regulatory sense, as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups. Fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites.Does alcohol belong in herbal tinctures? newhope.com When used as a primary \\"true\\" alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies, glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds, with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water‚Äìalcohol solutions.https://www.aciscience.org/docs/Glycerine_-_an_overview.pdf That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic (i.e. critical) methodologies as opposed to standard passive \\"tincturing\\" methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert like alcohols (i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc.) do. Glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or mitigates reduction-oxidation (REDOX) of a finished extract's constituents, even over several years. Both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents. Glycerol is bacteriostatic in its action, and ethanol is bactericidal in its action.Lawrie, James W.

The Technical Press, LTD., London, UK. =Electronic cigarette liquid= Glycerin is often used in electronic cigarettes to create the vapor Glycerin, along with propylene glycol, is a common component of e-liquid, a solution used with electronic vaporizers (electronic cigarettes). This glycerol is heated with an atomizer (a heating coil often made of Kanthal wire), producing the aerosol that delivers nicotine to the user. =Antifreeze= Like ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, glycerol is a non-ionic kosmotrope that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonds. This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70% glycerol in water. Glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol, which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.Proposed ASTM Engine Coolant Standards Focus on Glycerin. Astmnewsroom.org. Retrieved on 15 August 2012. In the laboratory, glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzymatic reagents stored at temperatures below 0 ¬∞C due to the depression of the freezing temperature. It is also used as a cryoprotectant where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and mammalian embryos. =Chemical intermediate= Glycerol is used to produce nitroglycerin, which is an essential ingredient of various explosives such as dynamite, gelignite, and propellants like cordite. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol made it difficult to increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities in the days leading up to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve angina pectoris, taken in the form of sub-lingual tablets, or as an aerosol spray. An oxidation of glycerol affords mesoxalic acid. Dehydrating glycerol affords hydroxyacetone. =Vibration damping= Glycerol is used as fill for pressure gauges to damp vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce harmonic vibrations within Bourdon gauges that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance by S. R. Majumdar -- McGraw-Hill 2006 Page 74 =Niche uses= Film industry Glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly.Chemicals in Film. reagent.co.uk Glycerine is used‚Äîcombined with water (around in a 1:99 proportion)‚Äîto create a smooth smoky environment. The solution is vaporized and pushed into the room with a ventilator. Ultrasonic couplant Glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for water in ultrasonic testing, as it has favourably higher acoustic impedance (2.42MRayl vs 1.483MRayl for water) while being relatively safe, non-toxic, non-corrosive and relatively low cost.Acoustic Properties for Liquids. nde- ed.org =Internal combustion fuel= Glycerol is also used to power diesel generators supplying electricity for the FIA Formula E series of electric race cars.Formula E uses pollution-free glycerine to charge cars. fiaformulae.com. 13 September 2014 =Research on uses= Research has been conducted to produce value-added products from glycerol obtained from biodiesel production. Examples (aside from combustion of waste glycerol): *Hydrogen gas production *Glycerine acetate is a potential fuel additive. *Glycerol is one of the most used additive for starch thermoplastic. *Conversion to propylene glycol *Conversion to acrolein *Conversion to ethanol *Conversion to epichlorohydrin, a raw material for epoxy resins Metabolism Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids in the liver and adipose tissue. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. Glycerol is mainly metabolized in the liver. Glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage, as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health. Glycerol metabolization is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease.Glycerol clearance in alcoholic liver disease. Gut (British Society of Gastroenterology). 1982 Apr; 23(4): 257‚Äì264.

Jeffrey D. Browning, Eunsook S. Jin1, Rebecca E. Murphy, and Craig R. Malloy Blood glycerol levels are highly elevated during diabetes, and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls. Direct glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long- term reduction in sperm count. Further testing on this subject was abandoned due to the unexpected results, as this was not the goal of the experiment.Molecular Human Reproduction, Volume 23, Issue 11, November 2017, Pages 725‚Äì737 Circulating glycerol does not glycate proteins as do glucose or fructose, and does not lead to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). In some organisms, the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and, thus, provide energy for cellular metabolism (or, potentially, be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis). Before glycerol can enter the pathway of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis (depending on physiological conditions), it must be converted to their intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the following steps: The enzyme glycerol kinase is present mainly in the liver and kidneys, but also in other body tissues, including muscle and brain. In adipose tissue, glycerol 3-phosphate is obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glycerol has very low toxicity when ingested; its LD50 oral dose for rats is 12600 mg/kg and 8700 mg/kg for mice. It does not appear to cause toxicity when inhaled, although changes in cell maturity occurred in small sections of lung in animals under the highest dose measured. A sub-chronic 90-day nose-only inhalation study in Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats exposed to 0.03, 0.16 and 0.66 mg/L glycerin (Per liter of air) for 6-hour continuous sessions revealed no treatment-related toxicity other than minimal metaplasia of the epithelium lining at the base of the epiglottis in rats exposed to 0.66 mg/L glycerin. Historical cases of contamination with diethylene glycol On 4 May 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration advised all US makers of medicines to test all batches of glycerol for the toxic diethylene glycol. This followed an occurrence of hundreds of fatal poisonings in Panama resulting from a falsified import customs declaration by Panamanian import/export firm Aduanas Javier de Gracia Express, S. A. The cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol.

The term de facto standard is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as \\"de jure standards\\"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one standard available for the same use. In social sciences, a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard is a typical solution to a coordination problem. The choice of a de facto standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced \\"de jure standard\\" is a solution to the prisoner's problem.  Examples  A selection of well-known and illustrative examples of de facto and de jure standards are: * with consolidation by tradition of use: ** The driver's seat side in a given country starts as a user/industry preference, turning to a local tradition, then a traffic code local norm. ** The QWERTY system was one of several options for the layout of letters on typewriter (and later keyboard) keys. It was developed to prevent adjacent keys from jamming on early and later mechanical typewriters, often attributed to the typist's speed.QWERTY It became a de facto standard because it was used on the most commercially successful early typewriters and is now used on devices which have no moving parts such as touchscreens. ** The MP3 audio format started as an alternative to WAV for Internet music distribution, then replaced it ‚Äî it is now supported by the vast majority of music players, audio transport, audio storage and noncommercial media. WAV and MP3 are also \\"de jure ISO formats\\". * with consolidation by uniqueness and efficiency: ** HTML (computer file format) started as \\"de facto\\" (1993-1995) and became the \\"de jure\\" standard (1995‚Äìpresent day). ** PDF (computer file format) was first created in 1993 by Adobe. Adobe internal standards were part of its software quality systems, but they were neither published nor coordinated by a standards body. With the Acrobat Reader program available for free, and continued support of the format, PDF eventually became the de facto standard for printable documents. In 2005, PDF/A became a de jure standard as ISO 19005-1:2005. In 2008 Adobe's PDF 1.7 became ISO 32000-1:2008. Examples of long-time de facto but never de jure standards (for computer file formats): * AutoCAD DXF: a de facto ASCII format for import and export of CAD drawings and fragments in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, XML based standards emerged as de facto standards. * Microsoft Word DOC (over all other old PC word processors): one of the best known de facto standards. Due to the market dominance of Word, it is supported by all office applications that intend to compete with it, typically by reverse engineering the undocumented file format. Microsoft has repeatedly internally changed the file specification between versions of Word to suit their own needs, while continuing to reuse the same file extension identifier for different versions. * FITS and CSV file formats, commonly used in science and engineering, with FITS traditionally used in astronomy. * TeX typesetting system, commonly used in creating scientific articles and reports for publication (in fact many journals require the publication to be fully written in TeX). Other examples: * Most American-made spark plugs require a -inch hex socket (21mm) to remove or install. * The spacing of the rollers in a bicycle chain. * The IBM Personal Computer (PC). By one year after its 1981 release, John Dvorak described the PC as rapidly becoming a \\"de facto standard microcomputer\\". With the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems, it gained a large share of the personal computer market. Because of the great influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market, competing products like the Rainbow 100 were eventually withdrawn. * Interpreted programming languages such as PHP that have multiple implementations tend to also have a de facto standard.

Punta Gorda is the southernmost sizable town in the nation, with a population of about 5,000 people. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly Kriol/English-speaking, and are primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, Kriol, and Maya descent. Punta Gorda is a seaport and fishing town on the Caribbean Sea. It was a small fishing village before it was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from Honduras in 1823. The Garifuna refer to the town as Peini. The town is about fifteen feet above sea level.  Climate  The climate is tropical rainforest (K√∂ppen: Af), similar to that found in the Amazon Basin, with precipitation being high and with temperatures always above 25 ¬∞C on average every month. Transport Punta Gorda is the main point of transportation for people visiting the Toledo district and the offshore southern cayes. There is a small airport which serves domestic flights from Maya Island Air and Tropic Air. James Bus Line is based in Punta Gorda and offers a regular service to points north such as Independence, Dangriga, Belmopan, and Belize City. Water taxis offer daily crossings to Puerto Barrios and twice weekly service to Livingston in Guatemala. Unlike the purpose-built water taxis plying the routes between Belize city and the northern cays, the services from Punta Gorda are provided by small, open boats. Punta Gorda will have railway lines to Dangriga and Belize City that are currently in the feasibility study being conducted by CRECG. Tourism There are several hotels in Punta Gorda that draw tourists with their ocean views. Punta Gorda is also a gateway to several well-regarded jungle accommodations, including Cotton Tree Lodge, The Lodge at Big Falls, Copal Tree Lodge, and Hickatee Cottages. Every May the town hosts the Toledo Cacao Festival, held over the Commonwealth Day holiday weekend, which celebrates Toledo district's ancient and modern-day links with cacao and chocolate. Notable people Notable people from Punta Gorda include paranda musician Paul Nabor and Belize's \\"Queen of Brukdown\\", Leela Vernon.

In 1990, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis\\", specifically retrosynthetic analysis.E. J. Corey, X-M. Cheng, The Logic of Chemical Synthesis, Wiley, New York, 1995, . Regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists, he has developed numerous synthetic reagents, methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably. Biography E.J. Corey (the surname was anglicized from the Lebanese Arabic Khoury, meaning priest) was born to Christian Lebanese immigrants in Methuen, Massachusetts, north of Boston.Elias James Corey ‚Äì Autobiography . nobelprize.org His mother changed his name to \\"Elias\\" to honor his father, who died eighteen months after Corey's birth. His widowed mother, brother, two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house, struggling through the Great Depression. As a young boy, Corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball, football, and hiking. He attended a Catholic elementary school and Lawrence High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts. At the age of 16 Corey entered MIT, where he earned both a bachelor's degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. under Professor John C. Sheehan in 1951. Upon entering MIT, Corey's only experience with science was in mathematics, and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering. After his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Immediately thereafter, at the invitation of Professor John C. Sheehan, Corey remained at MIT for his Ph.D. After his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27. He was initiated as a member of the Zeta chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at the University of Illinois in 1952.Fraternity ‚Äì Awards ‚Äì Hall of Fame ‚Äì Alpha Chi Sigma In 1959, he moved to Harvard University, where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active Corey Group research program. He chose to work in organic chemistry because of \\"its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health\\". He has also been an advisor to Pfizer for more than 50 years. Among numerous honors, Corey was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1988,National Science Foundation ‚Äì The President's National Medal of Science the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1990, and the American Chemical Society's greatest honor, the Priestley Medal, in 2004. Major contributions =Reagents= E.J. Corey has developed several new synthetic reagents: *PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate), also referred to as the Corey-Suggs reagent, is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes. PCC has several advantages over other commercial oxidants. center One of these advantages is that the compound is available as an air-stable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic. Unlike other oxidizing agents, PCC can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents (scheme 1). The alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium(VI) metal displacing chlorine. The chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium(IV). The slightly acidic character of PCC makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes (Scheme 2). reactivity of PCC under acidic conditions The initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde, which can then undergo a Prins reaction with the neighboring alkene. After elimination and further oxidation, the product is a cyclic ketone. If this product is undesired, powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation. The robustness of PCC as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis (Scheme 3). This example illustrates that PCC is capable of performing a Dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. [3,3] rearrangement with PCC *t-Butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS), triisopropylsilyl ether (TIPS), and methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM): are popular alcohol protecting groups. The development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations. Although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them. Since 1972 the TBS group has become the most popular silicon protecting group. TBS is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions. More importantly, TBS ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents and enolates.Kocienski, P.J. Protecting Groups; Georg Thieme Verlag: Germany, 2000 center In the field of complex molecule synthesis, TBS has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups (scheme 4). The use of CSA provides selective removal of a primary TBS ether in the presence of tertiary TBS ether and TIPS ethers. Other means of TBS deprotection include acids (also Lewis acids), and fluorides. TIPS protecting groups were also pioneered by Corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection. TIPS ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions, the disadvantage of this protecting group over TBS ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection. The most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as TBS ether, but longer reaction times are generally needed. center Usually TBS ethers are severed by TBAF, but the hindered TBS ether above survives the reaction conditions upon primary TIPS removal (scheme 5). The MEM protecting group was first described by Corey in 1976. This protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions. Cleavage of MEM protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions, but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage (scheme 6). center *1,3-Dithianes were pioneered by E.J. Corey in 1965 as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions. The formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced Umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity. The formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a Lewis acid (scheme 7) or directly from carbonyl compounds. center The pKa of dithianes is approximately 30, allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent, typically n-butyllithium. The reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the Corey-Seebach reaction. The dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles. After deprotection of the dithiane, usually with HgO, a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion. The utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use Umpolung disconnections in total synthesis (scheme 8). 1,3-dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group. center *In addition, Corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes. Corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene. =Methodology= Several reactions developed in Corey's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry. At least 302 methods have been developed in the Corey group since 1950.See the Methods tab Several reactions have been named after him: * Corey-Itsuno reduction, also known as the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, is an enantioselective reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant. The Corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols. The reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the CBS catalyst (scheme 9).Kurti, L.; Czako, B. Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis; Elsevier: Burlington, 2005.Corey, E.J.; Kurti, L. Enantioselective Chemical Synthesis; Direct Book Publishing: Dallas, 2010 600px Later, Corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable. The reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at [nitrogen], coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complex(scheme 10). Lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its Lewis acidity, allowing coordination with the ketone substrate. The complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the B-O bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group. 400px Migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state, leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst. The reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists (scheme 11). The synthesis of dysidiolide by Corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective CBS reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex. center * Corey-Fuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide.Corey, E.J.; Fuch, P.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1972, 3769 The mechanism is similar to that of the Wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide. Reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin.Eymery et al Synthesis 2000, 185 center On treatment with two equivalents of n-buLi, lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product (scheme 12). More recently, a one-pot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed. This synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis (+)-taylorione by W.J. Kerr and co-workers (scheme 13). center * The Corey‚ÄìKim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones. This process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of N-chlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride (NCS), dimethylsulfide (DMS), and triethylamine (TEA). The Corey-Kim reagent is formed in situ when NCS and DMS are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species (scheme 14). center The alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product. The reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups, but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides. Its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility. In the total synthesis of ingenol, Kuwajima and co-workers exploited the Corey-Kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol(scheme 15). center * Corey-Winter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of 1,2-diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate, thiocarbonyldiimidazole, and excess trialkylphosphite. The mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Specifically, the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate. Nonetheless, the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure. The formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in 7-membered rings was attempted by Corey and coworkers, but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain. More importantly, stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates. Professor T.K.M Shing et al used the Corey-Winter olefination reaction to synthesize (+)-Boesenoxide (scheme 16). total synthesis example of corey winter olefination * CBS enantioselective Diels-Alder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective CBS reduction. After the development of this reaction the CBS reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations. The use of a chiral Lewis acid such as the CBS catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates. The reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized 6-membered ring pre-transition state to deliver highly enantio-enriched products (scheme 17). enantioslective diels-alder transition state This transition state likely occurs because of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl substituent. The enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent. The Diels- Alder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings(scheme 18). enantioslective diels-alder in total synthesis * Corey- Nicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones. Previously, intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations. One big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and base-labile functional groups. To date rings of 7 to 48 members have been successfully synthesized using this method. mechanism of Corey-Nicolaou macrolactonization The reaction occurs in the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene. The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone (scheme 20). macrolactonization total synthesis example * Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes. The reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones, ketones, aldehydes, and imines to form corresponding epoxides, cyclopropanes, and aziridines. Two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products (scheme 21).The dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones, but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed. Dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides. Dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, so it is generated at low temperatures. corey- chaykovsky selectivity Based on their reactivity, another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure. corey-chaykovsky total synthesis example =Total syntheses= E. J. Corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses. At least 265 compounds have been synthesized in the Corey group since 1950.See the Syntheses tab His 1969 total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics.K. C. Nicolaou, E. J. Sorensen, Classics in Total Synthesis, VCH, New York, 1996, .For a review see Axen, U.; Pike, J. E.; and Schneider, W. P. (1973) p. 81 in The Total Synthesis of Natural Products, Vol. 1, ApSimon, J. W. (ed.) Wiley, New York. Specifically the synthesis of Prostaglandin F2Œ± presents several challenges. The presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists. Corey's retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors (scheme 23). center Molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a Wittig reaction and Horner- Wadsworth Emmons modification. The Wittig reaction affords the cis product, while the Horner-Wadsworth Emmons produces the trans olefin. The published synthesis reveals a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride. However, years later Corey and co-workers established the CBS reduction. One of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer (scheme 24). center The iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins. Other notable syntheses: * Longifolene * Ginkgolides A and B * Lactacystin * Miroestrol * Ecteinascidin 743 * Salinosporamide A =Publications= E.J.

Altom suicide Jason Altom, one of Corey's students, committed suicide in 1998. Altom's suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed Corey, his research advisor, for his suicide. Altom cited in his 1998 farewell note \\"abusive research supervisors\\" as one reason for taking his life. Altom's suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors. While Altom was the second suicide in as many years in Corey's lab, Corey was devestated and bewildered by his student's death.English, Bella. , The Boston Globe via Archive.org (2001-01-02). Corey said, \\"That letter doesn't make sense. At the end, Jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme.\\" Corey also claimed he never questioned Altom's intellectual contributions. \\"I did my best to guide Jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain. I did my best every step of the way,\\" Corey states. \\"My conscience is clear. Everything Jason did came out of our partnership. We never had the slightest disagreement.\\" The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) cited The New York Times article on Altom's suicide as an example of problematic reporting, arguing that Altom presented warning signs of depression and suicidal ideation and that the article had scapegoated Corey despite a lack of secondary evidence that the advisor's behavior had contributed to Altom's distress. The AFSP incorrectly identifies the author and date of The New York Times article as Keith B. Richburg and November 28, 1998. The author was Stephen S. Hall and the date of publication was November 29, 1998. According to The Boston Globe reporting, students and professors said Altom actually retained Corey's support. As a result of Altom's death, the Department of Chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis. Corey Group members As of 2010, approximately 700 people have been Corey Group members. A database of 580 former members and their current affiliation was developed for Corey's 80th birthday in July, 2008.See the Members' Data tab Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules When awarded the Priestley Medal in 2004, E. J. Corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired Robert Burns Woodward prior to the development of the Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules. Corey wrote: \\"On May 4, 1964, I suggested to my colleague R. B. Woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed (HOMO) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene ‚Üí 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene ‚Üí cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules.\\"See the E. J. Corey, Impossible Dreams tab This was Corey's first public statement on his claim that starting on May 5, 1964 Woodward put forth Corey's explanation as his own thought with no mention of Corey and the conversation of May 4. Corey had discussed his claim privately with Hoffmann and close colleagues since 1964. Corey mentions that he made the Priestley statement \\"so the historical record would be correct\\". Corey's claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by Roald Hoffmann in the journal Angewandte Chemie. In the rebuttal, Hoffmann states that he asked Corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why Corey did not make the issue public. Corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt Harvard and that he would not \\"consider doing anything against Harvard, to which I was and am so devoted.\\" Corey also hoped that Woodward himself would correct the historical record \\"as he grew older, more considerate, and more sensitive to his own conscience.\\" Woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in 1979. Awards and honors E.J. Corey has received more than 40 major awards including the Linus Pauling Award (1973), Franklin Medal (1978), Tetrahedron Prize (1983), Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1986), National Medal of Science (1988), Japan Prize (1989), Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1990), Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1991), Roger Adams Award (1993), and the Priestley Medal (2004).See the E.J.

It may stand up to at the withers. It has a heavy coat and short legs, is strong for its size, and is used for riding, driving, and pack purposes.  History  Two women of the Shetland Isles with ponies: photograph taken about 1900 Shetland ponies originated in the Shetland Isles, located northeast of mainland Scotland. Small horses have been kept in the Shetland Isles since the Bronze Age. People who lived on the islands probably later crossed the native stock with ponies imported by Norse settlers. Shetland ponies also were probably influenced by the Celtic pony, brought to the islands by settlers between 2000 and 1000 BCE. The harsh climate and scarce food developed the ponies into extremely hardy animals. Shetland ponies were first used for pulling carts and for carrying peat, coal and other items, and ploughing land. Then, as the Industrial Revolution increased the need for coal in the mid-nineteenth century, thousands of Shetland ponies travelled to mainland Britain to be pit ponies, working underground hauling coal, often for their entire (often short) lives. Coal mines in the eastern United States also imported some of these animals. The last pony mine in the United States closed in 1971.The Last Pony Mine, a documentary film, Les Benedict, director, Steve Knudston, producer, 1972. Available on Youtube in 3 parts part 1part 2part 3 The Shetland Pony Stud-Book Society is the breed society for the traditional Shetland throughout the world. It was started in 1890 to maintain purity and encourage high-quality animals. In 1957, the Shetland Islands Premium Stallion Scheme was formed to subsidise high-quality registered stallions to improve the breeding stock. In the United States, ponies may also be registered with the American Shetland Pony Club and the Shetland Pony Society of North America. A number of pony breeds derive from the traditional Shetland. These include the American Shetland Pony and Pony of the Americas in the United States, and the Deutsches Classic Pony in Germany.

The Shetland Pony is hardy and strong, in part because it developed in the harsh conditions of the Shetland Isles. It has a small head, widely spaced eyes and small and alert ears. It has a short muscular neck, a compact stocky body, short strong legs and a shorter-than-normal cannon-bone in relation to its size. A short broad back and deep girth are universal characteristics, as is a springy stride. It has a long thick mane and tail, and a dense double winter coat to withstand harsh weather. It may be of any known horse coat colour other than spotted. It is not unusual for a Shetland pony to live more than 30 years. Uses A Shetland pony in harness. Shetland pony \\"Grand National\\" in the UK Today, Shetlands are ridden by children and are shown by both children and adults at horse shows in harness driving classes as well as for pleasure driving outside of the show ring. Shetlands are ridden by small children at horse shows, in riding schools and stables as well as for pleasure. They are seen working in commercial settings such as fairs or carnivals to provide short rides for visitors. They are also seen at petting zoos and sometimes are used for therapeutic horseback riding purposes. In the United Kingdom, Shetlands are also featured in the Shetland Pony Grand National, galloping around a racecourse with young jockeys. Junior Harness Racing was founded in Queensland by a group of breeders to give young people aged 6‚Äì16 an opportunity to obtain a practical introduction to the harness racing industry. The children have the opportunity to drive Shetland ponies in harness under race conditions. No prize money is payable on pony races, although winners and place-getters receive medallions. Miniature Shetlands have been trained as guide horses to take the same role as guide dogs. This task is also performed by other miniature horse breeds.

It was later ported to other platforms, and spawned a series of follow up titles. The game was produced by Stainless Games and published by Interplay Productions and Sales Curve Interactive. In 2011, Stainless Games obtained the rights to Carmageddon from former company Square Enix Europe. In June 2012, it was announced that a new port of the game would be released for iOS and certain Android mobile devices. The game was released as both a free demo and paid game in 2013. In December 2018, THQ Nordic acquired the rights to the Carmageddon series from Stainless Games. Gameplay Die Anna drives through the Coastal Carnage level In Carmageddon, the player races a vehicle against a number of other computer controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars, or by running over pedestrians. Unusually for a racing game, checkpoints do not extend the time limit. Races are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \\"wasting\\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty six race tracks, played across eleven different locations. The game featured three songs (in instrumental format) from Fear Factory's album of 1995, Demanufacture. The title track and \\"Body Hammer\\" are both included with the song \\"Zero Signal\\" being used in the game's intro. Development The game that became Carmageddon started out as \\"3D Destruction Derby\\", a banger racing sim prototyped by Stainless Software. This was signed by SCi in 1995, but under the condition that it be made into a licensed game in order to guarantee popularity. Initially, SCi wanted to use the Mad Max license, but they were unable to find out who owned the rights to the franchise. They instead secured the Death Race 2000 license, as a sequel to the original film was at that time planned. According to head programmer Patrick Buckland, the initial concept stemmed from the team getting bored while playing racing games, leading them to ultimately drive in the wrong direction and crash into other cars. They decided it made sense to create a game where this was the objective to begin with. Shortly after, Psygnosis released a game with this same concept, Destruction Derby. The notion of running over pedestrians was added in an effort to distinguish the game from Destruction Derby and arouse controversy. However, there had been a number of recent games which involved running over pedestrians, such as Quarantine and Die Hard Trilogy. Rob Henderson from SCi suggested that they could increase the potential for controversy by rewarding the player points for the pedestrian kills. The sequel to Death Race 2000 was later cancelled, but by this point SCi were impressed enough by Stainless's work on the game that they felt they could try creating their own IP. The name Carmageddon was coined, and development proceeded with the designers allowed unusually free rein with regard to the content of the game. The game uses the BRender engine, which Stainless Software were already thoroughly familiar with; one of their previous contracts was to port BRender to Macintosh and build the corresponding tools and demos. The PlayStation conversion was subcontracted to developer Elite, with the plan to release the PC and PlayStation versions simultaneously. Buckland anticipated that Elite would have problems with the conversion due to Carmageddons open environments. Release Carmageddon was originally released for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS in 1997. It won the \\"Game of the Year\\" trophy in the 1997 PC Zone reader awards and \\"Driving Game of the Year\\" 1997. An expansion pack, Splat Pack, was released in 1997. It included new tracks, vehicles, environments, network levels and 3Dfx support. The Carmageddon Max Pack, released on February 17, 1998, bundled the original game and its expansion pack into one package. As a bonus, it also included a strategy guide, mousepad, and a leather car key chain with Carmageddon's logo on it. The Max Pack was nominated for the 1998 Computer Action Game of the Year D.I.C.E. Award A port was in development for the Gizmondo, but was never released due to the system's demise. Carmageddon and its expansion Splat Pack were released on GOG.com on 27 September 2012 for modern operating systems, likely in conjunction with the 29‚Äì30 September closure of Interstate 405. In addition, a port of the game for Apple's mobile devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad) was released on 17 October 2012. A port for Android based devices was released on 10 May 2013. As of August 2019, Carmageddon is no longer available to download on the iOS App Store in the United Kingdom. =Controversy= In many countries (including Germany and, for a short time, the United Kingdom), the first release of the game was censored. They contained zombies with green blood or robots with black oil instead of people, as running over the non human figures was considered more acceptable by their respective ratings boards. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC refused to certify the game unless all blood and gore was removed. After ten months of appeal, the BBFC certified the original version. In some countries, the game was banned completely, including Brazil. In Australia, the game was passed completely uncut with a MA15+ rating. Reception and sales According to the co founders of Stainless Games, the Carmageddon series sold around two million copies in total. NPD Techworld, a firm that tracked sales in the United States, reported 118,500 units sold of Carmageddons computer version by December 2002. GameSpot was enamoured of the open ended, chaotic nature of the game, commenting that \\"Carmageddon touches that particular collective nerve that fuses the wholesome popularity of the All American Racing Game, with the homicidal singularity of the 70s cult film into an onscreen experience, that can only be compared to the kind of automotive mayhem that a five year old American male wreaks, with his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars.\\" Next Generation stated that \\"if you're willing to sweep your morals under the rug for a while, and shamelessly commit auto homicide on a grand scale, then Carmageddon is an absolute blast.\\" GamePro gave a more mixed review, commenting that the game is intense and high on longevity, but that its focus on wanton destruction and gore is in questionable taste and ultimately to the detriment of the gameplay. They also found the graphics mediocre and the controls when using a keyboard to be \\"frustrating and sluggish.\\" Legacy The game was successful enough to become a series. The other games in the main series are: * Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now (1998) * Carmageddon TDR 2000 (2000) * Carmageddon: Reincarnation (2015) * Carmageddon: Max Damage (2016) SCi had originally planned Carmageddon 4 for a release in the end of 2005. Little to no information was released about the game, then SCi (at the time owned by Eidos) put development on hold for unspecified reasons. SCi and Eidos went on to focus on other projects, while Square Enix Europe obtained the series Intellectual property rights. =Reboot= A reboot of the series, Carmageddon: Reincarnation was developed by Stainless Games, who re-acquired the rights to the Carmageddon name, releasing in May 2015. The game is a downloadable or digitally distributed game for Microsoft Windows. In July 2011, the City of Los Angeles launched a massive media campaign under the title \\"Carmageddon\\" to warn drivers about a major closure on the 405 Freeway during the weekend of July 15‚Äì17. Stainless Games capitalized on the coincidence to promote the new release by announcing on the official web site during that time that \\"L.A. Celebrates Carmageddon\\" and \\"Yes, it‚Äôs official! The news that Carmageddon is back has been such a hit in California, that the authorities have decided to dedicate a whole weekend to the game!\\" Funding for the game has come partially from a Kickstarter campaign and donations through their main website. Further funds were secured from Les Edgar (co founder of Bullfrog Productions). On September 26, 2013, it was announced that the PC version on Steam would be released in Q1 2014. On March 27, 2014 the first 'pre alpha' release was available as an Early Access version on Steam. The first beta version was released on February 14, 2015, and on March 18, 2015, it was announced the game would be released on April 23, 2015, via Carmageddon's YouTube channel. The release date was later delayed to May 21, 2015.

Corozal Town is located about 84 miles north of Belize City, and 9 miles from the border with Mexico. The population of Corozal Town, according to the main results of the 2010 census, is 9,871. Corozal was a private estate before becoming a town in the 1840s, mostly settled by Maya Mestizo refugees from the Caste War of Yucat√°n. Much of the town was built over an ancient Maya city, sometimes known as Santa Rita; this may have been the original Pre-Columbian town called Chetumal. Corozal Town was badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in 1955 and was substantially rebuilt afterward.  History  Corozal, the northmost town in Belize, was founded in 1848 by refugees from the Maya Indian uprising against the Spanish in neighboring Yucat√°n. This uprising, known as the Caste War of Yucat√°n (from the Spanish \\"castes\\" or race), began as a war against the Spaniards, but it eventually became a war against the Mestizos. The Mestizos, half Spanish and half Indian, had proved to be formidable allies of the Spaniards and were thus mortal enemies of the Maya Indians. A massacre at Bacalar, Mexico ‚Äî a Mestizo stronghold about thirty miles north of Corozal Town ‚Äî finally led to the exodus of thousands of Mestizos from Bacalar and the surrounding area. Between 1848 and 1856 more than 10,000 refugees crossed the Rio Hondo, the river that now serves as a boundary between Belize and Mexico. These immigrants sought refuge in northern Belize and increased the population of Corozal Town to 4500. Mr. James Blake, a magistrate, let them settle on lands in the Corozal District and helped them to establish the new crop ‚Äî sugar cane. The Mestizo refugees were far from safe in Corozal Town as the Maya Indians from the Mexican base in Santa Cruz Bravo ‚Äî today Carrillo Puerto ‚Äî made several incursions in Corozal Town. In defense, Corozal became a garrison town and Fort Barlee was built here in 1870. Today, the brick corner supports the fort surround the post office complex of the buildings across from the central town square. The immigrants brought with them Maya Mestizo culture: Spanish and Yucatec Maya language, Catholicism and Maya folklore, the use of alcalde, their family structure and way of life. Soon, there emerged a local replication of the society of the Yucat√°n within the boundaries of a country ruled by English expatriates. Across the bay from Corozal Town are the mounds of Cerros, the first Maya coastal trading center. Cerros is considered one of the most important late preclassic Maya sites because it represented the first experiment with kingship in the Maya world. The remains include a number of temples, plazas, ball courts, canals, and minor structures. The most interesting artifacts so far discovered are the five jade head pendants. Within Corozal, itself can be found another Maya ruins from the fourteenth century AD. Known as Santa Rita, the pyramid site sits atop the remains of a Maya city that dominated the area for more, than 2000 years. Burial sites rich in jewelry and artifacts have recently been unearthed here. Santa Rita was probably part of ancient Chactumal, the Maya capital of the area at the time of the first Spanish attempt to conquer the Yucatec Mayas in the early 16th century. The ruins of Santa Rita is located near the town's Hospital and is surrounded by the villages of San Andres, San Antonio, and Paraiso, by walking distances. An estimated 90% of the town was destroyed by Hurricane Janet in 1955, and most of the present structures post-date that hurricane. The town is served by Corozal Hospital. Climate Population and Housing According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census the town of Corozal has a total population of 9,871; 4,740 male and 5,131 female. The total number of households is 2,672 and the average household size is 3.7.  Language  The most spoken language in Corozal is Spanish.

Christmas crackers are festive table decorations that make a snapping sound when pulled open, and often contain a small gift and a joke. They are part of Christmas celebrations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth countries such as Australia (where they are sometimes known as bon-bons), Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the middle, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize. The split is accompanied by a mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a shock-sensitive, chemically impregnated card strip (similar to that used in a cap gun). One chemical used for the friction strip is silver fulminate. Tradition Crackers are typically pulled at the Christmas dinner table or at parties. In one version of the cracker tradition, the person with the larger portion of cracker empties the contents from the tube and keeps them. In another, each person has their own cracker and keeps its contents regardless of whose end they were in. Typically these contents are a coloured paper hat, a small toy, a small plastic model or other trinket, and a motto, a joke, a riddle or piece of trivia on a small strip of paper.Rarely, they can be much more substantial. In 2009, Harrod's offered a version of Christmas cracker retailing at $1,000: \\"Harrods Luxury 6 Christmas Cracker Collection: Bling it up this festive season!\\" The paper hats, with the appearance of crowns, are usually worn when eating Christmas dinner. The tradition of wearing festive hats is believed to date back to Roman times and the Saturnalia celebrations, which also involved decorative headgear. Christmas crackers are also associated with Knut's parties, held in Sweden at the end of the Christmas season. History The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of cracker bonbons and the pulling of crackers from 1847.OED, Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010.. Retrieved 23 December 2010. Earlier version first published in New English Dictionary, 1893. = Tom Smith = Tom Smith's Christmas Novelties from 1911 Tradition tells of how Tom Smith (1823‚Äì1869) of London invented crackers in 1847.Peter Kimpton (2005) Tom Smith's Christmas crackers: an illustrated history, Tempus Margaret Baker (1992) Discovering Christmas customs and folklore: a guide to seasonal rites, p.72, Osprey Publishing He created the crackers as a development of his bon-bon sweets, which he sold in a twist of paper (the origins of the traditional sweet-wrapper). As sales of bon-bons slumped, Smith began to come up with new promotional ideas. His first tactic was to insert love messages into the wrappers of the sweets (similar to fortune cookies). Smith added the \\"crackle\\" element when he heard the crackle of a log he had just put on a fire. The size of the paper wrapper had to be increased to incorporate the banger mechanism, and the sweet itself was eventually dropped, to be replaced by a trinket: fans, jewellery and other substantial items. The new product was initially marketed as the Cosaque (French for Cossack), but the onomatopoeic \\"cracker\\" soon became the commonly used name, as rival varieties came on the market. The other elements of the modern cracker‚Äîthe gifts, paper hats and varied designs‚Äîwere all introduced by Tom Smith's son, Walter Smith, to differentiate his product from the rival cracker manufacturers which had suddenly sprung up. Tom Smith merged with Caley Crackers in 1953.

It is the capital of the Orange Walk District. Orange Walk Town is located on the left bank of the New River, north of Belize City and south of Corozal Town. Despite the English name of the city, its residents are primarily Spanish-speaking mestizos. The city is in a very low-lying area of Belize, though the police station sits atop a buried Mayan pyramid at tall. History In the days of the Maya civilization, the area was known as Holpatin.https://www.elgranmestizo.bz/orange-walk-guide/13-surprising-facts- orange-walk-belize/ The district is home to the biggest Maya temple of the pre-classic period. The Maya of the area came in contact with the Europeans in the 1530s, after which the two groups fought over land. In 1848, there was a massive influx of Maya and Mestizos from Mexico, fleeing the Caste War of Yucat√°n (1847‚Äì1901). This caused a rapid growth of population. In 1872, it was the site of the Battle of Orange Walk. Lamanai (meaning \\"submerged crocodile\\" in Mayan dialect) and Cuello (\\"chin\\" in Spanish) are two very early Mayan ruins located in Orange Walk. Cuello is in fact the oldest Mayan settlement in Belize, dating back to around 2000 BC.https://www.chaacreek.com/orange-walk- district-belize-north-west Visit Banquitas House of Culture to find out more about the history and culture of Orange Walk. In the nineteenth century, Orange Walk was a small city mostly concentrated on the banks of the Rio Hondo River until the construction of the Philip P. Goldson Northern Highway after World War 2. This sparked massive growth around the highway, and it became what is now Queen Victoria Avenue in downtown Orange Walk. Economy Orange Walk Town Sugar Cane Processing Plant With the Maya and Mestizos came their many traditions that today abound in the region. One such thing that they brought was sugar cane, which in the years to come became the basis of Belize's leading industry. Today, this industry continues to thrive in the region, and Orange Walk Town is nicknamed \\"Sugar City\\". The local Tower Hill Sugar Factory (Belize Sugar Industries) handles all of the country's sugar cane output. Also, rum is made straight from the local cane by refineries such as Cuello Refinery Ltd, Caribbean Refinery and Old Master Rum. It is then mostly consumed nationally and not customarily exported. The farming of other crops, and tourism, also play a role in the economy. Overall, Orange Walk has one of Belize's strongest and most productive economies. Many families are rich due to importing goods from nearby Mexico. The poverty rate in Orange Walk is 24.9%, the second-lowest in the country.http://www.fao.org/3/j4051b/j4051b05.htm The quality of life is also high due to the good economy.

Local bus service to and from Belize City to the south and Corozal Town to the north operates approximately every half-hour. Taxis and minibuses are also available for transportation within the city and to surrounding villages and towns. The town is a mid-stop point between Belize City and Chetumal, Mexico, and for this reason many large tour buses pass through on a regular basis. The Orange Walk District in general, and Orange Walk Town in particular, are drug-trafficking centers due to their close proximity to Mexico. The streets in Orange Walk town are very well paved in most areas, with almost no potholes. Be aware that there are some speed bumps throughout the town, as well as traffic lights at main intersections (these are rare in Belize). =Statistics= In accordance with the Orange Walk Transport Authority, there are about twenty daily buses coming into Orange Walk from the surrounding areas. About fifty buses leave Orange Walk to surrounding towns, villages, and to Quintana Roo, Mexico. Social issues Orange Walk is generally a safe city. Only about 0.5 people per 1,000 are homeless. Orange Walk has a very low internet access rate at 22.3%, compared with 38.2% in Belize City.https://sib.org.bz/wp- content/uploads/2017/05/Census_Report_2010.pdf Orange Walk has the second- highest marriage rate in the country at 43.7% of all persons. A relatively low number of foreign-born persons live in the city (10.8%, as opposed to 14.5% national average). Healthcare The town is served by the Northern Regional Hospital, formerly called the Orange Walk Hospital, and a second major private hospital named Northern Medical Specialist Plaza. Orange Walk has a very good quality of healthcare.

San Ignacio lies 13 km to the east and Melchor de Mencos just across the border. The Mopan River runs along the town's north and west edges. Historical background Benque was first settled by Maya from Flores, El Pet√©n, Guatemala. It grew as a lumber camp on the Mopan River that flowed into the Belize River, to the coast at Belize Town. The Mayas had been catechized by Spanish Catholic missionaries, leading to the predominance of the Catholic church in Benque, which holds the earliest Baptismal records in Cayo District from Jesuit Fr. Bavastro in May 1865. In 1877 the town was served by Manuel Ignacio Santa Cruz Loidi, a Basque priest and military leader in the unsuccessful effort to defeat the liberals in Spain's Third Carlist War.Osborne, F.J. (1988). British Honduras. History of the Catholic Church in Jamaica, 274-509. Chicago: Loyola University, 286. During the 1880s Fr. Jose Maria Pinelo, a refugee from Pet√©n during the presidency of Manuel Barillas, visited Benque, remaining from 1887‚Äì1889. In the 1890s the population was about 500. In 1904 a permanent Catholic residency was established by Jesuit Fr. William ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Stanton. Benque Communion class with Pallottines & Fr. Versavel, c. 1920 Then in 1913, at the persuasion of Jesuit Fr. Versavel, the Pallottine sisters came from Germany and served first in Benque. Mother (Saint) Katharine Drexel subsidized their convent from her inheritance. On the night of 16 November 1937 a fire destroyed the Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and Fr. Kuenzel undertook to build the new church. In 1950, Kuenzel persuaded the Town Board to name the new football field after Corporal Marchalleck through whose \\"self-sacrificing interest and persevering efforts [the] football campus came as if by magic out of what was hitherto useless tropical bush.\\". St. Joseph Convent on the street of that name was completed in 1952. On 18 January 1961 Fr. Sontag, Jesuit pastor in Benque, was found murdered at his desk in the rectory, with a machete the likely weapon. The perpetrator and motive remain a mystery. In 1963 a Catholic primary school building of reinforced concrete was built. The next year the Jesuits handed the parish over to the diocesan clergy, with Fr. Herbert Panton its first native pastor. The Catholic community SOLT increased its presence in Belize from the early 1990s, beginning in Benque. Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC printing in Benque to improve the quality of elementary school textbooks in Belize. Demographics Benque has long been the place where tourists and merchants cross to Melchor and purchase Maya textiles. Now Guatemalan youth cross the border each day to receive a secondary education in English. During the first years of the 21st century Benque experienced a rapid boom in population. It offers primary and secondary education, supermarkets, an annual fiesta, and is home to a Belize Premier Football League team. In 2010 its population, mostly of Maya or Mestizo descent, was 5,824 (2,906 males and 2,918 females); households numbered 1,415 with average size 4.1.\\" MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS OFFICIAL RESULTS 4th MARCH 2015, Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission.

Troubador Publishing Ltd, 3 May 2010 is a human-powered (or gravity-powered) three- wheeled vehicle. Some tricycles, such as cycle rickshaws (for passenger transport) and freight trikes, are used for commercial purposes, especially in the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia. In the West, adult-sized tricycles are used primarily for recreation, shopping, and exercise. Tricycles are favoured by children and senior adults for their apparent stability versus a bicycle; however a conventional trike has poor dynamic lateral stability, and the rider must take care when cornering to avoid tipping the trike over. Unconventional designs such as recumbents have a lower centre of gravity so require less care. History Stephan Farffler's hand-controlled three- wheeled wheelchair 19th century tricycle used in Iran A three-wheeled wheelchair was built in 1655 or 1680 by a disabled German man, Stephan Farffler, who wanted to be able to maintain his mobility. Since he was a watch-maker, he was able to create a vehicle that was powered by hand cranks. In 1789, two French inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle, powered by pedals; They called it the tricycle. In 1818, British inventor Denis Johnson patented his approach to designing tricycles. In 1876, James Starley developed the Coventry Lever Tricycle, which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side; power was supplied by hand levers. In 1877, Starley developed a new vehicle he called the Coventry Rotary, which was \\"one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles.\\" Starley's inventions started a tricycling craze in Britain; by 1879, there were \\"twenty types of tricycles and multi-wheel cycles ... produced in Coventry, England, and by 1884, there were over 120 different models produced by 20 manufacturers.\\" The first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by The Leicester Safety Tricycle Company of Leicester, England, which was brought to the market in 1882 costing ¬£18. They also developed a folding tricycle at the same time. Tricycles were used by riders who did not feel comfortable on the high wheelers, such as women who wore long, flowing dresses (see rational dress). Associations In the UK, upright tricycles are sometimes referred to as \\"barrows\\". Many trike enthusiasts in the UK belong to the Tricycle Association, formed in 1929. They participate in day rides, tours, time trials, and a criterium (massed start racing) series. Wheel configurations =Delta= A delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels. =Tadpole= A tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel. Rear wheel steering is sometimes used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added). =Other= Some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other. An in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels, one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear. Types Small folded delta trike parked in New York =Upright= Upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle, traditionally diamond frame, or open frame, but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back (called delta) or two wheels at the front (called tadpole). The rider straddles the frame in both delta and tadpole configurations. Steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta, or via a form of Ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole. All non- tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike. The center of gravity is quite high compared to recumbent trikes. Because of this, non-tilting trikes are more prone to tipping over in corners and on uneven or sloping terrain. Conversely, the rider enjoys better visibility than on a recumbent because their head is higher. =Recumbent= Recumbent trikes' advantages (over conventional trikes) include stability (through low centre of gravity) and low aerodynamic drag. Disadvantages (compared to bicycles) include greater cost, weight, and width. The very low seat may make entry difficult, and on the road they may be less visible to other traffic. Recumbent delta Delta layout Hase Spezialr√§der Kettwiesel Recumbent delta is similar to an upright, with two wheels at the back and one at the front, but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat. One or both rear wheels can be driven, while the front is used for steering (the usual layout). Steering is either through a linkage, with the handlebars under the seat (under seat steering) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar (over seat steering). Some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground. Delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes. The tight turning radius is necessary if riding on trails with offset barriers, or navigating around closely placed obstacles. The higher seat makes mounting and dismounting easier. Even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight (including the rider) is shifted back towards the rear wheels. Many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable. The Hase Kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable. Delta trikes are suitable to be used as manual scooters for mobility, rehab and/or exercise. The Hase Lepus Comfort is an example of a rehab delta trike designed mainly for comfort and ease of use. It has a lowered front boom and the seat can be adjusted to a height of , which aids in mounting and dismounting. It also has rear wheel suspension for comfort. The Lepus can be folded for easier storage and transportation. The weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used. The Hase Kettwiesel Allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 lbs (17.9 kg). The Catrike Road tadpole trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 37.5 lbs (17 kg). Recumbent tadpole Recumbent tadpole Recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects the left and right axle assemblies. The tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes. With its extremely low center of gravity, aerodynamic layout and light weight (for trikes), tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes. Most Velomobiles are built in a tadpole trike configuration since a wide front and narrow rear offer superior aerodynamics to a delta trike configuration. Recumbent hand trike Racing handcycle Hand-crank trikes use a hand- operated crank, either as a sole source of power or a double drive with footpower from pedals and hand-power from the hand crank. The hand-power only trikes can be used by individuals who do not have the use of their legs due to a disability or an injury. They are made by companies including Greenspeed, Invacare, Quickie and Druzin. In case of paralysis of the legs, more speed and range of distance can be obtained by adding functional electrical stimulation to the legs. The large leg muscles are activated by electrical impulses synchronized with the hand cranking movement. Recumbent tandem Recumbent tandem trikes allow two people to ride in a recumbent position with an extra-strong backbone frame to hold the extra weight. Some allow the \\"captain\\" (the rider who steers) and \\"stoker\\" (the rider who only pedals) to pedal at different speeds. They are often made with couplers so the frames can be broken down into pieces for easier transport. Manufacturers of recumbent trikes include Greenspeed, WhizWheelz and Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE). =Special purposes= Some tricycles are designed for load carrying. Others are designed for racing or for comfort. Some recumbent tricycles are fully enclosed for all weather use as well as for aerodynamic benefits; these are known as velomobiles. Some are designed to transport children. Tricycle rickshaw Two kinds of tricycle rickshaw Most cycle rickshaws, used for carrying passengers for hire, are tricycles with one steering wheel in the front and two wheels in the back supporting a seating area for one or two passengers. Cycle rickshaws often have a parasol or canopy to protect the passengers from sun and rain. These vehicles are widely used in South Asia and Southeast Asia, where rickshaw driving provides essential employment for recent immigrants from rural areas, generally impoverished men. In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, rickshaws became increasingly popular in big cities in Britain, Europe and the United States, where they provide urban transportation, novelty rides, and serve as advertising media. Spidertrike Spidertrike is a recumbent cycle rickshaw that is used in central London and operated by Eco Chariots. The trike pictured is called the SUV (Sensible Utility Vehicle) and is produced by the company Organic Engines, which operates in Florida in the United States. It is a front wheel drive tricycle, articulated behind the driver seat, and has hydraulic double disc brakes and internal hub gears. The passenger is protected from rain and sun with a canopy. Freight trike Industrial trike with storage box mounted between rear wheels Freight trike in Shanghai High-mass counter-direction tricycle Urban delivery trikes are designed and constructed for transporting large loads. These trikes include a cargo area consisting of a steel tube carrier, an open or enclosed box, a flat platform, or a large, heavy-duty wire basket. These are usually mounted over one or both wheels, low behind the front wheel, or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle, to keep the center of gravity low. The frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads several times that of an ordinary bicycle; as such, extra low gears may be added. Other specific design considerations include operator visibility and load suspension. Many, but not all, cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles. Many freight trikes are of the tadpole configuration, with the cargo box (platform, etc.) mounted between the front wheels. India and China are significant strongholds of the rear-loading \\"delta\\" carrier trike. Freight trikes are also designed for indoor use in large warehouses or industrial plants. The advantage of using freight trikes rather than a motor vehicle is that there is no exhaust, which means that the trike can be used inside warehouses. While another option is electric golf cart-style vehicles, freight trikes are human-powered, so they do not have the maintenance required to keep batteries on golf carts charged up. Common uses include: *Delivery services in dense urban environments *Food vending in high foot traffic areas (including specialist ice cream bikes) *Transporting trade tools, including around large installations such as power stations and CERN *Airport cargo handling *Recycling collections *Warehouse inventory transportation *Mail *Food collection *Child transport (in Amsterdam, freight trikes are used primarily to carry children) Children's tricycle Children's tricycle Children's plastic tricycle Compared to adult trikes, children's model are simpler, without brakes or gears, and often with crude front-drive. Tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five, after which point they usually switch to a bicycle, often with training wheels (stabilisers). Child trikes can be unstable, particularly if the wheelbase or track are insufficient. Some trikes have a push bar so adults can control the trike. Child trikes have frames made of metal, plastic, or wood. Children's trikes can have pedals directly driving the front wheels, allowing braking with the pedals, or they can use chain drive the rear wheels, often without a differential, so one rear wheel spins free. Children's trikes do not always have pneumatic tires, having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to the weight of the tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. Pull brakes are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals. Drift trike Drift trikes are a variety of tricycle with slick rear wheels, enabling them to drift, being countersteered round corners. They are commonly used for gravity-powered descents of paved roads with steep gradients. Hand and foot trike Hand and foot trike With hand and foot trikes, the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel. The hand and foot trike can be also converted into a manual tricycle designed to be driven with both hands and both feet. There are also new hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle, these bikes make it even possible to cycle with legs despite a spinal cord injury. =Tilting= Tricycles have been constructed that tilt in the direction of a turn, as a bicycle does, to avoid rolling over without a wide axle track. Examples have included upright, recumbent, delta, and tadpole configurations. Conversion sets Tricycle conversion sets or kits convert a bicycle to an upright tricycle. Tricycle kit can remove the front wheel and mounts two wheels under the handlebars for a quick and easy conversion. The advantages of a trike conversion set include lower cost compared with new hand built tricycles and the freedom to choose almost any donor bicycle frame. Tricycle conversion sets tend to be heavier than a high quality, hand built, sports, touring or racing tricycle. Conversion sets can give the would-be serious tricyclist a taste of triking before making the final decision to purchase a complete tricycle. Conversion sets can also supplied ready to be brazed onto a lightweight, steel bicycle frame to form a complete trike. Some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes. Operation Adults may find upright tricycles difficult to ride because of familiarity with the counter-steering required to balance a bicycle. The variation in the camber of the road is the principal difficulty to be overcome once basic tricycle handling is mastered. Recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and, depending on track width and riding position, capable of very fast cornering. Some trikes are tilting three-wheelers, which lean into corners much as bicycles do. In the case of delta tricycles, the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels, though in some cases both wheels are driven through a differential. A double freewheel, preferably using no-backlash roller clutches, is considered superior. Trikes with a differential often use an internally geared hub as a gearbox in a 'mid drive' system. A jackshaft drive permits either single or two-wheel drive. Tadpoles generally use a bicycle's rear wheel drive and for that reason are usually lighter, cheaper and easier to replace and repair. =Braking= Some trikes use a geometry (also called center point steering) with the kingpin axis intersecting the ground directly ahead of the tire contact point, producing a normal amount of trail. This arrangement, elsewhere called \\"zero scrub radius\\" is used to mitigate the effects of one-sided braking on steering. While zero scrub can reduce steering feel and increase wandering it can also protect novices from spinning out and/or flipping. Tadpole trikes tend also to use Ackermann steering geometry, perhaps with both front brakes operated by the stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do \\"bootlegger turns\\", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes is close to the front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a latching brake lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill. Recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand, allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction.

They are Dangriga, which contains the town proper and two villages (including Hope Creek and Sarawee) and the offshore islands (cayes), and Stann Creek West, which contains most of the remaining villages including Santa Cruz, Placencia and Independence. = Transportation = The district is served by the Hummingbird Highway and the Southern Highway, connecting to Belize City by way of the George Price Highway at Belmopan.  Language  Mostly used language in Stann Creek is English, with the main town of Dangriga having a mix of English and Garifuna, since majority of the residents are Garifuna.  Attractions  The Stann Creek District is also home to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary where South Stann Creek rises. Within the preserve is Victoria Peak, the second highest point in Belize, at above sea level. The ethnic Garifuna village of Hopkins has recently undergone a huge transformation due to the growing tourism industry. Placencia is home to one of Belize's most popular tourist destinations due to its large selection of resorts, guest houses, hotels and white Sandy beaches. The Garifuna are direct descendants of a group of African slaves who escaped two ship-wrecked Spanish slave ships near St. Vincent in 1635. They celebrate a diverse and rich culture that is a blend of African traditions of music, dance and religious ceremonies; Native American farming, hunting, and fishing techniques; and a French and Arawak influenced language.

It is the least developed region in the country, and it features some of the most pristine rainforests, extensive cave networks, coastal lowland plains, and offshore cays. Toledo is home to a wide range of cultures: Mopan and Kekchi Maya, Creole, the Garifuna, East Indians, Mennonites, Mestizos, and descendants of US Confederate settlers. Geography The District has many villages, including Monkey River Town and the Toledo Settlement; the Maya villages of San Pedro Columbia, Blue Creek, Indian Creek, Santa Cruz, San Antonio, San Jose, San Felipe; and the Garifuna village of Barranco. It also has a number of Maya ruins, including Lubaantun, Nim Li Punit, Uxbenka, and Pusilha. According to the 2010 census, Toledo District had a population of 30,538 people. Economy The economy of Toledo relies heavily upon agriculture: crops grown include beans and corn, as well as rice which is sold to the Big Falls Rice Mill. Cacao is grown organically and sold via the Toledo Cacao Growers Association to Green & Black's for their renowned Maya Gold chocolate, as well as to chocolatiers within Belize. The District's ancient and modern-day links with chocolate are celebrated annually in May (Commonwealth Day Holiday weekend) at the Toledo Cacao Festival. Farmers grow additional crops such as coffee, yams, sweet potato, hot chili peppers, avocado, oranges and plantain for sale at the market in Punta Gorda, held each Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Fishermen practice small- scale fishing from their dug-out canoes, as well as diving for lobster and conch during open season. The Port Honduras Marine Reserve just north of Punta Gorda Town is a protected area, and Toledo's waters are regarded as the permit capital of Belize. Many traditional fishermen have now trained as fly-fishing guides through the alternative livelihood projects offered by local conservation groups. Tourism is an important, and relatively new, industry for Toledo. Once regarded as an area only for the hardy and adventurous, the opening of new tourist accommodation and the development of tours, as well as a growing awareness of the district's high proportion of protected areas, wildlife, excellent birding and the offshore cayes, have resulted in Toledo being recognized as an important ‚Äòemerging destination‚Äô.  Language  The most spoken language in Toledo is the Mayan Language.

The instrument features a tone and portamento similar to that of the theremin, but with a different control mechanism. It consisted of a sine wave generator with a knob that controlled the pitch, placed inside a wooden box. The pitch knob was attached to a slider on the outside of the box with some string. The player would move the slider, thus turning the knob to the desired frequency, with the help of markings drawn on the box. Background The instrument was custom-built at Tanner's request. Tanner appreciated the theremin's sound, but wanted greater control of pitch and attack. The Electro-Theremin uses mechanical controls, a long slide bar for the pitch (analogous to the slide of the trombone that was Tanner's main instrument) and a knob to adjust volume. This contrasts with the hand movements in space that formed the original theremin's signal feature. The Electro-Theremin also produces a slightly less complex timbre than the original. This is not due to the nature of the instrument, but due to Dr. Theremin's intentional harmonic generation in the output of the theremin, which Tanner did not do. Tanner played it for the 1958 LP record Music for Heavenly Bodies, the first full-length album featuring the instrument, and played it subsequently on several television and movie soundtracks, most notably on George Greeley's theme for the 1960s TV series My Favorite Martian, and on an LP record titled Music from Outer Space. Most famously, Tanner played his Electro-Theremin on three songs by The Beach Boys: \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\", and \\"Wild Honey\\". The instrument used in \\"Good Vibrations\\" was a Heathkit tube-type audio oscillator coupled to a mechanical action that allowed the player to mark notes along a ruler-type scale where notes could be located quickly and precisely. Tanner's prototype Electro-Theremin appears to have been the only one made. In the late 1960s, Tanner donated or sold the instrument to a hospital to use for audiology work, because he believed that newer keyboard synthesizers made it obsolete.The Paul Tanner Electro-Theremin ‚Äî David S. Miller Tannerin In 1999, Tom Polk built a replica of the original Electro-Theremin for Brian Wilson's solo tour of that year. Polk called his instrument the Tannerin in honor of the original creator and performer.Tannerin built for the 1999 Brian Wilson solo Tour - Tom Polk  Similar instruments  * A musical saw, also called a singing saw, is the application of a hand saw as a musical instrument, played with a bow. The sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the theremin. The musical saw is classified as a friction idiophone with direct friction (131.22) under the Hornbostel-Sachs system of musical instrument classification. * The Ondes- Martenot, 1928, which uses the principle of heterodyning oscillators, but has a keyboard as well as a slide controller and is touched while playing. *Trautonium, a monophonic electronic musical instrument by Friedrich Trautwein, invented in 1929 * The Electronde, invented in 1929 by Martin Taubman, has an antenna for pitch control, a handheld switch for articulation and a foot pedal for volume control.Taubman demonstrates his Electronde.

The Persephone allows continuous variation of the frequency range from 1 to 10 octaves.

Geography  Most of the Belize District is in the east central mainland of Belize; the Belize District also includes various offshore islands, including Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker, St. George's Caye, Caye Chapel, English Caye, Goff's Caye, and Turneffe Atoll. Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker are considered two of the country's primary tourism areas. The longest river in the country, the Belize River, passes through the district and joins the Caribbean Sea along its coast. The Northern River, Sibun River, and Manatee River are also in this District. = Settlements = San Pedro Town, which is situated on the island of Ambergris Caye, is also in the Belize District. Caye Caulker and St. George's Caye are the island villages in this district. Maskall, Bomba, Corozalito, Santana, Lucky Strike, Rockstone Pond, Boston, Crooked Tree, Biscayne, May Pen, Gardenia, Grace Bank, Sand Hill, Lord's Bank, Ladyville, Burrel Boom, Buttercup, Scotland Halfmoon, Flowers Bank, Bermudian Landing, Isabella Bank, Double Head Cabbage, Willows Bank, Saint Paul's Bank, Big Falls, Rancho Dolores, Hattieville, Freetown Sibun, Gracie Rock, La Democracia, and Gales Point are all mainland villages in the Belize District. The Crooked Tree and Monkey Bay Wildlife Sanctuaries, the Belize Zoo (30 miles west of Belize City), as well as the ancient Maya ruins of Altun Ha are all in this district.  History  The Belize District was the area first settled by Europeans. They developed estates along the rivers and creeks; because these waterways were their transportation highways. Many of the estates were referred to as the owner's 'bank'(as in the banks of a river). Therefore, Mr. Lord's estate on the bank of the Belize River became Lord's Bank and Mr. Flowers' home place on this same river became Flowers Bank. Many of these old estates have grown into villages; while other places on our map such as Baker, Bob Eiley, Bocotora, Butcher Burns, Lime Walk, More Force, Nago Bank, Washing Tree, Cedar Bank, Churchyard, Egypt, Watters Bank, and White Hill are old estates which did not become villages. Some places like Davis Bank and Tropical Park have now become parts of larger communities.  Demographics  In 2005 mid-year population estimate to the Belize District was 87,000 with an estimated number of 69,200 of these living in the two urban areas. Belize City is by far the large of the two with an estimated population of 60,800. San Pedro Town has a population of about 8,900. The population of all the villages and outlying communities combined is about 17,800 people. =Population and housing= 2010 Population and Housing Census has Belize district's total population as 89,247 residents, of this 43,980 are males and 45,267 are females. The total number of households is 27,161 and the average household size is 3.3.  Political divisions  Politically, Belize District contains 13 constituencies according to the Elections and Boundaries Department. 10 of these are in Belize City proper; the remainder are classified as rural. = Belize City constituencies = The 10 constituencies that fall within the city limits of Belize City are: Albert, Caribbean Shores, Collet, Fort George, Freetown, Lake Independence, Mesopotamia, Pickstock, Port Loyola, and Queen's Square. Both Prime Minister Dean Barrow (Queen's Square) and Leader of the Opposition Francis Fonseca (Freetown) represent Belize City constituencies. = Belize Rural North = Belize Rural North contains the northern half of mainland Belize District, including Maskall, Lucky Strike and villages in the Belize River Valley and along the Northern Highway, except for Ladyville and Lord's Bank. Its current representative is Edmond Castro of the United Democratic Party. = Belize Rural Central = Belize Rural Central is limited to the southern half of mainland Belize District and containing the important villages of Ladyville, Lord's Bank, Western Paradise, Hattieville, and Gales Point. As of 2012, the PUP's Dolores Balderamos is area representative. = Belize Rural South = Belize Rural South contains the offshore islands of the Belize District including Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker, Caye Chapel, St. George's Caye, and the Turneffe Islands. Its main town is San Pedro on Ambergris Caye. The current representative is the UDP's Manuel Heredia. Ambergris Caye is also a pene-exclave, and it is the land that is completely separated through the rest of the district and in the country.

The population was 33,335 in 2000. The district capital is Corozal Town. Pre- Columbian Maya ruins are found in Corozal at Santa Rita near Corozal Town, and at Cerros. Towns and Villages Corozal District includes Corozal Town and the villages of Buena Vista, Calcutta, Caledonia, Carolina, Chan Chen, Chunox, Concepcion, Consejo, Copper Bank, Cristo Rey, Estrella, Libertad, Little Belize, Louisville, Paraiso, Patchacan, Progresso, Ranchito, San Andres, San Antonio, San Joaquin, San Narciso, San Roman, San Victor, San Pedro, Santa Clara, Sarteneja, Xaibe, and Yo Chen. In addition, the island of Ambergris Caye is geographically closer to Corozal District than the district in which it is administrated, Belize District. Political divisions There are four political divisions in the Corozal District. *Corozal Bay is represented by the United Democratic Party's Pablo Marin, Minister of Health, in his second term. Marin defeated relative and former PUP representative Vildo Marin. The division includes most of Corozal Town proper. *Corozal North covers the villages immediately north and west of Corozal Town and is held by two-term representative Hugo Patt of the UDP. *Corozal Southeast has long been a PUP stronghold under father and son Florencio Marin Sr. (who stepped down in 2008 after seven terms) and Florencio Marin Jr., who is now in his third term. *Corozal Southwest is represented by first-term representative Dr. Angel Campos, who beat incumbent Ramiro Ramirez of the PUP in 2015.  Economy  While Corozal District depended for many years on the sugar industry, at one time having its own sugar factory in Libertad Village, today the economy is more diversified. Sugar production and other agricultural crops such as papaya are still central to the way of life of many rural Corozalenos, but occupations in the tourism industry are slowly becoming more prominent. Now almost 65% of Corozalenos depend on the Commercial Free Zone for employment. The Zone is located on the border of Belize and Mexico. Contraband is the biggest source of growing income in Corozal since it is adjacent to Mexico, and includes such things as vegetables, fruits, liquors, cigarettes, and gasoline. Languages English is the most spoken language in Corozal, followed by Spanish. 80% speak English very well and 60% speak Spanish very well. Corozal's villages are divided by colour and language: Corozal Town, the main centre of the District, is peopled by a mix of Belize's races and cultures, most notably the Maya Mestizos. Spanish and English are the major languages spoken. Calcutta, Estrella Village, Libertad, Ranchito, and San Antonio are populated by East Indian people and speak English and Spanish very well. Chan Chen, Chunox, Cristo Rey, Louisville, Patchakan, San Pedro, San Victor Village, Xaibe, and Yo Chen are populated by Maya people and speak Spanish and Yucatec Maya language very well, along with some English. Buena Vista, Caledonia, Conception, San Narciso, San Roman, and Santa Clara are populated by Maya-Mestizo people who speak Spanish, some English and elders speaking Yucatec Maya. They are not obliged to learn English, because school teachers teach in Spanish but write in English and because at work the primary language is Spanish, so villagers are not exposed to English on a daily basis. Progresso, San Andres, and Sarteneja Village are populated by Creole and Hispanic people, who share their cultures and languages in English and Spanish. Little Belize is populated by Mennonites, who speak German. http://www.simplybelize.org/episode01.html Education Belize Adventist College and Belize Adventist Junior College are located in the village of Calcutta in the Corozal District.

Main settlements The Orange Walk District, with an area of 1,829 square miles (4,636 square km), is located north-northwest of the Belize District. This is the second largest district in terms of total area in comparison to other districts in Belize, and lies between the Belize and Corozal districts to the east, Mexico to the north and Guatemala to the west. Villages in Orange Walk District include August Pine Ridge, Blue Creek, Carmelita, Chan Pine Ridge, Douglas, Indian Church, Guinea Grass, San Antonio, San Carlos, San Estevan, San Felipe, San Jos√©, San Jose Palmar, Nuevo San Juan, San Lazaro, San Luis, San Pablo, San Rom√°n, Santa Cruz, Santa Martha, Shipyard, Trial Farm, Trinidad and Yo Creek. Other settlements with smaller numbers of inhabitants may also be found, as well as ancient Mayan sites such as Cuello, Lamanai, Noh Mul and Chan Chich. The Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, a large private nature reserve in the Yalbac Hills, is also located in this district. The land is highly cultivated with sugar cane, sorghum, rice, corn and vegetables, with a significant amount of this agriculture done by Mennonite farmers. According to the Statistical Institute of Belize, the Orange Walk District had an estimated population of 45,419 persons for the 2010 population and housing census; 13,400 of these persons lived in the urban area of Orange Walk Town while 32,019 lived in rural areas. Economy The capital of the district is Orange Walk Town, with an estimated population of 13,400. The district is home to mostly Maya mestizo descendants of Mexican refugees who fled from the 1840 Caste War. The district's main economic base is drawn from agriculture, with sugar cane being the primary crop. This is slowly being replaced by a combination of alternative crops such potatoes, onions and soya beans. Orange Walk is also important for its production of dairy products, citrus fruits, beef and rum production. Another emerging industry is tourism due to healthy populations of tropical wildlife and the rich archaeological sites now coming to light. There are over 400 recorded bird species in the district, making Orange Walk a birdwatcher's paradise. Several settlements in the district are also home to German speaking Amish Mennonites. The district is also the home of two rivers, the Rio Hondo, which also forms part of the border with Mexico, and the New River, which has as its source Belize's largest body of water, the New River Lagoon. History Industry in Orange Walk was previously dominated by logging for over a hundred years until the refugees of the Caste War arrived in the late 19th century. At the time of logging, all the timber was floated down the New River into the Corozal Bay, then to Belize City and shipped abroad. At the time of the arrival of the Caste War refugees, the logging industry was in decline and eventually the sugar industry was established. There has been evidence that some Yucatec Maya were still living in a remote area of Yalbac hills of the district when the British arrived in the Orange walk District. Although the Orange Walk District has no coast because it is locked inland, it boasts the remains of two forts, Forts Mundy and Cairns, built by soldiers of the British Honduras West India Regiment. The forts were built in the 19th century after battles between earlier Mayan inhabitants of the district, most notably Marcus Canul and his Icaiche Indians, and settlers. Political divisions Politically, Orange Walk is divided into 4 constituencies, three currently under the People's United Party (PUP) and one under the United Democratic Party (UDP). *Orange Walk Central: Orange Walk Central generally includes the vicinity of Orange Walk Town and the village of San Estevan. Since 1993, this seat has been held by the PUP's John Briceno. Briceno was re-elected in the 2015 elections. *Orange Walk East: Orange Walk East includes the eastern area of Orange Walk Town and the easternmost villages in the district, particularly San Jose Palmar, Chan Pine Ridge, Tower Hill, Carmelita and Santa Martha. Elodio Aragon of the UDP won this seat in the 2015 elections. *Orange Walk North: Gaspar Vega won this seat for the UDP in the 2015 elections. The area includes the Otro Benque area of Orange Walk Town and the villages of Trial Farm, San Jose, San Pablo, Douglas, San Roman, San Luis, Nuevo San Juan, San Antonio and Santa Cruz. *Orange Walk South: Orange Walk South contains the villages of San Lazaro, Yo Creek, Trinidad, August Pine Ridge, San Felipe, Guinea Grass, Blue Creek, Shipyard and a number of other villages. Jose Abelardo Mai for the PUP is the recently elected area representative in the 2015 elections. Language In the Orange Walk District Spanish, Kriol and English are mostly spoken. The mennonite community, which is around 10% of the district's population speaks primarily German. In many villages Yucatec Maya is still spoken by elders.

History =Early years and products= JTS initially focused on a new 3\\" form-factor drive for laptops. The 3\\" form factor allowed a larger drive capacity for laptops with the existing technology. Compaq Computers was actively engaged in qualifying these drives and built several laptops with this form factor drive. Lack of a second source was a major obstacle for this new form factor to gain a foothold; JTS licensed the form factor to Western Digital to attempt to remedy this problem. Eventually, as 2.5\\" drives became cheaper to build, interest in the 3\\" form factor waned, and JTS and WD stopped the project in 1998. JTS by then had become a source of cheap, medium- performance 3.5\\" drives with 5400 RPM spindles. The drives, produced in a factory in India (the factory was in the Madras Export Processing Zone in the suburbs of the Southern Indian city of Madras, now known as Chennai), were known for poor reliability. Failure rates were very high and quality control was inconsistent: good drives were very good, still running after 5 years, whereas bad drives almost always failed within a few weeks. Because of their low-tier reputation, JTS drives were rare in brand-name PCs and most frequently turned up in home-built and whitebox PCs. Product lines included Palladium and Champion internal IDE hard drives. The basic design of their drives was done by Kalok for TEAC in the early 1990s. TEAC used the design as part of a removable HDD system, which was also sold under the Kalok name. After Kalok failed in 1994, JTS hired its founder as their chief technical officer, and licensed the patents involved from TEAC and Pont Peripherals. =Merger with Atari Corporation and demise= On February 13, 1996, JTS announced a reverse merger with former video game and home computer manufacturer, Atari Corporation. It was primarily a marriage of convenience; JTS had products but little cashflow, while Atari had money, primarily from a series of successful lawsuits earlier in the decade followed by good investments. However, with the failure of its Jaguar game console, losses mounting, and no other products to sell, Atari expected to run out of money within two years. Within a few months of the merger becoming official on July 30, all the former Atari employees were either dismissed or relocated to JTS's headquarters. Atari's remaining inventory of Jaguar products proved difficult to get rid of, even at liquidation prices, and the bulk of them remained in stock months after the merger until finally being moved out to a private liquidator on December 23, 1996. Even with the cash infusion from Atari, JTS quickly ran out of money. On March 13, 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to HIAC XI, Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive, for $5 million in cash, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. Later that year, on December 11, JTS filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but its filing was ultimately converted into involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation by the bankruptcy courts on January 28, 1999.

Of two earlier print/formatting programs DITTO and TJ-2, only the latter had, and introduced, text justification; RUNOFF also added pagination. The name RUNOFF, and similar names led to other formatting program implementations. By 1982 Runoffa name not possible before lower case letters were introduced to file names largely became associated with Digital Equipment Corporation and Unix computers. DEC used the terms VAX DSR and DSR to refer to VAX DIGITAL Standard Runoff. History =CTSS= The original RUNOFF type-setting program for CTSS was written by Jerome H. Saltzer. Bob Morris and Doug McIlroy translated that from MAD assembler to BCPL. Morris and McIlroy then moved the BCPL version to Multics when the IBM 7094 on which CTSS ran was being shut down. =Multics= Documentation for the Multics version of RUNOFF described it as \\"types out text segments in manuscript form.\\" =Other versions and implementations= A later version of runoff for Multics was written in PL/I by Dennis Capps, in 1974. This runoff code was the ancestor of the machine language roff that was written for the fledgling Unix. Other versions of Runoff were developed for various computer systems including Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-11 minicomputer systems running RT-11, RSTS/E, RSX on Digital's PDP-10 and for OpenVMS on VAX minicomputers, as well as UNIVAC Series 90 mainframes using the EDT text editor under the VS/9 operating system. These different releases of Runoff typically had little in common except the convention of indicating a command to Runoff by beginning the line with a period. Another notable program, based on work by Donald Knuth, is named TeX; a successor to TeX was announced by Knuth in 2010. The origin of IBM's SCRIPT (markup) software began in 1968 when \\"IBM contracted Stuart Madnick of MIT to write a simple document preparation ...\\" to run on CP/67. He modeled it on MIT's CTSS RUNOFF. Background RUNOFF was written in 1964 for the CTSS operating system by Jerome H. Saltzer in MAD and FAP. It actually consisted of a pair of programs, TYPSET (which was basically a document editor), and RUNOFF (the output processor). RUNOFF had support for pagination and headers, as well as text justification (TJ-2 appears to have been the earliest text justification system, but it did not have the other capabilities). RUNOFF is a direct predecessor of the runoff document formatting program of Multics, which in turn was the ancestor of the roff and nroff document formatting programs of Unix, and their descendants. It was also the ancestor of FORMAT for the IBM System/360, and of course indirectly of every computerized word processing system. Likewise, RUNOFF for CTSS was the predecessor of the various RUNOFFs for DEC's operating systems, via the RUNOFF developed by the University of California, Berkeley's Project Genie for the SDS 940 system. The name is alleged to have come from the phrase at the time, I'll run off a copy.

Dennis Ritchie noted that the ability to rapidly modify roff (because it was locally written software) to provide special features was an important factor in leading to the adoption of Unix by the patent department to fill its word processing needs.

San Ignacio serves as the cultural-economic hub of Cayo District. It got its start from mahogany and chicle production during British colonisation. Over time it attracted people from the surrounding areas, which led to the diverse population of the town today. San Ignacio is the largest settlement in Cayo District and the second largest in the country, after Belize City. History The town was originally named El Cayo by the Spanish. On 19 October 1904, El Cayo was officially declared a town by the government of British Honduras. In the past a creek ran between the Macal and the Mopan rivers one mile outside of San Ignacio going toward Benque Viejo. This creek then fulfilled the definition of an area of land completely surrounded by water and thus the name Cayo, \\"island\\". There was a large wooden bridge across this creek in the late 1940s, but since the creek eventually dried up, the area was filled with limestone gravel and today there remains no evidence of its existence. The demise of the creek, however, took away the distinction for the classification of a 'cayo' from the venerable western town of 'El Cayo' and returned it to a regular land mass. Geography San Ignacio is situated on the banks of the Macal River, about 63 miles (101 km) west of Belize City and 22 miles (35 km) west of the country's capital: Belmopan. The town has an area of approximately .

San Ignacio also boasts a fairly large Chinese population, most of whom emigrated from Guangzhou in waves in the mid-20th century. The Mennonite community of Spanish Lookout is situated a few miles outside San Ignacio. The 2010 census counted 17,878 inhabitants in San Ignacio and Santa Elena, of whom 8,751 are males and 9,127 are females. The total number of households is 4,351 and the average household size is 4.1. =Santa Elena= In recent years San Ignacio has absorbed the formerly separate village of Santa Elena. San Ignacio and its sister-town Santa Elena make up Belize's second largest urban area. The two towns are connected by Belize's only suspension bridge, the one-lane Hawkesworth Bridge across the Macal river, built in 1949. The two are collectively referred to as the \\"Twin Towns\\" although San Ignacio has a larger population. , Santa Elena has a population of 7,389 compared with San Ignacio's population of 10,489. Government San Ignacio is currently governed by a town council affiliated with the United Democratic Party (UDP). The mayor is Earl Trapp, also of the UDP. Town council elections are held every three years to elect the mayor and council. Both UDP and People's United Party (PUP) candidates participate in town elections. The next municipal elections are scheduled for the year 2020. At the national level, the San Ignacio/Santa Elena area is represented by three constituencies in the Belize House of Representatives, Cayo Central, Cayo North and Cayo North East. Educational institutions San Ignacio has three main colleges. Sacred Heart College of Catholic denomination is the largest institution, with both a high school and a junior college division, and is one of the largest high schools in Belize. Eden Seventh Day Adventist High School and Saint Ignatius High School (Catholic) are also found here. Galen University was founded in 2003 and is located at Central Farm, a couple of minutes east of San Ignacio. The University of Belize also has an agricultural campus next to Galen. Health care The city is served by the San Ignacio Hospital, which is a regional clinic, and the Loma Luz Adventist hospital in Santa Elena. It also has various clinics, doctors and pharmacies scattered around town. Attractions The area around San Ignacio is one of the most popular parts of the country for tourism. Nearby attractions include the ancient Maya ruins of Caracol, Xunantunich, Cahal Pech, and El Pilar. Notable caves to explore include the Actun Tunichil Muknal cave, which includes skeletons, ceramics, and stoneware, and Barton Creek Cave, which is popular among adventure tourists interested in cave canoeing. Also popular among adventure travelers are nature reserves such as the Chaa Creek Nature Reserve, and the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve. A day trip to Mountain Pine Ridge allows visitors to go on several hikes and visit waterfalls, caves, and Maya ruins.

Rationale  Different operating systems handle shared libraries in different ways, and some platforms do not use shared libraries at all. It can be difficult to make a software program portable: the C compiler differs from system to system; certain library functions are missing on some systems; header files may have different names. One way to handle this is to write conditional code, with code blocks selected by means of preprocessor directives (\`#ifdef\`); but because of the wide variety of build environments this approach quickly becomes unmanageable. The GNU build system is designed to address this problem more manageably. Libtool helps manage the creation of static and dynamic libraries on various Unix-like operating systems. Libtool accomplishes this by abstracting the library- creation process, hiding differences between various systems (e.g. Linux systems vs. Solaris). GNU Libtool is designed to simplify the process of compiling a computer program on a new system, by \\"encapsulating both the platform-specific dependencies, and the user interface, in a single script\\".Libtool Manual When porting a program to a new system, Libtool is designed so the porter need not read low-level documentation for the shared libraries to be built, rather just run a configure script (or equivalent).

He was one of the founding fathers of the Romantic movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Early life Tieck was born in Berlin, the son of a rope-maker. His siblings were the sculptor Christian Friedrich Tieck and the poet Sophie Tieck. He was educated at the , where he learned Greek and Latin, as required in most preparatory schools. He also began learning Italian at a very young age, from a grenadier with whom he became acquainted. Through this friendship, Tieck was given a first-hand look at the poor, which could be linked to his work as a Romanticist. He later attended the universities of Halle, G√∂ttingen, and Erlangen. At G√∂ttingen, he studied Shakespeare and Elizabethan drama. On returning to Berlin in 1794, Tieck attempted to make a living by writing. He contributed a number of short stories (1795-98) to the series Straussfedern, published by the bookseller C. F. Nicolai and originally edited by J. K. A. Mus√§us. He also wrote Abdallah (1796) and a novel in letters, William Lovell (3 vols, 1795-96). Adoption of Romanticism Tieck's transition to Romanticism is seen in the series of plays and stories published under the title Volksm√§rchen von Peter Lebrecht (3 vols., 1797), a collection containing the fairy tale Der blonde Eckbert, which blends exploration of the paranoiac mind with the realm of the supernatural, and a witty dramatic satire on Berlin literary taste, Der gestiefelte Kater. With his school and college friend Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773‚Äì1798), he planned the novel Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen (vols. i‚Äìii. 1798), which with Wackenroder's Herzensergiessungen (1796), was the first expression of the Romantic enthusiasm for old German art. In 1798 Tieck married and in the following year settled in Jena, where he, the two brothers August and Friedrich Schlegel, and Novalis were the leaders of the early Romantic school (also known as Jena Romanticism). His writings between 1798 and 1804 include the satirical drama, Prinz Zerbino (1799), and Romantische Dichtungen (2 vols., 1799‚Äì1800). The latter contains Tieck's most ambitious dramatic poems, Leben und Tod der heiligen Genoveva, Leben und Tod des kleinen Rotk√§ppchens, which were followed in 1804 by the \\"comedy\\" in two parts, Kaiser Oktavianus. These dramas are typical plays of the first Romantic school. Although formless and destitute of dramatic qualities, they show the influence of both Calder√≥n and Shakespeare. Kaiser Oktavianus is a poetic glorification of the Middle Ages. In 1801 Tieck went to Dresden, then lived for a time at Ziebingen near Frankfurt, and spent many months in Italy. In 1803 he published a translation of Minnelieder aus der schw√§bischen Vorzeit, then between 1799 and 1804 an excellent version of Don Quixote, and in 1811 two volumes of Elizabethan dramas, Altenglisches Theater. From 1812 to 1817 he collected in three volumes a number of his earlier stories and dramas, under the title Phantasus. In this collection appeared the stories \\"Der Runenberg\\", \\"Die Elfen\\", \\"Der Pokal\\", and the dramatic fairy tale \\"Fortunat\\". In 1817 Tieck visited England in order to collect materials for a work on Shakespeare, which was never finished. In 1819 he settled permanently in Dresden, and from 1825 he was literary adviser to the Court Theatre. His semi-public readings from the dramatic poets gave him a reputation which extended far beyond the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony. The new series of short stories which he began to publish in 1822 also won him a wide popularity. Notable among these are \\"Die Gem√§lde\\", \\"Die Reisenden\\", \\"Die Verlobung\\", and \\"Des Lebens √úberfluss\\". More ambitious and on a wider canvas are the historical or semi-historical novels Dichterleben (1826), Der Aufruhr in den Cevennen (1826, unfinished), and Der Tod des Dichters (1834). Der junge Tischlermeister (1836; but begun in 1811) is a work written under the influence of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister. His story of Vittoria Accorombona (1840) was written in the style of the French Romanticists and shows a falling-off. Later years In later years Tieck carried on a varied literary activity as a critic (Dramaturgische Bl√§tter, 2 vols., 1825‚Äì1826; Kritische Schriften, 2 vols., 1848). He also edited the translation of Shakespeare by August Wilhelm Schlegel, who was assisted by Tieck's daughter Dorothea (1790‚Äì1841) and by Wolf Heinrich, Graf von Baudissin (1789‚Äì1878); Shakespeares Vorschule (2 vols., 1823‚Äì1829); and the works of Heinrich von Kleist (1826) and of Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1828). In 1841 Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia invited Tieck to Berlin, where he received a pension for his remaining years. He died in Berlin on 28 April 1853. Literary significance Tieck's importance lay in the readiness with which he adapted himself to the emerging new ideas which arose at the close of the 18th century, as well as his Romantic works, such as Der blonde Eckbert. His importance in German poetry, however, is restricted to his early period. In later years it was as the helpful friend and adviser of others, or as the well-read critic of wide sympathies, that Tieck distinguished himself. Tieck also influenced Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user. It was from Phantasus that Wagner based the idea of Tannh√§user going to see the Pope and of Elisabeth dying in the song battle. Works Tieck's Schriften appeared in twenty volumes (1828‚Äì1846), and his Gesammelte Novellen in twelve (1852‚Äì1854). Nachgelassene Schriften were published in two volumes in 1855. There are several editions of Ausgew√§hlte Werke by H. Welti (8 vols., 1886‚Äì1888); by J. Minor (in Kirschner's Deutsche Nationalliteratur, 144, 2 vols., 1885); by G. Klee (with an excellent biography, 3 vols., 1892), and G. Witkowski (4 vols., 1903) and Marianne Thalmann (4 vols., 1963‚Äì66). Translations \\"The Elves\\" and \\"The Goblet\\" were translated by Thomas Carlyle in German Romance (1827), \\"The Pictures\\" and \\"The Betrothal\\" by Bishop Thirlwall (1825). A translation of Vittoria Accorombona was published in 1845. A translation of \\"Des Lebens √úberfluss\\" (\\"Life's Luxuries\\", by E. N. Bennett) appeared in German Short Stories in the Oxford University Press World's Classics series in 1934, but the wit of the original comes over more strongly in The Superfluities of Life. A Tale Abridged from Tieck, which appeared anonymously in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in February 1845. The Journey into the Blue Distance (Das Alte Buch: oder Reise ins Blaue hinein, 1834). \\"The Romance of Little Red Riding Hood\\" (1801) was translated by Jack Zipes and included in his book \\"The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood.\\" Influences Tieck's biggest influence was 16th-century Italian poet Torquato Tasso, who is featured in Tieck's novel, Vittoria Accorombona, as a secondary character.

Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content. The first DVD player was created by Sony Corporation in Japan in collaboration with Pacific Digital Company from the United States in 1997. Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996. These predictions were too optimistic. Delivery was initially held up for \\"political\\" reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios, but was later delayed by lack of movie titles. The first players appeared in Japan on November 1, 1996, followed by the United States on March 19, 1997 (a few days earlier than the DVD-Video launch there) with distribution limited to only seven major cities for the first six months. Players slowly trickled into other regions around the world. Prices for the first players in 1997 started at $600 and could top out at prices over $1000. By the end of 2000, players were available for under $100 at discount retailers. In 2003 players became available for under $50. Six years after the initial launch, close to one thousand models of DVD players were available from over a hundred consumer electronics manufacturers. Fujitsu released the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on November 6 in Great Britain. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped computer and a DVD-ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD- ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of DVD-ROM drive and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD-ROM drives. The first DVD-Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999, but they did not play copy-protected discs. Matsushita (under the Panasonic and Technics labels) first released full- fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200. DVD-Audio players are now also made by Aiwa, Denon, JVC, Kenwood, Madrigal, Marantz, Nakamichi, Onkyo, Toshiba, Yamaha, and others. Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000. Pioneer's first DVD-Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD. SACD players are now also made by Accuphase, Aiwa, Denon, Kenwood, Marantz, Philips, Sharp, and others.  Technical details  The interior of a DVD player A DVD player has to complete these tasks: *Read a DVD in ISO ‚Äì UDF version 1.02 format *Optionally decrypt the data with either CSS and/or Macrovision *Read and obey the DVDs Regional lockout codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the DVD *Decode the MPEG-2 video stream with a maximum of 10 Mbit/s (peak) or 8 Mbit/s (continuous) *Decode sound in MP2, PCM or AC-3 format and output (with optional AC-3 to stereo downmixing) on stereo connector, optical or electric digital connector *Output a video signal, either an analog one (in NTSC or PAL format) on the composite, S-Video, SCART, or component video connectors, or a digital one on the DVI or HDMI connectors. *DVD players cannot play Blu-ray discs due to using different wavelength laser's Blu ray use a Blue Violet laser instead of a Red laser. However, all Blu-ray players are \\"backwards compatible\\" and they will play DVDs and some are compatible with CD and other disc formats.  CD/DVD/AVI/MP4 playback  Additionally, most DVD players allow users to play audio CDs (CD-DA, MP3, etc.) and Video CDs (VCD). A few include a home cinema decoder (i.e. Dolby Digital, Digital Theater Systems (DTS)). Some newer devices also play videos in the MPEG-4 ASP video compression format (such as DivX) popular in the Internet.  Portable players  A portable DVD player Most hardware DVD players must be connected to a television; there are portable devices which have an attached LCD screen and stereo speakers. Portable DVD players are often used for long road trips and travel. They often have a plug for the 12 volt power jack in cars. Some models have two screens, so that two people in the back seat can both watch the movie. Other portable DVD players have a single screen that opens up like a laptop computer screen.  Output  Output Due to multiple audio (and video) output devices, there are many outputs on a DVD player, such as an RCA jack, component outputs, and an HDMI output. Consumers may become confused with how to connect a player to a TV or amplifier. Most systems include an optional digital audio connector for this task, which is then paired with a similar input on the amplifier. The physical connection is typically RCA connectors or TOSLINK, which transmits a S/PDIF stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio (PCM) or the original compressed audio data (Dolby Digital, DTS, MPEG audio) to be decoded by the audio equipment. = Video = Video is another issue which continues to present most problems. Early generations of DVD players usually outputted analog video only, via both composite video on an RCA jack and S-Video. However, neither connector was intended to be used for progressive video, and most later players sold then gained another set of connectors, component video, which keeps the three components of the video, luminance and two color differentials, on fully separate wires. This video information is taken directly from the DVD itself. The three components compare well to S-Video, which uses two wires, uniting and degrading the two color signals, and composite, which uses only wire one, uniting and degrading all three signals. The connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models, RCA or BNC, as well as using VGA cables in a non-standard way (VGA is normally analog RGB--a different, incompatible form of component video). Even worse, there are often two sets of component outputs, one carrying interlaced video, and the other progressive, or an interlaced/progressive switch (either a physical switch or a menu setting). In Europe (but not most other PAL areas), SCART connectors are generally used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, but not all DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.) HDMI is a digital connection for carrying high-definition video, similar to DVI. Along with video, HDMI also supports up to eight-channel digital audio. DVD players with connectors for high-definition video can upconvert the source to formats used for higher definition video (e.g., 720p, 1080i, 1080p, etc.), before outputting the signal. By no means, however, will the resulting signal be high-definition video; that is, aside from optional deinterlacing, upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats, foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device. = USB = Some DVD players include a USB video recorder. As well as such, there are also have DVD players with a USB port to be able to play digital media types as well as MP4, MP3, etc. = Wireless = Wireless connections (bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi) are useful to manage (play/record) wirelessly content from or to other devices (i.e. cell phones).  Prices  , retail prices for such a device, depending on its optional features (such as digital sound or video output), start between 30 and 80 USD/Euro. They are usually cheaper than VCRs.  Manufacture  the largest producer of DVD players is China; in 2002 they produced 30 million players, more than 70% of the world output. These producers have to pay US$15‚Äì$20 per player in license fees, to the patent holders of the DVD technology (Sony, Philips, Toshiba and Time Warner) as well as for MPEG-2 licenses. To avoid these fees, China has developed the Enhanced Versatile Disc standard as an intended successor of DVD; , EVD players were only being sold in China.  Software  Software DVD players are programs that allow users to view DVD videos on a computer with a DVD-ROM drive. Some examples are the VLC media player, 5KPlayer and MPlayer (all free software), as well as WinDVD, TotalMedia Theatre, PowerDVD, Fluendo DVD Player and DVD Player. Among others, there are variants & huge kinds of software DVD players as well as multimedia player software which has DVD video playback capability, whether its proprietary-type (as commercial software), freeware, shareware or just a free software are available in the market.  Successors  In the battle to succeed and to improve upon the role of the DVD player as the mainstream medium for stored audiovisual content on optical disc, there were two major contestants: the HD DVD player and the Blu-ray Disc player, utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduced higher resolution video images and more complete audio information than was possible with DVD. On February 19, 2008, Toshiba, creator of the former technology, announced it would cease production on all HD DVD products, leaving Blu-ray as the high definition successor to DVD players. As technology improved, various players were sold, some of which were also Blu-ray players, that could upscale and up-convert DVD content, increasing the overall perceived picture quality.

It may also refer to a computer itself which is primarily or solely used for handling Usenet. Access to Usenet is only available through news server provider. Articles and posts End users often use the term \\"posting\\" to refer to a single message or file posted to Usenet. For articles containing plain text, this is synonymous with an article. For binary content such as pictures and files, it is often necessary to split the content among multiple articles. Typically through the use of numbered Subject: headers, the multiple-article postings are automatically reassembled into a single unit by the newsreader. Most servers do not distinguish between single and multiple- part postings, dealing only at the level of the individual component articles. =Headers and overviews= Each news article contains a complete set of header lines, but in common use the term \\"headers\\" is also used when referring to the News Overview database. The overview is a list of the most frequently used headers, and additional information such as article sizes, typically retrieved by the client software using the NNTP \`XOVER\` command. Overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form. If non- overview headers are required, such as for when using a kill file, it may still be necessary to use the slower method of reading all the complete article headers. Many clients are unable to do this, and limit filtering to what is available in the summaries. News server attributes Among the operators and users of commercial news servers, common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects. Completion (the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic), retention (the amount of time articles are made available to readers) and overall system performance. With the increasing demands, it is common for the transit and reader server roles to be subdivided further into numbering, storage and front end systems. These server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders, and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service. = Speed = Speed, in relation to Usenet, is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user. The server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks. How fast the data can move throughout this farm is the first thing that affects the speed of delivery. The speed of data traveling throughout the farm can be severely bottlenecked through hard drive operations. Retrieving the article and overview information can cause massive stress on hard drives. To combat this, caching technology and cylindrical file storage systems have been developed. Once the farm is able to deliver the data to the network, then the provider has limited control over the speed to the user. Since the network path to each user is different, some users will have good routes and the data will flow quickly. Other users will have overloaded routers between them and the provider which will cause delays. About all a provider can do in that case is try moving the traffic through a different route. If the ISP has limited connectivity to the network, routing changes may have little effect. Frequently a user can reduce the impact of network problems by using multiple connections. Some servers allow as many as 60 simultaneous connections, but this varies widely based on the provider. =Article sizes= Article sizes are limited to what each news server will accept. The larger the article size, the more space it occupies, and thus the fewer articles on each server. This generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server, but gives less articles for users to access. =Retention= Retention is simply defined as how long the server keeps articles. Historically, most users want retention to be long enough so that they don't need to access the server every day but not overly long retention that can overwhelm users with slow computers or network connections. In the modern era, high speed connections, large storage capacity, and advanced search tools allows users to utilize extensive retention without any drawbacks. Retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles, though it may also vary between different groups within these categories. The times vary greatly according to the amount of storage available on the servers and continually increasing traffic. As of 2009, it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days. Large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more. It's important to understand that retention time varies between different newsgroups within the text and binary categories. Omicron's HW Media is currently the Usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention, while Google is the Usenet server with the highest amount of text retention. It can be difficult for end users to accurately measure the retention of a server. One common method is to examine the oldest articles in a group and examine the date, but this is not always accurate. Some articles in a group may be retained for longer than others, articles from remote servers do not always arrive promptly, and at times the date headers are simply incorrect. A sampling of many or all articles, preferably in more than one newsgroup, is required to detect such anomalies. News servers do not have unlimited storage, and due to this fact they can only hold posts for a length of time before they must delete them in order to make room for new posts. This is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles. For news servers provided by Internet Service Providers as part of a user's subscription package, typical retention rates are usually only 2‚Äì4 days. To deal with the increase of Usenet traffic, many providers turn to a hybrid system, in which old articles not found on the provider's server will request the article from another server with longer retention. =Completion= Given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles, their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed. The term \\"completion\\" is used to describe how well a service is keeping up with the traffic. The primary obstacle to calculating the completion percentage is how many articles were posted. Looking at only one server, one cannot know how many articles were actually inserted throughout the network. Articles may never make their way outside the originating server, or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud. Very large articles are frequently dropped, and tend to propagate less well than smaller ones. One way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles. Because Message-ID: headers are nominally unique throughout the network, comparison of the lists is mostly a straightforward task. Practical limitations to this type of measurement include the impossibility of obtaining lists from all servers worldwide, the fact that many servers filter out spam or employ Usenet Death Penalties, and that some servers mask incompletion by hiding multipart binary sets with missing articles. It is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server, or it may have been present but already expired. News server operation =Peering= All Usenet servers peer with one or more other servers in order to exchange articles. Occasionally, new servers appear. Although there are several web resources which may aid in finding peers, a better resource is the newsgroup news.admin.peering (Google Groups portal). As of 2020, text feeds can usually be attained for free, while full binary feeds can be free or paid (depending on how many articles each server sends to the other). Due to the large amount of data in a full binary+text Usenet feed (can be high as 30 terabytes a day) and the high costs of transmitting that data through an IP transit provider like Cogent, Telia, or Zayo, most Usenet providers will only engage in binary peering when they are interconnected at an Internet exchange like AMS-IX, SIX, or DeCIX. =Spools= When the server stores the body of an article, it places it in a disk storage area generically called a \\"spool\\". There are several common ways in which the spool may be organized: *One file per article is the oldest storage scheme, still in common use on smaller servers and replicated in many clients. Its performance capability is a direct function of the underlying operating system's ability to create, remove and locate files within a directory, and often this scheme is insufficient to keep up with modern Usenet traffic. It does, however, allow for the greatest flexibility in managing the amount and location of storage used by the server. Nearly all current software using this scheme stores articles using the B News 2.10 layout. *Cyclical storage has been in increasingly common use since the 1990s. In this storage method, articles are appended serially to large indexed container files. When the end of the file is reached, new articles are written at the beginning of the file, overwriting the oldest entries. On some servers, this overwriting is not performed, but instead new container files are created as older ones are deleted. The major advantages of this system include predictable storage requirements if an overwriting scheme is employed, and some freedom from dependency on the underlying performance of the operating system. There is, however, less flexibility to retain articles by age rather than space used, and traditional text manipulation tools such as grep are less well suited to analyzing these files. Some degree of article longevity control can be exercised by directing subsets of the newsgroups to specific sets of container files. *In some cases, a relational database or similar is used to contain the spool. This is most commonly seen with Internet forum software that also offers an NNTP interface. *Some servers, such as INN, allow multiple storage schemes to be used at once. Various hybrid storage schemes have also been used in news servers, including different organizations of the file-per-article method, or smaller containers carrying perhaps 100 articles apiece. Types of Servers A reader server provides an interface to read and post articles, generally with the assistance of a news client. A transit server exchanges articles with other servers. Most servers can provide both functions. =Transit server= Modern transit servers usually use NNTP to exchange news continually over the Internet and similar always-on connections. In the past, servers normally employed the UUCP protocol, which was designed for intermittent dial-up connections. Other ad hoc protocols, including e-mail, are less commonly seen. News servers normally connect with multiple peers, with the redundancy helping to spread loads and ensure that articles are not lost. Smaller sites, called leaf nodes, are connected to one other major server. Articles are routed based on information found in the header lines defined in RFC 1036. Of particular interest to a transit server are: *Message- ID - a globally unique key *Newsgroups - a list of one or more newsgroups where the article is intended to appear *Distribution - (optional) a supplement to Newsgroups, used to restrict circulation of articles. *Date - the time when the article was created *Path - a list of the servers an article passed through on its way to the local server *Expires - (optional) the time when it is requested that the article be deleted *Approved - (optional) indicates an article that has been accepted for a moderated newsgroup *Control - (optional) contains command requests In most cases, the sending server controls the article transfer process. It compares the Newsgroups and Distribution of each newly arrived article against a set of patterns called newsfeeds, listing each remote server and the newsgroups its operator wishes to receive. Some senders also examine the Path; if the receiving server appears in this line, it is not offered. Other local rules may also be added. The sender transmits matching articles' Message-IDs to the receiving server. The receiver indicates which Message-IDs it has not yet stored locally, and those articles are sent. The receiving server examines the incoming articles. A message is normally discarded if the Message-ID is duplicated by an article already received (i.e., another server sent it in the meantime), the Date or Expires lines indicate that the article is too old, the header syntax appears to be invalid, the Approved header is missing for a moderated newsgroup, or additional local rules disallow it. Most servers also maintain a list of active newsgroups. If the Newsgroups header of a new article does not match the active list, it may be discarded or placed in a special \\"junk\\" newsgroup. Once the article is stored, the server attempts to retransmit it to any servers in its own newsfeed list. Articles with Control lines are given special handling. They are typically filed in special \\"control\\" newsgroups and may cause the server to automatically carry out exceptional actions. The \`newgroup\` and \`rmgroup\` commands can cause newsgroups to be created or removed; \`checkgroups\` can be used to reconcile the local active list with a commonly accepted set; and \`cancel\` commands are used to request the deletion of a specific article. \`ihave\` and \`sendme\` are sometimes used with UUCP to transmit lists of offered and wanted Message-IDs. Other commands (\`version\`, \`sendsys\`, and \`uuname\`) are requests for server configuration details. Once used to create network maps, they now are generally obsolete. =Reader server= A reader server is one that makes the articles available in the hierarchical disk directory format originated by B News 2.10, or offers the NNTP or IMAP commands, for use by newsreaders. A reader server typically also works as a transit server, but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an Internet forum. When receiving news, this type of server must perform the additional steps of filing articles into newsgroups and assigning sequential numbers within each group. An Xref line is usually added, listing all the groups where the message appears and the sequence numbers. Unlike Message IDs, the numbers and ordering of articles will differ on each server; but related servers may force agreement by operating in a slave mode, re-using their siblings' Xref lines. Reader servers typically also maintain a News Overview (NOV) database that allows newsreaders to quickly obtain message summaries and present messages in threaded form. Most reader servers support posting, either through NNTP or a special inews program. When an article is posted, the process is much the same as when a transit server receives news, but with additional checks. For posting, the server will normally fill in missing Path and Message-ID lines and check the syntax of headers intended for human readers, such as From and Subject. If the article is posted to a moderated group, the server will attempt to mail it to the newsgroup moderator if the Approved header is absent. Additional identity checks and filters are also typically applied at this point. =Hybrid or cache server= Smaller sites with limited network bandwidth may operate \\"sucking\\" or cache servers. These perform the same reader server role as conventional news servers, but themselves act as newsreaders to exchange articles with other reader servers. Hybrid servers allow greater flexibility for the server operator in that received groups can be adjusted without manual intervention by operators. They may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding. Because hybrid servers usually use the posting function to send news, article headers are reformatted by the posting function and tracing information can be lost. Also, the delayed sucking process can result in excess activity on the remote reader servers. For these reasons, the use of hybrid servers is often discouraged or disallowed without prior agreement.

It allows patients to undergo surgical and dental procedures with reduced pain and distress. In many situations, such as cesarean section, it is safer and therefore superior to general anesthesia. The following terms are often used interchangeably: * Local anesthesia, in a strict sense, is anesthesia of a small part of the body such as a tooth or an area of skin. * Regional anesthesia is aimed at anesthetizing a larger part of the body such as a leg or arm. * Conduction anesthesia encompasses a great variety of local and regional anesthetic techniques. Medical A local anesthetic is a drug that causes reversible local anesthesia and a loss of nociception. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (nerve block), effects such as analgesia (loss of pain sensation) and paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved. Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not act on the sympathoadrenergic system, i.e. they do not produce hypertension or local vasoconstriction, with the exception of Ropivacaine and Mepivacaine that do produce weak vasoconstriction. Unlike other forms of anesthesia, a local can be used for a minor procedure in a surgeon's office as it does not put you into a state of unconsciousness. However, the physician should have a sterile environment available before doing a procedure in their office. Local anesthetics vary in their pharmacological properties and they are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as: * Topical anesthesia (surface) - Similar to topical gel numbing before getting injected with Lidocaine. * Infiltration * Plexus block Adverse effects depend on the local anesthetic method and site of administration discussed in depth in the local anesthetic sub-article, but overall, adverse effects can be: #localized prolonged anesthesia or paresthesia due to infection, hematoma, excessive fluid pressure in a confined cavity, and severing of nerves & support tissue during injection. #systemic reactions such as depressed CNS syndrome, allergic reaction, vasovagal episode, and cyanosis due to local anesthetic toxicity. #lack of anesthetic effect due to infectious pus such as an abscess. Non- medical local anesthetic techniques Local pain management that uses other techniques than analgesic medication include: *Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, which has been found to be ineffective for lower back pain, however, it might help with diabetic neuropathy. *Pulsed radiofrequency, neuromodulation, direct introduction of medication and nerve ablation may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent nociception or the nociceptors from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain.

It was the first news server with integrated NNTP functionality. While previous servers processed articles individually or in batches, innd is a single continuously running process that receives articles from the network, files them, and records what remote hosts should receive them. Readers can access articles directly from the disk in the same manner as B News and C News, but an included program, called nnrpd, also serves newsreaders that employ NNTP. A later improvement was the Cyclical News Filesystem (CNFS), which sequentially stores articles in large on-disk buffers. This method, implemented by Scott Fritchie, greatly increased performance by eliminating the operating system overhead needed to deal with thousands of individual article files. James Brister's innfeed program was also added to the package. Like innd, innfeed operates continuously to feed articles out to other servers, while the earlier innxmit processed them in batches. This combination allows articles to be received and redistributed with virtually no latency, and has substantially changed the nature of Usenet interaction by reducing the time for messages to be posted, read across the network and answered, from hours or days, to seconds or minutes. A similar earlier program, called nntplink, provided a comparable function, but it was produced independently. INN is under active development .

He is a Member of Honour of the International Music Council. Family He is the grandson of Cuban composer Ernestina Lecuona y Casado. His great-uncle, Ernesto Lecuona, composed \\"La Malague√±a\\" and his second cousin, Margarita Lecuona, composed \\"Babal√∫\\", which was popularized by Cuban musician and actor Desi Arnaz. Music career =Early years= Brouwer was born in Havana. When he was 13, he began classical guitar with the encouragement of his father, who was an amateur guitarist. His teacher was Isaac Nicola, who was a student of Emilio Pujol, who was himself a student of Francisco T√°rrega. At age 17 he performed publicly for the first time and began composing. Brouwer went to the United States to study music at the Hartt College of Music of the University of Hartford, and later at the Juilliard School, where he studied under Vincent Persichetti and took composition classes with Stefan Wolpe. In 1970 Brouwer played in the premiere of El Cimarr√≥n by Hans Werner Henze in Berlin. Together with Morton Feldman, he was awarded a 1972 scholarship by the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and to work as a guest composer and lecturer at the Academy of Science and Arts of Berlin. In Germany Brouwer also recorded a number of LPs for Deutsche Grammophon. =Composing and performing= In his early compositions, Brouwer remained close to the rhythms of Cuban music, while later he was drawn to aleatoric music. During the 1960s and 70s, he became interested in the music of modernist composers such as Luigi Nono and Iannis Xenakis, using indeterminacy in works such as Sonograma I. Other works from this period include the guitar pieces Canticum (1968), La espiral eterna (1971), Par√°bola (1973) and Tarantos (1974). More recently, Brouwer's works have leaned towards tonality and modality. The solo guitar works El Decamer√≥n Negro (1981), Paisaje cubano con campanas (1986), and the Sonata (1990; for Julian Bream) exemplify this tendency. His playing career ended in the early 1980s due to an injury to a tendon in his right hand middle finger. Brouwer has written for guitar, piano, and percussion, and has composed orchestral works, ballet, and music for over one hundred movies, including the film Like Water for Chocolate. For a guitar competition in Hungary in 1979, he wrote a composition that employed 200 guitarists. He is known for a series of studies called the Etudes Simples. Brouwer has also transcribed Beatles songs for classical guitar. He has performed and recorded works by Sylvano Bussotti, Hans Werner Henze, Maurice Ohana, Crist√≥bal Halffter, Leni Alexander, Cornelius Cardew, and Heitor Villa-Lobos.Rara Recording by Leo Brouwer =Other activities= He has been a conductor for many symphony orchestras, including the BBC Concert Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Cordoba Symphony in Spain. Brouwer is involved in the Concurso y Festival Internacional de Guitarra de la Habana (Havana International Guitar Festival and Competition). He frequently travels to attend guitar festivals throughout the world, and especially to other Latin American countries. Brouwer is a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, and has held a number of official posts in Cuba, including with the music department of the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry. Brouwer is the great-uncle of Al Jourgensen of Ministry fame. Brouwer is the brother of Jourgensen's maternal grandfather.

Played by professional musicians called klezmorim in ensembles known as kapelye, the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924,Hankus Netsky, \\"American Klezmer: A Brief History\\" from American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots Ed. Mark Slobin, p.13 came into contact with American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, the American sub- variety was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the 21st century musicians began paying more attention to the original pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Joel Rubin, Yale Strom and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, later immigrants from the Soviet Union, such as German Goldenshtayn, took their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s. Compared with most other European folk-music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it remains uncertain. There is, however, a heavy influence of Romani music, since many Jews and Roma lived side by side in Europe.Mark Slobin, Fiddler on the Move. p.93. Popular musician Leonard Cohen composed many songs which had quite a following where the Klezmer style was evident. Songs such as \\"Dance me to the end of love\\" rely heavily on a violin but also have chord structures that feel Jewish, Eastern European, Romanian, Romani, or Greek in flavor or sound. Some aspects of these Klezmer-feeling Cohen compositions, as rendered, were surely modern in some of the instruments used, but the distinctive Jewish Klezmer feel shines through, and arguably, these numbers by Cohen are the most widely-heard examples of Klezmer music in the modern era due to Cohen's prolific multi- generational appeal and status as a popular poet-songwriter-singer who was very popular on several continents in the Western World from the 1960s until his death in 2016. Etymology The term klezmer comes from a combination of Hebrew words: klei, meaning \\"tools, utensils or instruments of\\" and zemer, \\"melody\\"; leading to k'lei zemer , literally \\"instruments of music\\" or \\"musical instruments\\". Originally, klezmer referred to musical instruments, and was later extended to refer, as a pejorative, to musicians themselves. From the 16th to 18th centuries, it replaced older terms such as leyts (clown). It was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre. Early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as \\"Yiddish\\" music, although it is also sometimes called Freilech music (Yiddish, literally \\"Happy music\\"). The first recordings to use the term \\"klezmer\\" to refer to the music were The Klezmorim's East Side Wedding and Streets of Gold in 1977/78, followed by Andy Statman and Zev Feldman's Jewish Klezmer Music in 1979. Style Klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies, reminiscent of the human voice, complete with laughing and weeping. This is not a coincidence; the style is meant to imitate khazone and paraliturgical singing. A number of dreydlekh (a Yiddish word for musical ornaments), such as krekhts (\\"sobs\\") are used to produce this style. Various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music. Perhaps the strongest and most enduring is Romani music. Klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional Romani music, which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire (e.g., Horas, Doinas, Sirbas, and Bulgars) History Klezmer musicians at a wedding, Ukraine, ca. 1925 The Bible has several descriptions of orchestras and Levites making music, but after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, many Rabbis discouraged musical instruments. However, the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished, and musicians came forth to fill that niche, klezmorim. The first klezmer known by name was Yakobius ben Yakobius, a player of the aulos in Samaria in the 2nd century CE. The earliest written record of the klezmorim is in the 15th century. It is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century Bessarabia, where the bulk of today's traditional repertoire was written. Klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue, in particular cantorial music. Even so, klezmorim‚Äîalong with other entertainers‚Äîwere typically looked down on by Rabbis because of their secular traveling lifestyle. Klezmorim often travelled and played with Romani musicians (\\"lƒÉutari\\"), because they occupied similar social strata. They had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically (the extensive klezmer argot in Yiddish includes some Romani borrowings). Josef Gusikov Klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire, but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer. They sometimes played for Christian churches and local aristocracy, and taught some Italian classical violin virtuosos. Like other professional musicians, klezmorim were often limited by authorities. In Ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments, until the 19th century. Hence musicians took up the violin, tsimbl (or cymbalom), and other stringed instruments. The first musician to play klezmer in European concerts, Josef Gusikov, played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a \\"wood and straw instrument\\". It was laid out like a cymbalom, and attracted comments from Felix Mendelssohn (highly favourable) and Liszt (condemnatory). Later, around 1855 under the reign of Alexander II of Russia, Ukraine permitted loud instruments. The clarinet started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice. Also, a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands. As Jews left Eastern Europe and the shtetls (see a related article about the artist Chaim Goldberg, who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings), klezmer spread throughout the globe, to the United States as well as to Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Initially, the klezmer tradition was not maintained much by U.S. Jews. In the 1920s, clarinetists Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein caused a brief, influential revival, but Hankus Netsky has noted that \\"few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim, and the term is found nowhere in any Jewish instrumental recording of the time.\\"American Klezmer p.16-17 (The soprano Isa Kremer was a popular exponent of Yiddish song internationally during the first half of the 20th century; notably making several recordings with Columbia Records and appearing often at Carnegie Hall and other major venues in the U.S. from 1922-1950.) As U.S. Jews began to adopt mainstream culture, the popularity of klezmer waned, and Jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-Jewish music. While traditional performances may have been on the decline, many Jewish composers who had mainstream success, such as Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth (as Gustav Mahler had been). George Gershwin was familiar with klezmer music, and the opening clarinet glissando of Rhapsody in Blue suggests this influence, although the composer did not compose klezmer directly. Some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer, as can the \\"freilach swing\\" playing of other Jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter Ziggy Elman. At the same time, non- Jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material. Dmitri Shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life, and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces, the Piano Quintet in G minor, op. 57 (1940), the Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, op. 67 (1944), and the String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, op. 110 (1960). The Klezmatics, an American klezmer band In the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the United States and Europe, led by Giora Feidman, The Klezmorim, Zev Feldman, Andy Statman, and the Klezmer Conservatory Band. They drew their repertoire from recordings and surviving musicians of U.S. klezmer. In 1985, Henry Sapoznik and Adrienne Cooper founded KlezKamp to teach klezmer and other Yiddish music. The 1980s saw a second wave of revival, as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments, largely with non-Jews of the United States and Germany. Musicians began to track down older European klezmer, by listening to recordings, finding transcriptions, and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in Eastern Europe. Key performers in this style are Joel Rubin, Budowitz, Khevrisa, Di Naye Kapelye, Yale Strom, The Chicago Klezmer Ensemble, The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, the violinists Alicia Svigals, Steven Greenman, Cookie Segelstein and Elie Rosenblatt, flutist Adrianne Greenbaum, and tsimbl player Pete Rushefsky. Other artists like Yale Strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in Central and Eastern Europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions, as well as incorporating the Rom (Roma) music element into the Jewish style. Bands like Brave Old World, Hot Pstromi and The Klezmatics also emerged during this period. Klezmer musicians in Jerusalem In the 1990s, musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory. Clarinetist Ben Goldberg and drummer Kenny Wollesen, after playing in Bay Area-based The Klezmorim, formed the critically acclaimed New Klezmer Trio‚Äîkicking open the door for radical experiments with Ashkenazi music and paving the way for John Zorn's Masada, Naftule's Dream, Don Byron's Mickey Katz project and violinist Daniel Hoffman's klezmer/jazz/Middle-Eastern fusion band Davka. The New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of New Orleans funk, jazz, and klezmer styles. Interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as John Zorn and Don Byron, who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz. Klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave Ska band Streetlight Manifesto. Singer/songwriter Tomas Kalnoky frequently slips in horn licks with Russian and Jewish origins. The Jerusalem Klezmer Association with Ultra Orthodox Jewish musicians are playing Klezmer music Mames Babegenush was formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2004 out of strong Scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer, influenced on the klezmer side by masters like Naftule Brandwein, Abe Schwartz and Dave Tarras. Today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer, pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide. The band's most recent album Mames Babegenush With Strings (2017) was warmly received with 5-6 stars reviews in such magazines as Songlines and fRoots. Starting in 2008, \\"The Other Europeans\\" project, funded by several EU cultural institutions, spent a year doing intensive field research in Moldavia under the leadership of Alan Bern and scholar Zev Feldman. They wanted to explore klezmer and lautari roots, and fuse the music of the two \\"other European\\" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally. As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & Hot Pstromi have incorporated Rom musicians and elements since their inceptions. A separate klezmer tradition had developed in Israel in the 20th century. Clarinetists Moshe Berlin and Avrum Leib Burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in Israel. In order to preserve and promote klezmer music in Israel, Burstein founded the Jerusalem Klezmer Association, which has become a center for learning and performance of Klezmer music in the country. Repertoire According to Walter Zev Feldman, the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of Jewish settlement in the Russian Empire.\\"Bulgareasca/Bulgarish/Bulgar: The Transformation of a Klezmer Dance Genre\\" by Walter Zev Feldman in American Klezmer p.84 Much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition, and much co-territorial music such as non-Jewish folksongs, especially Romanian music (mainly from Moldavia), as well as Ukrainian music and Ottoman music, and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as Jews in Southeastern Europe such as Crimean Tatars. Historically, young klezmorim learned tunes from their family and their elders in bands. However, there were several times in history where this transmission broke down, including mass emigration, but especially the Holocaust, which destroyed most of Jewish life and culture in Europe. Few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in Europe, one notable exception being Leopold Kozlowski of Poland. Undoubtedly, much has been lost of the repertoires played in various locations and social contexts‚Äîespecially wedding repertoire, since although Jewish weddings could last several days, early recording technology could only capture a few minutes at a time. Also, recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region. A few older klezmorim‚Äîsuch as Leon Schwartz, Dave Tarras, and German Goldenshtayn‚Äîsurvived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire. Also, some transcriptions survive from the 19th century. Some ethnomusicological work from Jewish Eastern Europe is still available in print, notably the work of Soviet Jewish field researcher Moshe Beregovski. In the 21st century, klezmer is typically learned from \\"fake books\\" and transcriptions of old recordings, although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear. Song types Most klezmer pieces are for dancing to, from fast to slow tempo: * Freylekhs (also Bulgar, bulgarish ‚Äì literally \\"Bulgarian\\", volekhl/vulekhl ‚Äì literally \\"Wallachian\\", or \\"Romanian\\") is an (divided ) circle dance, usually in the Ahava Rabboh melodic mode. Typically piano, accordion, or bass plays a duple oompah beat. These are by far the most popular klezmer dances. The name \\"Bulgar\\" (Yiddish \\"bulgarish\\") comes from the Romanian traditional song and dance (Romanian bulgareascƒÉ). \\"Freylekh\\" is the Yiddish word for \\"festive.\\" * Sher is a set dance in . It is one of the most common klezmer dances. Its name comes from the straight-legged, quick movements of the legs, reminiscent of the shears (Yiddish: sher) of tailors. * Khosidl, or khusidl, named after the Hasidic Jews who danced it, is a more dignified embellished dance in or . The dance steps can be performed in a circle or in a line. * Hora or zhok is a Romanian- style dance in a hobbling time with beats on 1 and 3, and is even more embellished. The Israeli hora derives its roots from the Romanian hora. The Yiddish name zhok comes from the Romanian term joc (literally \\"dance\\") * Kolomeike is a fast and catchy dance in time, which originated in Ukraine, and is prominent in the folk music of that country. * Terkish is a dance like the habanera. Terk in America is one famous arrangement by Naftule Brandwein, who used this form extensively. As its name indicates, it recalls Turkish styles. * Skotshne (\\"hopping\\") could be an instrumental display piece, but also a dance piece, like a more elaborate freylekhs. * Nigun means \\"melody\\" in both Yiddish and Hebrew, a mid-paced song in . * Waltzes were very popular, whether classical, Russian, or Polish. A padespan was a sort of Russian/Spanish waltz known to klezmers. * Mazurka and polka, Polish and Czech dances, respectively, were often played for both Jews and Gentiles. * Sirba ‚Äì a Romanian dance in or (Romanian s√¢rbƒÉ). It features hopping steps and short bursts of running, accompanied by triplets in the melody. * Humoresque \\"Halaka\\" dance, a traditional Israeli dance from Safed in Galilee; it has an ancient melody handed down from generation to generation. * Tango ‚Äì well-known dance that originated in Argentina. These were extremely popular around the world in the 1930s, and many Eastern European tangos were originally written by Jews. Types not designed for dance are: * Doina is an improvisational lament usually performed solo, and is extremely important in weddings. Its basis is the Romanian shepherd's lament, so it has an expressive vocal quality, like the singing of the khazn. Although it has no form, it is not just random sounds in a Jewish mode‚Äîthe musician works with very particular references to Jewish prayer and East European laments. Often these references might occur in the form of harmonic movements or modal maneuvers that quote or otherwise invoke traditional Jewish cantorial practices. Typically it is performed on violin, cymbalom or clarinet, though it has been done on banjo, xylophone, flute, cornet, saxophone, tuba, and many other instruments. Often the doina is the first of a three-part set, followed by a hora, then either a freylekhs or khusidl. One can even hear recordings of contemporary vocalists singing the doina, including Michael Alpert and Elizabeth Schwartz. * Taksim is a freeform prelude that introduces the motifs of the following piece, which is usually a freylekhs; it was largely supplanted by the doina. * Fantazi or fantasy is a freeform song, traditionally played at Jewish weddings to the guests as they dined. It resembles the fantasia of \\"light\\" classical music. Song structure Most klezmer tunes are in several sections, sometimes with each in a different key. Many songs have alternating sections with major and minor keys. Klezmer music often uses \\"folk scales,\\" or scales commonly found in folk music, such as the harmonic minor and phrygian dominant. Instrumental tunes often follow the types of chord progressions found in Middle Eastern and Greek music, whereas vocal Yiddish songs are often much simpler, and follow a style and chord progressions similar to Russian folk songs. Freylekhs are often in the form ABCB, which is rare in music. Having a third distinct section is a relatively unique aspect of klezmer music. A common ending for songs is an upwards chromatic run or glissando, followed by a slow staccato 8-5-1. They may also end with a Coda, a new melodic line that is accompanied by a change in the percussion rhythm and an increase in tempo. Orchestration Klezmorim in Rohatyn, Galicia, Austria-Hungary, 1912 Klezmer is generally instrumental, although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the badkhn (wedding entertainer). A typical 19th-century European orchestra included a first violin, a contra-violin (or modified 3-stringed viola also called Groyse Fidl [Yid. Big Fiddle], Sekund, Kontra or Zsid√≥ Bratsch [Hun.]), a tsimbl (cimbalom or hammered dulcimer), a bass or cello, and sometimes a flute. Other instruments such as a piano or an accordion are used too. The melody is generally assigned to the lead violin, while the other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer. The clarinet now often played the melody. Brass instruments‚Äîsuch as the French valved cornet and keyed German trumpet‚Äîeventually inherited a counter-voice role. Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras. The orchestration used by Joel Rubin‚Äîone of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians‚Äîrepresents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of Romania and Hungary.Tobias Shklover, A talk with the master-musician Joel Rubin (in Yiddish). Forverts, No. 31 (387) of the 5th of April, 2002 Percussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal‚Äîno more than a wood block or snare drum. The snare drum is the more \\"authentic\\" of the two. Wood blocks were introduced by modern klezmorim to imitate recordings from the early 20th century that replaced snare drums‚Äîwhich tended to overwhelm the recording equipment of the time‚Äîwith quieter instruments. In Eastern Europe, percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum, or poyk, sometimes called baraban. A poyk is similar to a bass drum and often has a cymbal or piece of metal mounted on top, which is struck by a beater or a small cymbal strapped to the hand. In Bulgaria, Serbia, and Macedonia, sometimes the paykler (drummer) also played in the tapan style, i.e., with a switch in one hand on a thin tight head, and a mallet in the other, on a thicker, looser head. The Amsterdam Klezmer Band performing in Cologne, Germany Some klezmer revival bands look to loud- instrument klezmer, jazz, and Dixieland for inspiration. Their bands are similar to a typical jazz band, with some differences. They use a clarinet, saxophone, or trumpet for the melody, and make great use of the trombone for slides and other flourishes. When a cymbalom sound is called for, a piano may be played. There is usually a brass instrument ensemble, and sometimes a tuba substitutes for bass. Performers in this style include The Klezmorim, The Klezmatics, The Klezmer Conservatory Band, and The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. Other bands look back to different eras or regions in an effort to recreate specific styles of klezmer‚Äîfor example, Budowitz, the Chicago Klezmer Band, Veretski Pass, Di Naye Kapelye, and the Hungarian band Muzsikas with its album Maramoros: the Lost Jewish Music of Transylvania. \\"New Orleans Klezmer All Stars\\" band in the Krewe du Vieux parade Klezmer instrument choices were traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several parts of the wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved from town to town for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by a neck or shoulder strap (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano). In America, this trend has continued into the present day, with hand-held or strap-held instruments like guitars, saxophones, and even harmonicas integrated into klezmer ensembles. For example, the typical American klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer, not a piano. The compositions of Israeli-born composer Ofer Ben- Amots incorporate aspects of klezmer music, most notably his 2006 composition Klezmer Concerto. The piece is for klezmer clarinet (written for Jewish clarinetist David Krakauer), string orchestra, harp and percussion. Time In its historic form, klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing. Hence, musicians adjusted the tempo as dancers tired or better dancers joined in. Tunes could drag to a near-halt during a particularly sad part, picking up slowly, and eventually bursting into happy song again. (This is also a feature of many Rom and Russian folk songs.) Like other musicians of their time, and many modern jazz performers, early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat. Often they slightly led or trailed it, giving a lilting sound. Melodic modes Klezmer is usually played in shteygerim, prayer modes of the synagogue. They are closely related to Greek, Turkish, and other \\"co- territorial\\" modes of Southeastern and Central Europe. The following are the names of these modes; the names are taken from the names of familiar prayers that use that mode (imagine an American composer referring to a piece as \\"a Grand Old Flag\\" instead of as \\"a march\\"). =Ahava Rabboh/Freygish= Ahavo Rabboh means \\"Abounding Love\\" in Hebrew, and refers to a prayer from the daily morning prayer service (shacharis). It is built on the 5th degree of the harmonic minor scale, with a descending tetrachord to the tonic being the most characteristic final cadence. It is also called the \\"Freygish\\", a Yiddish term derived from the German \\"Phrygisch\\", or Phrygian mode (specifically, the Phrygian dominant scale). It is considered the mode of supplication. Conversely, it can be thought of as a natural minor scale with lowered 2nd, and augmented 3rd degrees. It is similar to the Arabic Hijaz maqam. Much of klezmer music uses the Ahavah Rabboh scale (such as Nigun Rikud, Tish Nigun and numerous freylekhs), although Mi Sheberach is prevalent as well. =Mi Shebeirach= Mi Shebeirach means \\"He who blessed\\" in Hebrew, from the Mi Shebeirach prayer, recited after the honor of being called to the Torah reading. It is also called the Ukrainian, Altered Ukrainian, Doina, or Altered Dorian. It is similar to the natural minor scale, but has raised fourth and sixth scale degrees, and is used often for the doina or dance pieces, like the Odessa Bulgar. When used in combination with the Ahavoh Rabboh scale in the same piece (as in Mayn Shtetl Yas), the Mi Shebeirach section is usually a whole tone below the Ahavoh Rabboh scale (for example, D Ahavoh Rabboh changes to C Mi Shebeirach or vice versa). =Adoyn-y Moloch= Adoyn-y Moloch means \\"my Lord reigns\\" in Hebrew. It is common in traditional synagogue services (they are the beginning words of many of the Psalms). It is similar to the Western Mixolydian mode and can be thought of as a major scale with a lowered 7th, which is sometimes raised at cadences, but is generally avoided altogether. =Mogen Ovoys= Mogen Ovoys means \\"our forebears' shield\\" in Hebrew. It is an older mode from the synagogue, derived from the Friday night prayers. It is similar to the Western melodic minor scale. =Yishtabach= Yishtabach means \\"it shall become superb\\" in Hebrew (from the daily morning services). It has a frequent lowering of the 2nd and 5th. It is related to Mogein Ovoys, above. Film * Yidl Mitn Fidl (1936), directed by Joseph Green * Oliver!

Scientific citation is providing detailed reference in a scientific publication, typically a paper or book, to previous published (or occasionally private) communications which have a bearing on the subject of the new publication. The purpose of citations in original work is to allow readers of the paper to refer to cited work to assist them in judging the new work, source background information vital for future development, and acknowledge the contributions of earlier workers. Citations in, say, a review paper bring together many sources, often recent, in one place. To a considerable extent the quality of work, in the absence of other criteria, is judged on the number of citations received, adjusting for the volume of work in the relevant topic. While this is not necessarily a reliable measure, counting citations is trivially easy; judging the merit of complex work can be very difficult. Previous work may be cited regarding experimental procedures, apparatus, goals, previous theoretical results upon which the new work builds, theses, and so on. Typically such citations establish the general framework of influences and the mindset of research, and especially as \\"part of what science\\" it is, and to help determine who conducts the peer review. Disciplined citation of prior works in mathematics and science is known at least as far back as Euclid. Late in the first millennium, Islamic scholars developed their practice of isnad, or \\"backing\\", which established the validity of sayings of Muhammad in the hadith. The Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy extended this into fiqh or jurisprudence, while the Mutazilite school used the traditional methods and applied them to science. In some form, then, achieving authority for new work by citing accepted authorities is a near-universal idea among the peoples of the Mediterranean, whose educated people were exposed to one or other of these practices well before the European Renaissance and the emergence of the formal scientific method. Patent references In patent law the citation of previous works, or prior art, helps establish the uniqueness of the invention being described. The focus in this practice is to claim originality for commercial purposes, and so the author is motivated to avoid citing works that cast doubt on its originality. Thus this does not appear to be \\"scientific\\" citation. Inventors and lawyers have a legal obligation to cite all relevant art; not to do so risks invalidating the patent. The patent examiner is obliged to list all further prior art found in searches. Citation frequency Modern scientists are sometimes judged by the number of times their work is cited by others‚Äîthis is actually a key indicator of the relative importance of a work in science. Accordingly, individual scientists are motivated to have their own work cited early and often and as widely as possible, but all other scientists are motivated to eliminate unnecessary citations so as not to devalue this means of judgment.

Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that \\"the only reliable information on the history of Fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.\\" Although the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is commonly regarded as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain traditional structure. In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a sentiment of resignation, fate and melancholia. This is loosely captured by the Portuguese word saudade, or longing, symbolizing a feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). This is similar to the character of several musical genres in Portuguese ex-colonies such as morna from Cape Verde, which may be historically linked to fado in its earlier form but has retained its rhythmic heritage. This connection to the music of a historic Portuguese urban and maritime proletariat (sailors, bohemians, dock workers, port traders, fishwives and other working-class people, in general) can also be found in Brazilian modinha and Indonesian kroncong, although all these music genres subsequently developed their own independent traditions. Famous singers of fado include Am√°lia Rodrigues, Dulce Pontes, Carlos do Carmo, Mariza, Mafalda Arnauth, Ant√≥nio Zambujo, Ana Moura, Caman√©, Helder Moutinho, Carminho, M√≠sia, Cristina Branco, Gisela Jo√£o and Katia Guerreiro. On 27 November 2011, fado was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. It is one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the lists, the other being Cante Alentejano. Etymology Fado, painting by Jos√© Malhoa (1910) Portuguese guitar The word \\"fado\\" possibly comes from the Latin word fatum (\\"fate\\", \\"death\\" or \\"utterance\\"Wiktionary - fatum). The word is linked to the music genre itself, although both meanings are approximately the same in the two languages. Nevertheless, many songs play on the double meaning, such as the Am√°lia Rodrigues song \\"Com que voz\\", which includes the lyric \\"Com que voz chorarei meu triste fado\\" (\\"With what voice should I lament my sad fate/sing my sad fado?\\"). The English-Latin term vates, the Scandinavian fata (\\"to compose music\\") and the French name fatiste (also meaning \\"poet\\") have been associated with the term fadista. History Fado appeared during the early 19th century in Lisbon, and is believed to have its origins in the port districts such as Alfama, Mouraria and Bairro Alto. There are numerous theories about the origin of fado. Some trace its origins or influences to the Medieval \\"cantigas de amigo\\" (song of a friend), some ancient Moorish influence and the chants of Africans sailing at sea, but none is conclusive. It possibly evolved and formed, from a mixture of several older musical genres. Fado performers in the middle of the 19th century were mainly from the urban working-class, namely sailors, bohemians and courtesans, who not only sang, but also danced and beat the fado. During the second half of the 19th century, the dance rhythms would eventually fade away, and the performers became merely singers (fadistas). Maria Severa, fado singer (1820-1846) The 19th century's most renowned fadista was Maria Severa. More recently Am√°lia Rodrigues, known as the \\"Rainha do Fado\\" (\\"Queen of Fado\\") was most influential in popularizing fado worldwide. Fado performances today may be accompanied by a string quartet or a full orchestra. Musicological aspects Fado typically employs the Dorian mode, Ionian mode (natural major), sometimes switching between the two during a melody or verse change. A particular stylistic trait of fado is the use of rubato, where the music pauses at the end of a phrase and the singer holds the note for dramatic effect. The music uses double time rhythm and triple time (waltz style). Varieties There are two main varieties of fado, namely those of the cities of Lisbon and Coimbra. The Lisbon style is more well known - alongside the status of Am√°lia Rodrigues, while that of Coimbra is traditionally linked to the city's University and its style is linked to the medieval serenading troubadours. Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has produced many renowned musicians. According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon one claps one's hands, while in Coimbra one coughs as if clearing one's throat. =Coimbra fado= Coimbra students playing fado in a serenade at the frontdoor of Old Cathedral of Coimbra (S√© Velha) This fado is closely linked to the academic traditions of the University of Coimbra and is exclusively sung by men; both the singers and musicians wear the academic outfit (traje acad√©mico): dark robe, cape and leggings. Dating to the troubadour tradition of medieval times, it is sung at night, almost in the dark, in city squares or streets. The most typical venues are the stairsteps of the Santa Cruz Monastery and the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. It is also customary to organize serenades where songs are performed before the window of a woman to be courted. As in Lisbon, Coimbra fado is accompanied by the guitarra portuguesa and viola (a type of guitar). The Coimbra guitar has evolved into an instrument different from that of Lisbon, with its own tuning, sound colouring, and construction. Artur Paredes, a progressive and innovative singer, revolutionised the tuning of the guitar and its accompaniment style to Coimbra fado. Artur Paredes was the father of Carlos Paredes, who followed in his father's footsteps and expanded on his work, making the Portuguese guitar an instrument known around the world. In the 1950s, a new movement led the singers of Coimbra to adopt the ballad and folklore. They began interpreting lines of the great poets, both classical and contemporary, as a form of resistance to the Salazar dictatorship. In this movement names such as Adriano Correia de Oliveira and Jos√© Afonso (Zeca Afonso) had a leading role in popular music during the Portuguese revolution 1974. Some of the most famous fados of Coimbra include: Fado Hil√°rio, Saudades de Coimbra (\\"Do Choupal at√© √† Lapa\\"), Balada da Despedida (\\"Coimbra tem mais encanto, na hora da despedida\\" - the first phrases are often more recognizable than the song titles), O meu menino √© d'oiro, and Samaritana. The \\"judge- singer\\" Fernando Machado Soares is an important figure, being the author of some of those famous fados. Curiously, it is not a Coimbra fado but a popular song which is the most known title referring to this city: Coimbra √© uma li√ß√£o, which had success with titles such as April in Portugal.

The 2020 Sunday Times Rich List values Rice at ¬£155m; the 21st-richest music millionaire in the UK. Early life Rice was born at Shardeloes, an historic English country house near Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England that was requisitioned as a maternity hospital during the Second World War. His father, Hugh Gordon Rice (1917‚Äì1988),Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 3327 served with the Eighth Army and reached the rank of major during the Second World War, and afterward worked for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, becoming Far East representative, and for the Diplomatic Service, including as adviser to the Ministry of Overseas Development at Amman, Jordan. Rice's mother, Joan Odette (n√©e Bawden; 1919‚Äì2009), daughter of an entrepreneur in the London fashion trade, served in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a photographic interpreter, and in her eighties became known as a writer on the publication of her wartime diaries. Education Lancing College Rice was educated at three independent schools: Aldwickbury School in Hertfordshire, St Albans School and Lancing College. He left Lancing with GCE A-Levels in History and French and then started work as an articled clerk for a law firm in London, having decided not to apply for a university place.

When EMI producer Norrie Paramor left to set up his own organization in 1968, Rice joined him as an assistant producer, working with, among others, Cliff Richard, The Scaffold. = Musical theatre = Rice became famous for his collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber, with whom he wrote Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Cricket, The Likes of Us, and additional songs for the 2011 West End production of The Wizard of Oz. Joseph and Superstar were additionally known as two of the first hit musicals that drew their sound from the rock and pop music that became embedded in culture in the 1960s. For The Walt Disney Company, Rice has collaborated individually with Alan Menken and Elton John, creating productions including Aladdin (winning an Academy Award, Golden Globe and Grammy Award for Song of the Year for \\"A Whole New World\\") and The Lion King (winning the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\").

In 2009, he wrote the lyrics for Andrei Konchalovsky's critically panned reimagining of The Nutcracker, set to the music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Rice reunited with Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2011 to pen new songs for Lloyd Webber's newest production of The Wizard of Oz which opened in March 2011 at the London Palladium. Rice has since, however, rejected working with Lloyd Webber again, claiming their partnership has run its course, and they are \\"no longer relevant as a team\\". = Media = On 9 November 1979, Rice hosted a highly publicised edition of Friday Night, Saturday Morning on the BBC which had a heated debate on the newly released film Monty Python's Life of Brian, a film that had been banned by many local councils and caused protests throughout the world with accusations that it was blasphemous (as the lyricist of Jesus Christ Superstar, Rice himself had been accused of blasphemy a decade before). To argue in favour of this accusation were veteran broadcaster and noted Christian Malcolm Muggeridge, and Mervyn Stockwood (the Bishop of Southwark). In defence of the film were two members of the Monty Python team, John Cleese and Michael Palin.Cleese and Palin relive the 1979 Life of Brian debate, BBC News.

I have nothing against it.\\" Conversely, he also stated that he adapted the biblical stories of Joseph and Jesus to musicals because \\"I'd always rather take a true story over an untrue one.\\" = Wealth = According to The Sunday Times Rich List of the UK's richest millionaires, Rice is worth ¬£155 million as of 2020. In 2015, Rice expressed his indebtedness to the journalist Angus McGill as \\"the man responsible for Andrew Lloyd Webber and I having our first song recorded\\". Speaking at McGill's funeral,\\"Angus McGill: The funeral and the wake\\". 47 Shoe Lane, 29 October 2015, retrieved 25 September 2017. Rice told a tale from his days at EMI about trying to rig the results of the London Evening Standard Girl of the Year competition in 1967. As \\"glorified office boy\\", Rice was writing songs with Lloyd Webber and desperate to find anybody to record one of their songs. Rice and colleagues filled in 5,000 entry forms overnight voting for the contestant who was a singer, and delivered them to McGill, who supervised the competition. Rice said it was \\"a disgraceful act of dishonesty on my part... without actually breaking the rules\\". As a result, the Standard proclaimed two Girls of the Year and Rice's choice, Rosalind (\\"Ross\\") Hannaman,Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical, Stephen Citron, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 114 was signed to EMI where she made her first record.

Competitors design and operate remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination tournament. For five seasons, BattleBots aired on the American Comedy Central and was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Comedy Central's first season premiered on August 23, 2000, and its fifth and last season ended on December 21, 2002. A six-episode revival series premiered on ABC on June 21, 2015, to generally favorable reviews and ratings. Additionally, ABC renewed BattleBots for a seventh season, which premiered on June 23, 2016. In February 2018, Discovery Channel and Science picked up the show for BattleBots eighth season, which began airing on May 11, 2018. A ninth season of BattleBots premiered on Discovery Channel on June 7, 2019. Discovery Channel has renewed the series for a tenth season and it was originally set to premiere May 15, 2020, but was postponed to a later date due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.https://premieredate.news/tv- series/2387-battlebots.htmlhttps://twitter.com/BattleBots/status/1254842215148347392 Production of the tenth season was postponed until October and began on October 2, 2020. History BattleBots is an offshoot of the original version Robot Wars, the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and Profile Records (the former Sm:)e-communications). Profile licensed Robot Wars to a UK production company and Robot Wars ran for seven years as a popular television program in the UK, before being revived for 2016. The robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and streamed online, attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of professional boxing, was in attendance and showed interest in being involved with BattleBots‚Äîbelieving the concept of robot combat was \\"hip\\" and have shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition's format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as CBS, NBC, HBO, and Showtime‚Äîbut they failed to understand the concept of the program or take it seriously. A second event was held as a pay-per-view in Las Vegas in 1999, the PPV was in turn, used as a pilot to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success. Among the networks interested was Comedy Central, who would ultimately pick up the program. Debbie Liebling, the network's Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network's young adult demographic, explaining that \\"it was really funny and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn't so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess.\\" Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double- edged sword; it gave BattleBots an outlet and a larger budget, but the network insisted on the addition of comedic aspects to BattleBots as a program, such as sketches involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being \\"a parody of a sports show without being a parody\\". Munson lamented that the network had also ignored his suggestion for the co-host role to be filled by \\"attractive geek girls\\" with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders, having elected to \\"[keep] throwing bigger and better hot babes at it\\", such as Carmen Electra. Despite this, viewership and awareness of BattleBots grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter would be invited to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, BattleBots beat South Park as Comedy Central's highest-rated program for a period during Season 3, competitor interest grew and licensing deals also emerged. The success of BattleBots, however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; TLC introduced a competing program, Robotica, while other channels imported episodes of the British Robot Wars series. By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become \\"homogenized\\" because the participants had \\"perfected\\" the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies. Furthermore, BattleBots had sued Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for producing and airing a commercial during Super Bowl XXXVII that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from BattleBots (this lawsuit, however, would be dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a parody protected by fair use). In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled BattleBots after its fifth season, BattleBots 5.0. Viacom would acquire full control of the network in April 2003; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become \\"tired\\" of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming. In December 2014, ABC announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of BattleBots, produced by Whalerock Industries, to premiere in June 2015. Roski and Munson served as executive producers, joined by Lloyd Braun. The revival drew an average viewership of 5.4 million in its Sunday-night timeslot, with a 1.9 share in the 18-49 demographic. In November 2015, ABC announced that it had renewed the BattleBots revival for a second season, which expanded the competition to a 56-team field. After ABC declined to renew the revival for a third season, the series was picked up by Discovery Channel and sister network Science. On April 18, 2018, Discovery and Science channels announced that a new season would begin on Friday, May 11, 2018, at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on Discovery Channel and Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on Science Channel. The announcement reported that amongst the bots would be returning favorites Tombstone, Minotaur, Chomp, Witch Doctor, Bronco, Bombshell, Bite Force, and Yeti. Chris Rose and Kenny Florian return to call the action, provide background information about the bots and teams, and offer commentary. Jessica Chobot served again as the sideline reporter. Faruq Tauheed returned as the ring announcer. BattleBots was then brought back for another season on June 5, 2019, on Discovery and Science Channel. Chris Rose and Kenny Florian returned as hosts with a new sideline reporter, Jenny Taft, interviewing all of the BattleBots competitors in the workshop. A tenth season will premiere on Discovery on May 15, 2020, however, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it has been posted to a unknown date and has began filming october 10th. Personalities For the first five seasons, BattleBots was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Correspondents included former Baywatch actresses Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, comedian Arj Barker and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show's \\"technical expert\\". The show's match announcer was longtime boxing ring announcer Mark Beiro. The 2015 edition was hosted by Molly McGrath, with Chris Rose and former UFC fighter Kenny Florian as commentators. The battle arena announcer was Faruq Tauheed, and Alison Haislip conducted interviews on the sidelines and behind the scenes. The judges were engineer and NASA astronaut Leland Melvin, Nerdist News anchor Jessica Chobot and visual effects artist Fon Davis. For the 2016 season, Samantha Ponder was added as host, replacing Molly McGrath. The returning judges were Fon Davis, Jessica Chobot, and Leland Melvin, as well as celebrity guest judges actor Clark Gregg, MythBusters host and former Battlebots builder Adam Savage, NFL tightend Vernon Davis, and YouTube star Michael Stevens a.k.a. Vsauce. For the 2018 season, Rose, Florian, and Tauheed all returned in their roles, with Rose and Florian taking over as the primary hosts of the show. Chobot and Haislip switched their roles, with Chobot becoming the new sideline reporter and Haislip one of the rotating judges. Other judges include former Battlebots competitors Lisa Winter, Derek Young, Grant Imahara and Mark Setrakian. For the 2019 season, Chobot was replaced with Jenny Taft as a sideline reporter, and the judging panel was fixed to Winter, Young, and former competitor Jason Bardis instead of rotating as it had done in previous seasons. * Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage (creators of heavyweight Blendo), and Grant Imahara (creator of middleweight Deadblow) of Discovery Channel's MythBusters are former competitors. Deadblow sometimes appeared as a \\"guest MythBuster\\", assisting Grant with various experiments including \\"Driving In The Dark\\". * Will Wright, the creator of SimCity and other Sim games, as well as Spore, was a long-time contestant. He competed with middleweight Chiabot in Seasons 1 - 5, multibot RACC along with Mike Winter in Long Beach 1999, and lightweight The Aggressive Polygon in Season 1. His daughter Cassidy competed with middleweight Misty the WonderBot in Seasons 4 - 5. * Michael Loren Mauldin, founder of Lycos, entered multiple bots over the series, competing with Team Toad. * One of the founders of BattleBots, Trey Roski, is the son of Edward Roski Jr., one of the owners of the STAPLES Center sports arena in Los Angeles. * Jay Leno appeared with a novelty BattleBot, Chinkilla ‚Äì a lift type robot, Chinkilla did not comply with the competition rules and only competed in special exhibition matches at BattleBots events. * Mark Setrakian, builder/creator of the fighting robots and control suits used on Robot Combat League, is known for his visually appealing robots such as Mechadon and Snake. He has also worked on control technology used for films like Men In Black, The Grinch, and Hellboy. Whilst Setrakian did not compete in the ABC revival series, he built Axis, a claw- like podium that would rotate the Giant Nut on top of it while it was on display. * Gary Coleman, in promotion with UGO.com, joined Jim Smentowski on Team Nightmare for BattleBots Season 5. In that season, he competed with middleweight Psyche. * Dan Barry, retired NASA astronaut and Survivor: Panama contestant, competed in BattleBots Season 7 with Black Ice. * Andrew Norton worked on the show from its first event until season 4 as a member of the technical and arena safety crew, while simultaneously holding the UK Robot Wars Middleweight title. Gameplay =Weight classes= Robots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1‚Äì5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments the classes were: *Lightweight ‚Äì 60 pounds (27 kilograms) *Middleweight ‚Äì 120 pounds (54 kilograms) *Heavyweight ‚Äì 220 pounds (100 kilograms) *Superheavyweight ‚Äì 340 pounds (154 kilograms) \\"Walking\\" robots (\\"StompBots\\") propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight StompBot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms do not use cam operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation. Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds. Starting in season 6, there were no longer separate weight classes while the weight limit for heavyweights was increased from 220 to 250 pounds. =Matches= Matches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy or disable each other using whatever means available. The match begins with a series of lights that flash from yellow to green. The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of drag racing; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green. There are only two events that cause the match to be paused resulting in people entering the BattleBox. One is the event that the robots are stuck together and cannot separate or that both have simultaneously become immobilized. The other scenario is that one or both 'bots have caught on fire. In that case, the people entering the BattleBox are equipped with fire extinguishers. If a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck in some manner (e.g. ensnared in an arena-trap), it is declared knocked out. In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a \\"tap-out\\" to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is \\"asked\\" (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count. If both robots survive the three minutes, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins. The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will. The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent's weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent's weak areas will gain points. The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself. At the end of the tournament, a series of 'rumbles' or 'melee rounds' is typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a 'free for all' in a 5-minute match. Occasionally there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event. During the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared- off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.RobotCombat.com http://www.robotcombat.com/nightmare_sf02.html =Arena= The BattleBox is a 48' x 48' square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying debris and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson. As of the 2015 season, Pete was still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer. It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic. The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited. The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena. Arena booby-traps are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable and to reward drivers who can avoid the traps while pushing or carrying their opponent into them. Traps from the first five seasons include (and where noted, omitted for the later ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons): *Pulverizers: Originally pneumatic powered standard sledgehammers that did minimal damage, the Pulverizers were first upgraded to 50-pound aluminum mallets for season 2, and were again upgraded to 150-pound mallets for season 3 and beyond, now with one near each corner. The pulverizers were capable of causing serious damage to the lighter weight class robots. *Spike Strips: The lower walls of the arena are lined with inward- pointing 6-inch long sharpened steel spikes. Pushing an opponent hard into a wall can sometimes lodge it in the spikes, immobilizing it. *Spinners: Large, rapidly spinning discs embedded in the arena floor, Not intended to damage a robot, but rather to interfere with navigation. The spinners could fling lighter class robots across the arena, but the impact on heavier robots was minimal. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. *Kill Saws: Spinning circular saw saw-blades comprising eight twin-blade hazards, that rise out of slots in the arena floor that was originally under the control of \\"Pulverizer Pete\\". These carbide-tipped saw blades can damage a robot's tires or chassis. In later seasons, red 'throwing blades' were added to increase the chance of a bot being thrown across the arena. *Pistons: Introduced in Season 3, the Pistons are steel columns that raise and lower from the floor without warning. They can stop a charging robot or tip a slow- moving robot onto its side. The Pistons were removed for Seasons 4 and 5, and likewise omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. *Ramrods: Sharpened steel spikes that rise up out of the arena floor in groups of six, serving either to lift a robot off the ground or damage vulnerable portions of the undercarriage. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel- shown seasons. *Hell Raisers: A pneumatic ram that can tilt up specific sections of the arena floor. The 15-degree tilt may become a launching ramp, or may abruptly block passage. The Hell Raisers were removed for Season 5 onwards, to allow more uncluttered room for the robots. *Screws: Introduced for season 3, these devices were a modification to the static spike strips. The screws were continually rotating augers placed horizontally along the edges of the arena floor. The Screws were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the Pulverizers due to the corkscrew design. Much like the Spinners, the Screws had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes‚Äîalthough their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5 onwards, the screws were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in the center of themselves from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.

He is well known internationally as the creator of the Kod√°ly Method. Life Born in Kecskem√©t, Hungary, Kod√°ly learned to play the violin as a child. In 1905 he visited remote villages to collect songs, recording them on phonograph cylinders. In 1906 he wrote a thesis on Hungarian folk song, \\"Strophic Construction in Hungarian Folksong\\". At around this time Kod√°ly met fellow composer and compatriot B√©la Bart√≥k, whom he took under his wing and introduced to some of the methods involved in folk song collecting. The two became lifelong friends and champions of each other's music. Statue of Kod√°ly at Szent Istv√°n square in P√©cs, Hungary All these works show great originality of form and content, a very interesting blend of highly sophisticated mastery of the western European style of music, including classical, late-romantic, impressionistic and modernist traditions, and on the other hand a profound knowledge and respect for the folk music of Hungary (including the Hungarian-inhabited areas of modern-day Slovakia and Romania, as those territories were part of Hungary). Partly because of the Great War and subsequent major geopolitical changes in the region, and partly because of a naturally rather diffident temperament in youth, Kod√°ly had no major public success until 1923. This was the year when one of his best-known pieces, Psalmus Hungaricus, was given its first performance at a concert to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the union of Buda and Pest (Bart√≥k's Dance Suite premiered on the same occasion.) Kod√°ly's first wife was Emma Gruber (n√©e Schlesinger, later S√°ndor), the dedicatee of Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi's Waltz for piano with four hands, Op. 3, and Variations and Fugue on a theme by E.G., Op. 4 (1897). In November 1958, after 48 years of marriage, Kod√°ly's first wife Emma died. In December 1959, Kod√°ly married Sarolta P√©czely, his 19-year-old student at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music with whom he lived happily until his death in 1967 at the age of 84 in Budapest. In 1966, Kod√°ly toured the United States and gave a special lecture at Stanford University, where some of his music was performed in his presence. Kod√°ly method of musical education Throughout his adult life, Kod√°ly was very interested in the problems of many types of music education, and he wrote a large amount of material on teaching methods as well as composing plenty of music intended for children's use. Beginning in 1935, along with his colleague Jen≈ë √Åd√°m (14 years his junior), he embarked on a long-term project to reform music teaching in Hungary's lower and middle schools. His work resulted in the publication of several highly influential books. The Hungarian music education program that developed in the 1940s became the basis for what is called the \\"Kod√°ly Method\\". While Kod√°ly himself did not write down a comprehensive method, he did establish a set of principles to follow in music education, and these principles were widely taken up by pedagogues (above all in Hungary, but also in many other countries) after World War II. See also: Kod√°ly Hand Signs. In the motion picture Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a visual learning aid distributed to members of a conference of ufologists was named the \\"Kod√°ly Method\\" and referenced musical notes as hand signals. Legacy and memorials Andr√°ssy Avenue, Budapest The city of P√©cs commissioned a full-length bronze statue, located in Szent Istv√°n square, in his honour in 1976. According to the wishes of the sculptor, the work stands with its back to the Cathedral and facing a former playground, so that it was facing children, whose musical education was the most important thing in Kod√°ly's life. He is depicted as a fragile old man, who walks almost imperceptibly among the horse-chestnut trees.

Tubby's innovative studio work, which saw him elevate the role of the mixing engineer to a creative fame previously only reserved for composers and musicians, would prove to be influential across many genres of popular music. He is often cited as the inventor of the concept of the remix that later became ubiquitous in dance and electronic music production. Singer Mikey Dread stated, \\"King Tubby truly understood sound in a scientific sense. He knew how the circuits worked and what the electrons did. That's why he could do what he did\\". Career King Tubby's first interaction with the music industry came in the late 1950s with the rising popularity of Jamaican sound systems, which were to be found all over Kingston and which were developing into enterprising businesses. As a talented radio repairman, Tubby soon found himself in great demand by most of the major sound systems of Kingston, as the tropical weather of the Caribbean island (often combined with sabotage by rival sound system owners) led to malfunctions and equipment failure.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , pp. 138‚Äì141 Tubby owned an electrical repair shop on Drumalie Avenue, Kingston, that fixed televisions and radios. It was here that he built large amplifiers for the local sound systems. In 1961‚Äì62, he built his own radio transmitter and briefly ran a pirate radio station playing ska and rhythm and blues which he soon shut down when he heard that the police were looking for the perpetrators.\\"King Jammy interview\\", BBC, 2005. Retrieved 30 April 2016 Tubby would eventually form his own sound system, Tubby's Hometown Hi-Fi, in 1968.Bonitto, Brian (2012) \\"King Tubby, the sound creator\\", Jamaica Observer, 6 July 2012, retrieved 13 July 2012 It became a crowd favourite due to the high quality sound of his equipment, exclusive releases and Tubby's own echo and reverb sound effects, at that point something of a novelty. The sound also launched the career of U-Roy, its featured toaster. =Remixes= Tubby began working as a disc cutter for producer Duke Reid in 1968. Reid, one of the major figures in early Jamaican music alongside rival Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, ran Treasure Isle studios, one of Jamaica's first independent production houses, and was a key producer of ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae recordings. Before the advent of dub, most Jamaican 45s featured an instrumental version of the main song on the flipside, which was called the \\"version\\". When Tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system MCs or toasters, Tubby initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on Reid's mixing desk, but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated, reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and primitive early effects units. In time, Tubby began to create wholly new pieces of music by shifting the emphasis in the instrumentals, adding sounds and removing others and adding various special effects, like extreme delays, echoes, reverb and phase effects. Partly due to the popularity of these early remixes, in 1971, Tubby's soundsystem consolidated its position as one of the most popular in Kingston and Tubby decided to open a studio of his own in Waterhouse in 1971, initially using a 4-track mixer purchased from Byron Lee's Dynamic studio. =Dub music production= King Tubby's production work in the 1970s made him one of the best-known celebrities in Jamaica, and would generate interest in his production techniques from producers, sound engineers and musicians across the world. Tubby built on his considerable knowledge of electronics to repair, adapt and design his own studio equipment, which made use of a combination of old devices and new technologies to produce a studio capable of the precise, atmospheric sounds which would become Tubby's trademark. With a variety of effects units connected to his mixer, Tubby \\"played\\" the mixing desk like an instrument, bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix (literally \\"dubbing\\" them) to create an entirely new genre known as dub music. By the end of 1971 he was already providing dub mixes for producers such as Glen Brown and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. Using existing multitrack master tapes‚Äîhis small studio in fact had no capacity to record session musicians‚ÄîTubby would re-tape or \\"dub\\" the original after passing it through his 12-channel, custom-built MCI mixing desk, twisting the songs into unexpected configurations which highlighted the heavy rhythms of their bass and drum parts with minute snatches of vocals, horns, piano and organ. These techniques mirrored the actions of the sound system selectors (reggae disc jockeys), who had long used EQ equipment to emphasise certain aspects of particular records, but Tubby used his custom-built studio to take this technique into new areas, often transforming a hit song to the point where it was almost unrecognisable from the original version. One unique aspect of his remixes or dubs was the result of creative manipulating of the built-in high-pass filter on the MCI mixer he had bought from Dynamic Studios. The filter was a parametric EQ which was controllable by a large knob‚Äîaka the \\"big knob\\" ‚Äì which allowed Tubby to introduce a dramatic narrowing sweep of any signal, such as the horns, until the sound disappeared into a thin squeal. Tubby engineered/remixed songs for Jamaica's top producers such as Lee Perry, Bunny Lee, Augustus Pablo and Vivian Jackson, that featured artists such as Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Linval Thompson, Horace Andy, Big Joe, Delroy Wilson, Jah Stitch and many others. In 1973, he added a second 4-track mixer, and built a vocal booth at his studio so he could record vocal tracks onto the instrumental tapes brought to him by various producers. This process is known as \\"voicing\\" in Jamaican recording parlance. It is unlikely that a complete discography of Tubby's production work could be created based on the number of labels, artists and producers with whom he worked, and also subsequent repressings of these releases sometimes contained contradictory information. His name is credited on hundreds of B-side labels, with the possibility that many others were by his hand yet uncredited, due to similarities with his known work. Several albums of Tubby's dub mixes were released, among the earliest the Perry- produced Blackboard Jungle and Bunny Lee's Dub from the Roots (both 1974). His most famous dub and one of the most popular dubs of all time was \\"King Tubby Meets the Rockers Uptown\\" from 1974. The original session was for a Jacob Miller song called \\"Baby I Love You So\\", which featured Bob Marley's drummer Carlton Barrett playing a traditional one drop rhythm. When Tubby completed the dub, which also featured Augustus Pablo on melodica, Barrett's drums regenerated several times and created a totally new rhythm which was later tagged \\"rockers\\". This seminal track later also appeared on Pablo's 1976 album King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown. By the later part of the 1970s, King Tubby had mostly retired from music, still occasionally mixing dubs and tutoring a new generation of artists, including King Jammy and perhaps his greatest protege, Hopeton Brown a.k.a. Scientist. In the 1980s. he built a new, larger studio in the Waterhouse neighbourhood of Kingston with increased capabilities, and focused on the management of his labels Firehouse, Waterhouse, Kingston 11, and Taurus, which released his productions of Anthony Red Rose, Sugar Minott, Conroy Smith, King Everald and other popular musicians. Death King Tubby was shot and killed on 6 February 1989, outside his home in Duhaney Park, Kingston, upon returning from a session at his Waterhouse studio.

Modern radiosondes measure or calculate the following variables: altitude, pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind (both wind speed and wind direction), cosmic ray readings at high altitude and geographical position (latitude/longitude). Radiosondes measuring ozone concentration are known as ozonesondes. Radiosondes may operate at a radio frequency of 403 MHz or 1680 MHz. A radiosonde whose position is tracked as it ascends to give wind speed and direction information is called a rawinsonde (\\"radar wind -sonde\\"). Most radiosondes have radar reflectors and are technically rawinsondes. A radiosonde that is dropped from an airplane and falls, rather than being carried by a balloon is called a dropsonde. Radiosondes are an essential source of meteorological data, and hundreds are launched all over the world daily.  History  Kites used to fly a meteograph Meteograph used by the US Weather Bureau in 1898 U.S. Bureau of Standards personnel launch radiosonde near Washington, DC in 1936 US sailors launching a radiosonde during World War 2 The first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs, a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment. This proved to be difficult because the kites were linked to the ground and were very difficult to manoeuvre in gusty conditions. Furthermore, the sounding was limited to low altitudes because of the link to the ground. Gustave Hermite and Georges Besan√ßon, from France, were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph. In 1898, L√©on Teisserenc de Bort organized at the Observatoire de M√©t√©orologie Dynamique de Trappes the first regular daily use of these balloons. Data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude, which varied with the season, and then stabilized above this altitude. De Bort's discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere was announced in 1902 at the French Academy of Sciences. Other researchers, like Richard A√ümann and William Henry Dines, were working at the same times with similar instruments. In 1924, Colonel William Blaire in the U.S. Signal Corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon, making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits. The first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in France by . Bureau coined the name \\"radiosonde\\" and flew the first instrument on January 7, 1929. Developed independently a year later, Pavel Molchanov flew a radiosonde on January 30, 1930. Molchanov's design became a popular standard because of its simplicity and because it converted sensor readings to Morse code, making it easy to use without special equipment or training.DuBois, Multhauf and Ziegler, \\"The Invention and Development of the Radiosonde\\", Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology, No. 53, 2002. Working with a modified Molchanov sonde, Sergey Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude. On April 1, 1935, he took measurements up to using a pair of Geiger counters in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers.Vernoff, S. \\"Radio-Transmission of Cosmic Ray Data from the Stratosphere\\", Nature, June 29, 1935. This became an important technique in the field, and Vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years, measuring the radiation's latitude dependence caused by the Earth's magnetic field. In 1936, the U.S. Navy assigned the U.S. Bureau of Standards (NBS) to develop an official radiosonde for the Navy to use. The NBS gave the project to Harry Diamond, who had previously worked on radio navigation and invented a blind landing system for airplanes. The organization led by Diamond eventually (in 1992) became a part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. In 1937, Diamond, along with his associates Francis Dunmore and Wilbur Hinmann, Jr., created a radiosonde that employed audio-frequency subcarrier modulation with the help of a resistance-capacity relaxation oscillator. In addition, this NBS radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors. In 1938, Diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde, which prompted the first service use of the NBS radiosondes in the Navy. Then in 1939, Diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the ‚Äúremote weather station,‚Äù which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations. By 1940, the NBS radiosonde system included a pressure drive, which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure. It also gathered data on cloud thickness and light intensity in the atmosphere. Due to this and other improvements in cost (about $25), weight (> 1 kilogram), and accuracy, hundreds of thousands of NBS-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes, and the apparatus was officially adopted by the U.S. Weather Bureau. Diamond was given the Washington Academy of Sciences Engineering Award in 1940 and the IRE Fellow Award (which was later renamed the Harry Diamond Memorial Award) in 1943 for his contributions to radio- meteorology. The expansion of economically important government weather forecasting services during the 1930s and their increasing need for data motivated many nations to begin regular radiosonde observation programs In 1985, as part of the Soviet Union's Vega program, the two Venus probes, Vega 1 and Vega 2, each dropped a radiosonde into the atmosphere of Venus. The sondes were tracked for two days. Although modern remote sensing by satellites, aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data, none of these systems can match the vertical resolution ( or less) and altitude coverage () of radiosonde observations, so they remain essential to modern meteorology. Although hundreds of radiosondes are launched worldwide each day year-round, fatalities attributed to radiosondes are rare. The first known example was the electrocution of a lineman in the United States who was attempting to free a radiosonde from high-tension power lines in 1943.\\"Linemen Cautioned About Disengaging Radiosonde,\\" Electrical World, 15 May 1943 In 1970 an Antonov 24 operating Aeroflot Flight 1661 suffered a loss of control after striking a radiosonde in flight resulting in the death of all 45 people on board.  Operation  A rubber or latex balloon filled with either helium or hydrogen lifts the device up through the atmosphere. The maximum altitude to which the balloon ascends is determined by the diameter and thickness of the balloon. Balloon sizes can range from . As the balloon ascends through the atmosphere, the pressure decreases, causing the balloon to expand. Eventually, the balloon will expand to the extent that its skin will break, terminating the ascent. An balloon will burst at about .Dian J. Gaffen. Radiosonde Observations and Their Use in SPARC-Related Investigations. Retrieved on 2008-05-25. After bursting, a small parachute on the radiosonde's support line carries it to Earth. A typical radiosonde flight lasts 60 to 90 minutes. One radiosonde from Clark Air Base, Philippines, reached an altitude of . The modern radiosonde communicates via radio with a computer that stores all the variables in real time. The first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite, and gave only a wind estimation by the position. With the advent of radar by the Signal Corps it was possible to track a radar target carried by the balloons with the SCR-658 radar. Modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction, such as a radio direction finder or GPS. The weight of a radiosonde is typically . Sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon. Radiosondes deployed in this way are called dropsondes.  Routine radiosonde launches  Worldwide there are about 1,300 radiosonde launch sites.WMO Global Observing SystemUpper-air observations. Retrieved February 19, 2017. Most countries share data with the rest of the world through international agreements. Nearly all routine radiosonde launches occur 45 minutes before the official observation time of 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC, so as to provide an instantaneous snapshot of the atmosphere.Preflight Procedures and Success Criteria , PDF This is especially important for numerical modeling. In the United States the National Weather Service is tasked with providing timely upper-air observations for use in weather forecasting, severe weather watches and warnings, and atmospheric research. The National Weather Service launches radiosondes from 92 stations in North America and the Pacific Islands twice daily. It also supports the operation of 10 radiosonde sites in the Caribbean. A list of U.S. operated land based launch sites can be found in Appendix C, U.S. Land-based Rawinsonde StationsU.S. Land-based Rawinsode Stations of the Federal Meteorological Handbook #3, titled Rawinsonde and Pibal Observations, dated May 1997.  Uses of upper air observations  Raw upper air data is routinely processed by supercomputers running numerical models. Forecasters often view the data in a graphical format, plotted on thermodynamic diagrams such as Skew-T log-P diagrams, Tephigrams, and or St√ºve diagrams, all useful for the interpretation of the atmosphere's vertical thermodynamics profile of temperature and moisture as well as kinematics of vertical wind profile. Radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction. Because a sonde may drift several hundred kilometers during the 90- to 120-minute flight, there may be concern that this could introduce problems into the model initialization. However, this appears not to be so except perhaps locally in jet stream regions in the stratosphere.Dead link  Radio regulations  According to article 1.109 of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR):ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV.

Its first editor in chief, Fran√ßois Honti, developed the newspaper as a scholarly reference journal. Honti attentively followed the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement, created out of the 1955 Bandung Conference, and the issues of the \\"Third World\\". Claude Julien became the newspaper's second editor in January 1973. At that time, the circulation of Le Monde diplomatique had jumped from 5,000 to 50,000 copies, and would reach, with Micheline Paulet, 120,000 in under 20 years.Numbers given in \\"Le Monde diplomatique depuis 1954...\\", Les Amis du Monde diplomatique, 1901 law association, 26 September 2006 Without renouncing its \\"Third-worldism\\" position, it extended the treatment of its subjects, concentrating on international economic and monetary problems, strategic relations, the Middle-East conflict, etc. Le Monde diplomatique took an independent stance, criticising both the neoliberal ideology of the left and conservative policies represented by UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. =1989‚Äìpresent= After the November 1989 Fall of the Berlin Wall following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the 1990-1991 Gulf War, the newspaper began to criticise what it described as an \\"American crusade\\". Ignacio Ramonet was elected director or editor-in-chief in January 1991, serving until 2008. Under his leadership, Le Monde diplomatique analysed the post-Cold War world, paying specific attention to \\"ethnic\\" conflicts that arose in this period: the wars in former Yugoslavia, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the conflicts in the Caucasus, etc., as well as to the new information technology. Ramonet has also published books about the media and their relationship to national societies. As noted by Fran√ßois Cusset, French universities have not developed an interdisciplinary approach to media studies. He notes that leftist journals including Le Monde Diplomatique have had an editorial approach that is committed to \\"critique of dominant media\\", both in terms of their roles in setting agendas and in enjoying status perks.Fran√ßois Cusset, \\"Media Studies: A French Blind Spot\\", InMedia, 1/2012; accessed 01 October 2018 Both Ramonet and his successor, Serge Halimi, published books that critiqued the media from outside academic circles.Serge Halimi and Christine Larrazet, \\"At the Crossroads of Media, Media Critique, and the Critique of Media critics ‚Äì An Interview with Serge Halimi, Editor-in-Chief of 'Le Monde Diplomatique' \\", InMedia, 2/2012 (Interview 25 July 2012); accessed 01 October 2018 The newspaper established financial and editorial independence from Le Monde in 1996, forming its own company.

Formed in 1969, War is a musical crossover band that fuses elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and reggae. Their album The World Is a Ghetto was Billboard's best-selling album of 1973. The band transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. War was subject to many line-up changes over the course of its existence, leaving member Leroy \\"Lonnie\\" Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up; four other members created a new group called the Lowrider Band. History =1960s: Beginnings= In 1962, Howard E. Scott and Harold Brown formed a group called The Creators in Long Beach, California. Within a few years, they had added Charles Miller, Morris \\"B. B.\\" Dickerson and Lonnie Jordan to the lineup. Lee Oskar and Papa Dee Allen later joined as well. They all shared a love of diverse styles of music, which they had absorbed living in the racially mixed Los Angeles ghettos. The Creators recorded several singles on Dore Records while working with Tjay Contrelli, a saxophonist from the band Love. In 1968, the Creators became Nightshift (named because Brown worked nights at a steel yard) and started performing with Deacon Jones, a football player and singer. The original War was conceived by record producer Jerry Goldstein (\\"My Boyfriend's Back\\", \\"Hang on Sloopy\\", \\"I Want Candy\\") and singer Eric Burdon (ex-lead singer of the British band the Animals). In 1969, Goldstein saw musicians who would eventually become War playing at the Rag Doll in North Hollywood, backing Deacon Jones, and he was attracted to the band's sound. Jordan claimed that the band's goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crimes, and turf wars, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood. Eric Burdon and War began playing live shows to audiences throughout Southern California before entering into the studio to record their debut album Eric Burdon Declares \\"War\\". The album's best known track, \\"Spill the Wine\\", was a hit and launched the band's career. =1970s: Height of popularity= Eric Burdon and War toured extensively across Europe and the United States. The subtitle of a 1970 review in the New Musical Express of their first UK gig in London's Hyde Park read: \\"Burdon and War: Best Live Band We've Ever Seen\\". Their show at Ronnie Scott's Club in London on September 18, 1970, is historically notable for being the last public performance for Jimi Hendrix, who joined them onstage for the last 35 minutes of Burdon and War's second set; a day later he was dead. A second Eric Burdon and War album, a two-disc set titled The Black-Man's Burdon was released in 1970, before Burdon left the band in the middle of its European tour. They finished the tour without him and returned to record their first album as War. War (1971) met with only modest success, but later that year, the band released All Day Music which included the singles \\"All Day Music\\" and \\"Slippin' into Darkness\\". The latter single sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1972. In 1972, they released The World Is a Ghetto which was even more successful. Its second single, \\"The Cisco Kid\\" shipped gold, and the album attained the number two spot on Billboard Hot 100 chart, and was Billboard magazine's Album of the Year as the best-selling album of 1973. The next album, Deliver the Word (1973) contained the hits \\"Gypsy Man\\" and a studio version of \\"Me and Baby Brother\\" (previously issued as a live recording), which peaked at #8 and #15 on the Billboard chart. The album went on to sell nearly two million copies. The next album, Why Can't We Be Friends? was released in 1975. It included \\"Low Rider\\" and the title track, which were among the band's biggest hits. In 1976, War released a greatest hits record which contained one new song \\"Summer\\", which, as a single, went gold and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard chart. Also released that year were Love is All Around by Eric Burdon and War, containing mostly unreleased recordings from 1969 and 1970, and Platinum Jazz, a one-off album for jazz label Blue Note. The latter double album had cover art to match the greatest hits album, and was half new material and half compilation, focusing on (but not restricted to) instrumental music. The group continued to attain success with their next album, Galaxy (1977) whose title single was inspired by Star Wars. War's next project was a soundtrack album for the movie Youngblood in 1978. =1980s: The Music Band= In 1979, following the departure of B.B. Dickerson during recording sessions for their next album (replaced by Luther Rabb on bass who completed the album), the band considered changing their name to The Music Band, but decided at the last minute to continue as War, and use \\"The Music Band\\" as the title of a series of albums. The series originally consisted of two studio albums (The Music Band, The Music Band 2, both in 1979) and a live album (The Music Band Live, 1980), but after the band left MCA in 1981 and had already made records for other labels, MCA expanded the series with a compilation (The Best of the Music Band, 1982) and a third original album of left-over material (The Music Band ‚Äì Jazz, 1983). The group lost another member when Charles Miller (saxophone) was murdered in 1980. He had already been replaced by Pat Rizzo (ex Sly and the Family Stone) in 1979. Other new members joining at this time were Alice Tweed Smith (credited as \\"Tweed Smith\\" and \\"Alice Tweed Smyth\\" on various albums) on percussion and vocals (giving the band its first female vocalist), and Ronnie Hammon as a third drummer. After making the one-off single \\"Cinco de Mayo\\" for LAX Records in 1981 (Jerry Goldstein's own label, which also reissued Eric Burdon Declares \\"War\\" under the title Spill the Wine the same year), War signed with RCA Victor Records and recorded Outlaw (1982) which included the single plus additional singles \\"You Got the Power\\", \\"Outlaw\\", and \\"Just Because\\". It was followed by Life (is So Strange) (1983) from which the title track was also a single. War's records from 1979 to 1983 were not as successful as those from the preceding decade, and after the two RCA albums, the band's activities became sporadic. They did not record another full album until a decade later. The 1987 compilation album The Best of War ...and More included two new tracks, \\"Livin' in the Red\\" and \\"Whose Cadillac Is That?\\", and a remixed version of \\"Low Rider\\" (in addition to the original version). Papa Dee Allen died of a brain aneurysm which struck him onstage in 1988. =1990s: Reformations= War in 1992 Sampling of War by hip hop artists was prevalent enough to merit the compilation album Rap Declares War in 1992, which was sanctioned by the band. In 1993, War reformed with most surviving previous members (including original members Brown, Jordan, Oskar, and Scott, and later members Hammon and Rizzo), augmented by a large line-up of supporting musicians and still under the management and production of Jerry Goldstein, and released a new album, ‚òÆ in 1994. In 1996, the group attempted to gain independence from Goldstein, but were unable to do so under the name \\"War\\" which remains a trademark owned by Goldstein and Far Out Productions. In response, Brown, Oskar, Scott, and a returning B.B. Dickerson (who had not worked with War since 1979) adopted a name which referenced one of War's biggest hits: Lowrider Band. They have yet to record a studio album. Lonnie Jordan opted to remain with Goldstein and create a new version of War with himself as the only original member. Some other musicians who had joined between 1983 and 1993 were also part of the new line-up. Both the \\"new\\" War and the Lowrider Band are currently active as live performance acts. 1996 also saw the release of a double CD compilation, Anthology (1970‚Äì1994), later updated in 2003 with a few track substitutions, as The Very Best of War. Another CD compilation from 1999, Grooves and Messages, included a second disc of remixes done by various producers. =21st century= On April 21, 2008, Eric Burdon and Lonnie Jordan reunited for the first time in 37 years to perform a concert as War at the London Royal Albert Hall. The other original surviving members were not asked to be a part of the reunion. The concert coincided with Avenue / Rhino Records' Eric Burdon and War reissues which included Eric Burdon Declares \\"War\\" and The Black-Man's Burdon, plus compilations The Best of Eric Burdon and War and Anthology. In 2008, Lonnie Jordan's edition of War released a live album / DVD of songs originally from 1969 to 1975: Greatest Hits Live. War were unsuccessfully nominated for 2009 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. There were rumours that Burdon would join them again in summer 2009, but it did not happen. In 2011, War played \\"Low Rider\\" and many other hits at the Rack n' Roll in Stamford, Connecticut, with Remember September and Westchester School of Rock. In 2014 the new War released a studio album, Evolutionary. Also in 2014, War was a nominee for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed War among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It is located in Corozal District. The name Xaibe literally means 'crossroads'. The people of the Maya civilization often traversed across the village to reach other Maya villages. The population of the village is very small. The last available data of the population of Xaibe in 2010 revealed that it had a modest population of approximately 1,575 people. There is, however, evidence of the fact that the people belonging to the Maya civilization resided in the Xaibe village. These people then gradually shifted to Mexico, just across the border at the time of the Caste War of Yucat√°n. The village is known for celebrating the Maya tradition Hanal Pixan which means \\"food for the souls\\" also known as Day of the Dead. Disasters Because of its location on the Caribbean coastline, it is vulnerable to tropical cyclones; Hurricane Janet and Hurricane Dean, both Category 5 storms, made landfall near Xaibe village in 1955 and 2007 respectively. The village was badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in 1955 and was substantially rebuilt. Access The nearest airports to the region include the San Pedro International Airport which is only 3 mi (4.82 km) away, the Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport being 60 mi (96.5 km) far and the Chetumal International Airport located 10 mi(16.09 km) away at neighboring country Mexico. The cities and towns close to Xaibe are Xcanluum, Patchakan, Chan Chen, Carolina, Calcutta, San Antonio, Ranchito and San Andres. Xaibe is also located only 2.5 mi (4 km) from the District's Capital, Corozal Town located at the Corozal bay. Education There is only one school located within the village limits: Xaibe Roman Catholic School(Xaibe R.C. School). The school has three main divisions: Infant Division, Middle Division, and Upper Division. Infant Division is divided into Infant I, Infant II, and Standard I, where kids from five to seven years old attend. Middle Division comprises Standard II and Standard III. Students from eight to ten years old attend. Upper Division comprises Standard IV, Standard V, and Standard VI, which are for students from eleven to thirteen years of age. At this last level students start to prepare for their Primary School Examination (PSE) which for primary school graduation. Politics The village as a whole has repeatedly voted the PUP village council, headed by Luciano Noh, for over 6 years and community affairs have ‚Äì according to nearly all residents ‚Äì worked well under the current council. However, as is the case throughout Belize, finances are getting tighter and employment opportunities scarcer, and villagers from Xaibe are not immune to ‚Äòfeeling the pinch‚Äô. Shop-keepers complain of heightened competition between vendors, a situation made worse by the overall decreasing demand for goods as more villagers are forced to rely on contraband Mexican goods solely to be able to provide for themselves and their families as inflation continues to afflict rural communities throughout our country. Economy The majority of villagers made their wealth during the climax of the sugar cane industry, and villagers are grateful to the past economy for having provided houses and land which, in today's tight times, would be impossible to acquire. However, the labour force of Xaibe today has forcibly become more fluid, adjusting to new industries and job vacancies that will at least provide a bare minimum salary, such as at the nearby Fruta Bomba papaya farm, and in the retail and service industry in the Free Zone and border Casinos. For those who have not been able to secure employment locally, many have left the village to join more promising tourist industries in the Cayes and elsewhere in the country, although the current economic crisis is warranting many of these to suffer un- (or under-) employment too.  Climate  The climate in Xaibe is subtropical, similar to that in central or south Florida. In winter, temperatures may drop to the high 50s F at night, but there's never a frost. In spring and summer, the thermometer may hit the low 90s at midday and drop only to the 70s at night.

Rustin worked with A. Philip Randolph on the March on Washington Movement, in 1941, to press for an end to racial discrimination in employment. Rustin later organized Freedom Rides, and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership and teaching King about nonviolence; he later served as an organizer for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Rustin worked alongside Ella Baker, a co- director of the Crusade for Citizenship, in 1954; and before the Montgomery bus boycott, he helped organize a group, called \\"In Friendship\\", amongst Baker, George Lawrence, Stanley Levison of the American Jewish Congress, and some other labor leaders. \\"In Friendship\\" provided material and legal assistance to those being evicted from their tenant farms and households in Clarendon County, Yazoo, and other places. Rustin became the head of the AFL‚ÄìCIO's A. Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions, and promoted the unionization of African Americans. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time of his death in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti. Rustin was a gay man, who had been arrested, early in his career, for engaging in public sex (in a parked car), though he was posthumously pardoned. Due to criticism over his sexuality, he usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders. In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay causes, speaking at events as an activist and supporter of human rights. Later in life, while still devoted to securing workers' rights, Rustin joined other union leaders in aligning with ideological neoconservatism and (after his death), President Ronald Reagan praised him.Associated Press, \\"Reagan Praises Deceased Civil Rights Leader\\" Justin Va√Øsse, Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement (Harvard University Press, 2010), p.71-75 \\"Table: The Three Ages of Neoconservatism\\" , Neoconservatism: Biography of Movement by Justin Vaisse, official website] On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Early life Rustin was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, to Florence Rustin and Archie Hopkins, but raised by his maternal grandparents, Julia (Davis) and Janifer Rustin, as the ninth of their twelve children; growing up he believed his biological mother was his older sister.Bayard Rustin Biography , (2015), Biography.com. Retrieved 07:37, February 28, 2015 His grandparents were relatively wealthy local caterers who raised Rustin in a large house. Julia Rustin was a Quaker, although she attended her husband's African Methodist Episcopal Church. She was also a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). NAACP leaders such as W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson were frequent guests in the Rustin home. With these influences in his early life, in his youth Rustin campaigned against racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. One of the first documented realizations Rustin had of his sexuality was when he mentioned to his grandmother that he preferred to spend time with males rather than females. She responded, \\"I suppose that's what you need to do\\". In 1932, Rustin entered Wilberforce University, a historically black college (HBCU) in Ohio operated by the AME Church. As a student at Wilberforce, Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike, and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania). Cheyney honored Rustin with a posthumous \\"Doctor of Humane Letters\\" degree at its 2013 commencement. After completing an activist training program conducted by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Rustin moved to Harlem in 1937 and began studying at City College of New York. There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women. He joined the Young Communist League for a small period of time in 1936, before becoming disillusioned with the party. Soon after arriving in New York City, he became a member of Fifteenth Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Rustin was an accomplished tenor vocalist, an asset which earned him admission to both Wilberforce University and Cheyney State Teachers College with music scholarships.D'Emilio 2003, pp. 21, 24. In 1939, he was in the chorus of a short-lived musical that starred Paul Robeson. Blues singer Josh White was also a cast member, and later invited Rustin to join his band, \\"Josh White and the Carolinians\\". This gave Rustin the opportunity to become a regular performer at the Caf√© Society nightclub in Greenwich Village, widening his social and intellectual contacts.D'Emilio 2003, pp. 31‚Äì2. A few albums on Fellowship Records featuring his singing, such as Bayard Rustin Sings a Program of Spirituals, were produced from the 1950s through the 1970s. Political philosophy Rustin's personal philosophy is said to have been inspired by combining Quaker pacifism with socialism (as taught by A. Philip Randolph) and the theory of non-violent protest, popularized by Mahatma Gandhi. Evolving affiliations At the direction of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and its members were active in the civil rights movement for African Americans. The CPUSA, at the time following Stalin's \\"theory of nationalism\\", favored the creation of a separate nation for African-Americans to be located in the American Southeast where the greatest proportion of the black population was concentrated.August Meier and Elliot Rudwick. Black Detroit and the Rise of the UAW. In 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Communist International ordered the CPUSA to abandon civil rights work and focus on supporting U.S. entry into World War II. Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas, particularly A. Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; another socialist mentor was the pacifist A. J. Muste, leader of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR). FOR hired Rustin as a race relation secretary in the late summer of 1941. The three of them proposed a march on Washington in 1941 to protest racial segregation in the armed forces and widespread discrimination in employment. Meeting with President Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully and politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred. To prove their good faith, the organizers canceled the planned march after Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (the Fair Employment Act), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies. The leader of the organizers, Randolph, canceled the march against Rustin's advisement. The armed forces were not desegregated until 1948, under an Executive Order issued by President Harry S. Truman. Randolph felt that FOR had succeeded in their goal and wanted to dissolve the committee. Again, Rustin disagreed with him and voiced his differing opinion in a national press conference, which he later regretted. Rustin traveled to California to help protect the property of the more than 120,000 Japanese Americans (most of whom were native-born citizens) who had been imprisoned in internment camps. Impressed with Rustin's organizational skills, A.J. Muste appointed him as FOR's secretary for student and general affairs. Rustin was also a pioneer in the movement to desegregate interstate bus travel. In 1942, he boarded a bus in Louisville, bound for Nashville, and sat in the second row. A number of drivers asked him to move to the back, according to Southern practice of Jim Crow, but Rustin refused. The bus was stopped by police 13 miles north of Nashville and Rustin was arrested. He was beaten and taken to the police station, but was released uncharged. reprinted in He spoke about his decision to be arrested, and how that moment also clarified his witness as a gay person, in an interview with the Washington Blade: In 1942, Rustin assisted two other FOR staffers, George Houser and James Farmer, and activist Bernice Fisher as they formed the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Rustin was not a direct founder, but later described \\"an uncle of CORE\\". CORE had been conceived as a pacifist organization based on the writings of Mohandas Gandhi, who used non-violent resistance against British rule in India. CORE was also influenced by his protege Krishnalal Shridharani's book War without Violence. As declared pacifists who refused induction into the military, Rustin, Houser, and other members of FOR and CORE were convicted of violating the Selective Service Act. From 1944 to 1946, Rustin was imprisoned in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, where he organized protests against segregated dining facilities. During his incarceration, he also organized FOR's Free India Committee. After his release from prison, he was frequently arrested for protesting against British colonial rule, in both India and Africa. Just before a trip to Africa while college secretary of the FOR, Rustin recorded a 10-inch LP for the Fellowship Records label. He sang spirituals and Elizabethan songs, accompanied on the harpsichord by Margaret Davison.from liner notes, Fellowship Records 102 Influence on the Civil Rights Movement Rustin and Houser organized the Journey of Reconciliation in 1947. This was the first of the Freedom Rides to test the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel as unconstitutional. Rustin and CORE executive secretary George Houser recruited a team of fourteen men, divided equally by race, to ride in pairs through Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.Podair 2009, pp 27 The NAACP opposed CORE's Gandhian tactics as too meek. Participants in the Journey of Reconciliation were arrested several times. Arrested with Jewish activist Igal Roodenko, Rustin served twenty-two days on a chain gang in North Carolina for violating state Jim Crow laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation. reprinted in In 1948, Rustin traveled to India to learn techniques of nonviolent civil resistance directly from the leaders of the Gandhian movement. The conference had been organized before Gandhi's assassination earlier that year. Between 1947 and 1952, Rustin also met with leaders of independence movements in Ghana and Nigeria. In 1951, he formed the Committee to Support South African Resistance, which later became the American Committee on Africa. Rustin was arrested in Pasadena, California, in 1953 for sexual activity with another man in a parked car. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of \\"sex perversion\\" (as sodomy was officially referred to in California then, even if consensual) and served 60 days in jail. This was the first time that his homosexuality had come to public attention. He had been and remained candid in private about his sexuality, although homosexual activity was still criminalized throughout the United States. Rustin resigned from the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) because of his convictions. They also greatly affected Rustin's relationship with A. J. Muste, the director of the FOR. Muste had already tried to change Rustin's sexuality earlier in their relationship with no success. Later in Rustin's life they continued their relationship with more tension than they previously had. Rustin became the executive secretary of the War Resisters League. Later, in Montana, an American Legion chapter made his conviction in Pasadena public to try to cancel his lectures in the state. Rustin served as an unidentified member of the American Friends Service Committee's task force to write \\"Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence,\\" published in 1955. This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon pacifist essays in the United States. Rustin had wanted to keep his participation quiet, as he believed that his known sexual orientation would be used by critics as an excuse to compromise the 71-page pamphlet when it was published. It analyzed the Cold War and the American response to it, and recommended non-violent solutions. Rustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister Martin Luther King Jr. of the Baptist Church on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, which became known as the Montgomery bus boycott. According to Rustin, \\"I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns.\\" Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun.\\"Bayard Rustin ‚Äì Who Is This Man\\" , State of the Reunion, radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40‚Äì2:10. Retrieved March 16, 2011. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Rustin also reflected that his integrative ideology began to differ from King's. He believed a social movement \\"has to be based on the collective needs of people at this time, regardless of color, creed, race.\\" The following year, Rustin and King began organizing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. After the organization of the SCLC, Rustin and King planned a march. However, they did not plan on the march to be included in the Democratic National Convention. This did not sit well with U.S. Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Powell threatened to leak to the press rumors of a fake affair between Rustin and King. King, acting in his interests, cancelled the march, and Rustin left his position in the SCLC. King received criticism for this action from Harper's magazine, which wrote about him, \\"Lost much moral credit ... in the eyes of the young\\". Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his convictions were a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership. Rustin did not let this setback change his direction in the movement. Leaders of the March on Washington posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln on August 28, 1963 =March on Washington= Rustin and Cleveland Robinson of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 7, 1963 Despite shunning from some civil rights leaders, A few weeks before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963, South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond railed against Rustin as a \\"Communist, draft-dodger, and homosexual,\\" and had his entire Pasadena arrest file entered in the record. Thurmond also produced a Federal Bureau of Investigation photograph of Rustin talking to King while King was bathing, to imply that there was a same-sex relationship between the two. Both men denied the allegation of an affair. Rustin became involved in the March on Washington in 1962 when he was recruited by A. Philip Randolph. The march was planned to be a commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier. Rustin was instrumental in organizing the march. He drilled off-duty police officers as marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium speakers. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Rachelle Horowitz were aides. Despite King's support, NAACP chairman Roy Wilkins did not want Rustin to receive any public credit for his role in planning the march. Roy Wilkins said, \\"This march is of such importance that we must not put a person of his liabilities at the head.\\" Because of this conflict, Randolph served as the director of the march and Rustin as his deputy. During the planning of the march, Rustin feared his previous legal issues would pose a threat to the march. U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond attacked him about them three weeks before the march. Nevertheless, Rustin did become well known. On September 6, 1963, a photograph of Rustin and Randolph appeared on the cover of Life magazine, identifying them as \\"the leaders\\" of the March.Life Magazine , September 6, 1963. =New York City school boycott= At the beginning of 1964, Reverend Milton Galamison and other Harlem community leaders invited Rustin to coordinate a citywide boycott of public schools to protest their de facto segregation. Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the United Federation of Teachers Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964 boycott. Historian Daniel Perlstein notes that \\"newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protesters.\\" It was, Rustin stated, and newspapers reported, \\"the largest civil rights demonstration\\" in American history. Rustin said that \\"the movement to integrate the schools will create far-reaching benefits\\" for teachers as well as students.Daniel Perlstein, \\"The dead end of despair: Bayard Rustin, the 1968 New York school crisis, and the struggle for racial justice\\" , New York City government The protest demanded complete integration of the city's schools (which would require some whites to attend schools in black neighborhoods), and it challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals. An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring, and soon abandoned the coalition. Rustin organized a May March 18 which called for \\"maximum possible\\" integration. Perlstein recounts. \\"This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the construction of larger schools and the replacement of junior high schools with middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the May rally, yet only four thousand protesters showed up, and the Board of Education was no more responsive to the conciliatory May demonstration than to the earlier, more confrontational boycott.\\" When Rustin was invited to speak at the University of Virginia in 1964, school administrators tried to ban him, out of fear that he would organize a school boycott there. =From protest to politics= In the spring of 1964, Rev. Martin Luther King was considering hiring Rustin as executive director of SCLC, but was advised against it by Stanley Levison, a longtime activist friend of Rustin's. He opposed the hire because of what he considered Rustin's growing devotion to the political theorist Max Shachtman. \\"Shachtmanites\\" have been described as an ideologically cultish group with ardently anti-communist positions, and attachments to the Democratic Party and the AFL-CIO.Taylor Branch, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-1965 (Simon & Schuster, 1999), p. 292-293 At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which followed Freedom Summer in Mississippi, Rustin became an adviser to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP); they were trying to gain recognition as the legitimate, non-Jim Crow delegation from their state, where blacks had been officially disenfranchised since the turn of the century (as they were generally throughout the South) and excluded from the official political system. DNC leaders Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey offered only two non-voting seats to the MFDP, with the official seating going to the regular segregationist Mississippi delegation. Rustin, following a line set by ShachtmanMartin Duberman, A Saving Remnant: The Radical Lives of Barbara Deming and David McReynolds (The New Press, 2013) and AFL-CIO leaders, urged the MFDP to take the offer. MFDP leaders, including Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses, angrily rejected the arrangement; many of their supporters became highly suspicious of Rustin. Rustin's attempt to compromise appealed to the Democratic Party leadership. Rustin, 1965 After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Rustin advocated closer ties between the civil rights movement and the Democratic Party, specifically the party's base among the white working class, many of whom still had strong union affiliations. With Tom Kahn, Rustin wrote an influential article in 1964 called \\"From Protest to Politics,\\" published in Commentary magazine; it analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote presciently that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban African- American working class, particularly in northern states. He believed that the working class had to collaborate across racial lines for common economic goals. His prophecy has been proven right in the dislocation and loss of jobs for many urban African Americans due to restructuring of industry in the coming decades. Rustin believed that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it was time to move from protest to politics. Rustin's analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.Staughton Lynd, another civil rights activist, responded with an article entitled, \\"Coalition Politics or Nonviolent Revolution?\\" Rustin argued that since black people could now legally sit in the restaurant after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they needed to be able to afford service financially. He believed that a coalition of progressive forces to move the Democratic Party forward was needed to change the economic structure. He also argued that the African- American community was threatened by the appeal of identity politics, particularly the rise of \\"Black power.\\" He thought this position was a fantasy of middle-class black people that repeated the political and moral errors of previous black nationalists, while alienating the white allies needed by the African-American community. Nation editor and Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy noted later that, while Rustin had a general \\"disdain of nationalism,\\" he had a \\"very different attitude toward Jewish nationalism\\" and was \\"unflaggingly supportive of Zionism.\\"Randall Kennedy, \\"From Protest to Patronage\\" , The Nation, September 11, 2003 Commentary editor-in-chief Norman Podhoretz had commissioned the article from Rustin, and the two men remained intellectually and personally aligned for the next 20 years. Podhoretz and the magazine promoted the neoconservative movement, which had implications for civil rights initiatives as well as other economic aspects of the society. In 1985, Rustin publicly praised Podhoretz for his refusal to \\"pander to minority groups\\" and for opposing affirmative action quotas in hiring as well as black studies programs in colleges.Walter Goodman, \\"Podhoretz on 25 Years at Commentary\\" , The New York Times, January 31, 1985 Because of these positions, Rustin was criticized as a \\"sell-out\\" by many of his former colleagues in the civil rights movement, especially those connected to grassroots organizing. They charged that he was lured by the material comforts that came with a less radical and more professional type of activism. While biographer John D'Emilio rejects these characterizations, Randall Kennedy wrote in a 2003 article that descriptions of Rustin as \\"a bought man\\" are \\"at least partly true.\\" =Labor movement: Unions and social democracy= Rustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the African-American community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics. He was the founder and became the Director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper. On the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American social democracy. In early 1972, he became a national co-chairman of the Socialist Party of America. In December 1972, when the Socialist Party changed its name to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) by a vote of 73‚Äì34, Rustin continued to serve as national co-chairman, along with Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). (limited free access) In his opening speech to the December 1972 Convention, Co-Chairman Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the \\"reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration\\"; Rustin also criticized the \\"irresponsibility and √©litism of the 'New Politics' liberals\\". In later years, Rustin served as the national chairman of SDUSA. During the 1960s, Rustin was a member of the League for Industrial Democracy. He would remain a member for years, and became vice president during the 1980s. =Foreign policy= Like many liberals and some socialists, Rustin supported President Lyndon B. Johnson's containment policy against communism, while criticizing specific conduct of this policy. In particular, to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in Vietnam, Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the Vietnam War, while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being \\"angered and humiliated by the kind of war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages.\\"Rustin 2012, pp. 291-2 Along with Allard Lowenstein and Norman Thomas, Rustin worked with the CIA-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, Juan Bosch.Nathan Glazer \\"A Word From Our Sponsor: Review of Hugh Wilford's The Mighty Wurlitzer\\" The New York Times, January 20, 2008 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and election monitor for Freedom House. In 1970, Rustin called for the U.S. to send military jets in the fight against Arab states by Israel; referring to a New York Times article he authored, Rustin wrote to Prime Minister Golda Meir \\"...I hope that the ad will also have an effect on a serious domestic question: namely, the relations between the Jewish and the Negro communities in America.\\" Rustin was concerned about unity between two groups that he argued faced discrimination in America and abroad, and also believed that Israel's democratic ideals were proof that justice and equality would prevail in the Arab territories despite the atrocities of war. His former colleagues in the peace movement considered it to be a profound betrayal of Rustin's nonviolent ideals.Matthew Arlyck \\"Review of I Must Resist: Letters of Bayard Rustin\\" Fellowship of Reconciliation website Rustin maintained his strongly anti-Soviet and anti-communist views later in his life, especially with regard to Africa. Rustin co-wrote with Carl Gershman (a former director of Social Democrats, USA and future Ronald Reagan appointee) an essay entitled \\"Africa, Soviet Imperialism & the Retreat of American Power,\\" in which he decried Russian and Cuban involvement in the Angolan Civil War and defended the military intervention by apartheid South Africa on behalf of the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). \\"And if a South African force did intervene at the urging of black leaders and on the side of the forces that clearly represent the black majority in Angola, to counter a non-African army of Cubans ten times its size, by what standard of political judgment is this immoral?\\" Rustin accused the Soviet Union of a classic imperialist agenda in Africa in pursuit of economic resources and vital sea lanes, and called the Carter Administration \\"hypocritical\\" for claiming to be committed to the welfare of blacks while doing too little to thwart Russian and Cuban expansion throughout Africa. In 1976, Rustin helped found the Committee on the Present Danger (CPD) with Paul Nitze, leader of the CIAs Team B project. CPD promoted Team B's controversial intelligence claims about Soviet foreign policy, using them as an argument against arms control agreements such as SALT II. This cemented Rustin's leading role in the neoconservative movement.John Ehrman, The Rise of Neoconservatism: Intellectuals and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1994 (Yale University Press, 1996), p. 107-114 = Soviet Jewry movement = The plight of Jews in the Soviet Union reminded Rustin of the struggles that blacks faced in the United States. Soviet Jews faced many of the same forms of discrimination in employment, education, and housing, while also being prisoners within their own country by being denied the chance to emigrate by Soviet authorities.Podair, Jerald E. \\"Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer\\" (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Pub., 2009). After seeing the injustice that Soviet Jews faced, Rustin became a leading voice in advocating for the movement of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel. He worked closely with Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, who introduced legislation that tied trade relations with the Soviet Union to their treatment of Jews.Podair 2009, pp. 99 In 1966 he chaired the historic Ad hoc Commission on Rights of Soviet Jews organized by the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, leading a panel of six jurors in the commission's public tribunal on Jewish life in the Soviet Union. Members of the panel included Telford Taylor, the Nuremberg war trial prosecutor and Columbia University professor of law, Dr. John C. Bennett, president of the Union Theological Seminary; Reverend George B. Ford, pastor emeritus of the Corpus Christi Church; Samuel Fishman representing United Automobile Workers; and Norman Thomas, veteran Socialist leader. The commission collected testimonies from Soviet Jews and compiled them into a report that was delivered to the secretary general of the United Nations. The report urged the international community to demand that the Soviet authorities allow Jews to practice their religion, preserve their culture, and to emigrate from the USSR at their will. The testimonies from Soviet Jews were published by Moshe Decter, the executive secretary of the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, in a book‚Äî Redemption! Jewish freedom letters from Russia, with a foreword by Rustin. Through the 1970s and 1980s Rustin wrote several articles on the subject of Soviet Jewry and appeared at Soviet Jewry movement rallies, demonstrations, vigils, and conferences, in the United States and abroad. He co-sponsored the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry. Rustin allied with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an outspoken advocate for Soviet Jewry, and worked closely with Senator Henry Jackson, informing the Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment‚Äîa vital legislation that restricted United States trade with the Soviet Union in relation to its treatment of Jews. =Gay rights= He also testified on behalf of New York State's Gay Rights Bill. In 1986, he gave a speech \\"The New Niggers Are Gays\\", in which he asserted, While there is a recurring tendency to describe Rustin as a pioneering \\"out gay man\\", the truth is more complex. In 1986, Rustin was invited to contribute to the book In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology. He declined, explaining > I was not involved in the struggle for gay rights as a youth... I did not > \\"come out of the closet\\" voluntarily‚Äîcircumstances forced me out. While I > have no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be > dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the > struggle for gay rights... I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be > a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly > influenced my role as an activist.Yasmin Nair, \\"Bayard Rustin: A complex > legacy\\" Windy City Times, March 3, 2012 Rustin did not engage in any gay rights activism until the 1980s. He was urged to do so by his partner Walter Naegle, who has said that \\"I think that if I hadn't been in the office at that time, when these invitations [from gay organizations] came in, he probably wouldn't have done them.\\" Due to the lack of marriage equality at the time, Rustin and Naegle took the then not unusual step to solidify their partnership and protect their union legally through adoption: in 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time. Naegle explained that Bayard > \\"... was concerned about protecting my rights, because gay people had no > protection. At that time, marriage between a same-sex couple was > inconceivable. And so he adopted me, legally adopted me, in 1982. > > That was the only thing we could do to kind of legalize our relationship. We > actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small > child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. > They had to send a social worker to our home. When the social worker > arrived, she had to sit us down to talk to us to make sure that this was a > fit home. Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s, said \\"I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. That was rare in those days. Rare.\\" Death and beliefs Rustin speaks with civil rights activists before a demonstration, 1964 Rustin died on August 24, 1987, of a perforated appendix. An obituary in The New York Times reported, \\"Looking back at his career, Mr. Rustin, a Quaker, once wrote: 'The principal factors which influenced my life are 1) nonviolent tactics; 2) constitutional means; 3) democratic procedures; 4) respect for human personality; 5) a belief that all people are one.'\\"\\"Bayard Rustin Is Dead at 75; Pacifist and a Rights Activist\\" , New York Times Rustin was survived by Walter Naegle, his partner of ten years. President Ronald Reagan issued a statement on Rustin's death, praising his work for civil rights and \\"for human rights throughout the world\\". He added that Rustin \\"was denounced by former friends, because he never gave up his conviction that minorities in America could and would succeed based on their individual merit.\\" Legacy Rustin \\"faded from the shortlist of well- known civil rights lions\\", in part because he was active behind the scenes, and also because of public discomfort with his sexual orientation and former communist membership. In addition, Rustin's tilt toward neo-conservatism in the late 1960s led him into disagreement with most civil rights leaders. But, the 2003 documentary film Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin, a Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize nominee, and the March 2012 centennial of Rustin's birth have contributed to renewed recognition of his extensive contributions. Rustin served as chairman of Social Democrats, USA, which, The Washington Post wrote in 2013, \\"was a breeding ground for many neoconservatives\\".Dylan Matthews, \\"Meet Bayard Rustin\\", Washingtonpost.com, August 28, 2013 In the 1970s, he was among the second-age neoconservatives, and in 1979, was elevated to vice-chair of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, an organization that helped revive the Committee on the Present Danger.Justin Va√Øsse, Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 91 \\"Coalition for a Democratic Majority\\" , Right Web, Institute for Policy Studies According to Daniel Richman, former clerk for United States Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, Marshall's friendship with Rustin, who was open about his homosexuality, played a significant role in Marshall's dissent from the court's 5‚Äì4 decision upholding the constitutionality of state sodomy laws in the later overturned 1986 case Bowers v. Hardwick. Several buildings have been named in honor of Rustin, including the Bayard Rustin Educational Complex located in Chelsea, Manhattan;\\"H.S. 440 Bayard Rustin Educational Complex\\" at InsideSchools.org Bayard Rustin High School in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Bayard Rustin Library at the Affirmations Gay/Lesbian Community Center in Ferndale, Michigan; the Bayard Rustin Social Justice Center in Conway, Arkansas, and the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice in Princeton, New Jersey. Rustin is one of two men who have both participated in the Penn Relays and had a school, West Chester Rustin High School, named in his honor that participates in the Relays. =1990s and 2000s= In July 2007, with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin, a group of San Francisco Bay Area African-American LGBT community leaders officially formed the Bayard Rustin LGBT Coalition (BRC), to promote greater participation in the electoral process, advance civil and human rights issues, and promote the legacy of Rustin. In addition, the Bayard Rustin Center for LGBTQA Activism, Awareness, and Reconciliation is located at Guilford College, a Quaker school. Formerly the Queer and Allied Resource Center, the center was rededicated in March 2011 with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin and featured a keynote address by social justice activist Mandy Carter. A 1998 anthology movie, Out of the Past, featured letters and archive footage of Rustin. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker is placed at Lincoln and Montgomery Avenues, West Chester, Pennsylvania; the marker commemorating his accomplishments lies on the grounds of Henderson High School, which he attended. In 2006, Bayard Rustin High School opened in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Bayard Rustin was a 1932 graduate of West Chester High School. =2010s= In 2012, Rustin was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBTQ history and people. He was posthumously awarded honorary membership into Delta Phi Upsilon, a fraternity for gay, bisexual, and progressive men. In 2013, Rustin was selected as an honoree in the United States Department of Labor Hall of Honor. On August 8, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award in the United States. The citation in the press release stated: > Bayard Rustin was an unyielding activist for civil rights, dignity, and > equality for all. An advisor to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he > promoted nonviolent resistance, participated in one of the first Freedom > Rides, organized the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and > fought tirelessly for marginalized communities at home and abroad. As an > openly gay African American, Mr. Rustin stood at the intersection of several > of the fights for equal rights. At the White House ceremony on November 20, 2013, President Obama presented Rustin's award to Walter Naegle, his partner of ten years at the time of Rustin's death. In 2014 Rustin was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco‚Äôs Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \\"made significant contributions in their fields.\\" In 2016, the Greensboro Mural Project, created a mural in honor of Rustin located at New Garden Friends Meeting in Greensboro, North Carolina. John Hunter designed the mural, their first, honoring the legacy of Rustin. In April 2018, the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland voted to name the Bayard Rustin Elementary School after Rustin. Canadian writer Steven Elliott Jackson wrote a play that stages an imaginary meeting and one-night- stand between Rustin and Walter Jenkins of the Johnson administration called The Seat Next to the King. The play won the award for Best Play at the 2017 Toronto Fringe Festival. In June 2019, Rustin was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall‚Äôs unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. In 2019, the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice (BRCSJ) opened its doors with the Rustin Estate, and Rustin's partner Walter Naegle joining as Community Liaison. The BRCSJ is a community activist center, and safe-space for LGBTQ kids, intersectional families, and marginalized people. =2020s= In January 2020, California State Senator Scott Wiener, chair of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus, and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, chair of the California Legislative Black Caucus, called for Governor Gavin Newsom to issue a pardon for Rustin‚Äôs arrest for having sex with men, citing Rustin's legacy as a civil rights icon. Newsom issued the pardon on 5 February while also announcing a new process for fast- tracking pardons for those convicted under historical laws making homosexuality illegal.

Active for five decades, with their greatest success in the 1970s, the group's current lineup consists of founding members Tom Johnston (guitars, vocals) and Patrick Simmons (guitars, vocals), veteran member Michael McDonald (keyboards, vocals), longtime member John McFee (guitars, pedal steel, violin, backing vocals), and touring musicians including John Cowan (bass, vocals), Bill Payne (keyboards), Marc Russo (saxophones), Ed Toth (drums), and Marc Qui√±ones (percussion). The band's history can be roughly divided into three eras. From 1970 to 1975 it featured lead vocalist Johnston and a mainstream rock and roll sound with elements of folk, country and R&B.; Johnston left the group in 1977 due to health reasons, and was replaced by Michael McDonald, whose interest in soul music changed the band's sound until it broke up in 1982 with Simmons being the only constant member having appeared on all of their albums. In 1987, the Doobie Brothers reformed with Johnston back in the fold; McDonald, who had previously made several guest appearances since their reformation, returned to the band full-time in 2019 for their upcoming 50th anniversary tour. Every incarnation of the group has emphasized vocal harmonies. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on November 7, 2020. The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. Founding members John Hartman and Dave Shogren, Tiran Porter, Michael Hossack, Keith Knudsen and Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter are former members of the band. Career =Original incarnation= Drummer John Hartman arrived in California determined to meet Skip Spence of Moby Grape and join an aborted Grape reunion. Spence introduced Hartman to singer, guitarist, and songwriter Tom Johnston and the two proceeded to form the nucleus of what would become the Doobie Brothers. Johnston and Hartman called their fledgling group \\"Pud\\" and experimented with lineups (occasionally including Spence) and styles as they performed in and around San Jose. They were mostly a power trio (along with bassist Greg Murphy) but briefly worked with a horn section. In 1970, they teamed up with singer, guitarist, and songwriter Patrick Simmons and bassist Dave Shogren. Simmons had belonged to several area groups (among them \\"Scratch\\", an acoustic trio with future Doobies bassist Tiran Porter) and also performed as a solo artist. He was already an accomplished fingerstyle player whose approach to the instrument complemented Johnston's rhythmic R&B; strumming. While still playing locally around San Jose, the group adopted the name \\"Doobie Brothers\\". Musician Keith \\"Dyno\\" Rosen, who lived with or next-door to the band, came up with the name after the band had difficulty coming up with one on their own. According to Tom Johnston, Rosen said, \\"Why don't you call yourself the Doobie Brothers because you're always smoking pot?\\" Hartman has said he wasn't involved with choosing the name, and didn't know that \\"doobie\\" meant a marijuana joint until Rosen told him. Everyone in the band agreed that \\"Doobie Brothers\\" was a \\"dumb\\" or \\"stupid\\" name. Simmons has said the band intended to use the name only for a few early performances until they came up with something better, but they never did. The Doobie Brothers improved their playing by performing live all over Northern California in 1970. They attracted a particularly strong following among local chapters of the Hells Angels and got a recurring gig at one of the bikers' favorite venues, the Chateau Libert√© in the Santa Cruz mountains, playing there through the summer of 1970 (although some of these concerts did not include all band members and were of an impromptu nature). A set of demos, which showcased fuzz-toned dual lead electric guitars, three-part harmonies and Hartman's drumming, caught the ear of Warner Brothers' staff A & R representative Ted Templeman, and eventually earned the group a contract at Warner Bros. Records before the year was out. The band's image originally reflected that of their biggest fans‚Äîleather jackets and motorcycles. Released in April 1971, their self- titled debut album departed significantly from that image and their live sound of the period. Produced at Pacific Recorders in San Mateo, the album, which failed to chart, emphasized acoustic guitars and reflected country influences. The leadoff song \\"Nobody\\", the band's first single, has surfaced in their live set several times over the ensuing decades. Most recently, this song was re- recorded and added to their 2010 album World Gone Crazy. In the late spring/summer of 1971, their record label sent the Doobies out on their first national tour in tandem with the group Mother Earth, the \\"Mother Brothers Tour\\". Also in 1971, the group toyed with the idea of adding a second drummer, supplementing Hartman's drumming on some of their shows with that of United States Navy veteran Michael Hossack while still touring behind their first album. Moving to Warner Brothers' newly-acquired Amigo Studios in North Hollywood starting in late October 1971, the band recorded several songs for their next album with Shogren on bass, guitar, and background vocals, but Shogren left after disagreements with the group's producer, Ted Templeman. Shogren was replaced in December 1971 with singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Tiran Porter, while Hossack was added to the lineup at the same time as a regular. Porter and Hossack were both stalwarts of the Northern California music scene, Porter having previously played in Scratch with Simmons. Porter brought a funkier bass style and added his husky baritone to the voices of Johnston and Simmons, resulting in a rich three-part blend. The band's second album, Toulouse Street (which contained the hits \\"Listen to the Music\\" and \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\"), brought their breakthrough success after its release in July 1972. In collaboration with manager Bruce Cohn, producer Ted Templeman and engineer Donn Landee, the band put forward a more polished and eclectic set of songs. Pianist Bill Payne of Little Feat contributed keyboards for the first time, beginning a decades-long collaboration that included many recording sessions and even a two-week stint touring with the band in early 1974.Jackson, Blair. \\"Little Feat Article - Feb 2001\\" ‚Äì MixOnline.com. A string of hits followed, including Johnston's \\"Long Train Runnin'\\" and \\"China Grove\\", from the 1973 album The Captain and Me. Other noteworthy songs on the album were Simmons' country-ish ode \\"South City Midnight Lady\\" and the explosive, hard rocking raveup \\"Without You\\", for which the entire band received songwriting credit. Onstage, the latter song sometimes stretched into a 15-minute jam with additional lyrics completely ad- libbed by Johnston. A 1973 appearance on the debut episode of the television music variety show Don Kirshner's Rock Concert featured one such performance of the tune. In the midst of recording sessions for their next album, 1974's What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits, and rehearsals for a 1973 fall tour, Hossack abruptly departed the band, citing burnout from constant touring. Drummer, songwriter and vocalist Keith Knudsen (who previously drummed for Lee Michaels of \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\" fame) was recruited promptly in September 1973 and left with the Doobies on a major tour a few weeks later (Hossack subsequently replaced Knudsen in the band Bonaroo, which served as an opening act for the Doobies shortly thereafter). Both Hossack's drums and Knudsen's voice are heard on Vices. Doobie Bros in Dutch TV show TopPop (January 1974) In 1974, Steely Dan co-lead guitarist Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter learned that his band was retiring from the road and that Donald Fagen and Walter Becker intended to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. In need of a steady gig, he joined the Doobie Brothers as third lead guitarist in the middle of their current tour. He had previously worked with the band in the studio, adding pedal steel guitar to both Captain (\\"South City Midnight Lady\\") and Vices (\\"Black Water\\", \\"Tell Me What You Want\\") and was already playing with the band as a special guest during that year's tour. Vices included the band's first No. 1 single, Simmons' signature tune \\"Black Water\\". It topped the charts in March 1975 and eventually propelled the album to multi-platinum status. Johnston's lyrical \\"Another Park, Another Sunday\\" (as a single, it featured \\"Black Water\\" as the B-side) and his horn-driven funk song \\"Eyes of Silver\\" also charted the year before at numbers 32 & 52, respectively. During this period and for several subsequent tours, the Doobies were often supported on stage by Stax Records legends The Memphis Horns. Live recordings with the horn section have aired on radio on the King Biscuit Flower Hour, but none have been officially released. The Memphis Horns also appeared as session players on multiple Doobies albums. By the end of 1974, Johnston's health was suffering from the rigors of the road. He was absent when the band joined The Beach Boys, Chicago, and Olivia Newton-John on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve that December. By then, the western-themed Stampede had been completed for release in 1975. It featured yet another hit single, Johnston's cover of the Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland-written Motown hit \\"Take Me in Your Arms\\" (originally sung by Kim Weston and also covered by the Isley Brothers, Blood Sweat and Tears and Mother Earth). Simmons contributed the atmospheric \\"I Cheat the Hangman\\", as well as \\"Neal's Fandango\\", an ode to Santa Cruz, Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady. Ry Cooder added his slide guitar to Johnston's cowboy song, \\"Rainy Day Crossroad Blues\\". By the start of the Spring 1975 promotional tour for Stampede, Johnston's condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole: singer, songwriter and keyboardist Michael McDonald. Simmons, Knudsen, Porter and McDonald divvied up and sang Johnston's parts on tour while Simmons and Baxter shared lead guitar chores.Menn, Don. \\"GP Flashback : The Doobie Brothers, June 1976\\" ‚Äì Guitar Player Magazine.Blackett, Matt. \\"The Doobie Brothers\\" ‚Äì Guitar Player Magazine. =Michael McDonald years= Under contract to release another album in 1976, the Doobies were at a crossroads. Their primary songwriter and singer remained unavailable, so they turned to McDonald and Porter for material to supplement that of Simmons. The resulting LP, Takin' It to the Streets, debuted a radical change in their sound. Their electric-guitar-based rock and roll gave way to a more soft rock and blue-eyed soul sound, emphasizing keyboards and horns and subtler, more syncopated rhythms. Baxter contributed jazz-inflected guitar stylings reminiscent of Steely Dan, along with unusual, complex harmony and longer, more developed melody. Above all, McDonald's voice became the band's new signature sound. Takin' It to the Streets featured McDonald's title track and \\"It Keeps You Runnin'\\", both hits. (A second version of \\"It Keeps You Runnin'\\", performed by Carly Simon, appeared on her album Another Passenger, with the Doobies backing her.) Bassist Porter wrote and sang \\"For Someone Special\\" as a tribute to the absent Johnston. A greatest hits compilation, Best of the Doobies, followed before year's end. (In 1996, the Recording Industry Association of America certified Best of the Doobies \\"Diamond\\" for sales in excess of 10 million units.) Their new sound was further refined and McDonald's dominant role cemented with 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line. It featured a cover of the Motown classic \\"Little Darling (I Need You)\\" and \\"Echoes of Love\\", which had been written by Willie Mitchell for, but not recorded by, Al Green. Mitchell (then of the Memphis Horns) and Earl Randle had both worked with Green a good bit. Simmons added some music and lyrics, co-writing the finished version with Mitchell and Randle; the song was later covered not just by the Pointer Sisters but by Lyn Paul, the ex-New Seekers vocalist. The album also featured the song \\"You Belong to Me\\" (co- written by McDonald and Carly Simon, who had a hit with her own version of the tune). To help promote Fault Line, the band performed live on the PBS show Soundstage. Baxter used an early type of guitar synthesizer (made by Roland) on many of the tracks (especially the title track and \\"China Grove\\"). The combination of McDonald's cerebral approach to harmony, funkier beats and R&B; vocal flavor, along with Baxter's guitar pyrotechnics, pushed the band away from the more proletarian biker-bong-boogie style that made them popular originally. The use of complex jazz chords, built on McDonald's thoroughly composed keyboard parts and tempered by strong pop hooks, resulted in an album that, though not really jazz, had a distinctly urban contemporary finish, adding the flavor of the \\"cool jazz\\" era to a pop setting. The Doobie Brothers with the addition of Michael McDonald in 1976 Both Streets and Fault Line reflected Johnston's diminished role in the group following his illness. Restored to fitness and briefly back in the fold, he contributed one original song to Streets (\\"Turn It Loose\\"), and also sang a verse on Simmons' tune \\"Wheels of Fortune\\". He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (documented in a concert filmed that year at the Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts of which appear occasionally on VH1 Classic), but was sidelined once again that fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston's songs appeared on Fault Line, though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Finally, before Fault Line was released, Johnston had his songs removed and he left the band that he co-founded, though he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album's inner sleeve band photo. He embarked on a solo career that eventually yielded one modestly successful 1979 Warner Brothers album, Everything You've Heard is True, which featured the single \\"Savannah Nights\\", and the less successful album Still Feels Good in 1981. During this period of transition, the band also elevated former roadie Bobby LaKind to onstage backup vocalist and percussionist. In the studio, LaKind first contributed percussion to Streets but had been a member of the band's lighting crew since 1974. Additionally, in early 1978, the band appeared as themselves in two episodes of the ABC sitcom What's Happening!!, performing \\"Little Darlin' (I Need You)\\", \\"Black Water\\", \\"Takin' It to the Streets\\", and \\"Take Me in Your Arms\\". After almost a decade on the road, and with seven albums under their belts, the Doobies' career soared with the success of their next album, 1978's Minute by Minute. It spent five weeks atop the charts and dominated several radio formats for the better part of two years. McDonald's song \\"What a Fool Believes\\", written with Kenny Loggins, was the band's second No. 1 single and earned the songwriting duo (along with producer Ted Templeman) a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The album won a Grammy for Pop Vocal Performance by a Group and was nominated for Album of the Year. Both \\"What a Fool Believes\\" and the title track were nominated for Song of the Year, with \\"What a Fool Believes\\" winning the award. Among the other memorable songs on the album are \\"Here to Love You\\", \\"Dependin' On You\\" (co- written by McDonald and Simmons), \\"Steamer Lane Breakdown\\" (a Simmons bluegrass instrumental) and McDonald's \\"How Do the Fools Survive?\\" (co-written by Carole Bayer Sager). Nicolette Larson and departed former bandleader Johnston contributed guest vocals on the album. Minute by Minute's triumph was bittersweet because it coincided with the near-dissolution of the band. The pressure of touring while recording and releasing an album each year had worn the members down. Baxter and McDonald had been in creative conflict for some time. McDonald desired a direct, soulful and polished rock/R&B; sound, while Baxter insisted on embellishing guitar parts in an increasingly avant-garde style. (Both McDonald and Baxter elaborated on the matter in the documentary series Behind the Music, which aired on VH1 in February 2001.) Just as Minute by Minute's success became apparent, Hartman, Baxter, and LaKind left the band. A two-song set on the January 27, 1979, broadcast of Saturday Night Live (with guest host Michael Palin) marked the final television appearance of this lineup, and a brief tour of Japan marked the band's last live performances in its middle-period configuration (Hartman subsequently joined Johnston's touring band in 1979 and taped an appearance with him that aired on Soundstage in 1980). With the surprise smash album embedded in the charts and more money to be earned on the road, the remaining Doobies (Simmons, Knudsen, McDonald and Porter) decided to forge ahead. In 1979, Hartman was replaced by session drummer Chet McCracken and Baxter by multi-instrumental string player John McFee (late of Huey Lewis's early band Clover); Cornelius Bumpus (who had been part of a recent reunion of Moby Grape) was also recruited to add vocals, keyboards, saxophones, and flute to the lineup. This lineup toured throughout 1979, including stops at Madison Square Garden and New York City's Battery Park for the No Nukes benefit shows with like-minded artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Crosby, Stills & Nash, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen and John Hall. 1980 marked LaKind's return to the lineup as a full-time member and the Doobies' ninth studio album, One Step Closer. The LP featured the hit title track and the Top 10 hit \\"Real Love\\" (not to be confused with the John Lennon composition) but did not dominate the charts and the radio as Minute by Minute had, largely due to an oversaturation of the \\"McDonald sound\\" by many other artists (such as Robbie Dupree's hit \\"Steal Away\\", which copied the \\"McDonald sound\\" nearly note for note) on the radio at the time‚Äînot to mention McDonald's numerous guest vocal appearances on hits by other artists, such as Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross, Lauren Wood and Nicolette Larson. The album itself was also noticeably weaker musically than the previous three with the band sounding tired and seemingly devolving to little more than McDonald's \\"backup band\\" (according to contemporary sources). \\"Ted and Michael became one faction against Pat and the rest of us\\", Porter said in an interview. Long frustrated with the realities of relentless touring and yearning for a stable home life, as well as battling an admitted cocaine problem, Porter left the band after the recording of Closer. Session bassist Willie Weeks joined the band and the Doobies continued touring throughout 1980 and 1981 (post-Doobies, Weeks has performed with the Gregg Allman Band, Eric Clapton, and many others). Backstage at the Greek Theater in Berkeley, California in 1982 By the end of 1981, even Simmons had left the band. Now faced with the prospect of calling themselves The Doobie Brothers with no remaining original members and a \\"leader\\" in McDonald who was ready for a solo career, the group elected instead to disband after a rehearsal without Simmons, according to an interview with McDonald for Listen to the Music, the Doobie Brothers' official video history/documentary released in 1989. He went on to say that by that point they could not have gotten further away from the Doobies sound if they had tried. Simmons, already at work on his first solo album, Arcade, rejoined for a 1982 farewell tour on the condition that this truly would be the end of the Doobie Brothers. At their last concert at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California on September 11, 1982, they were joined onstage by founding member Tom Johnston for what was presumed to be the final rendition of his staple, \\"China Grove\\". Former members Porter, Hossack and Hartman subsequently took the stage for an extended version of \\"Listen to the Music\\". Knudsen sang lead vocals while Johnston, Simmons and McFee traded licks on guitar. The live album Farewell Tour was released in 1983 and the Greek Theatre concert was released in 2011 as Live at the Greek Theatre 1982. =Reunion= The Doobies did not work together for the next five years, though various members got together in different configurations for annual Christmas season performances for the patients and staff at the Stanford Children's Hospital in the Bay area. Simmons released a commercially disappointing solo album, Arcade, in 1983. During the mid-1980s, Johnston toured U.S. clubs with a band called Border Patrol, which did not release any recordings. Hossack and (briefly) Simmons worked with the group. Around 1986, Johnston and Simmons began working on an album together (according to a 1989 interview with Simmons), but abandoned the project soon after with no known finished tracks. In 1983, Knudsen and McFee formed the band Southern Pacific and recorded four albums that found success in the country charts (former Creedence Clearwater Revival bassist Stu Cook joined the band in 1986 and former Pablo Cruise guitarist David Jenkins in 1988). Out of print for many years, Simmons' Arcade was reissued on compact disc in 2007 by specialty label Wounded Bird Records, which is also the home of Southern Pacific's and Tom Johnston's catalogs. Post-Doobies, McDonald became established as a bearded solo artist. His voice dominated adult contemporary radio throughout the 1980s. He experienced a renaissance of popularity in the 21st century as an interpreter of Motown classics. The reformation of the Doobie Brothers was not intentional. On a personal quest for a worthy cause and after conquering his drug addiction, Knudsen became active in the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation. In early 1987, he persuaded 11 Doobie alumni to join him for a concert to benefit veterans' causes. Answering the call were Tom Johnston, Pat Simmons, Jeff Baxter, John McFee, John Hartman, Michael Hossack, Chet McCracken, Michael McDonald, Cornelius Bumpus, Bobby LaKind and Tiran Porter, plus their long-time record producer and good friend, Ted Templeman. There were no surplus bass players as Weeks had other commitments. They soon discovered that tickets were in great demand, so the concert quickly evolved into a 12-city tour that began on May 21, 1987, in San Diego. The third concert, held at the Hollywood Bowl, was reportedly the venue's fastest sell-out since the Beatles had played there just over 20 years earlier. The band performed selections from every album using a wide variety of instrumentation that they could not have previously duplicated onstage without the expanded lineup. Baxter and McFee played pedal steel and violin, respectively, during \\"Black Water\\" and \\"Steamer Lane Breakdown\\". \\"Without You\\" featured four drummers and four lead guitarists. Producer Ted Templeman played percussion and LaKind sometimes played Knudsen's drum set while Knudsen went to the front of the stage to join the chorus. Templeman also played the drum set on \\"What a Fool Believes\\", as he did on the original hit record. The tour culminated (sans McDonald, McFee and Knudsen) at the Glasnost-inspired July 4 \\"Peace Concert\\" in Moscow, with Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and Santana sharing the bill. Excerpts appearing later that year on the Showtime cable network included a performance of \\"China Grove\\". The successful 1987 reunion sparked discussions about reconstituting the band on a permanent basis. They eventually decided to replicate the Toulouse Street/Captain and Me incarnation, settling on a lineup featuring Johnston, Simmons, Hartman, Porter and Hossack, plus more recent addition LaKind, and released Cycles on Capitol Records in 1989. The album featured a Top 10 single, \\"The Doctor\\". The song is very similar to \\"China Grove\\", and the connection was further enhanced by guest Bill Payne's tinkling piano. Other material on the album included Johnston's \\"South of the Border\\", Dale Ockerman's and Pat Simmons' \\"Take Me to the Highway\\", and \\"I Can Read Your Mind\\", a version of the Isley Brothers' \\"Need a Little Taste of Love\\", and a version of The Four Tops classic, \\"One Chain (Don't Make No Prison)\\", which had been covered by Santana years before. Cycles proved a successful comeback album and was certified Gold. Bumpus participated in the 1989 and 1990 tours, adding his distinctive voice, keyboards, saxophone and flute. His presence bridged the gap between the current band and the McDonald era; he sang lead vocals on \\"One Step Closer\\" (as he originally had on the 1980 album) while Simmons took McDonald's part. The group was further augmented on the 1989 tour by Dale Ockerman (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Richard Bryant (percussion, vocals) and Jimi Fox (percussion, backing vocals). After being diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, LaKind stepped down before the tour to focus on his health. =The 1990s= The success of Cycles led to the release of 1991's Brotherhood, also on Capitol. The group members grew their hair back out, wore denim and leather, and attempted to revive their biker image of the early 1970s. In spite of the makeover and strong material led by Simmons' now trademark \\"Dangerous\\" (featured in the Brian Bosworth biker film Stone Cold), Brotherhood was unsuccessful, in part due to a lack of support from Capitol Records. The accompanying tour (with the 1989 lineup sans Bumpus), which also featured Joe Walsh on the bill, was ranked among the ten least profitable tours of the disappointing 1991 summer season by the North American Concert Promoters Association.Cited in Billboard Magazine, December 14, 1989 The 1987 Doobie Brothers alumni band reunited on October 17 and 19, 1992, at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, California to perform benefit shows for LaKind's children. LaKind, terminally ill with colon cancer, joined the group on percussion for a few numbers. The concerts were recorded and subsequently broadcast on the Superstars in Concert radio series accompanied by a plea for contributions to the LaKind family fund. LaKind died on December 24, 1992 at the age of 47. A brief hiatus followed during which Simmons collaborated with bassist and songwriter John Cowan (ex-New Grass Revival), Rusty Young (of Poco) and Bill Lloyd (of Foster & Lloyd) on an unreleased project called Four Wheel Drive. When the band emerged yet again in 1993, Hartman and Porter retired from the road for good but Knudsen and McFee rejoined the Doobie Brothers on a full-time basis after Southern Pacific disbanded. Joined by Ockerman, Bumpus, and Weeks, the group toured with Four Wheel Drive as the opening act. After Weeks left the tour to resume his session work, Cowan played bass for both bands. Bumpus also left to join the reunited Steely Dan, giving way to saxophonist, keyboardist, and harmonica player Danny Hull. Former band member Chet McCracken temporarily filled in for an injured Hossack in July 1993. Their 1994 tour included co-headlining appearances with Foreigner. With renewed energy in the mid-1990s, the band began to experiment with different arrangements of several tunes. They even pulled from McDonald's songbook from time to time, eventually restoring \\"Takin' it to the Streets\\" to the setlist with Simmons and new bass guitarist Skylark (who joined in 1995) substituting for McDonald on lead vocals. Return to permanent touring The band has toured continuously since 1993. In 1995, they reunited with McDonald for a co-headlining tour with the Steve Miller Band. The \\"Dreams Come True\\" tour featured all three primary songwriters and singers and reflected all phases of the band's career. Bumpus rejoined for the 1995 tour, with McCracken replacing the absent Knudsen and Bernie Chiaravalle sitting in for McFee. A 1996 double live album, Rockin' Down the Highway: The Wildlife Concert, featured McDonald on three of his signature tunes. McDonald remains an occasional special guest to this day and has joined the group for benefits, private corporate shows, and parties (such as the wedding reception of Liza Minnelli and David Gest). In mid-1996, Ockerman was replaced by keyboardist Guy Allison (ex-Moody Blues and Air Supply). Saxophonist Marc Russo (ex- Yellowjackets) joined in early 1998, replacing Hull. In the late 1990s, the band obtained an injunction preventing confusing or misleading uses of \\"The Doobie Brothers\\" moniker in advertisements promoting a tribute band featuring former members McCracken, Bumpus and Shogren. =The 2000s= In 1999, Rhino Records released the group's first box set, Long Train Runnin': 1970‚Äì2000, which featured remastered tunes from the band's entire catalog, a new studio recording of the live concert staple \\"Little Bitty Pretty One\\", and an entire disc of previously unreleased studio outtakes and live recordings. Rhino's release the following year, Sibling Rivalry, was the band's first new studio album since 1991. The material reflected contributions from both Knudsen and McFee, ranging from rock to hip-hop, jazz, adult contemporary, and country. The album sold poorly, reflecting the declining sales throughout the adult- oriented rock musical scene. The Doobie Brothers in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, on August 31, 2006 On June 22, 2001, while heading to a show at Caesars Tahoe in Lake Tahoe, Hossack suffered multiple fractures in a motorcycle accident on Highway 88 and had to be airlifted to a Sacramento-area hospital, where he underwent surgery. Drummer and percussionist M. B. Gordy was recruited to fill in for Hossack. After being sidelined for months, Hossack returned to the band in mid-2002. Gordy remained with the band as an auxiliary percussionist until 2005. On October 26, 2004, the Doobie Brothers released Live at Wolf Trap, a live album that was recorded at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia on July 25 of that year. The album features the final recordings of drummer and vocalist Keith Knudsen, who died in February 2005. =The 2010s= For its 2010 and 2012 summer tours, the band was once again paired with Chicago, as it was in 1974, 1999 and 2008. In March 2010, longtime bass guitarist/vocalist Skylark resigned from the band after suffering a serious stroke. John Cowan, who had originally toured with the band in the early 1990s, returned to take Skylark's place, and has been with the band ever since. Three months later, before the band embarked on its 2010 summer tour with Chicago, Hossack was forced to sit out following a diagnosis of cancer. Tony Pia, a member of the Brian Setzer Orchestra, was recruited to substitute for Hossack. Pia became an official touring member of the band following Hossack's death in 2012. On September 28, 2010, the Doobie Brothers released their 13th studio album, World Gone Crazy, produced by their longtime producer Ted Templeman. World Gone Crazy was the first Doobie Brothers album Templeman produced since 1980's One Step Closer. The album's first single, \\"Nobody\\", was free-streamed on their website. By March 2012, five members of the Doobie Brothers family were deceased: percussionist/vocalist LaKind on December 24, 1992, of colon cancer; original bass guitarist / vocalist Shogren of unreported causes on December 14, 1999; saxophonist, keyboardist, vocalist, and flutist Bumpus of a heart attack on February 3, 2004 while in the air en route to California for a solo tour; drummer, vocalist, and activist Keith Knudsen on February 8, 2005 of cancer and chronic pneumonia; and drummer Michael Hossack of cancer on March 12, 2012. On November 13, 2012, the Doobie Brothers released an official documentary, Let the Music Play: The Story of The Doobie Brothers. It features interviews and rare footage from their early days of the 1970s to the present day. Johnston, Simmons, McDonald, McFee, Porter, and Baxter, along with manager Bruce Cohn, producer Ted Templeman, and members of the Johnston and Simmons families are interviewed in the film. In March 2014, the Doobie Brothers, in conjunction with Sony Music Nashville, announced that their 14th studio album would be released featuring the greatest hits of their 40+-year career. The album would feature lead and backing vocals from several country artists, and Michael McDonald returned to collaborate on the album. Featured artists included Sara Evans, Vince Gill, Hunter Hayes, Casey James, Toby Keith, Love and Theft, Jerrod Niemann, Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton, Tyler Farr, Chris Young, Charlie Worsham, and the Zac Brown Band. The album, entitled Southbound, was released on November 4, 2014. The following day, the Doobie Brothers and Michael McDonald were featured musical guests on the 47th Annual CMA Awards to celebrate its release, and were joined by Hunter Hayes, Jennifer Nettles, and Hillary Scott in a performance of \\"Listen to the Music\\". At the end of the ceremony, in addition to Hayes, Nettles, and Scott, they were joined by co-host Brad Paisley for \\"Takin' It to the Streets\\". The Doobie Brothers performed at Music City Roots on May 13, 2015, sharing the stage with B√©la Fleck and Dan Tyminski. This was the band's second performance at the venue, after an all-acoustic performance in 2011. The acoustic portion of the 2015 show featured songs that had not been heard by audiences in years, including the bluesy Chicago from their debut album and the title track from Toulouse Street. In early August 2015, keyboardist/backing vocalist Guy Allison was called to fly out to Japan to work on an album project. Little Feat co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, known for his contributions to many of the band's early studio albums, was selected to temporarily fill in for Allison in his absence. Allison briefly returned to the band after their September 5 show at Susquehanna Bank Center in Camden, New Jersey. On August 20, 2015, the Doobie Brothers and Michael McDonald were the featured musical guests on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where they performed a medley of \\"Long Train Runnin'\\" and \\"Takin' It to the Streets\\". The band also performed a web-exclusive performance of \\"What a Fool Believes\\" that was made available on The Tonight Show's website. On the afternoon of September 11, 2015, the Doobie Brothers performed at the Lockn' Festival in Arrington, Virginia, sharing the stage with the jam band String Cheese Incident. The Doobies then flew to Cherokee, North Carolina for an evening concert. In October 2015, Payne left Little Feat and officially took over Guy Allison's duties as the Doobies' keyboardist. The announcement was officially made by the band on December 1, 2015. On November 24, 2015, the Doobie Brothers, together with Journey, launched a tour featuring Dave Mason. The tour started on May 12, 2016, at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and concluded on September 4, 2016, when the Doobies and Journey joined the Steve Miller Band and Santana at AT&T; Park. Johnston was forced to miss the Warren Haynes Christmas Jam on December 12, 2015, due to knee surgery he had a few weeks earlier. Since the early 2000s, they have headlined and performed at many benefit concerts including manager Cohn's B.R. Cohn Winery in Glen Ellen (once again sharing the stage with McDonald in 2006 and 2012). Cohn sold his winery in 2015 to set his primary focus on managing the band, and the B.R. Cohn Charity Fall Music Festival was relocated to the Sonoma Valley Field of Dreams. The festival was renamed the Sonoma Music Festival. The Doobie Brothers and McDonald, Chicago, and Ringo Starr headlined the three-day event. In March 2016, the Doobie Brothers signed under new management with Irving Azoff. Drummer Tony Pia left the band in the summer of 2016, leaving Ed Toth as the band's sole drummer. In January 2017, the Doobie Brothers announced that Chicago would once again join them for their Summer 2017 tour. The tour began on June 7 at the Concord Pavilion and wrapped up on July 30 in Virginia Beach. The Doobie Brothers, along with the Eagles, Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, and Earth, Wind & Fire performed at the Classic concerts for two weekends in July 2017. These concerts took place on July 15 and 16 at Dodger Stadium as the Classic West and July 29 and 30 at Citi Field as the Classic East. The Doobies performed at the July 15 and 29 concerts, sharing the bill with the Eagles and Steely Dan. The success of these concerts led to the Classic Northwest concert on September 30 at Safeco Field, where the Doobies opened for the Eagles. The band took the last leg of their 2017 world tour to Europe in late October and early November, opening for Steely Dan at those shows. The Doobies announced that they would take their Summer 2018 tour with Steely Dan. The tour began in May in Charlotte, North Carolina and concluded in July in Bethel, New York. Ex-Allman Brothers percussionist Marc Qui√±ones joined the band in May 2018. On July 16, 2018, the band announced that they would perform the Toulouse Street and The Captain and Me albums in their entirety plus select hits at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on November 15 and 16, 2018. These shows marked the first time the band performed at the theatre in 25 years. The concerts were recorded and subsequently released as a live album on June 28, 2019. The band toured with Santana in the summer of 2019. On November 18, 2019, the Doobies performed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, where they performed the Toulouse Street and The Captain and Me albums in their entirety. For the encore, Michael McDonald came out, joining the band in performing \\"Takin' It to the Streets\\". At the end of the concert, Simmons made the announcement that McDonald will rejoin the band in 2020 and participate in the band's 50th Anniversary tour. This tour will mark the first time the four principal players of the Doobie Brothers - Johnston, McDonald, Simmons, and McFee - will be on the road together in 25 years. =The 2020s= On January 15, 2020, it was announced that the Doobie Brothers are one of the six groups that will be inducted into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction will include living members Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons, Michael McDonald, John McFee, Tiran Porter, John Hartman, and Jeff Baxter, while drummer & vocalist Keith Knudsen and drummer Michael Hossack will be inducted posthumously. The induction ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on May 2, 2020 in Cleveland, but was postponed to November 7 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 26, 2020, the Doobie Brothers officially announced that they had rescheduled their 50th Anniversary tour to 2021 as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The band continues to remain popular among a wide variety of audiences worldwide and have maintained a continuous and active presence on the Internet through the official website and on social media outlets.

Such taxes are in place in various countries and the income is typically allocated to the developers of \\"content\\". (A distinction is sometimes made between \\"tax\\" and \\"levy\\" based on the recipient of the accumulated funds; taxes are received by a government, while levies are received by a private body, such as a copyright collective.) Levy system may operate in principle as a system of collectivisation, partially replacing a property approach of sale of individual units. History Such levies were first introduced in Germany in the 1960s.WIPO, International Survey on Private Copying - Law & Practice 2013 (23rd ed.) p.4: \\"A levy was first introduced in Germany in 1966.\\" With the advent of the audio cassette, legislators were persuaded that cassette recorders would decimate sales of records as friend after friend would then make copies of only one purchased album. Levies today are assessed on recordable compact discs, a form of media that did not exist when levies were first conceived. Although the bulk of unrecorded compact discs are actually used in the computing industry, they are still \\"taxed\\" to provide a revenue stream to the recording industry. Levies are often considered a compensation for illegal file sharing. This is debatable, however: levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines, but rather, only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions. A notable exception in Europe is the UK, that does not allow private copies. But generally legislators allow private copies for two reasons: firstly, because otherwise the enforcement would be unfeasible for private reasons, and secondly because the administrative burden would be disproportionate. = European Union review = On 2015-07-09 the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution (Reda Report) asking a review of the levy in the European Union, building on previous resolutions and studies. Questions on fairness A difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered \\"fair\\" by all copyright holders and consumers. Implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of CDs in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like. This ignores other distribution channels such as the Internet, and it disproportionally benefits popular artists and publishers of the related products. Fairer methods would arguably involve extensive sampling of purchasers to determine actual recording behaviour, or alternatively paying all musicians at a simple flat-rate (the preferred method will depend on one's political views). While the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors, some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes. In Germany this is even required by law. It acknowledges the purpose of cultural diversity - which is not necessarily identical to free market effects. This funding is usually executed by the same entities (collecting societies) that distribute the levy money to individual authors. One may question however whether these entities are properly qualified to make culture policy. Levy systems assume that all authors want to exploit their work for money. However this is not always true, especially on the internet. Many authors do not write to entertain, but to inform readers, listeners and viewers. Often their purpose is to reach the widest possible audience rather than make the maximum profit from the copyrighted work by itself. The discrepancy between reality and the assumption underlying a levy system is growing as \\"web 2.0\\" matures, with pervasive user-supplied content, from Wikipedia to YouTube. A further problem is to find a proper tariff base for levies. Conceivably the levy may be a percentage of storage media sales price (e.g. 3% in the US). The implication of such a scheme is however that the author gets ever less as technology proceeds and becomes less expensive. But a price based on units of information (bits, or megabits) is not fair either, as for instance a DVD can be used to store a film, a computer game, a large amount of documents, or measurement data. The cost of producing a certain amount of bits widely varies by type of information. Measurement data is even not copyrighted at all. Yet in today's world of converging technology, storage media can be used for a wide range of purposes. An implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as music. If it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes. The options include: * Collecting the tax on all media, regardless of the end use, and ignoring the injustice to purchasers with non-covered uses. * Allowing taxed and untaxed media to be sold, but with only the taxed media providing the copyright-relaxation benefits. * Collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses. Contrary Fairness arguments * Although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies, there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made. * With respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy. In countries that do not have the levy, many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted. This is the similar argument that non- proponents to the levy system use to show fault. They advocate that if the levy cannot be precisely applied to the people that are private copying, it is a faulty system. Likewise, if one cannot reprimand all people that are copying illegally and not compensating the music industry, this is also a faulty system. One system over subscribes, the other undersubscribes, both have faults. * Finally, those countries that do not have private copying laws are in fact making many of their citizens criminals. A law which makes potentially more than 50% of the population criminals does not seem to be a fair business practice. Lawyers rather than artists may well be the greatest beneficiaries in non-private copying countries. This argument assumes that private copying can only be allowed with a levy. Legal effects It is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law, by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid. However, there is little evidence to support this theory. On the contrary, lobbyists representing publishers and copyright holders have increased pressures to implement more restrictive laws, even on countries that have implemented private copying levy. In 2007, it was reported that International Intellectual Property Alliance put 23 of the world's 30 most populous countries into Priority Watch List, even though the United States, which was not in the list, has laws that are more liberal than the laws from the countries within the list. Even when restricting levy system to devices that primarily play music, this itself creates loopholes that prevents collecting levies from cellphones, PDAs, and other all-in-one portable electronic devices. As a result, copyright holders will have to rely on even more laws to collect levy, and to increase rates of already levied product to recover perceived losses, which run against the political trends toward eliminating levy systems. Regulations Examples of countries operating such schemes: =Australia= Australia had a public levy on cassette tapes. The legislation establishing the levy was passed in 1989, challenged in the High Court of Australia in Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v Commonwealth. The court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose. Copyright Amendment Act 1989 (Cth) introduced the Levy on blank tapes but was later repealed by Copyright Amendment (Re-Enactment) Act 1993 following the \\"blank tapes levy case\\" in the HCA in 1993. =Belgium= In Belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to \\"Auvibel\\", which is in charge of distributing the funds. As of 1 February 2010, these fees are applicable for the following: *Equipment with integrated carrier: **MP3/MP4 player, cellphone with MP3/MP4 functionality: *** capacity is less or equal to 2GB: ‚Ç¨1.00 *** capacity is higher than 2GB and less or equal to 16GB: ‚Ç¨2.50 *** capacity is higher than 16GB: ‚Ç¨3.00 **TV, Hi-Fi, combined DVD writer and videorecorder, multifunctional DVD home cinema, set top box, multimediacenter: *** capacity is less or equal to 256GB: ‚Ç¨3.30 *** capacity is higher than 256GB and less or equal to 1TB: ‚Ç¨10.75 *** capacity is higher than 1TB: ‚Ç¨13.00 *Non-integrated equipment with integrated carrier: **DVD recorder, DVD reader, CD writer, videorecorder, DVD home cinema: *** capacity is less or equal to 256GB: ‚Ç¨3.30 *** capacity is higher than 256GB and less or equal to 1TB: ‚Ç¨10.75 *** capacity is higher than 1TB: ‚Ç¨13.00 *For the following equipment, without integrated carrier, that are not integrate-able in a computer and work standalone, have a fee of ‚Ç¨2.00: **Hi-Fi with radio-cassette-CD **Combined DVD writer and videorecorder **Combined DVD reader and videorecorder **Portable radio-cassette recorder **Combined portable radio-cassette-CD **TV and combined DVD writer **DVD recorder **Cassette deck **Videorecorder **CD writer **MiniDisc writer **CD audio to MiniDisc writer *Digital carriers: **Memorystick, memorycard: *** capacity is less or equal to 2GB: ‚Ç¨0.15 *** capacity is higher than 2GB and less or equal to 16GB: ‚Ç¨0.50 *** capacity is higher than 16GB: ‚Ç¨1.35 **External hard drive: *** capacity is less or equal to 256GB: ‚Ç¨1.30 *** capacity is higher than 256GB and less or equal to 1TB: ‚Ç¨6.75 *** capacity is higher than 1TB: ‚Ç¨9.00 ** blank CD-R/RW, MiniCD-R/RW, MiniDVD-R/RW, MiniDisc, audiocassette DAT: ‚Ç¨0.12/disc ** blank DVD+/-R/RW: ‚Ç¨0.40/disc *Analogue carriers: **audiocassette, audiotape, videocassette 8mm: ‚Ç¨0.12 **videocassette: ‚Ç¨0.40 =Canada= A blank media levy was introduced in Canada in 1997, by the addition of Part VIII, \\"Private Copying\\", to the Canadian Copyright Act. The power to set rates and to set the distribution allocation is vested in the Copyright Board of Canada. The Copyright Board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the Canadian Private Copying Collective, which is a non-profit private organization. In Canada: * The levy applies to \\"blank audio recording media\\", such as CD-Rs. * The levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within Canada (and typically passed on to the retailer, and passed on to the purchaser). * With the exception of the zero-rating exemption, the levy is collected regardless of the purchaser's end use of the media. * The private copying levy, less CPCC operating costs, is distributed as per the Copyright Board's allocation as: 58.2% to eligible authors and publishers, 23.8% to eligible performers and 18.0% to eligible record companies. * The Canadian Private Copying Collective has developed a method by which the proceeds are distributed to rights holders based on commercial radio airplay and commercial sales samples, ignoring radio/college airplay and independent record sales not logged by Soundscan. This method has been criticised as favouring major-label artists at the expense of the long-tail. As of September 7, 2007 over one hundred million dollars has been distributed. * In conjunction with the levy, the Copyright Act allows individuals to make copies of sound recordings for their own private, non-commercial use. They may not distribute the copy. * In 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal overruled a 2003 Copyright Board decision which had applied the blank media levy to MP3 players such as Apple Inc.'s iPod, on the basis that such devices did not qualify as \\"audio recording medium\\" as per the Copyright Act definition.Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Canadian Storage Media Alliance [2005] 2 F.C.R. 654 Before this, the proposed rates were $2 for players with less than 1 GB of capacity, $15 for players up to 15 GB, and $25 for players 15 GB and over. *On February 12, 2007, CPCC asked the Copyright Board of Canada to reintroduce the levy of $5 to $75, this time onto the memory component of the digital audio recorders (such as MP3 players) in Canada. In addition, CPCC also proposed levies of $2 to $10 for memory cards (since withdrawn), 8 cent increases to CD, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio and MiniDiscs. Certain parties objected to this tariff based on the 2005 Federal Court of Appeal precedent and brought a preliminary motion before the Copyright Board that would have prevented that part of the tariff application from being considered. The Copyright Board dismissed this preliminary motion in July 2007. *In September 2007, an application for judicial review was brought before the Federal Court of Appeal to appeal the Copyright Board's dismissal. On October 26, 2007, the court granted the Canadian Recording Industry Association's request to intervene in the private copying/iPod levy judicial review. Some argue that CRIA wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy, given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy, possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not. *In January 2008, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Copyright Board's July 2007 decision, stating that its previous ruling in the 2005 Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Canadian Storage Media Alliance case is dispositive authority for the proposition that \\"the Copyright Board has no legal authority to certify a tariff on digital audio recorders or on the memory permanently embedded in digital audio recorders.\\"Apple Canada Inc. v. Canadian Private Copying Collective [2008] F.C.J. No. 5. Canada's current private copying levies are as follows: $0.29 per unit for CD-R, CD-RW, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio disks. The Pirate Party of Canada, or the PPCA, has called for the scrapping the levy, as there are plenty of non-piracy related uses for CDs and it is unjust to punish Canadians who don't use them for these purposes. =Finland= Finland had a blank media levy 1984-2015. From 2015 on the funds come directly from the state budget. As of beginning of 2012, the fees were (in Euros): * ‚Ç¨0.005/min for analog audio tapes (e.g. ‚Ç¨0.30 for a 60-minute cassette) * ‚Ç¨0.0076/min for analog video tapes (e.g. ‚Ç¨1.37 for an E180 tape) * ‚Ç¨0.20 per disk for CD and MiniDisc (capacity: up to 1 GB) * ‚Ç¨0.60 per disk for DVD, DVD-RAM, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL (capacity: from 1 GB to 10 GB) * ‚Ç¨1.20 per disk for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD (capacity: over 10 GB to 25 GB) * ‚Ç¨1.80 per disk for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD (capacity: over 25 GB) * ‚Ç¨4 to ‚Ç¨36 depending on capacity of digital audio players or personal video recorders. ** ‚Ç¨4, memory up to 512 MB ** ‚Ç¨7, over 512 MB to 1 GB ** ‚Ç¨10, over 1 GB to 20 GB ** ‚Ç¨12, over 20 GB to 50 GB ** ‚Ç¨15, over 50 GB to 150 GB ** ‚Ç¨18, over 150 GB to 250 GB ** ‚Ç¨25, over 250 GB to 500 GB ** ‚Ç¨30, over 500 GB to 750 GB ** ‚Ç¨36, over 750 GB * ‚Ç¨5 to ‚Ç¨18 for external hard disk drives: ** ‚Ç¨9, over 50 GB to 250 GB ** ‚Ç¨12, over 250 GB to 1 TB ** ‚Ç¨18, over 1TB to 3 TB ** smaller and bigger drives have no levies There was no levy fee on mobile phones, computers, memory cards, game consoles, USB flash drives and CDs/DVDs. VAT of 9% is added to the levies. =Germany= The world's first private copying system was created in Germany in 1965. It was a result of earlier successful litigation by GEMA against an audio equipment manufacturer in GEMA v. Grundig. =Luxembourg= Luxembourg is the only EU member state on the continent without a private copying levy,The other four EU member states lacking a private copying levy are Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom. Greece has a private copying levy scheme in place, but does currently not enforce it. making it a popular \\"copying levy haven\\" for blank media buyers from countries such as France and Germany. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands a fee is charged on blank media which is passed on to \\"Stichting Thuiskopie\\" (Foundation Homecopy), which is in charge of distributing the funds. Fees for February 17, 2007 until January 1, 2010 are as follows; * Data CD-R/RW: ‚Ç¨0.14 per disc * Audio CD-R/RW: ‚Ç¨0.42 per hour (‚Ç¨0.52 per 74 minutes) * Blank DVD-R/RW: ‚Ç¨0.60 per 4.7 gigabyte * Blank DVD+R/RW: ‚Ç¨0.40 per 4.7 gigabyte * Blank DVD-RAM: exempt * Video analog (video tapes): ‚Ç¨0.33 per hour * Audio analog (cassette tapes) ‚Ç¨0.23 per hour * MiniDisc: ‚Ç¨0.32 per hour * HI-MD: ‚Ç¨1.10 per carrier =Portugal= Portugal established a levy on cds and DVDs in 1998. =Russian Federation= Article 1245 of Civil Code of Russian Federation \\"Remuneration for free reproduction of phonograms and audiovisual products for private purposes\\" (\\"–í–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–æ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º –∏ –∞—É–¥–∏–æ–≤–∏–∑—É–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Ü–µ–ª—è—Ö\\") mandates a fee, which is to be distributed in the following proportion: 40% to the authors, 30% to the singers, 30% to the manufacturers of the media. In practice, this fee had not been charged until after the Regulation of the Government of Russian Federation 829 from October 14, 2010, which mandated a uniform 1% tax on computers, blank optical disks, memory sticks, TVs, video and audio recorders, radios, mobile phones, etc. The controversial decision of the government to award the collected funds to the Russian Union of Rights-Holders for further distribution was criticized by the public and disputed in a lawsuit. =Sweden= In Sweden there is a fee called \\"privatkopieringsers√§ttning\\" (private copy remuneration) earlier called \\"kassetters√§ttning\\" (cassette tape remuneration) on storage media. The levy is handled by Copyswede. The extent of what is included in the copy levy has changed several times the past decade. In September 2019 the copy levy looks as follows https://www.copyswede.se/elektronikbranschen/produkter-och- ersattningsnivaer/: * Computers with built-in storage memory, loose internal hard drives, external hard drives, tablets with built-in storage memory, gaming consoles with built-in storage memory and usb memories: * > 2 GB - 80 GB 1 kr / GB * > 80 GB 80 kr / pc * MP3 player, set-top box with built-in hard drive, DVD player with built-in hard drive, TV with built-in hard drive and other media players with built-in hard drive: * 1 - 320 GB 1 SEK/ GB * > 320 GB 320 SEK / pc * Mobile phones with storage: * For mobile phones with storage 3 SEK / GB * Recordable CDs and DVDs: * CD-r All up to 900 MB 0.60 SEK * CD-rw All up to 900 MB 0.95 SEK * DVD-r / + r 4.7 GB 2.65 SEK * DVD-rw / + rw 4.7 GB 4.25 SEK * DVD frame 4.7 GB 4.25 SEK * Dvd-r / + r double layer 8.5 GB 4.80 SEK * Analog audio cassettes (C cassettes), vhs cassettes (E cassettes), minidisc and cd-r audio (minute tariff): * C-cassette 2.5 √∂re * Minidisc 2 √∂re * Cd-r audio 2 √∂re * E-cassette (vhs) 2.5 √∂re =Switzerland= * Tax on recordable DVD (GT 4c): ** CHF 0.31 per recordable DVD ** CHF 0.88 per rewritable DVD ** CHF 0.33 per recordable Blu-Ray ** CHF 0.93 per rewritable Blu-Ray * Tax on digital storage media packaged inside audio and audiovisual recording devices (GT 4d): ** Memory capacity up to 4 GB, CHF 0.63 per GB ** Memory capacity between 4 GB and 8 GB, CHF 0.572 per GB ** Memory capacity between 8 GB and 16 GB, CHF 0.332 per GB ** Memory capacity between 16 GB and 32 GB, CHF 0.2552 per GB ** Memory capacity over 32 GB, CHF 0.1992 per GB * Compensation for the transfer of use of set-top box with memory and vPVR (GT 12): ** CHF 1.00 per month and subscriber if the following charges do not apply ** CHF 0.13 per month and subscriber if free or part of the basic package ** CHF 0.55 per month and subscriber for monthly subscription fee up to a max of CHF 6.50 * Tax on digital (recordable) memory in cell phones: ** Memory capacity up to 4 GB, CHF 0.108 per GB ** Memory capacity up to 8 GB, CHF 0.090 per GB ** Memory capacity up to 16 GB, CHF 0.072 per GB ** Memory capacity up to 32 GB, CHF 0.063 per GB ** Memory capacity up to 64 GB, CHF 0.052 per GB ** Memory capacity up to 128 GB, CHF 0.050 per GB =United States= Audio home recording in general , as legislated by the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, says that non-commercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings is not copyright infringement. Non- commercial includes such things as resale not in the course of business, perhaps of normal use working copies which are no longer wanted. It is unlikely to include resale of copies in bulk; Napster tried to use the Section 1008 defense but was rejected because it was a business. From House Report No. 102-873(I), September 17, 1992: \\"In the case of home taping, the [Section 1008] exemption protects all noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings\\" . From House Report No. 102-780(I), August 4, 1992: \\"In short, the reported legislation [Section 1008] would clearly establish that consumers cannot be sued for making analog or digital audio copies for private noncommercial use\\". The United States music industry administers the Audio Home Recording Act and foreign hometaping royalties for artists on US sound recordings as well as US record labels. These royalties are administered by The Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies for featured artists and copyright owners, ASCAP/BMI/SESAC for writers, Harry Fox Agency for publishers, and The AFM/AFTRA Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund (Joint venture of AFM and AFTRA ) for non-featured artists. All societies also collect foreign remuneration for their respective funds. Blank music CDs and recorders bars copyright infringement action and provides for a royalty of 2% of the initial transfer price for devices and 3% for media. The royalty rate in was established by the Fairness in Music Licensing Act of 1998. This only applies to CDs which are labeled and sold for music use; they do not apply to blank computer CDs, even though they can be (and often are) used to record or \\"burn\\" music from the computer to CD. The royalty also applies to stand-alone CD recorders, but not to CD burners used with computers. Most recently, portable satellite radio recording devices contribute to this royalty fund. Thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the Rio PMP300 player, most MP3 players are deemed \\"computer peripherals\\" and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the U.S. Currently, private copy royalties are generated in the US by the sale of \\"blank CDs and personal audio devices, media centers, satellite radio devices, and car audio systems that have recording capabilities.\\" =United Kingdom= Currently there is no proper private copy exception in the United Kingdom, there is only a narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting (s70(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)). On 1 June 2014, the UK implemented art. 5(2)b of the Infosoc Directive via the Copyright and Rights in Performance (Personal Copies for Private Use) Regulations 2014. This provided an exception limited to the personal use, to the owners of a personal copy and with the exclusion of indirectly commercial uses. It did not provide for compensation. The UK Government's view was that \\"levies or other compensation are neither required nor desirable in the context of a narrow provision that causes minimal harm. Levies are an unnecessary and inefficient tax on consumers. They are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device (for example a hard disk) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device. Furthermore, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not right to extract more money from the pockets of hard pressed consumers.\\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140603093549/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/response-2011-copyright- final.pdf The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), the Musicians' Union, and UK Music challenged the introduction of these regulations, and brought an application for judicial review. Their application succeeded when, in June 2015, the High Court ruled that the regulations were unlawful because of a flawed impact assessment.

G√°bor D√©nes College in Budapest, Hungary, is named after him in honour of his works.  Life and career  Gabor was born as G√ºnszberg D√©nes, into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. In 1918, his family converted to Lutheranism.Dennis Gabor Biography. Bookrags.com (2 November 2010). Retrieved on 2017-09-07. Dennis was the first- born son of G√ºnszberg Bern√°t and Jakobovits Ad√©l. Despite having a religious background, religion played a minor role in his later life and he considered himself agnostic. In 1902, the family received permission to change their surname from G√ºnszberg to G√°bor. He served with the Hungarian artillery in northern Italy during World War I. He began his studies in engineering at the Technical University of Budapest in 1918, later in Germany, at the Charlottenburg Technical University in Berlin, now known as the Technical University of Berlin. At the start of his career, he analysed the properties of high voltage electric transmission lines by using cathode-beam oscillographs, which led to his interest in electron optics. Studying the fundamental processes of the oscillograph, Gabor was led to other electron- beam devices such as electron microscopes and TV tubes. He eventually wrote his PhD thesis on Recording of Transients in Electric Circuits with the Cathode Ray Oscillograph in 1927, and worked on plasma lamps. In 1933 Gabor fled from Nazi Germany, where he was considered Jewish, and was invited to Britain to work at the development department of the British Thomson-Houston company in Rugby, Warwickshire. During his time in Rugby, he met Marjorie Louise Butler, and they married in 1936. He became a British citizen in 1946, and it was while working at British Thomson-Houston that he invented holography, in 1947. He experimented with a heavily filtered mercury arc light source. However, the earliest hologram was only realised in 1964 following the 1960 invention of the laser, the first coherent light source. After this, holography became commercially available. Gabor's research focused on electron inputs and outputs, which led him to the invention of re-holography. The basic idea was that for perfect optical imaging, the total of all the information has to be used; not only the amplitude, as in usual optical imaging, but also the phase. In this manner a complete holo-spatial picture can be obtained. Gabor published his theories of re-holography in a series of papers between 1946 and 1951. Gabor also researched how human beings communicate and hear; the result of his investigations was the theory of granular synthesis, although Greek composer Iannis Xenakis claimed that he was actually the first inventor of this synthesis technique. Gabor's work in this and related areas was foundational in the development of time‚Äìfrequency analysis. In 1948 Gabor moved from Rugby to Imperial College London, and in 1958 became professor of Applied Physics until his retirement in 1967. His inaugural lecture on 3 March 1959, 'Electronic Inventions and their Impact on Civilisation' provided inspiration for Norbert Wiener's treatment of self-reproducing machines in the penultimate chapter in the 1961 edition of his book Cybernetics. In 1963 Gabor published Inventing the Future which discussed the three major threats Gabor saw to modern society: war, overpopulation and the Age of Leisure. The book contained the now well-known expression that \\"the future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented.\\" Reviewer Nigel Calder described his concept as, \\"His basic approach is that we cannot predict the future, but we can invent it...\\" Others such as Alan Kay, Peter Drucker, and Forrest Shaklee have used various forms of similar quotes. His next book, Innovations: scientific, technological, and social which was published in 1970, expanded on some of the topics he had already earlier touched upon, and also pointed to his interest in technological innovation as mechanism of both liberation and destruction. In 1971 he was the single recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics with the motivation \\"for his invention and development of the holographic method\\" and presented the history of the development of holography from 1948 in his Nobel lecture. While spending much of his retirement in Italy at Lavinio Rome, he remained connected with Imperial College as a senior research fellow and also became staff scientist of CBS Laboratories, in Stamford, Connecticut; there, he collaborated with his lifelong friend, CBS Labs' president Dr. Peter C. Goldmark in many new schemes of communication and display. One of Imperial College's new halls of residence in Prince's Gardens, Knightsbridge is named Gabor Hall in honour of Gabor's contribution to Imperial College. He developed an interest in social analysis and published The Mature Society: a view of the future in 1972. He also joined the Club of Rome and supervised a working group studying energy sources and technical change. The findings of this group was published in the report Beyond the Age of Waste in 1978, a report which was an early warning of several issues that only later received widespread attention. Following the rapid development of lasers and a wide variety of holographic applications (e.g., art, information storage, and the recognition of patterns), Gabor achieved acknowledged success and worldwide attention during his lifetime. He received numerous awards besides the Nobel Prize. Gabor died in a nursing home in South Kensington, London, on 9 February 1979. In 2006 a blue plaque was put up on No. 79 Queen's Gate in Kensington, where he lived from 1949 until the early 1960s. Personal life On 8 August 1936 he married Marjorie Louise Butler with whom he lived in a harmonious marriage. They did not have any children.

It merged with the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro in 2007 and was known as StatoilHydro until 2009, when the name was changed back to Statoil ASA. The brand Statoil was retained as a chain of fuel stations owned by StatoilHydro. Statoil was the largest petroleum company in the Nordic countries. In the 2013 Fortune 500, Statoil was ranked as the 39th -largest company in the world. While Statoil was listed on both the Oslo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, the Norwegian state still held majority ownership, with 64%. The company's headquarters are located in Norway's oil capital Stavanger. The name Statoil was a truncated form of the State's oil (company). Statoil was one of the largest net sellers of crude oil in the world, and a major supplier of natural gas to the European continent, Statoil also operated around 2000 service stations in 9 countries. The company's CEO from mid-2004 onwards was Helge Lund, formerly CEO of Aker Kv√¶rner. History =Early years= Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Norwegian State Oil Company) was founded as a private limited company owned by the Government of Norway on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Storting, the Norwegian parliament. The political motivation was Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf and to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Statoil was required to discuss important issues with the Minister of Industry, later Minister of Petroleum and Energy. Statoil was also required to submit an annual report to the parliament. In 1973, the company started work acquiring a presence in the petrochemical industry. This resulted in the development of processing plants in Rafsnes and, in partnership with Norsk Hydro, the Mongstad plant in 1980. In 1981 the company acquired, as the first Norwegian company, operator rights on the Norwegian continental shelf on the Gullfaks field. 1987‚Äì88 saw the largest scandal in the companies history, the Mongstad scandal that made the until then unassailable CEO Arve Johnsen withdraw. =Privatization= The company was privatised and made a public limited company (allmennaksjeselskap) in 2001, becoming listed on both the Oslo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time it changed its name to Statoil ASA. =Merger with Hydro= In December 2006 Statoil revealed a proposal to merge with the oil business of Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian conglomerate.Hydro's oil and gas activities to merge with Statoil, Norsk Hydro, published 2006-12-18, accessed 20 June 2007 Under the rules of the EEA the proposal was approved by the European Union on 3 May 2007EU regulators approve Statoil, Norsk Hydro merger, EU Business, published 2007-05-03, accessed 20 June 2007 and by the Norwegian Parliament on 8 June 2007.Norwegian Parliament Okays Statoil-Hydro Merger , Ocean-Resources, published 2007-06-11, accessed 20 June 2007 Former Statoil's shareholders hold 67.3% of the new company StatoilHydro, which started operations on 1 October 2007. The company is the biggest offshore oil and gas company in the world. In November 2009, StatoilHydro changed its name to simply Statoil, following a prolonged name debate that sparked considerable public interest. Environmental record Statoil had three oil spills in Arctic waters near Norway. All the spills occurred from its ocean rig called the Erik Raude. The company was searching for oil in the region, which environmentalists were against because they wanted the sensitive area free from pollution. However, the Norwegian government allowed oil exploration, as long as there were no emissions. After the merger to StatoilHydro, in December 2007, of oil leaked into the North Sea. This was Statoil's 2nd worst oil spill. Two leaks also occurred in February 2008. In March, Statoil dropped about 1.6 tons of pure hydraulic oil in the Barents Sea. Hydraulic oil is said to be the 2nd most hazardous pollutant. Since the leaks, Statoil has stated that the oil has mostly dissolved, and there is not much proof of ecological harm. The Norwegian government has not stopped the oil drilling in the Arctic waters, and Statoil started up its oil operations in April 2005. Bellona, a Norwegian environmental group, is looking to take legal action. They want the end of oil drilling in the Barents Sea. Controversy and corruption =Rotvoll controversy= In 1991 there arose a controversy between Statoil and local environmentalists, mainly from Natur og Ungdom and Friends of the Earth Norway, who protested the building of a new research and development centre at Rotvoll in Trondheim, Norway, wetlands area close to the city with significant bird life. The controversy was climaxed with civil disobedience by the environmentalists, but the centre was still built. =Statoil corruption case= The Statoil corruption case refers to the company's misconduct and use of corruption in Iran in 2002/2003 in an attempt to secure lucrative oil contracts in that country. This was mainly achieved by hiring the services of Horton Investments, an Iranian consultancy firm owned by Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, son of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Horton Investments was paid US$15.2 million by Statoil to influence important political figures in Iran to grant oil contracts to Statoil. The corruption scandal was uncovered by Norwegian paper Dagens N√¶ringsliv on 3 September 2003. =Corrib gas project= Statoil was a partner of Royal Dutch Shell in the Corrib gas project, which entails developing a natural gas field off the west of Ireland. The project has proved controversial. In the summer of 2005, five men from County Mayo were jailed for contempt of court after refusing to obey a temporary court injunction forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken on their land. The ensuing protests led to the Shell to Sea campaign that opposes the project.

B.C.) The Tenlik kurgan is associated with the Wusun. The Wusun (; Eastern Han Chinese * î…ë-su…ôn)Schuessler 2007, pp. 517, 486 were an Indo-European semi-nomadic steppe people mentioned in Chinese records from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The Wusun originally lived between the Qilian Mountains and Dunhuang (Gansu) near the Yuezhi. Around 176 BC the Yuezhi were raided by the Xiongnu, who subsequently attacked the Wusun, killing their king and seizing their land. The Xiongnu adopted the surviving Wusun prince and made him one of their generals and leader of the Wusun. Around 162 BC the Yuezhi were driven into the Ili River valley in Zhetysu, Dzungaria and Tian Shan, which had formerly been inhabited by the Saka (Scythians). The Wusun then resettled in Gansu as vassals of the Xiongnu. In 133‚Äì132 BC, the Wusun drove the Yuezhi out of the Ili Valley and settled the area. The Wusun then became close allies of the Han dynasty and remained a powerful force in the region for several centuries. The Wusun are last mentioned by the Chinese as having settled in the Pamir Mountains in the 5th century AD due to pressure from the Rouran. They possibly became subsumed into the later Hephthalites. Etymology Wusun is a modern pronunciation of the Chinese Characters 'ÁÉèÂ≠´'. The Chinese name 'ÁÉèÂ≠´' (W≈´s≈´n) literally means w≈´ 'crow, raven' + s≈´n 'grandson, descendant'. There are several theories about the origin of the name.ÁéãÊòéÂì≤, ÁéãÁÇ≥ËèØ (Mingzhe Wang & Binhua Wang): ÂæûÊñáÁçªËàáËÄÉÂè§Ë≥áÊñôË´ñÁÉèÂ≠´Ê≠∑Âè≤ÁöÑÂπæÂÄãÈáçÂ§ßÂïèÈ°å (Important questions about the history of Wusun arising from the contemporary documents and archaeological investigations).

Mair compared Wusun with Sanskrit √°≈õva 'horse', a≈õvin 'mare' and Lithuanian a≈°v√† 'mare'. The name would thus mean 'the horse people'. Hence he put forward the hypothesis that the Wusun used a satem-like language within the Indo-European languages. However, the latter hypothesis is not supported by Edwin G. Pulleyblank.Edwin G. Pulleyblank, \\"Why Tocharians?\\", Central Asia and non-Chinese peoples of ancient China, vol. 1\\\\. Aldershot, Hampshire; Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing, 2002, , pp. 426‚Äì427. Christopher I. Beckwith's analysis is similar to Mair's, reconstructing the Chinese term Wusun as Old Chinese *√¢swin, which he compares to Old Indic a≈õvin 'the horsemen', the name of the Rigvedic twin equestrian gods. √âtienne de la Vaissi√®re identifies the Wusun with enemies of the Sogdian-speaking Kangju confederation, whom Sogdians mentioned on Kultobe inscriptions as wŒ¥'nn'p. WŒ¥'nn'p contains two morpheme n'p \\"people\\" and *wŒ¥'n [wi√∞an], which is cognate with Manichaean Parthian wd'n and means \\"tent\\". Vaissi√®re hypothesized that the Wusun likely spoke an Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, permitting Sogdians to translate their endonym as *wŒ¥'n [wi√∞an] and Chinese to transcribe their endonym with a native /s/ standing for a foreign dental fricative. Therefore, Vaissi√®re reconstructs Wusun's endonym as *W…ôŒ∏an \\"[People of the] Tent(s)\\". History =Early history= Migration of the Wusun The Wusun were first mentioned by Chinese sources as living together with the Yuezhi between the Qilian Mountains and Dunhuang (Gansu),Hanshu „ÄäÊº¢Êõ∏¬∑ÂºµÈ®´ÊùéÂª£Âà©ÂÇ≥„Äã Original text Ëá£Â±ÖÂåàÂ•¥‰∏≠ÔºåËÅûÁÉèÂ≠´ÁéãËôüÊòÜËé´„ÄÇÊòÜËé´Áà∂Èõ£ÂÖúÈù°Êú¨ËàáÂ§ßÊúàÊ∞è‰ø±Âú®Á•ÅÈÄ£„ÄÅÁÑûÁÖåÈñìÔºåÂ∞èÂúã‰πü„ÄÇtr. \\"[I, your majesty's] minister, while living among the Xiongnu, heard that the Wusun king was called Kunmo; Kunmo's father Nandoumi had originally been dwelling together with the Great Yuezhi in a small state between Qilian and Dunhuang.\\" although different locations have been suggested for these toponyms.Liu, Xinru, Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan: Interaction and Interdependence of Nomadic and Sedentary Societies (2001) Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were an eastern remnant of the Indo-Aryans, who had been suddenly pushed to the extremities of the Eurasian Steppe by the Iranian peoples in the 2nd millennium BCE. Around 210‚Äì200 BCE, prince Modu Chanyu, a former hostage of the Yuezhi and prince of the Xiongnu, who were also vassals of the Yuezhi, became leader of the Xiongnu and conquered the Mongolian Plain, subjugating several peoples. Around 176 BCE Modu Chanyu launched a fierce raid against the Yuezhi. Around 173 BCE, the Yuezhi subsequently attacked the Wusun, at that time a small nation, killing their king (Kunmi or Kunmo ) Nandoumi (). According to legend Nandoumi's infant son Liejiaomi was left in the wild. He was miraculously saved from hunger being suckled by a she-wolf, and fed meat by ravens.Shiji „ÄäÂè≤Ë®ò¬∑Â§ßÂÆõÂàóÂÇ≥„Äã Original text: ÂåàÂ•¥ÊîªÊÆ∫ÂÖ∂Áà∂ÔºåËÄåÊòÜËé´ÁîüÊ£ÑÊñºÈáé„ÄÇÁÉèÂóõËÇâËúöÂÖ∂‰∏äÔºåÁãºÂæÄ‰π≥‰πã„ÄÇ The Wusun ancestor myth shares striking similarities with those of the Hittites, the Zhou Chinese, the Scythians, the Romans, the Goguryeo, Turks, Mongols and Dzungars. Based on the similarities between the ancestor myth of the Wusun and later Turkic peoples, Denis Sinor has suggested that the Wusun, Sogdians, or both could represent an Indo-Aryan influence, or even the origin of the royal Ashina T√ºrks. In 162 BCE, the Yuezhi were finally defeated by the Xiongnu, after which they fled Gansu. According to Zhang Qian, the Yuezhi were defeated by the rising Xiongnu empire and fled westward, driving away the Sai (Scythians) from the Ili Valley in the Zhetysu and Dzungaria area.Hanshu „ÄäÊº¢Êõ∏¬∑ÂºµÈ®´ÊùéÂª£Âà©ÂÇ≥„Äã Original text ÊôÇÔºåÊúàÊ∞èÂ∑≤ÁÇ∫ÂåàÂ•¥ÊâÄÁ†¥ÔºåË•øÊìäÂ°ûÁéã„ÄÇ The Sai would subsequently migrate into South Asia, where they founded various Indo-Scythian kingdoms. After the Yuezhi retreat the Wusun subsequently settled the modern province of Gansu, in the valley of the Wushui-he (lit. \\"Raven Water-River\\"), as vassals of the Xiongnu. It is not clear whether the river was named after the tribe or vice versa. =Migration to the Ili Valley= The Xiongnu ruler was impressed with Liejiaomi, considering him a supernatural being, and adopted the child. When the child grew up the Chanyu made him leader of the Wusun and a Xiongnu general. He won many victories for the Xiongnu and the Wusun became powerful. Liejiaomi constantly requested the Xiongnu ruler for permission to revenge his father, and around 133‚Äì132 BCE, he successfully attacked the Yuezhi in the Ili Valley. The Yuezhi then migrated to Sogdia and then Bactria, where they became unified under Kujula Kadphises and expanded into South Asia, founding the Kushan Empire, which at its peak under Kanishka stretched from Turpan in the Tarim Basin to Pataliputra on the Gangetic plain and played an important role in the development of the Silk Road and the transmission of Buddhism to China. The Wusun subsequently took over the Ili Valley, expanding over a large area and trying to keep away from the Xiongnu. According to Shiji, Wusun was a state located west of the Xiongnu.Shiji „ÄäÂè≤Ë®ò¬∑Â§ßÂÆõÂàóÂÇ≥„Äã Original text: ÂåàÂ•¥Ë•øÈÇäÂ∞èÂúã‰πü When the Xiongnu ruler died, Liejiaomi refused to serve the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu then sent a force to against the Wusun but were defeated, after which the Xiongnu even more than before considered Liejiaomi a supernatural being, avoiding conflict with him. Wusun and their neighbours around 200 CE. =Establishing relations with the Han= After settling in the Ili Valley the Wusun became so strong that the Han was compelled to win their friendship in alliance. Chinese sources name the Scythian Sai (Saka), and the Yuezhi who are often identified as Tocharians, among the people of the Wusun state in the Zhetysu and Dzungaria area. The Wusun realm probably included both Yuezhi and Saka. It is clear that the majority of the population consisted of linguistically Iranian Saka tribes. In 125 BCE, under the Han Emperor Wu of Han (156-87 BCE), the Chinese traveller and diplomat Zhang Qian was sent to establish an alliance with the Wusun Against the Xiongnu.* Yap, Joseph P, (2019). The Western Regions, Xiongnu and Han, from the Shiji, Hanshu and Hou Hanshu, p. 164. Qian estimated the Wusun to number 630,000, with 120,000 families and 188,000 men capable of bearing arms.(Hanshu, ch.61 & 96) Hanshu described them as occupying land that previously belonged to the Saka (Sai).Hanshu „ÄäÊº¢Êõ∏¬∑Âç∑‰πùÂçÅÂÖ≠‰∏ã„Äã Ë•øÂüüÂÇ≥ Original text: Êú¨Â°ûÂú∞‰πüÔºåÂ§ßÊúàÊ∞èË•øÁ†¥Ëµ∞Â°ûÁéãÔºåÂ°ûÁéãÂçóË∂äÁ∏£Â∫¶„ÄÇÂ§ßÊúàÊ∞èÂ±ÖÂÖ∂Âú∞„ÄÇÂæåÁÉèÂ≠´ÊòÜËé´ÊìäÁ†¥Â§ßÊúàÊ∞èÔºåÂ§ßÊúàÊ∞èÂæôË•øËá£Â§ßÂ§èÔºåËÄåÁÉèÂ≠´ÊòÜËé´Â±Ö‰πãÔºåÊïÖÁÉèÂ≠´Ê∞ëÊúâÂ°ûÁ®Æ„ÄÅÂ§ßÊúàÊ∞èÁ®ÆÈõ≤„ÄÇ To their north-west the Wusun bordered Kangju, located in modern Kazakhstan.

Lying on one of the branches of the Silk Road Chigu was an important trading centre, but its exact location has not been established. The Wusun approved of a possible alliance, and Zhang Qian was sent as ambassador in 115 BCE. According to the agreement the Wusun would jointly attack the Xiongnu with the Han, while they were offered a Han princess in marriage and the return of their original Gansu homeland (heqin). Due to fear of the Xiongnu, the Wusun however had second thoughts and suggested sending a delegation to the Han rather than moving their capital further west. =As Han allies= Some time after the Han-Wusun negotiations had ended, the Han inflicted several blows to the Xiongnu. The Han then threatened war upon the Wusun, after which Liejiaomi finally agreed to an alliance, sending tributary horses and accepting princess () as his wife. Along with the Yuezhi and the Kangju of the Ferghana Valley, the Wusun became the main suppliers of horses for the Han. The Xiongnu had however also sent a princess to marry Liejiaomi, and the Xiongnu princess was declared his senior consort, with Xijun becoming his junior wife. Since Liejiaomi was already an old man, Xijun was however married to his successor Cenzou (), to which Wu agreed. Xijun wrote a famous poem, the Beichouge (), in which she complains about her exile in the land of the \\"barbarians\\": Xijun bore the Wusun a daughter but died soon afterward, at which point the Han court sent Princess Jieyou () to succeed her. After the death of Cenzou, Jieyou married Wengguimi (), Cenzou's cousin and successor. Jieyou lived for fifty years among the Wusun and bore five children, including the oldest Yuanguimi (), whose half-brother Wujiutu () was born to a Xiongnu mother. She sent numerous letters to the Han requesting assistance against the Xiongnu. Around 80 BCE, the Wusun were attacked by the Xiongnu, who inflicted a devastating defeat upon them. In 72 BCE, the Kunmi of the Wusun requested assistance from the Han against the Xiongnu. The Han sent an army of 160,000 men, inflicting a crushing defeat upon the Xiongnu, capturing much booty and many slaves. In the campaign the Han captured the Tarim Basin city-state of Cheshi (Turpan), a previous ally of the Xiongnu, giving them direct contact with the Wusun. Afterwards the Wusun allied with the Dingling and Wuhuan to counter Xiongnu attacks. After their crushing victory against the Xiongnu the Wusun increased in strength, achieving significant influence over the city- states of the Tarim Basin. The son of the Kunmi became the ruler of Yarkand, while his daughter became the wife of the lord of Kucha. They came to play a role as a third force between the Han and the Xiongnu. Around 64 BCE, according to Hanshu, Chinese agents were involved in a plot with a Wusun kunmi known as Wengguimi (\\"Fat King\\"), to kill a Wusun kunmi known to the Chinese as Nimi (\\"Mad King\\"). A Chinese deputy envoy called Chi Tu who brought a doctor to attend to Nimi was punished by castration when he returned to China. In 64 BCE another Han princess was sent to Kunmi Wengguimi, but he died before her arrival. Han emperor Xuan then permitted the princess to return, since Jieyou had married the new Kunmi, Nimi (), the son of Cenzou. Jieyou bore Nimi the son Chimi (). Prince Wujiutu later killed Nimi, his half-brother. Fearing the wrath of the Han, Wujiutu adopted the title of Lesser Kunmi, while Yuanguimi was given the title Greater Kunmi. The Han accepted this system and bestowed both of them with the imperial seal. After both Yuanguimi and Chimi were dead, Jieyou asked Emperor Xuan for permission to return to China. She died in 49 BCE. Over the next decades the institution of Greater and Lesser Kunmi continued, with the Lesser Kunmi being married to a Xiongnu princess and the Greater Kunmi married to a Han princess. In 5 BCE, during the reign of Uchjul√º-Chanyu (8 BCE ‚Äì CE 13), the Wusun attempted to raid Chuban pastures, but Uchjul√º-Chanyu repulsed them, and the Wusun commander had to send his son to the Chuban court as a hostage. The forceful intervention of the Chinese usurper Wang Mang and internal strife brought disorder, and in 2 BCE one of the Wusun chieftains brought 80,000 Wusun to Kangju, asking for help against the Chinese. In a vain attempt to reconcile with China, he was duped and killed in 3 CE. In 2 CE, Wang Mang issued a list of four regulations to the allied Xiongnu that the taking of any hostages from Chinese vassals, i.e. Wusun, Wuhuan and the statelets of the Western Regions, would not be tolerated. In 74 CE the Wusun are recorded as having sent tribute to the Han military commanders in Cheshi. In 80 CE Ban Chao requested assistance from the Wusun against the city-state Quchi (Kucha) in the Tarim Basin. The Wusun were subsequently rewarded with silks, while diplomatic exchanges were resumed. During the 2nd century CE the Wusun continued their decline in political importance. =Later history= In the 5th century CE the Wusun were pressured by the Rouran and may have migrated to the Pamir Mountains.Book of Wei, ch. 102 They are last mentioned in Chinese historical sources in 436 CE, when a Chinese envoy was sent to their country and the Wusun reciprocated. It is possible that they became subsumed into the later Hephthalites. After this event the Wusun seem to disappear from Chinese records: Wusun were last mentioned in 938 CE alongsides Tuyuhun and Mohe, as tributary states to the Khitan Liao.Liaoshi, vol. 4 \\"Â∫öÂ≠êÔºåÂêêË∞∑Ê∏æ„ÄÅÁÉèÂ≠´„ÄÅÈù∫Èû®ÁöÜ‰æÜË≤¢„ÄÇ\\" Physical appearance The Hanshu and Shiji do not make any special note of the physical appearance of the Wusun. The first description of the Wusun's physical appearance is found in a Western Han dynasty book of divination, the Jiaoshi Yilin, which describes the women of the Wusun as \\"with deep eyesockets, dark, ugly: their preferences are different, past their prime [still] without spouse\\"„ÄäÁÑ¶Ê∞èÊòìÊûó ‚Äì Jiaoshi Yilin„Äã Original text:ÁÉèÂ≠´Ê∞èÂ•≥ÔºåÊ∑±ÁõÆÈªëÈÜúÔºõÂóúÊ¨≤‰∏çÂêåÔºåÈÅéÊôÇÁÑ°ÂÅ∂„ÄÇ A later 7th century commentary to the Hanshu by Yan Shigu says: Initially, when only a few number of skulls from Wusun territory were known, the Wusun were recognized as a Caucasoid people with slight Mongoloid admixture. Later, in a more thorough study by Soviet archaeologists of eighty-seven skulls of Zhetysu, the six skulls of the Wusun period were determined to be purely Caucasoid or close to it. Language The Wusun are generally believed to be Indo-Iranian speakers. Specifically, They are thought to be Iranian-speaking by the archaeologist Elena Kuzmina, linguist J√°nos Harmatta, Joseph Kitagawa, David Durand-Gu√©dy, Turkologist Peter B. Golden and Central Asian scholar Denis Sinor. Archaeological evidence also supports the idea that Wusuns were Iranian speakers. The Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank has suggested that the Wusun, along with the Yuezhi, the Dayuan, the Kangju and the people of Yanqi, could have been Tocharian-speaking. Colin Masica and David Keightley also suggest that the Wusun were Tocharian-speaking. Sinor finds it difficult to include the Wusun within the Tocharian category of Indo-European until further research. J. P. Mallory has suggested that the Wusun contained both Tocharian and Iranian elements. Central Asian scholar Christopher I. Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were Indo-Aryan-speaking. The first syllable of the Wusun royal title Kunmi was probably the royal title while the second syllable referred to the royal family name. Beckwith specifically suggests an Indo-Aryan etymology of the title Kunmi. In the past, some scholars suggested that the Wusun spoke a Turkic language. Chinese scholar Han Rulin, as well as G. Vambery, A. Scherbak, P. Budberg, L. Bazin and V.P. Yudin, noted that the Wusun king's name Fu-li, as reported in Chinese sources and translated as 'wolf', resembles Proto-Turkic *b»´r√º 'wolf'. This suggestion however is rejected by Classical Chinese Literature expert Francis K. H. So, Professor at National Sun Yat-sen University. Other words listed by these scholars include the title bag, beg 'lord'.Zuev, Yu.A. (2002) Early T√ºrks: Essays on history and ideology, p. 35 This theory has been criticized by modern Turkologists, including Peter B. Golden and Carter V. Findley, who explain that none of the mentioned words are actually Turkic in origin. Findley notes that the term b√∂ri is probably derived from one of the Iranian languages of Central Asia (cf. Khotanese birgga-). \\"The term fu-li [ÈôÑÈõ¢], used to identify the ruler's retinue as 'wolves,' probably also derived from one of the Iranian languages.\\" Meanwhile, Findley considers the title beg as certainly derived from the Sogdian baga 'lord', \\"Many elements of non-Turkic origin also became part of T√ºrk statecraft. Important terms, for example, often came from non-Turkic languages, as in the cases of khatun for the ruler's wife and beg for 'aristocrat', both terms of Sogdian origin and ever since in common use in Turkish.\\" a cognate of Middle Persian baŒ≥ (as used by the rulers of the Sassanid Empire), as well as Sanskrit bhaga and Russian bog. According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica: \\"The origin of beg is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it is a loan-word. Two principal etymologies have been proposed. The first etymology is from a Middle Iranian form of Old Iranian baga; though the meaning would fit since the Middle Persian forms of the word often mean 'lord,' used of the king or others. The second etymology is from Chinese ‰ºØ (MC pÀ†√¶kÃö > b√≥) 'eldest (brother), (feudal) lord'. Gerhard Doerfer on the other hand seriously considers the possibility that the word is genuinely Turkish. Whatever the truth may be, there is no connection with Turkish berk, Mongolian berke 'strong' or Turkish b√∂g√º, Mongolian b√∂ge 'wizard, shaman.'\\"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/beg-pers Beg at Encyclop√¶dia Iranicahttp://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baga-an-old-iranian- term-for-god-sometimes-designating-a-specific-god Baga at Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Economy According to the Shiji (c. 123) and the Hanshu (c. 96), a daughter from the Han prince, Liu Jian, was sent to the ruler (Kunmi or Kunmo) of the Wusun between 110 BCE and 105 BCE. She describes them as nomads who lived in felt tents, ate raw meat and drank fermented mare's milk.Hanshu „ÄäÊº¢Êõ∏¬∑Âç∑‰πùÂçÅÂÖ≠‰∏ã„Äã Ë•øÂüüÂÇ≥ Original text: ÊòÜËé´Âπ¥ËÄÅÔºåË®ÄË™û‰∏çÈÄöÔºåÂÖ¨‰∏ªÊÇ≤ÊÑÅÔºåËá™ÁÇ∫‰ΩúÊ≠åÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæÂÆ∂Â´ÅÊàëÂÖÆÂ§©‰∏ÄÊñπÔºåÈÅ†ÊâòÁï∞ÂúãÂÖÆÁÉèÂ≠´Áéã„ÄÇÁ©πÂª¨ÁÇ∫ÂÆ§ÂÖÆÊóÉÁÇ∫ÁâÜÔºå‰ª•ËÇâÁÇ∫È£üÂÖÆÈÖ™ÁÇ∫Êºø„ÄÇÂ±ÖÂ∏∏ÂúüÊÄùÂÖÆÂøÉÂÖßÂÇ∑ÔºåÈ°òÁÇ∫ÈªÉÈµ†ÂÖÆÊ≠∏ÊïÖÈÑâ„ÄÇ„Äç Some early Chinese descriptions of the people were pejorative, describing them as \\"bad, greedy and unreliable, and much given to robbery\\", but their state was also described as very strong.Hanshu, Original text: Ê∞ëÂâõÊÉ°ÔºåË≤™ÁãºÁÑ°‰ø°ÔºåÂ§öÂØáÁõúÔºåÊúÄÁÇ∫Âº∑Âúã„ÄÇ However, the Wusun were also noted for their harmony towards their neighbours, even though they were constantly raided by the Xiongnu and Kangju. The principal activity of the Wusun was cattle-raising, but they also practiced agriculture. Since the climate of Zhetysu and Dzungaria did not allow constant wandering, they probably wandered with each change of season in the search of pasture and water. Numerous archaeological finds have found querns and agricultural implements and bones of domesticated animals, suggesting a semi- nomadic pastoral economy. Social structure The social structure of the Wusun resembled that of the Xiongnu. They were governed by the Great Kunmi, whose power was hereditary. The Great Kunmi and his two sons, who commanded the east and left flanks of the Wusun realm, each commanded a force of 10,000 men. The Wusun also fielded a regular army, with each freeman being considered a warrior. Their administrative apparatus was fairly sophisticated, consisting of sixteen officials. The Great Kunmi was assisted by a council of elders, which limited his power to some degree. The Wusun elite maintained itself through tribute from conquered tribes, war booty and trading profits. The booty acquired by the Wusun in their frequent conflicts enabled the administrative elite and members of the Kunmi's guard to amass enormous riches. Wusun society seems to have been highly stratified. The main source of this stratification seems to have been property ownership. The wealthiest Wusuns are believed to have owned as many as 4,000 to 5,000 horses, and there is evidence pointing to privileged use of certain pastures. Typical of early patriarchal stratified societies, Wusun widows were obliged to remain within the family of their late husband by marrying one of his relatives, a concept known as levirate marriage. Y. A. Zadneprovskiy writes that the social inequality among the Wusun created social unrest among the lower strata. Wusun society also included many slaves, mostly prisoners of war. The Wusun are reported as having captured 10,000 slaves in a raid against the Xiongnu. Wusun slaves mainly laboured as servants and craftsmen, although the freemen formed the core of the Wusun economy. Archaeology Numerous sites belonging to the Wusun period in Zhetysu and the Tian Shan have been excavated. Most of the cemeteries are burial grounds with the dead interred in pit-graves, referred to as the Chil-pek group, which probably belong the local Saka population. A second group of kurgans with burials in lined \\"catacomb\\" chamber graves, of the so-called Ayg√Ærdzhal group, are found together with the Chil-pek tombs from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE, and have been attributed to the Yuezhi. Graves of the Wusun period typically contain personal belongings, with the burials of the Ayg√Ærdzhal group often containing weapons. A famous find is the Kargali burial of a female Shaman discovered at an altitude of 2,300 m, near Almaty, containing jewellery, clothing, head-dress and nearly 300 gold objects. A beautiful diadem of the Kargali burial attest to the artistic skill of these ancient jewellers. Another find at Tenlik in eastern Zhetysu contained the grave of a high-ranking warrior, whose clothing had been decorated with around 100 golden bosses. Connection to Western histography Some scholars such as Peter B. Golden have proposed that the Wusun may have been identical with the people described by Herodotus (IV. 16‚Äì25) and in Ptolemy's Geography as Issedones (also Issedoni, Issedoi or Essedoni).Golden, Peter (1992). An Introduction of the Turkic Peoples: Ethnogenesis and State Formation in Medieval and Early Modern Asia and the Middle East, Wiesbaden, Otto Harrassowitz, p. 51.Gardiner-Garden, Chang-Ch'ien and Central Asian Ethnography, pp. 23‚Äì79 gives a survey of theories of ethnic affiliations and identification of the Wusun and the Yuezhi. Their exact location of their country in Central Asia is unknown. The Issedones are \\"placed by some in Western Siberia and by others in Chinese Turkestan,\\" according to E. D. Phillips. French historian Iaroslav Lebedynsky suggests that the Wusun may have been the Asii of Geographica.\\"Les Saces\\", Iaroslav Lebedinsky, p. 60-63, Genetics A genetic study published in Nature in May 2018 examined the remains of four Wusun buried between ca. 300 BC and 100 BC. The sample of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1. The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to C4a1, HV6, J1c5a and U5b2c. The authors of the study found that the Wusun and Kangju had less East Asian admixture than the Xiongnu and Sakas. Both the Wusun and Kangju were suggested to be descended from Western Steppe Herders (WSHs) of the Late Bronze Age who admixed with Siberian hunter- gatherers and peoples related to the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex.

As leader of the Christian Democratic Party, he served as Prime Minister of Norway from 1997 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2005, making him Norway's longest serving non-Labour Party prime minister since World War II. Currently, Bondevik is president of the Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights.  Family and early life Bondevik was born in Molde, the son of Johannes Bondevik, a principal at the Christian folk high school Rauma folkeh√∏yskole who also was a local politician for the Christian Democratic Party,Bondevik mistet faren Nettavisen, 19 February 2007, retrieved 20 July 2013 and Margit, n√©e H√¶reid. He became a theological candidate from MF Norwegian School of Theology in 1975.Erling Rimehaug in Norsk biografisk leksikon: Kjell Magne Bondevik Store norske leksikon, retrieved 20 July 2013 In 1979 he was ordained as pastor in the (Lutheran) Church of Norway. He is married to Bj√∏rg Bondevik (n√©e Rasmussen) and has three children: Bj√∏rn (born 1972), Hildegunn (born 1973) and John Harald (born 1976). Kjell Magne Bondevik is the nephew of politician Kjell Bondevik, the cousin of former bishop Odd Bondevik and brother in law of author and priest Eyvind Skeie.Viggo Valle and Per Kristian Johansen (2 June 2008): Stjerneklart med Kjell Magne Bondevik NRK, retrieved 20 July 2013 Political career In 2008, Bondevik said that he regards himself as a \\"68'er\\", and that he was \\"influenced by the radical wind of the time\\". While he remained in the movement of Young Christian Democrats (Norway, KrFU), he claims to have \\"radicalized the organization to great despair in the party\\". He has also said that he would likely rather have \\"oriented\\" himself towards the Socialist People's Party, had his radicalization of the Christian Democratic Party not gone through.Anfindsen, 2010, p. 249. Representing the Christian Democratic Party, Bondevik was a member of the Storting (Parliament) from 1973 to 2005. He was his party's parliamentary leader in the periods of 1981‚Äì1983, 1986‚Äì1989, 1993‚Äì1997, 1997, and 2000‚Äì2001, and party leader from 1983 to 1995. In this position, he was succeeded by Valgerd Svarstad Haugland. He was also Minister of Foreign Affairs in Jan P. Syse's government of 1989‚Äì1990, Minister of Church and Education in K√•re Willoch's government 1983‚Äì1986, also Prime Minister Willoch's deputy 1985‚Äì1986, and state secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister during Lars Korvald's government 1972‚Äì1973. = As Prime Minister= Bondevik's first term as Prime Minister lasted from 17 October 1997 to 3 March 2000, in a coalition cabinet consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Centre Party and the Liberal Party. While serving his first term as Prime Minister, Bondevik attracted international attention in August 1998 when he announced that he was suffering from depressive episode, becoming the highest ranking world leader to admit to suffering from a mental illness while in office. Upon this revelation, Anne Enger became acting Prime Minister for three weeks, from 30 August to 23 September, while he recovered from the depressive episode. Bondevik then returned to office. Bondevik received thousands of supportive letters, and said that the experience had been positive overall, both for himself and because it made mental illness more publicly acceptable.BBC Newsnight, 21 January 2008. Bondevik's first cabinet was defeated by a motion of no confidence in March 2000 as a result of a dispute over the construction of gas-fired power stations and was replaced by a Labour Party government led by Jens Stoltenberg until their defeat in the 2001 parliamentary election. Bondevik then formed his second cabinet, consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, which took office on 19 October 2001. The second Bondevik government carried out reforms and left a booming economy; however, Bondevik was defeated in the 2005 parliamentary election, with 81 seats obtained for Bondevik's coalition and its supporters to the opposition Red-Green Coalition's 88. Bondevik announced his retirement from national-level politics at the end of his term as prime minister, and did not seek re-election for his seat in parliament. Post-premiership The Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights was founded by Bondevik in January 2006. The purpose of the centre is to work for world peace, human rights and inter-religious tolerance worldwide. The centre cooperates closely with the Carter Center in Atlanta, the Kim Dae Jung Library in Seoul and the Crisis Management Initiative in Helsinki. On 31 October 2006, he published his memoir, called Et liv i spenning (A life of excitement and tension). On 31 January 2017, he was the first high-ranking politician from another country detained and questioned in the United States as a result of President Donald Trump's executive orders banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations, because of a diplomatic visit to Iran he had made in 2014.Former Norway PM held at Washington airport over 2014 visit to Iran The Guardian.

Awards and decorations Bondevik was awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav in 2004, the first sitting Norwegian Prime Minister to receive the Order of St. Olav in 80 years. The award happened due to a change in the Statutes of the Order with automatic awards to the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Government that stirred some debate and criticism.Orden p√• Bondevik Dagbladet, retrieved 20 July 2013 With the succeeding Stoltenberg Government, the practice was halted.Den siste √¶re VG, retrieved 20 July 2013 He is a full member of the Club de Madrid, a group of former leaders of democratic states that works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.

E. J. Brouwer but known to his friends as Bertus, was a Dutch mathematician and philosopher, who worked in topology, set theory, measure theory and complex analysis. He also became a major figure in the philosophy of intuitionism, a constructivist school of mathematics in which math is argued to be a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth. This position led to the Brouwer‚ÄìHilbert controversy, in which Brouwer sparred with his colleague David Hilbert, a major proponent of the formalist school of mathematics. Brouwer's work was subsequently taken up by his student Arend Heyting and Hilbert's former student Hermann Weyl. Biography Early in his career, Brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology. The most important were his fixed point theorem, the topological invariance of degree, and the topological invariance of dimension. Among mathematicians generally, the best known is the first one, usually referred to now as the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. It is a simple corollary to the second, concerning the topological invariance of degree, which is the best known among algebraic topologists. The third theorem is perhaps the hardest. Brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology, which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms, after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes, of the treatment of general continuous mappings. In 1912, at age 31, he was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at RomeBrouwer, L. E. J. \\"Die m√∂gliche M√§chtigkeiten.\\" Atti IV Congr. Intern. Mat. Roma 3 (1908): 569‚Äì571. and in 1912 at Cambridge, UK.Brouwer, L. E. J. (1912). Sur la notion de ¬´Classe¬ª de transformations d'une multiplicit√©. Proc. 5th Intern. Math. Congr. Cambridge, 2, 9‚Äì10. Brouwer founded intuitionism, a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators, who included Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, and John von Neumann (cf. Kleene (1952), p. 46‚Äì59). A variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics. It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning. Brouwer was a member of the Significs Group. It formed part of the early history of semiotics‚Äîthe study of symbols‚Äîaround Victoria, Lady Welby in particular. The original meaning of his intuitionism probably can not be completely disentangled from the intellectual milieu of that group. In 1905, at the age of 24, Brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract Life, Art and Mysticism, which has been described by the mathematician Martin Davis as \\"drenched in romantic pessimism\\" (Davis (2002), p. 94). Arthur Schopenhauer had a formative influence on Brouwer, not least because he insisted that all concepts be fundamentally based on sense intuitions.\\"...Brouwer and Schopenhauer are in many respects two of a kind.\\" Teun Koetsier, Mathematics and the Divine, Chapter 30, \\"Arthur Schopenhauer and L.E.J. Brouwer: A Comparison,\\" p. 584.Brouwer wrote that \\"the original interpretation of the continuum of Kant and Schopenhauer as pure a priori intuition can in essence be upheld.\\" (Quoted in Vladimir Tasiƒá's Mathematics and the roots of postmodernist thought, ¬ß 4.1, p. 36)‚ÄúBrouwer‚Äôs debt to Schopenhauer is fully manifest. For both, Will is prior to Intellect.\\" [see T. Koetsier. ‚ÄúArthur Schopenhauer and L.E.J. Brouwer, a comparison,‚Äù Combined Proceedings for the Sixth and Seventh Midwest History of Mathematics Conferences, pages 272‚Äì290. Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, 1998.]. (Mark van Atten and Robert Tragesser, ‚ÄúMysticism and mathematics: Brouwer, G√∂del, and the common core thesis,‚Äù Published in W. Deppert and M. Rahnfeld (eds.), Klarheit in Religionsdingen, Leipzig: Leipziger Universit√§tsverlag 2003, pp.145‚Äì160) Brouwer then \\"embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions\\"; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his Chapter II \\"as it stands, ... all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics, nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics\\" (Davis, p. 94 quoting van Stigt, p. 41). Nevertheless, in 1908: : \\"... Brouwer, in a paper entitled 'The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic', challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384--322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied\\" (Kleene (1952), p. 46). \\"After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\\" (Davis (2000), p. 95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert‚Äîthe formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict‚Äîadmired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p. 96). It was then that \\"Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism \\" (ibid). He was combative as a young man. He was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with Hilbert over editorial policy at Mathematische Annalen, at that time a leading learned journal. He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting. Dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden attended lectures given by Brouwer in later years, and commented: \\"Even though his most important research contributions were in topology, Brouwer never gave courses in topology, but always on‚Äîand only on‚Äîthe foundations of his intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output, false according to his philosophy.\\" About his last years, Davis (2002) remarks: : \\"...he felt more and more isolated, and spent his last years under the spell of 'totally unfounded financial worries and a paranoid fear of bankruptcy, persecution and illness.' He was killed in 1966 at the age of 85, struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of his house.\\" (Davis, p. 100 quoting van Stigt. p. 110.)

Withers was already a 10-year music business veteran, having been a session drummer for Dave Edmunds, Gerry Rafferty, Magna Carta and others through the 1970s; he was part of the group Spring, which recorded an album for RCA in 1971. At the time of the band's formation, Mark was working as a teacher at art college, Illsley was studying at Goldsmiths' College, and David was a social worker. Mark and Withers had both been part of the pub rock group Brewers Droop at different points in around 1973. The band was initially known as the Caf√© Racers. The name Dire Straits was coined by a musician flatmate of Withers, allegedly thought up while they were rehearsing in the kitchen of a friend, Simon Cowe, of Lindisfarne. In 1977, the group recorded a five-song demo tape which included their future hit single, \\"Sultans of Swing\\", as well as \\"Water of Love\\" and \\"Down to the Waterline\\". After a performance at the Rock Garden in 1977, they took a demo tape to MCA in Soho but were turned down. They then went to DJ Charlie Gillett, presenter of Honky Tonk on BBC Radio London. The band simply wanted advice, but Gillett liked the music so much that he played \\"Sultans of Swing\\" on his show.

It came to the attention of A&R; representative Karin Berg, working at Warner Bros. Records in New York City. She felt that it was the kind of music audiences were hungry for, but only one person in her department agreed at first. Many of the songs on the album reflected Mark Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds and London. \\"Down to the Waterline\\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \\"In the Gallery\\" is a tribute to Leeds sculptor/artist Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); \\"Wild West End\\" and \\"Lions\\" were drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.Peter Frame (1999) Pete Frame's rockin' around Britain: rock'n'roll landmarks of the UK and Ireland, p. 182.

During the recording sessions, tension between Mark and David Knopfler took its toll on the band, and David Knopfler left over creative differences with his brother to pursue a solo career; he was uncredited on the album. The sessions continued with Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar and keyboardist Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. After the recording sessions were completed, keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as full-time members for tours of Europe, North America, and Oceania. Making Movies received mostly positive reviews and featured longer songs with more complex arrangements, a style which would continue for the rest of the band's career. The album featured many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions. The most successful chart single was \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (number 8 in the UK singles chart), a song about a failed love affair, with Knopfler's trademark in keeping personal songs under fictitious names.(accessed 4 March 2008) Mark Knopfler .

Knopfler and Lindes on stage in Amsterdam, June 1981 Dire Straits' fourth studio album Love Over Gold, an album of songs filled with lengthy, experimental passages that featured Alan Clark's piano and keyboard work, was well received when it was released in September 1982, going gold in America and spending four weeks at number one in the United Kingdom. The title was inspired by graffiti seen from the window of Knopfler's old council flat in London. The phrase was taken from the sleeve of an album by Captain Beefheart. Love Over Gold was the first Dire Straits album produced solely by Mark Knopfler, and its main chart hit, \\"Private Investigations\\", gave Dire Straits their first top 5 hit single in the United Kingdom, where it reached the number 2 position despite its almost seven- minute length, and became another of the band's most popular live songs.International who's who in popular music, p. 282.

In other parts of the world, \\"Industrial Disease\\", a song that looks at the decline of the British manufacturing industry in the early 1980s, focusing on strikes, depression and dysfunctionality, was the main single from the album, particularly in Canada, where it became a top 10 hit. As well as the title track and \\"It Never Rains\\", Love Over Gold featured the 14-minute-long epic \\"Telegraph Road\\". Also written by Knopfler during this period was \\"Private Dancer\\", which did not appear on the album, but was eventually given to Tina Turner for her comeback album of the same name. Love Over Gold reportedly sold two million copies during the first six weeks after its release. Shortly after the release of Love Over Gold, drummer Pick Withers left the band.

I needed a rest.\\" The tremendous success of the Brothers in Arms album and the tour that went with it left the band members under a significant amount of stress, and Knopfler announced that he wanted to work on more personal projects. A greatest hits album, Money for Nothing, was released in October 1988 and reached number one in the UK. Also in 1988, John Illsley released his second solo album, Glass which featured Mark Knopfler, Alan Clark, Guy Fletcher and Chris White. In 1989, over a meal at a Notting Hill wine bar, Knopfler formed The Notting Hillbillies, a country-focused band whose line-up featured Guy Fletcher, Brendan Croker, and Steve Phillips and manager Ed Bicknell on drums.

The band began recording a new album, integrating new musicians including steel guitarist Paul Franklin and percussionist Danny Cummings. Saxophonist Chris White returned, and guitarist Phil Palmer filled the vacancy left by Sonni. Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro performed in place of Williams. Following their On Every Street Tour, John Illsley stated, \\"Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed. Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\\" Dire Straits released their final studio album, On Every Street, in September 1991. It was met with more moderate success and mixed reviews, as well as a significantly reduced audience. Some reviewers including the All Music Guide dubbed On Every Street an \\"underwhelming\\" follow-up to Brothers in Arms. However, it sold 8 million copies, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and number 12 in the United States. The album failed to produce a major hit single in the United Kingdom. The first single release was the opening track \\"Calling Elvis\\", which had a video based on the 1960s television show Thunderbirds. It charted at number 21 in the UK but dropped out of the charts within four weeks. The follow-up single, \\"Heavy Fuel\\", failed to reach the Top 50 in the UK singles chart, however in the United States the track reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, their second song to do so (after \\"Money for Nothing\\"). Similarly, the album's title track was also relatively unsuccessful, failing to reach the UK Top 40. The final single released from the album and from the band in the UK was \\"The Bug\\", which contains backing vocals by Vince Gill, who was also invited to join the band full-time but declined, and pursued a solo career. With session drummer Chris Whitten added to the lineup, Dire Straits embarked on a world tour to promote the album which lasted until October 1992. The On Every Street Tour featured 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. While musically more elaborate than the previous 1985‚Äì86 world tour, the band's gruelling final tour was not as critically acclaimed nor as successful commercially. This proved to be too much for Dire Straits, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such massive operations. This led to the second and final break-up. Bill Flanagan described the sequence of events in GQ: \\"The subsequent world tour lasted nearly two years, made mountains of money and drove Dire Straits into the ground. When the tour was over, both Knopfler's marriage and his band were gone.\\" Manager Ed Bicknell also said \\"The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed.\\" John Illsley agreed, saying \\"Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\\" The last stop and final touring concert of the group took place on 9 October 1992 in Zaragoza, Spain. After the end of the tour, Mark Knopfler expressed a wish to give up touring on a big scale, and took some time out from the music business. A live album, On the Night, was released in May 1993, which documented the tour, again to very mixed reviews. Nevertheless, it reached the UK Top 5, a rare achievement for a live album.

It is notable for supporting multiple channels of potentially different pixel sizes, including 32-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit and 16-bit floating point values, as well as various compression techniques which include lossless and lossy compression algorithms. It also has arbitrary channels and encodes multiple points of view such as left- and right-camera images. Overview A full technical introduction of the format is available on the OpenEXR website. OpenEXR, or EXR for short, is a deep raster format developed by ILM and broadly used in the computer-graphics industry, both visual effects and animation. OpenEXR's multi-resolution and arbitrary channel format makes it appealing for compositing, as it alleviates several painful elements of the process. Since it can store arbitrary channels‚Äîspecular, diffuse, alpha, RGB, normals, and various other types‚Äîin one file, it takes away the need to store this information in separate files. The multi-channel concept also reduces the necessity to \\"bake\\" in the aforementioned data to the final image. If a compositer is not happy with the current level of specularity, they can adjust that specific channel. OpenEXR's API makes tools development a relative ease for developers. Since there are almost never two identical production pipelines, custom tools always need to be developed to address problems, e. g. image manipulation issue. OpenEXR's library allows quick and easy access to the image's attributes such as tiles and channels. =History= OpenEXR was created by ILM in 1999 and released to the public in 2003 along with an open source software library. It soon received wide adoption by software used in computer graphics, particularly for film and television production. The format has been updated several times, adding support for tiles, mipmaps, new compression methods, and other features. In 2007, OpenEXR was honored with an Academy Award for Technical Achievement. OpenEXR 2.0 was released in April 2013, extending the format with support for deep image buffers and multiple images embedded in a single file. Version 2.2, released August 2014, added the lossy DWA compression format. =Compression methods= There are three general types of lossless compression built into OpenEXR, with two different methods of Zip compressing. For most images without a lot of grain, the two Zip compression methods seem to work best, while the PIZ compression algorithm is better suited to grainy images. The following options are available: ; None: Disables all compression. ; Run Length Encoding (RLE): This is a basic form of compression that is comparable to that used by standard Targa files. ; Zip (per scanline): deflate compression with zlib wrapper applied to individual scanlines (not based on the ZIP file format despite its name). ; Zip (16 scanline blocks): deflate compression applied to blocks of 16 scanlines at time. This tends to be the most effective style of compression to use with rendered images that do not have film grain applied. ; PIZ (wavelet compression): This uses a new combined wavelet / Huffman compression. This form of compression is quite effective when dealing with grainy images, and will often surpass any of the other options under grainy conditions. ; PXR24 (24-bit data conversion then deflate compression): This form of compression from Pixar Animation Studios converts 32-bit floats to 24 bits then uses deflate compression. It is lossless for half and 32-bit integer data and slightly lossy for 32-bit float data. ; B44: This form of compression is lossy for half data and stores 32-bit data uncompressed. It maintains a fixed compression size of either 2.28:1 or 4.57:1 and is designed for realtime playback. B44 compresses uniformly regardless of image content. ; B44A: An extension to B44 where areas of flat color are further compressed, such as alpha channels. ; DWAA: JPEG-like lossy compression format contributed by DreamWorks Animation. Compresses 32 scanlines together. ; DWAB: Same as DWAA, but compresses blocks of 256 scanlines. =Credits= From OpenEXR.org's Technical Introduction: > The ILM OpenEXR file format was designed and implemented by Florian Kainz, > Wojciech Jarosz, and Rod Bogart.

Developing with OpenEXR The OpenEXR library is developed in C++ and is available in source format as well as compiled format for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. Python bindings for the library are also available for version 2.x. As of version 1.3.0, released on 8 June 2006, support for multithreaded reading and writing was added to OpenEXR. Multithreaded reading and writing offers a higher performance gain for systems that have multiple cores or CPUs. OpenEXR handles reading and writing by a means of a thread pool.

Lossless data compression does not discard data during the process of encoding, unlike lossy compression methods such as AAC, MP3, Vorbis, and Opus. Therefore, it may be decompressed to a file that is identical to the source material. Similar to other lossless audio codecs, files encoded to Monkey's Audio are typically reduced to about half of the original size,Monkey's Audio official comparison with data transfer time and storage requirements being reduced accordingly. Comparisons Like any lossless compression scheme, Monkey's Audio format takes up several times as much space as lossy compression formats. Typically about twice as much as a 320 kbit/s bitrate MP3 file. The upside is that no data is lost compared to the input file, making lossless codecs suitable for transcoding, or simply taking up approximately half as much space as raw PCM data. Compared to FLAC, ALAC, or WavPack, Monkey's Audio is relatively slow to encode or decode files. Although Monkey's Audio is distributed as freeware, it is not open source. Among other things, the source code license terms make it impossible to legally redistribute, and invites people to infringe on the GPL license of other software. This is not compatible with the Open Source Definition or Free Software Definition as stated by the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation, respectively.Gentoo Bug 94477 - new ebuild: media-sound/mac (Linux ported version of Monkey's Audio converter) Alternatively, FLAC and WavPack are available under open source licences, and are well supported in Linux distributions and in many applications. Since all of these formats are lossless, users can transcode between formats without generation loss. While Monkey's Audio can achieve high compression ratios,http://www.audiograaf.nl/losslesstest/Lossless%20audio%20codec%20comparison%20-%20revision%204.pdf the cost is a dramatic increase in requirements on the decoding end. Many dedicated portable media players, and even flagship model smartphones have difficulty handling this. In comparison, most lossless codecs are asymmetric, meaning that the work done to achieve higher compression ratios, if selected by the user, slows down the encoding process, but has essentially no effect on the decoding requirements. Supported platforms Officially, Monkey's Audio is available only for the Microsoft Windows platform. As of version 4.02 (19 January 2009) a DirectShow filter is distributed with the installer, allowing for compatibility with most media players running on the Windows operating system. Monkey's Audio is also supported on Linux and OS X using JRiver Media Center or Plex. A GPL-licensed version of the Monkey's Audio decoder has been independently written for Rockbox and is included in ffmpeg.http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-0.5.changelog This code also provides playback support in applications that use GStreamer, as well as DeaDBeeF. A number of players and rippers support the format as well. It is also available as a port and package on FreeBSD. Monkey's Audio files can be encoded and decoded on any platform which has a J2SE implementation, by the means of the unofficial JMAC library, which is Free software licensed under the GNU LGPL. =Hardware support= Monkey's Audio is supported natively on all modern Cowon multimedia media players, the FiiO X Series and some Cayin digital audio players. On other hardware platforms, the open source firmware project Rockbox supports playback of Monkey's Audio files on most of its supported targets, but many lack sufficient processing power to play them on the higher compression settings.

He was previously associated with the bands Humble Pie and the Herd. As a solo artist, Frampton released several albums including his international breakthrough album, the live release Frampton Comes Alive!. The album sold more than eight million copies in the United States and spawned several hit singles. Since then he has released several other albums. He has also worked with Ringo Starr, the Who's John Entwistle, David Bowie and both Matt Cameron and Mike McCready from Pearl Jam, among others. Frampton is best known for such hits as \\"Breaking All the Rules\\", \\"Show Me the Way\\", \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\", \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\", and \\"I'm in You\\", which remain staples on classic rock radio. He has also appeared as himself in television shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Madam Secretary. Frampton is known for his work as a guitar player, particularly with a talk box and his voice. Early life Peter Kenneth Frampton was born to Owen and Peggy (n√©e ) Frampton in Beckenham, Kent, UK. He attended Bromley Technical High School,Sandford (1997): pp. 21‚Äì22 at which his father, Owen Frampton, was a teacher and the head of the Art department.

Both he and David Bowie, who was three years older, were pupils at Bromley Technical School (where his father Owen Frampton was Bowie's art instructor). The Little Ravens played on the same bill at school as Bowie's band, George and the Dragons. Peter and David would spend lunch breaks together, playing Buddy Holly songs.Buxton, John. ‚Äì \\"Answers to Correspondents\\". ‚Äì London Daily Mail ‚Äì p.64. ‚Äì 19 August 2006 At the age of 14, Peter was playing with a band called the Trubeats followed by a band called the Preachers, produced and managed by Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones. He became a successful child singer, and in 1966 he became a member of the Herd. He was the lead guitarist and singer, scoring several British pop hits. Frampton was named \\"The Face of 1968\\" by teen magazine Rave. In 1969, when Frampton was 18 years old, he joined with Steve Marriott of Small Faces to form Humble Pie. While playing with Humble Pie, Frampton also did session recording with other artists, including: Harry Nilsson, Jerry Lee Lewis, and John Entwistle's Whistle Rymes, in 1972.

His own debut was 1972's Wind of Change, with guest artists Ringo Starr and Billy Preston. This album was followed by Frampton's Camel in 1973, which featured Frampton working within a group project. In 1974, Frampton released Somethin's Happening. Frampton toured extensively to support his solo career, joined for three years by his former Herd mate Andy Bown on keyboards, Rick Wills on bass, and American drummer John Siomos. In 1975, the Frampton album was released. The album went to No. 32 in the US charts, and is certified Gold by the RIAA. Peter Frampton had little commercial success with his early albums. This changed with Frampton's best-selling live album, Frampton Comes Alive!, in 1976, from which \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\", \\"Show Me the Way\\", and an edited version of \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\", were hit singles. The latter two tracks also featured his use of the talk box guitar effect. The album was recorded in 1975, mainly at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, where Humble Pie had previously enjoyed a good following. Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans Bob Mayo on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass. Wills had been sacked by Frampton at the end of 1974, and Bown had left on the eve of Frampton Comes Alive, to return to England and new fame with Status Quo. Frampton Comes Alive was released in early January, debuting on the charts on 14 February at number 191. The album was on the Billboard 200 for 97 weeks, of which 55 were in the top 40, of which 10 were at the top. The album beat, among others, Fleetwood Mac's Fleetwood Mac to become the top selling album of 1976, and it was also the 14th best seller of 1977. With sales of eight million copies it became the biggest selling live album, although with others subsequently selling more it is now the fourth biggest. Frampton Comes Alive! has been certified as eight times platinum. Eder, Bruce. ‚Äì [ Frampton Comes Alive!]. ‚Äì AllMusic. The album won Frampton a Juno Award in 1977. A tribute to the album's staying power, readers of Rolling Stone ranked Frampton Comes Alive No. 3 in a 2012 poll of all-time favourite live albums. The article's text stated, \\"He was loved by teenage girls, and their older brothers. He owned the year 1976 like nobody else in rock.\\" The success of Frampton Comes Alive! put him on the cover of Rolling Stone, in a famous shirtless photo by Francesco Scavullo. Frampton later said he regrets the photo because it changed his image as a credible artist into a teen idol. In late 1976, he and manager Dee Anthony visited the White House at the invitation of Steven Ford, the president's son.\\"Random Notes\\". ‚Äì 16 December 1976. ‚Äì RS228. On 24 August 1979, Frampton received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the recording industry at 6819 Hollywood Boulevard. Setbacks Frampton's following album, I'm in You (1977) contained the hit title single and went platinum, but fell well short of expectations compared to Frampton Comes Alive!. He starred, with the Bee Gees, in producer Robert Stigwood's poorly received film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). Frampton's career seemed to be falling as quickly as it had risen. He also played guitar on the title song of the 1978 film Grease, a song newly-written for the film by Barry Gibb. Frampton suffered a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas in 1978 that marked the end of his prolific period and the beginning of a long fallow period where he was less successful than previously. He returned to the studio in 1979 to record the album Where I Should Be. Among those contributing to the album were past band members Stanley Sheldon (bass), Bob Mayo (keyboards/guitar/vocals), and John Siomos (drums/vocals). In 1980, his album Rise Up was released to promote his tour in Brazil, although he suffered another serious setback that year when all his guitars were thought destroyed in a cargo plane crash that killed three people. Among the instruments he lost was the black Les Paul Custom which he had named \\"Phenix\\"Gibson Guitar Greats: Peter Frampton , at Gibson.com; published 4 April 2017; retrieved 16 September 2018 (pictured on the cover of Frampton Comes Alive) given to him by Mark Mariana and first used on the night of the recording of the Humble Pie live album Performance, and which he had used all through his early solo career. The guitar was recovered and returned to him in December 2011. The album eventually turned into Breaking All the Rules, released the next year in 1981. These albums were the first he recorded almost completely live. In 1982, following the release of The Art of Control, Frampton tried unsuccessfully to split his ties with A&M; Records; he, however, re-signed with the label in 2006 and released his Grammy Award- winning Fingerprints. Return Although his albums generally met with little commercial success, Frampton continued to record throughout the 1980s. He did, however, achieve a brief, moderate comeback of sorts in 1986 with the release of his Premonition album, and the single \\"Lying\\", which became a big hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Most notably, he also united with old friend David Bowie, and both worked together to make albums. Frampton played on Bowie's 1987 album Never Let Me Down and sang and played on the accompanying Glass Spider Tour. Frampton would, in 2013, credit his participation in this tour for helping revive his career. Looking for the band experience again after touring with Bowie, Frampton kept referencing Steve Marriott, and at the beginning of 1991 rejoined his old Humble Pie mate for some shows (Marriott's last English gigs) at the Half Moon in Putney, London. The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a \\"Frampton-Marriott\\" tour. However, Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott's death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan. At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton's \\"Shine On\\" compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album. In the late 1990s, he starred in an infomercial plugging the internationally successful eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons. He claimed in the infomercial that the software was the best way to learn guitar. In 1994, Frampton wrote and released the album Peter Frampton, the final version of which contained material recorded on Tascam cassette recorders. Originally released on the Relativity label, this record was re- released in 2000 by Legacy Records, with four bonus tracks and additional notes by Peter. In 1995, Frampton released Frampton Comes Alive! II, which contained live versions of many of the songs from his 1980s and 1990s solo albums. Frampton Comes Alive! II was recorded at The Fillmore Theatre on 15 June 1995. Although there was a large amount of marketing for the album, it did not sell well. After Frampton Comes Alive! II, he recorded and toured with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings and Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band, where he and Jack Bruce performed a cover version of Cream's \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". Frampton performing in September 2006 In 2003, Frampton released the album Now, and embarked on a tour with Styx to support it. It was on this tour in 2004 he lost good friend and long time bandmate Bob Mayo. He also toured with the Elms, and appeared in 2006 on the Fox Broadcasting variety show Celebrity Duets, paired with Chris Jericho of WWE fame. They were the first pair voted out. On 12 September 2006, Frampton released an instrumental work titled Fingerprints. His band consisted of drummer Shawn Fichter, guitarist Audley Freed, bassist John Regan (Frampton's lifelong best friend,), and keyboardist- guitarist Rob Arthur, and guest artists such as members of Pearl Jam, Hank Marvin, and his bassist on Frampton Comes Alive!, Stanley Sheldon ‚Äì the only member of the backing band on that album still alive. Recent events On 11 February 2007, Fingerprints was awarded the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. In February 2007, he also appeared on the Chicago-based PBS television show Soundstage. Frampton released his 14th studio album, Thank You Mr. Churchill, on 27 April 2010. In summer 2010 he began touring North America with the English band Yes; the two acts had played stadium shows on a bill together in 1976. His 2010 band consisted of Rob Arthur (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), John Regan (bass), Adam Lester (guitar), and Dan Wojciechowski (drums). He embarked on a UK Tour in March 2011 in support of his new album, visiting Leamington Spa, Glasgow, Manchester, London and Bristol. Frampton went on tour in 2011 with The Frampton Comes Alive 35th Anniversary Tour that showcased and followed exactly the songs on the play list for the original tour from 1976, recorded for the famous Frampton Comes Alive! The concerts each night started with the prerecorded thump of a microphone being turned on, familiar to many fans of the album, followed by the recorded voice of Jerry Pompili saying, \\"If there was ever a musician that was an honorary member of San Francisco society, Mr. Peter Frampton ...\\", and then the crowd goes wild. He played the album song for song for 69 locations between 15 June 2011, and 22 October 2011, throughout the US. On 11 June 2011, Frampton performed a live set for \\"Guitar Center Sessions\\" on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt. In 2013, he performed throughout North America as part of the \\"Frampton's Guitar Circus\\" tour which featured periodic guest performers including B.B. King, Robert Cray, Don Felder, Rick Derringer, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Steve Lukather, Sonny Landreth, David Hidalgo, Mike McCready, Roger McGuinn and Vinnie Moore. On 9 February 2014, Frampton was one of several musicians to participate in The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles tribute to the Beatles on the 50th anniversary of their first appearance on American television. On 23 June 2014, Frampton released a new album entitled Hummingbird in a Box. On 11 June 2015, Frampton announced his new studio album: Acoustic Classics; then, on 14 January 2016, he launched the first song: a version of \\"Do You Feel Like I Do\\". In 2016, Frampton was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2017 and 2018, Frampton toured with the Steve Miller Band, opening the show. On 22 February 2019, Frampton announced he will be retiring from touring with his 'Peter Frampton Finale‚ÄîThe Farewell Tour' commencing on 18 June 2019 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, running through 12 October ending in Concord, California at the Concord Pavilion. The tour features special guest Jason Bonham's Led Zeppelin Evening, as well as Peter's son Julian Frampton on the West Coast stops. He also revealed the reason for the farewell tour; he's received a diagnosis that he has inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive muscle disorder characterized by muscle inflammation, weakness, and atrophy (wasting). A dollar of every ticket sold for the tour is donated to benefit Frampton's newly established myositis research fund at Johns Hopkins, where he‚Äôs being treated.http://www.frampton.com/news/ In June 2019, his most recent album, All Blues, debuted at number one in the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. In December 2019, Frampton announced his farewell UK tour to consist of five performances in May 2020. In April this UK/EU tour was cancelled \\"because of the COVID-19 virus\\". Media appearances In 1974, Frampton appeared in the movie The Son of Dracula as a guitarist in the Count Downes. In 1978, Frampton portrayed coastwatcher Peter Buckley in an episode of the World War II drama series Baa Baa Black Sheep titled \\"A Little Bit of England\\". In 1978, Frampton played Billy Shears in the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band starring along with the three brothers Gibb of the band the Bee Gees. The movie was inspired by the Beatles album of the same name. Critics were hostile, and the film was a box-office failure. In 1988, Frampton appeared in the video release of David Bowie's Glass Spider, a video recording of the 1987 tour of the same name. In 1996, Frampton appeared in an episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"Homerpalooza\\", in which he played \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\". He also made a TV appearance in the Family Guy episode \\"Death Lives\\", in which Peter Griffin asks Death to bring Peter Frampton to play \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" to Lois. Also in 2000, Frampton served as a technical advisor for Cameron Crowe's autobiographical film Almost Famous. He wrote some of the songs performed by the fictional band \\"Stillwater\\" in the film, supplied guitar tracks, and was the guitar instructor for Billy Crudup, who starred as Russell Hammond, the guitarist for the band. Crudup is quoted as saying, \\"Who could ask for a better tutor than Peter Frampton?\\" As an inside joke, he also appears briefly in the film as \\"Reg\\", a road manager for Humble Pie, Frampton's real-life former band. In 2001, Frampton appeared as himself in Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour, in which he performs \\"You Had To Be There\\" and appears in a brief scene with Mimi, in which he recalls their past relationship. On 20 December 2006, Frampton appeared on The Colbert Report. Stephen Colbert had a fake feud with the Decemberists to be decided by a head cutting duel. When Colbert faked an injury, Colbert called on Father Christmas to supply a guitar hero, at which point Frampton appeared and won the shred-down. On 23 April 2010, Frampton became the all-time celebrity champion of the trivia game called No Apparent Reason, with five correctly answered questions on the nationally syndicated Mark and Brian Radio Program originating from KLOS Los Angeles. However, on 5 May 2010, Frampton was reduced to second place after only two weeks by Luke Perry's answering six questions correctly. On 4 November 2010, Frampton appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show as one of her favourite musicians. On 21 October 2011, Frampton was honoured at Music City's at Walk of Fame Park in Nashville, Tennessee. On 6 January 2019, Frampton appeared as himself on Madam Secretary, where he performed a small portion of \\"Baby I Love Your Way\\". He similarly appeared on the final episode of that program (aired 07-December-2019) performing numerous songs at the wedding of the President's daughter. Personal life =Marriages, other relationships and family= Frampton has been married three times and has three children. His first marriage was to Mary Lovett, from 1972 to 1976. He was sued by Penelope J. \\"Penny\\" McCall in 1978 for palimony. McCall asked for half of Frampton's earnings during the five years that they were together. According to McCall, she gave up her job as a rock promoter and devoted herself full-time to Frampton, just as he achieved superstar status. A New York judge ruled that Frampton and McCall never intended to marry each other and \\"never held themselves out to the public as husband and wife\\" and dismissed her complaint on the grounds that to act otherwise would condone adultery. The case set precedent in New York. From 1983 to 1993, Frampton was married to Barbara Gold, with whom he had two children named Jade and Julian. The latter co-wrote and sang on Frampton's song \\"Road to the Sun\\" from Thank You Mr. Churchill. His third marriage was on 13 January 1996 to Tina Elfers, with whom he had a daughter, actress Mia Frampton, and a stepdaughter named Tiffany Wiest. Frampton filed for divorce from Elfers in Los Angeles, California, on 22 June 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. =Other= In June 1978, Frampton was involved in a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas and suffered broken bones, a concussion, and muscle damage. Dealing with the pain of the accident led to a brief period of drug abuse. Frampton has lived in London and various U.S. locations, including Westchester County, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Nashville, Tennessee. He moved to Indian Hill, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, in June 2000. This is the birthplace of his ex-wife Elfers and the city in which they were married in 1996. They chose to live there to be closer to Elfers' family. He currently lives in Nashville. Frampton cites the September 11 attacks as his reason for becoming a U.S. citizen and seeking the right to vote. He is a vegetarian. On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Frampton among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Equipment In 1987, Frampton played two natural-finish maple body Pensa-Suhr Strat types, hand-made by New York-based John Suhr. He used a Coral electric sitar, given to him in the late 70s and previously owned by Jimi Hendrix, on David Bowie's 1987 album Never Let Me Down. On the cover of the double live album Frampton Comes Alive, Frampton plays a highly customized 1954 Gibson Les Paul that was given to him during a concert by his friend Marc Mariana. He continues to play the Les Paul now known as the \\"Phenix\\". Frampton lost his black, custom Gibson Les Paul in a cargo plane crash in Venezuela. Frampton and the Les Paul were reunited 30 years later. Frampton was known as the artist who made the talk box famous. Frampton's talk box was used to transfer the guitar‚Äôs sound through a plastic tube attached to a microphone. The effect is Frampton's melodic guitar simulating speech while asking the audience on the live track \\"Do You Feel Like We Do?\\" Frampton also now sells his own line of custom-designed \\"Framptone\\" products, including the talk box.

However, their sound has expanded to include psychedelic rock and progressive rock elements. The band broke up in 2000 amid creative differences, but reunited in late 2003, releasing the acclaimed album Black Brick Road. They released their eighth studio album, Illwill, in April 2011. In 2014 they released their first live album, By the Black Sea.  History  =Early years= Lake of Tears was founded in the early 1990s by Daniel Brennare, Jonas Eriksson, Mikael Larsson and Johan Oudhuis. Their first album, entitled Greater Art, was released through the record label Black Mark Production in 1994. The album is doom metal featuring coarse, ragged vocals and crushing guitars. The band would subsequently steer away from such a directly categorized style, only revisiting it on their 2011 release Illwill. Lake of Tears wowed critics and fans alike with their second recording, Headstones, released in 1995. The music underwent important changes, expanding on the riff-base of doom metal to achieve a more melodic and melancholic sound. The lyrics also explored new territory, intensely mournful and psychedelic fantasy imagery enhancing the album's heavy, autumnal soundscapes. Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival LTR: Fredrik Jordanius, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival LTR: Mikael Larsson, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare Daniel Brennare at ProRock 2009 festival Mikael Larsson at ProRock 2009 festival =Mid-career success: A Crimson Cosmos= 1997 brought the release of the band's most popular studio effort until then, A Crimson Cosmos. If Headstones had been a revision of their earlier sound, A Crimson Cosmos was a complete rebirth, being a hypnotically melodic album. The release's closing track, \\"A Crimson Cosmos\\", reflected a marked influence by progressive/psychedelic luminaries Pink Floyd, while other tracks, such as Lady Rosenred and Raistlin and the Rose reflected popular fantasy themes. Rhythm guitarist Jonas Eriksson had left the band before the release, being replaced by guitarist Ulrik Lindblom. After recording A Crimson Cosmos and touring with Lake of Tears until 1999, he also left the band and had to be substituted by Magnus Sahlgren, who played as lead guitarist, but only as a guest artist. Although he played on Forever Autumn and every subsequent Lake of Tears album, often composing the majority of lead guitar riffs, Sahlgren was only formally accepted as a band member following the release of 2004's Black Brick Road. Lake of Tears' 1999 album, Forever Autumn, did not follow the trend settled by Headstones and A Crimson Cosmos, resulting an intensely quiet and introspective album. Keyboardist Christian Saarinen was briefly included as an official band member, adding an extra layer to the band's sound. Fantasy imagery was rife and the album's overall effect was sedate and sorrowful. =The breakup= Because of personal and creative differences, but also (and perhaps more-so) because of the lack of attention the band received from their label, the band went their separate ways shortly after the release of Forever Autumn, though they were still contractually bound to deliver one more album for Black Mark Production. This being the case, Brennare and Sahlgren retreated to the studio to record The Neonai, an electronica-influenced album relying on drum machines and uncharacteristically slick production values. The resulting album was released in 2002, and featured some of the band's most inspired songwriting and memorable melodies, regardless of the hasty manner in which it was composed and recorded. =The reunion and recent activity= In 2003 the band reunited out of boredom, participating in several jams. They were quick to realize that the brief hiatus had reinvigorated their collective spirits, and began to tentatively compose the material eventually released on their 2004 endeavor, Black Brick Road. Feeling that Black Mark Production had failed to market them appropriately, Lake of Tears began shopping for a new record label, and eventually settled on Noise Records. The subsequent release of Black Brick Road found the band exploring fresh concepts -the majority of the songs are highly abstract in nature, focusing on emotional states and dream- like imagery over specific nods to fantasy fiction and narrative structure. Following the album's release, Magnus Sahlgren was finally accepted as a member of the band, making his almost five years association official. Lake of Tears released their seventh studio album Moons and Mushrooms on April 26, 2007. The album featured a heavier approach to the guitar-work, unlike Black Brick Road whose melodies were primarily conceived via keyboard experimentation. The music was created directly in the rehearsal room, a new approach for the band. Moons and Mushrooms has a harder rock sound, though Brennare's lyrics continued to lean towards the melancholic and conceptual. A new album titled Illwill was released on April 29, 2011. It features an even heavier, darker approach, eschewing the band's typical evocation of mournful themes in favor of bleak and disturbing imagery. Lake of Tears released their first-ever live album on January 31, 2014. The album is titled By the Black Sea, and includes a full concert with 16 songs recorded earlier this year in Bucharest, Romania. It is also available as DVD/CD set. On July 13, 2020, Daniel Brennare publicly disclosed that he had been diagnosed with chronic leukaemeia, and that Illwill was \\"maybe a more obscure way\\" of dealing with it The same post suggests the name of the next album is \\"Ominous\\".

The group's pioneering music utilized minimalist electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers and primitive drum machines, and their early performances were confrontational and often ended in violence. They were among the first acts to use the phrase \\"punk music\\" in an advertisement for a concert in 1970. Though never widely popular among the general public, Suicide have been recognized as among the most influential acts of their era. Their debut album Suicide (1977) was described by Entertainment Weekly as \\"a landmark of electronic music,\\" while AllMusic stated that it \\"provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.\\" Rolling Stone called them \\"an unmeasurable influence on the industrial dance, noise, techno, ambient, and electronic scenes of the 1980s and 1990s.\\" History Some say Suicide took its name from the title of a Ghost Rider comic book issue titled \\"Satan Suicide,\\" seeing as the band would eventually release a song titled \\"Ghost Rider.\\" The band, however, formed in 1970, while Ghost Rider first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #5 in August of 1972, though Alan Vega did express his love for the comic books. Rev's simple keyboard riffs (initially played on a battered Farfisa organ combined with effects units, before changing to a synthesizer) were accompanied by primitive drum machines, providing a pulsing, minimalistic, electronic backdrop for Vega's murmuring and nervy vocals. It was the first band to use the term punk to describe itself, which the band had adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. Some of the band's earliest posters use the terms \\"punk music\\" and \\"punk music mass\\". Early Notoriety Suicide emerged alongside the early glam punk scene in New York, with a reputation for its confrontational live shows. Many of the band's early shows were at the Mercer Arts Center, alongside bands such as the New York Dolls and Eric Emerson and the Magic Tramps. David Johansen once played harmonica with Suicide in an early show there. Vega and Rev both dressed like arty street thugs, and Vega was notorious for brandishing a length of motorcycle drive chain onstage. Vega once stated \\"We started getting booed as soon as we came onstage. Just from the way we looked they started giving us hell already.\\" This sort of audience confrontation was inspired by Vega's witnessing of an Iggy and the Stooges concert at the New York State Pavilion in August 1969, which he later described as \\"great art\\". After the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center in 1973, Suicide played at Max's Kansas City and CBGB (before being banned), often sharing the bill with emerging punk bands. Their first album was reissued with bonus material, including \\"23 Minutes Over Brussels\\", a recording of a Suicide concert that later deteriorated into a riot. The band's first album, Suicide (1977), was released independently on Red Star Records. Although initial press reviews were divided (with Rolling Stone in particular giving it a scathing review), media recognition has changed over the years. One critic writes: Che', 'Ghost Rider'‚Äîthese eerie, sturdy, proto-punk anthems rank among the most visionary, melodic experiments the rock realm has yet produced.\\" Of note is the ten-minute \\"Frankie Teardrop\\", which tells the story of a poverty-stricken 20-year-old factory worker pushed to the edge. Critic Emerson Dameron writes that the song is \\"one of the most terrifying, riveting, absurd things I‚Äôve ever heard.\\" Nick Hornby in his book 31 Songs describes the track as something you would listen to \\"only once\\". Other Projects In 1986, Alan Vega collaborated with Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy on the Gift album, released under the name of The Sisterhood. Vega and Rev have both released solo albums. Return Suicide released their first album in over a decade with 2002's American Supreme. Sales, however, were slow, and critical reception was mixed. In 2005, SAF Publishing put out Suicide No Compromise, a \\"docu-biography\\" by David Nobahkt, which featured extensive interviews with Vega and Rev as well as many of their contemporaries and famous fans. In 2008, Blast First Petite released Alan Vega 70th Birthday Limited Edition EP Series‚Äîa monthly, limited-edition series of 10\\" vinyl EPs and downloads by major artists, honoring Alan Vega's 70th birthday. Among those paying tribute were Bruce Springsteen, Primal Scream, Peaches, Grinderman, Spiritualized, The Horrors, +Pansonic, Julian Cope, Lydia Lunch, Vincent Gallo, LIARS, and The Klaxons. The label also released Suicide: 1977‚Äì1978, a 6-CD box set, the same year. In September 2009, the group performed their debut LP live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. In May 2010 the band performed the entire first album live at two London concerts, double billed with Iggy & The Stooges performing Raw Power. The band performed their final concert at London's Barbican Centre on 9 July 2015. Billed as 'A Punk Mass', the show featured solo sets by both Rev and Vega before a headlining Suicide performance. Henry Rollins, Bobby Gillespie and Jehnny Beth made guest appearances. The concert received positive reviews. Alan Vega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016 at the age of 78. His death was announced by musician and radio host Henry Rollins, who shared an official statement from Vega's family on his website. Legacy Suicide's albums of the late 1970s and early 1980s have now become _regarded as some of the most influential recordings of their time and helped shape the direction of indie rock, industrial music, and dance music_.

(covered \\"Ghost Rider\\"), Devo, Ultravox, Massive Attack, Air, Autechre, The Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Aphex Twin and The Kills, Bono Vox and Bruce Springsteen have all listed Suicide as an influence. Examples of their influence on Bruce Springsteen include the song \\"State Trooper\\" from his album Nebraska and his solo keyboard version of \\"Dream Baby Dream\\" closing the concerts on his 2005 Devils & Dust Tour and in his studio version on his 2014 album High Hopes. Covers In 1994, The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack contains \\"Ghost Rider\\" covered by the Rollins Band. The Fatima Mansions released a cover of \\"Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne\\" on their 1994 single \\"Nite Flights\\". In May 1999, ? and the Mysterians released a cover of \\"Cheree\\" on the album More Action. The riff from \\"Ghost Rider\\" was sampled extensively in M.I.A.'s single, \\"Born Free\\", released in April 2010. In mid-2009, the band The Horrors released a cover of the song \\"Shadazz\\" as part of a tribute to Alan Vega and his work. They have performed it many times live, along with another Suicide song, \\"Ghost Rider\\". Later that year, Primal Scream and Miss Kittin covered the song \\"Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne\\" for a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl pressing. A total of 3,000 copies were pressed and released on March 30, 2009. \\"Ghost Rider\\" was covered by the garage punk band The Gories and released on the Cheapo Crypt Sampler No. 2 In April 2011, the influential dance-punk band LCD Soundsystem used a snippet from \\"Ghost Rider\\" during the song \\"Losing My Edge\\" and covered the Alan Vega solo effort \\"Bye Bye Bayou\\" during their final concert, held in a sold-out Madison Square Garden. In April 2012, Neneh Cherry released a cover of the song \\"Dream Baby Dream\\" which appeared on her album The Cherry Thing. Long time fan Bruce Springsteen also covered Dream Baby Dream in 2016. In May 2014, Savages released a live cover of \\"Dream Baby Dream\\" on the b-side of their single \\"Fuckers\\"/\\"Dream Baby Dream\\" 12\\".

They stretch for about downstream from Kingston, Ontario. The Canadian islands are in the province of Ontario and the U.S. islands in the state of New York. The islands range in size from over to smaller islands occupied by a single residence, or uninhabited outcroppings of rocks. To count as one of the Thousand Islands, emergent land within the river channel must have at least of land above water level year-round, and support at least two living trees.  Geography  The Thousand Islands archipelago is at the outlet of Lake Ontario at the head of the Saint Lawrence River. The region is bisected by the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and covers portions of Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties in the U.S. state of New York, in addition to parts of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and Frontenac County in the Canadian province of Ontario. Geologically, most of the islands are where a branch of the Canadian Shield, known as the Thousand Islands ‚Äì Frontenac Arch region, runs south across the river to join with the Adirondacks. This region was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002. =Transportation= The Thousand Islands Bridge connects New York State and Ontario by traversing Wellesley Island at the northernmost point of Interstate 81 in Jefferson County and meets Highway 137, which leads to Highway 401. The waterfront is served by New York State Routes 12 and 37 and by the Thousand Islands Parkway in Ontario. Ontario also has the Waterfront Trail alongside the Parkway for cyclists who wish to see the area in an alternative way. Seawaymax lake freighters often ply the Saint Lawrence Seaway. As is usual in inland waters of the USA and Canada, vessels must use maritime pilots to help them travel safely. In places, a vessel less than offshore can find itself in over of water. Conversely, rocks and shoals less than underwater can be found in the center of otherwise deep waters. Due to the great number of rocks and shoals just above or below the water's surface, navigation outside of the marked channels at night can be dangerous. Before the introduction of the zebra mussel, visibility of only was usual, slightly decreasing as the years passed. Water clarity improved markedly in the mid-1990s with the arrival of zebra mussels, which feed on algae. The water is so clear in some areas a rocky bottom can be observed in of water. The area has several shipwrecks, and although most are over underwater, some are a mere down and can be seen from the surface. =Notable islands= * The largest island in the group, Wolfe Island, is entirely in Ontario. Other large islands in the archipelago include New York's Grindstone Island and Wellesley Island, and Ontario's Howe Island. * Adjacent to Wolfe Island but part of New York is Carleton Island, the site of a ruined fort, Fort Haldimand, built in 1779 by the British during the American Revolutionary War. The island was captured by three American soldiers during the War of 1812 and remains part of the United States. * Deer Island, about north of Alexandria Bay, is owned by the secret society of Skull and Bones. * A pair of islands southwest of Grenadier Island are collectively called Zavikon Island. A popular but incorrect tale is the larger island is in Canada, while the smaller one is in the United States, and the foot bridge between them is the shortest international bridge in the world. Zavikon Island is entirely in Canada and belongs to the Leeds and Grenville municipal unit. * Longue Vue Island is the only artificial island in the region. * Ironsides Island is home to one of the largest great blue heron rookeries in northern New York State, where over one thousand herons return to breed each April. The uninhabited rocky island near Alexandria Bay, New York, is owned by The Nature Conservancy and was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1967. * Calumet Island is near Clayton, New York. The privately owned island formerly featured a \\"castle\\" mansion belonging to New York tobacco tycoon Charles G. Emery, and later hosted a marina in the 1960s. * Just Room Enough Island is the smallest inhabited island in the United States.  History  Prior to European colonization, the Thousand Islands region was home to, or visited by, members of the Iroquois Confederacy and Ojibwa people. Their name for the islands was Manitouana or the \\"Garden of the Great Spirit\\". The region was a part of the War of 1812 between the British Empire and the United States. Many sites from the war can be found, such as Fort Wellington in Prescott, Ontario and the garrison on Chimney Island, Mallorytown, Ontario. Museums about the war can be found on both the Canadian and American side of the river. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many distinguished visitors made the region widely known as a summer resort. During the half century (1874‚Äì1912) of the resort's greatest prominence, most wealthy vacationers came from New York City, joined by prominent families from Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and other cities of the United States and Canada. Several grand hotels provided luxurious accommodations while steamboats offered extensive tours among the islands. Wealthy and middle-class summer residents built summer homes, and the region retains a historically important collection of vacation homes from this time. Among the lavish homes built during this time were several masonry \\"castles\\", some of which remain as international landmarks. The region's first castle, Castle Rest, was built in 1888; it was destroyed in the mid-20th century. The most famous extant examples are \\"The Towers\\" on Dark Island, now called Singer Castle, and the previously long-neglected Boldt Castle on Heart Island, which had been left unfinished for over 75 years upon the untimely death of George Boldt's wife. It has since been completed over the recent decades in accord with Boldt's original plans. The Thousand Islands have long been a center for recreational boating. Large steam yachts, many designed by Nathanael Herreshoff, required distinctive yacht houses. The region was known also for innovative power boating during this period. Three local yacht clubs hosted the Gold Cup Races of the American Power Boat Association for nine consecutive years. Recreation =Public parks= To be considered an island, a piece of land must stay above water throughout the year and support a living tree. Many of the islands are publicly owned. A group of 21 islands form the Thousand Islands National Park, the oldest of Canada's national parks east of the Rocky Mountains. The park hosts campgrounds, inland walking trails, annual family events, as well as a national heritage building. Thirty New York state parks are managed as part of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation's Thousand Islands Region, including many on river islands or along the New York shore. Many of these river parks were established in the late 19th and early 20th century as part of the St. Lawrence Reservation, and were among New York's earliest land acquisitions for the purpose of preservation and recreational development. Among the larger parks are Wellesley Island State Park, which includes the largest camping complex in the region, and Robert Moses State Park. =Other boating, fishing and vacationing locations= *One of the few beaches in the Thousand Islands, Potter's Beach (conserved by the Thousand Islands Land Trust) on the American Grindstone Island has a fine, shallow sandy bottom with a very gradual slope, and serves as a location for boats to set anchor and spend a day at the beach or hiking on the trails that extend around Grindstone Island. *A popular location for swimming or anchoring out of the wind, the Lake of the Isles is a secluded area cut off from the rest of the St. Lawrence River by Wellesley Island and neighboring Canadian Hill Island. Access is limited through two narrow passages, one around the northeastern end of the island, and the other being the International Rift, which is a small, shallow, winding canal that leads you through to the north side of the island passing right underneath the customs bridge. *Known for its fishing, especially pike, Eel Bay is a shallow bay just southwest of Wellesley Island. *The Thousand Islands Land Trust (TILT) conserves over of land in the Thousand Islands region. This land includes many creeks, nature preserves and over of trails open to the public, year-round, free of charge. The Trust's annual series of programs ‚Äì TILTreks, TeenTreks, KidsTreks and TILTKids Camp ‚Äì give individuals and families the opportunity to participate in regional field trips and recreational activities as well as attend presentations on wildlife or habitat preservation. TILT's community events help further their conservation efforts in the Thousand Islands region. Powerhouse, Heart Island (Boldt Castle) *Boldt Castle, a testament of one man's love of his wife, has been under renovation by its owner, the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority since 1977, and can be visited by boat or tour cruise. This 120-room mansion is on Heart Island just across the shipping channel from Alexandria Bay. The grounds consist of the main castle, the power house, the play house, and a boat house tucked in across the bay on the inside of the island. *Though not as famous as George Boldt's Castle, Singer Castle on Dark Island is privately renovated and is open to tourists. Frederick Bourne had his castle constructed with secret passageways and hidden wine cellars so he could spy on his guests while keeping his liquor out of sight during the prohibition era. *The Antique Boat Museum in Clayton, New York houses antique wooden boats used or built in the region. The museum also features exhibits on the region's maritime culture and is home to La Duchesse, George Boldt's luxury houseboat. *Thousand Islands Boat Museum in Gananoque, Ontario is a young, hands-on waterfront museum celebrating the heritage of the St. Lawrence River. Workshops, events and a collection of 36 boats are on offer. *The Thousand Islands also facilitates freshwater shipwreck diving. Numerous wrecks lay at the bottom of the seaway including America, Islander, and Keystorm. There are wrecks that are appropriate for all diving skill levels. Aviation and airports Passenger air service to the Thousand Islands region is available in both Ontario and New York. Watertown International Airport (ART) in Watertown, New York has daily service on American Airlines connecting through Philadelphia (PHL). Norman Rogers Airport (YGK) in Kingston, Ontario offers daily service on Air Canada connecting through Toronto Pearson. Both airports also offer private aviation services. Maxson Airfield (FAA LID: 89NY) is a privately owned, private-use general aviation airport south of the central business district of Alexandria Bay, a village in Jefferson County, New York. It once had commercial service provided by Mohawk Airlines. At that time, the airport bore the IATA airport code AXB. Maxson is available to the public by Maxson Airfield, LLC. Brockville-Thousand Islands Regional Tackaberry Airport (IATA: XBR, TC LID: CNL3), also known as Brockville Municipal Airport, is a registered aerodrome in Elizabethtown- Kitley Township, northwest of the city of Brockville, Ontario, Canada. Thousand Island dressing According to The Oxford Companion of Food and Drink, the name for Thousand Island dressing \\"presumably comes from the Thousand Islands between the United States and Canada in the St. Lawrence River.\\" However, several different versions of the dressing's origin exist. One common story describes how a fishing guide's wife, Sophia LaLonde, made the condiment as part of her husband George's shore dinner. Often in this version, actress May Irwin requested the recipe after enjoying it. Irwin in turn gave it to another Thousand Islands summer resident, George Boldt, who built Boldt Castle between 1900 and 1904. Boldt, as proprietor of the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel, instructed the hotel's ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, Oscar Tschirky, to put the dressing on the menu in 1894. Sociologists attempting to determine the true origin of Thousand Island dressing found several conflicting origin stories exist, and they vary between the various islands and villages of the Thousand Islands region. None appear to have any strong written evidence to support their specific claims.

The Limes is often associated with Roman forts, but the concept could apply to any adjoining area the Romans exercised loose control with military forces. Overview Hadrian's Wall and Limes The Roman frontier stretched for more than from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the limites today consist of vestiges of walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements. Certain elements of the frontier have been excavated, some reconstructed, and a few destroyed. The two sections of limes in Germany cover a length of from the north-west of the country to the Danube in the south-east. The 118 km long Hadrian's Wall was built on the orders of the Emperor Hadrian c. AD 122 at the northernmost limits of the Roman province of Britannia. It is a striking example of the organization of a military zone and illustrates the defensive techniques and geopolitical strategies of ancient Rome. The Antonine Wall, a 60 km-long fortification in Scotland, was started by Emperor Antoninus Pius in AD 142 as a defense against the \\"Barbarians\\" of the north. It constitutes the northwesternmost portion of the Roman Limes. The soldiers at a limes were referred to as limitanei. Compared to the regular Roman military, they tended to be more likely to be of local descent (rather than Italians), be paid less, and be overall less prestigious. However, they were not expected to win large scales wars, but rather deter small-to-medium-sized raiders.

Etymology The stem of limes, limit-, which can be seen in the genitive case, limitis, marks it as the ancestor of an entire group of words in many languages related to Latin; for example, English limit or French limite. The Latin noun lƒ´mes (;Oxford English Dictionary (1989) Latin ') had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields; a boundary line or marker; any road or path; any channel, such as a stream channel; or any distinction or difference.Benjamin Isaac, \\"The Meaning of 'Limes' and 'Limitanei' in Ancient Sources\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 78 (1988), pp. 125‚Äì147 The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis.Benjamin Isaac, \\"The Meaning of 'Limes' and 'Limitanei' in Ancient Sources\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 78 (1988), pp. 125‚Äì147; Benjamin Isaac, The Limits of Empire: the Roman Army in the East (Oxford: Oxford University Press, revised edition 1992). An etymology by Julius Pokorny in Indogermanisches Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch says that limes comes from Indo-European el-, elei-, lei-, \\"to bow\\", \\"to bend\\", \\"elbow\\". According to Pokorny, Latin limen, \\"threshold\\", is related to limes, being the stone over which one enters or leaves the house. Some scholars have viewed the frontier as a threshold. The Merriam‚ÄìWebster dictionaries take this view, as does J. B. Hofmann in Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch des Griechischen under leimon. The White Latin Dictionary denies any connection, deriving limen from *ligmen, as in lien from *leig-, \\"tie\\". In this sense, the threshold ties together the doorway. W. Gebert also wrote an article discussing the term.W. Gebert, \\"Limes\\", Untersuchungen zur Erkl√§rung des Vortes und seiner Anwendung, Bonner Jahrb√ºcher Bd. 119, No. 2, 1910, 158‚Äì205. Some experts suggested that the Germanic limes may have been called Munimentum Traiani (Trajan's Bulwark) by contemporaries, referring to a passage by Ammianus Marcellinus, according to which emperor Julian had reoccupied this fortification in 360 AD.Hessian state archaeologist Prof. E. Schallmeyer, quoted in Schmid, A., Schmid, R., M√∂hn, A., Die R√∂mer an Rhein und Main (Frankfurt: Societ√§ts-Verlag, revised edition 2006). Limites in the Roman Empire  = Britain and Gaul = Map of fortifications and castles in North Britain around 155 AD This section of limes existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD and ran through the provinces of: * Britannia Inferior * Britannia Superior The limes in Britain (Limes Britannicus) is on the territory of the present-day United Kingdom in England, Scotland and Wales. From the 1st to the 2nd century, the Gask Ridge and the Stanegate, with their chains of Roman camps and watchtowers, marked the northern boundary of Britannia. Later the isthmuses in the north between the Firth of Forth and Firth of Clyde were guarded by the defences of the Antonine Wall and the line between the mouth of the Tyne and Solway Firth by Hadrian's Wall. The perimeter defence of Hadrian's Wall was achieved through the construction of camps (castella) on the lowlands, which were built along the most important roads in the north. Security and monitoring on the coasts in the west and southeast was achieved by camps and by chains of watchtowers or signal towers, both along the coastline and along main roads in the interior. The occupying forces, Exercitus Britannicus, consisted mostly of cohorts of auxilia. The strategic reserve comprised three legions based in Eburacum (York), Isca Silurum and Deva. The observation and surveillance of the waters around the British Isles was the responsibility of the Classis Britannica, whose headquarters was in Rutupiae (Richborough). Legions auxilia cohorts and the fleet were commanded by the provincial governors. From the 3rd century, units of comitatenses, limitanei and liburnaria (marines) came under the command of two generals: * Comes Britanniarum * Dux Britanniarum = Saxon Shore = Map of British and Gallic forts on the Saxon Shore This section of the limes existed from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD and covered the provinces of: * Britannia Inferior * Belgica * Lugdunensis * Aquitania This limes of the Late Antiquity ran through the territory of the present-day United Kingdom and France. In the 3rd century, a separate military district, the Litus Saxonicum, was established on the British side of the English Channel between the estuaries of the Wash and the Solent, to repel Saxon pirates and plunderers. The Gallic side of the English Channel and Atlantic coast were included therein. Monitoring and coastal surveillance were carried out by a chain of watchtowers or signal towers, camps and fortified ports (Gaul). Most of the Saxon Shore camps probably served as naval bases. The garrisons of the camps were composed of infantry and several cavalry regiments. Monitoring and surveillance of the Channel were the responsibility of the Classis Britannica and Classis Sambrica, whose headquarters were in Locus Quartensis (Port d'Etaple), guarding the mouth of the River Somme. The units of comitatenses, limitanei and liburnaria in this area came under the command of three generals: * Comes litoris Saxonici per Britanniam (Count of the Saxon Shore) * Dux Belgicae secundae * Dux tractus Armoricani et Nervicani = Lower Germania = Map of the legion camps and forts in Germania Inferior This section of limes existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD and ran through the province of Lower Germania (Germania Inferior). It lies on the territory of today's Netherlands and Germany. This limes was a river border (limes ripa) on the Rhine, defended by a chain of camps, that ran from the North Sea (Katwijk- Brittenburg camp) to Vinxtbach (opposite Rheinbrohl fort on the Upper Germanic Limes), forming the border between the Roman provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior. By contrast with the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, it was not marked by a solid palisade or wall. Neither can any defensive ditch or rampart be identified. The guards were stationed in nearby castra and watchtowers usually built immediately on the Rhine. The limes was served by a well-developed military road. Each camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area, because the Rhine not only formed the border but was also the most important transport and trade route in the region. In the first section, between the camps of Rigomagus (Remagen) and Bonna (Bonn), there were only a few camps. In the second, middle, section between Bonna and Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum (Nijmegen), there were considerably more. Here there were also larger legion camps; with one exception, all were cavalry barracks. The landscape of the third section between Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum and Mare Germanicum (the North Sea) was characterised by numerous small streams and boggy marshland. Consequently, in this area there was only one cavalry camp. Border security here consisted mainly of tightly packed, relatively small cohort forts. The occupying troops, Exercitus Germaniae Inferioris, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts. From the 2nd century, the strategic reserve comprised three legions stationed in Bonna/Bonn, Novaesium/Neuss, Vetera/Xanten and Noviomagus/Nijmegen. The control and surveillance of the waters of the North Sea, the Rhine estuary and the Lower Rhine was the responsibility of the Classis Germanica whose headquarters was in Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium/Cologne. Legions, auxilia and fleet units were commanded by the respective provincial governor. From the 3rd century the ripenses (river guards), comitatenses, and liburnaria were under the command of the Dux Belgicae secundae. = Upper Germania and Rhaetia = Map of the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes This limes existed from the 1st to 5th centuries AD and guarded the provinces of: * Germania Superior * Rhaetia It lay on the territory of the present German states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Baden- W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria. To the north, it bordered those parts of the Roman province of Rhaetia that lay north of the Danube and guarded the eastern border of that part of Germania Superior that lay east of the Rhine. In Upper Germania the border defences initially consisted only of a post road. From about 162/63 AD, the Romans constructed a defensive barrier with watchtowers and signal towers, palisades, ditches and earthworks. On one short section of the Rhaetian Limes, a solid stone wall was erected. In its final stages, the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes was about 550 kilometres long and ran from Rheinbrohl, in the county of Neuwied in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, as far as Hienheim on the Danube. Between the villages of Osterburken and Welzheim, the limes ran for 81 kilometres almost in a straight line southwards.M.J.T. Lewis: Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , pp. 242 245. In the scholarly literature, this unusual section is considered as evidence that this type of boundary wall had never been used for defensive purposes. The land of Agri Decumates that was guarded by this limes had to be vacated by the Romans in 260-285 AD. They moved their bases back to the banks of the Rhine and Danube, which were much easier to defend militarily. The exact route of the limes along the border between Upper Germania and Raetia has not been fully explored. In the late 4th and early 5th centuries, the Rhaetian Limes was reorganized and divided into three sections. The northern border of Rhaetia formed the pars superior (upper part), the western border was the pars media (central part) with the fortified town of Cambodunum and bases from Vemania (Isny im Allg√§u) to Cassilacum (Memmingen); the pars inferior (lower part) was the section between Castra Regina (Regensburg) and Batavis (Passau). The defending troops, Exercitus Germaniae superioris and Exercitus Raeticus, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts. From the 2nd century, the strategic reserve was formed from three legions stationed in Mogontiacum/Mainz, Argentorate/Strasbourg and Castra Regina/Regensburg. The monitoring of the Upper Rhine was the responsibility of the Classis Germanica; that of the Rhaetic Danube came under the Classis Pannonia, whose headquarters was in Aquincum/Budapest. Legions and auxilia cohorts were under the command of the governor. From the 3rd century the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian border troops (comitatenses, repenses, and liburnaria), were commanded by three generals: * Dux Raetiae, * Dux Mogontiacensis * Comes tractus Argentoratensis = Danube-Iller-Rhine Limes (DIRL) = Location of the Roman camps on the Rhine-Lake Constance line and in the hinterland provinces of Maxima Sequanorum and Raetia I, 3rd century AD This limes existed from the 3rd to the 5th centuries AD and guarded the provinces of: * Germania Superior * Rhaetia It lies on the territory of present-day Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. As early as the period 15 BC to about 70 AD, the border between Rome and Germania ran mostly along the line of the late antique Danube-Iller- Rhine Limes (DIRL) before the Romans advanced further north into the Agri decumates. Because of troop withdrawals and massive barbarian invasions, the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes were abandoned in the late 3rd century and the Roman forces pulled the border back to the banks of the three rivers. Especially around the year 300, the Emperor Diocletian had new fortifications built directly on the river banks or on major roads in the hinterland here. Around 370 AD, the line of fortifications was considerably strengthened under the Emperor Valentinian I to counter the Alemanni, who were steadily advancing southwards. By contrast with the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, the DIRL primarily fulfilled defensive purposes; its camps had much stronger and higher walls than their High Imperial predecessors. Furthermore, they had in most cases been built to conform to the local topography. This meant that they could not be built in the classical 'pack of cards' shape. Between them a dense chain of watchtowers and signal towers was constructed to provide an additional security measure (burgi). Flotillas of patrol boats were stationed on the large lakes in this region. * Lake Constance: Numerus Barcariorum (HQ at Brigantium/Bregenz) * Lake Neuch√¢tel: Classis Barcariorum (HQ at Eburodunum/Yverdon). Comitatenses, ripenses, and liburnaria in this section of the limes were under the command of four generals: * Dux Raetiae * Dux provinciae Sequanicae * Comes tractus Argentoratensis * Dux Germaniae primae = Noricum = Map of the Norican Limes This section of the limes existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD and guarded part of the Roman province of Noricum. It is on the soil of the present-day Austrian states of Upper and Lower Austria. It ran along the Danube from Passau/Boiodurum to Zeiselmauer/Cannabiaca. This is also a ripa (river border), which was guarded by a loose chain of cohort forts. The main road on the Norican Limes was the via iuxta amnem Danuvium. The initially simple wood and earth structures were systematically converted under Emperor Hadrian into stone encampments. During the 4th century, they were brought once more up to date and massively reinforced. Between the camps, in strategic places or good points of observation, were watchtowers or signal towers and, in the Late Antiquity, burgi. In the middle section, between the camps of Favianis and Melk, watchtowers were built only sporadically. Here the narrow valley of the Wachau, with its densely forested escarpments, made access to the riverbank more difficult, providing some defensive function. Every camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area because the Danube was not only border zone, but also the most important transport and trade route in the region. Over time civilian settlements or vici were established immediately next to the camps. In the immediate hinterland of the limes, walled towns or municipia were founded - for example, Aelium Cetium or Ovilava (Wels). They were the administrative or commercial centres of the region. In late antiquity, the Norican area was divided into two parts (pars inferior and pars superior).ND occ.: XXXIV It is probable that a second, defensive line was created to the rear (Castrum Locus Felicis). The occupying troops, Exercitus Noricus, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts and a legion stationed in Lauriacum/Enns acted as the strategic reserve. The surveillance and security of the Danube and its tributaries were the responsibility of the Classis Pannonia. Units of the legions, naval and auxiliary forces were commanded by the respective governors. In late antiquity - according to Notitia Dignitatum - four newly established flotillas undertook this task. From the 3rd century, the Norian comitatenses, ripenses and liburnari were under the command of two generals: * Comes Illyrici, * Dux Pannoniae Primae et Norici Ripensis = Pannonia = Map of the Pannonian Limes with its perimeter defences This stretch of limes was in use from the 1st to the 5th centuries AD and helped to guard the provinces of: * Pannonia inferior * Pannonia The Pannonian Limes is situated on the territory of present-day Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. Although this section of the frontier was relatively well protected by the Danube river border or Ripa, the Roman military presence here was always exceptionally strong (three military camps in Pannonia, but only one in Lower Pannonia) because especially after the abandonment of Roman Dacia in the late 3rd century, the pressure of migrant peoples from the east on this section of the limes intensified. The tributaries emptying into the Danube offered cheap transport routes, but also made good approach routes for invaders and raiders. The military camps were therefore built by the most important fords or confluences and road termini. The legion- and auxilia camps were mainly located in the immediate vicinity of the riverbank. The initial wood and earth structures, were systematically converted under Emperor Hadrian into stone barracks and, in the 4th century, redesigned and massively strengthened in order to match new strategic requirements. The gaps between the camps were closed by a chain of watchtowers or signal towers. In late Roman times huge inland camps were built and towns in the hinterland were fortified to create a second line of defence. In addition, at vulnerable points, units of the Danube fleet were stationed. In the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius the first mention is made in Pannonia of stone watchtowers (burgi, panelled towers and fortlets (praesidia). In late antiquity, the Pannonian military district was divided into two parts (pars inferior and pars superior). Advance defences were provided by bridgehead camps (e.g. Castra Contra Aquincum or Celemantia) and military stations on main transport routes in the Barbaricum (e.g. near Musov). Southern borders Limes Africanus under Septimius Severus (The frontier of Roman Africa (dark tan) in the late 2nd century AD: Septimius Severus expanded the Limes Tripolitanus dramatically (medium tan), even briefly holding a military presence (light tan) in the Garamantian capital Garama in 203) At the greatest extent of the Roman Empire, the southern border lay along the deserts of Arabia in the Middle East (see Romans in Arabia) and the Sahara in North Africa, which represented a natural barrier against expansion. The Empire controlled the Mediterranean shores and the mountain ranges further inland. The Romans attempted twice to occupy the Siwa Oasis and finally used Siwa as a place of banishment. However Romans controlled the Nile many miles into Africa up to the modern border between Egypt and Sudan. In Africa Romans controlled the area north of the Sahara, from the Atlantic Ocean to Egypt, with many sections of limes (Limes Tripolitanus, Limes Numidiae, etc.).Map of Roman Africa The Fossatum Africae (\\"African ditch\\") of at least 750 km controlled the southern borders of the Empire and had many similarities of construction to Hadrian's Wall. There are similar, but shorter, fossatae in other parts of North Africa. Between the Matmata and Tabaga ranges in modern Tunisia there is a fossatum which was duplicated during World War II.Baradez (1949) p. 146. There also appears to be a 20-km. fossatum at Bou Regreg in Morocco although this would not have been within the scope of the proclamation of the Codex Theodosianus because at that time the province was not in Africa, administratively speaking.Baradez (1949) p. 114. In the south of Mauritania Tingitana the frontier in the third century lay just north of Casablanca near Sala and stretched to Volubilis. Septimius Severus expanded the \\"Limes Tripolitanus\\" dramatically, even briefly holding a military presence in the Garamantian capital Garama in 203 AD. Much of the initial campaigning success was achieved by Quintus Anicius Faustus, the legate of Legio III Augusta. Following his African conquests, the Roman Empire may have reached its greatest extent during the reign of Septimius Severus,David L. Kennedy, Derrick Riley (2012), Rome's Desert Frontiers, page 13, RoutledgeR.J. van der Spek, Lukas De Blois (2008), An Introduction to the Ancient World, page 272, Routledge under whom the empire encompassed an area of 2 million square miles ( million square kilometers). = Fossatum Africae = Black lines indicating the approximate path of the 4 sections of the Fossatum Africae Fossatum Africae (\\"African ditch\\") is a linear defensive structure (limes) that extended over 750 km or moreThis figure depends very much on the way it is measured over the intervals where the Fossatum was not constructed or has disappeared, and includes a significant section which may not be a fossatum. in northern Africa constructed during the Roman Empire to defend and control the southern borders of the Empire in the Roman province of Africa. It is considered to have many similarities of construction to Hadrian's Wall at the northern border of the Empire in Britain. Generally the Fossatum consists of a ditch and earth embankments on either side using the material from the ditch. Sometimes the embankments are supplemented by dry stone walls on one or both sides; rarely, there are stone walls without a ditch. The width of the Fossatum is generally 3‚Äì6 m but in exceptional cases may be as much as 20 m. Wherever possible, it or its highest wall is constructed on the counterscarp. Excavations near Gemellae showed the depth there to be 2‚Äì3 m, with a width of 1 m at the bottom widening to 2‚Äì3 m at the top.Baradez (1949) p. 93. The Fossatum is accompanied by many small watchtowers and numerous forts, often built within sight of one another. Cultural impact Roman writers and subsequent authors who depended on them presented the limes as a sort of sacred border beyond which human beings did not transgress, and if they did, it was evidence that they had passed the bounds of reason and civilization. To cross the border was the mark of a savage. They wrote of the Alemanni failing to respect the limes as if they had passed the final limitation of character and had committed themselves to perdition. The Alemanni, on the other hand, never regarded the border as legitimate in the first place. They viewed the Romans as foreigners, who changed native place names and intruded on native homes and families. They were only to be tolerated because they were willing to pay cash for the privilege and also offered the blandishments of civilized life. The Romans never built limites where they considered themselves free to attack. As the army stayed within the limites, except for punitive expeditions, these were as much a mental barrier as material. The Germanic warriors harrying the limes during summer used the hesitance of the Romans to move beyond them to their advantage, knowing that they could concentrate and supply themselves outside the limes without fear of preemptive strikes. Post-Roman limites The Limes Saxoniae in Holstein was established in 810 AD, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Charlemagne considered his empire (later called the Carolingian Empire) as the true successor to the Roman Empire and called himself \\"Emperor of the Romans\\".

A variety of companies manufacture boPET and other polyester films under different brand names. In the UK and US, the best-known trade names are Mylar, Melinex, and Hostaphan.  History  BoPET film was developed in the mid-1950s,Izard, Emmette Farr, \\"Production of polyethylene terephthalate\\", U.S. patent no. 2,534,028 (filed: 1948 May 13; issued: 1950 December 12).Adams, John Francis Edward; Gerber, Kenneth George; Holmes-Walker, William Anthony, \\"Process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film\\", U.S. patent no. 3,177,277 (filed: 1957 May 10 ; issued: 1965 April 6). originally by DuPont, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), and Hoechst. In 1955 Eastman Kodak used Mylar as a support for photographic film and called it \\"ESTAR Base\\". The very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range U-2 reconnaissance flights.Eyes in the Sky, Dino A. Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, , pp. 102, 115. In 1964, NASA launched Echo II, a diameter balloon constructed from a thick mylar film sandwiched between two layers of thick aluminium foil bonded together.Staugaitis, C. & Kobren, L. (1966) \\"Mechanical And Physical Properties of the Echo II Metal-Polymer Laminate (NASA TN D-3409)\\", NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  Manufacture and properties  Chemical structure of polyethylene terephthalate The manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being extruded onto a chill roll, which quenches it into the amorphous state. It is then biaxially oriented by drawing. The most common way of doing this is the sequential process, in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction, i.e. orthogonally to the direction of travel, in a heated oven. It is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously, although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate. Draw ratios are typically around 3 to 4 in each direction. Once the drawing is completed, the film is \\"heat set\\" or crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above . The heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane. The orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented PET film, which has a typical Young's modulus of about . Another important consequence of the molecular orientation is that it induces the formation of many crystal nuclei. The crystallites that grow rapidly reach the boundary of the neighboring crystallite and remain smaller than the wavelength of visible light. As a result, biaxially oriented PET film has excellent clarity, despite its semicrystalline structure. If it were produced without any additives, the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up, similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked. To make handling possible, microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the PET to roughen the surface of the film such as silicon dioxide. Biaxially oriented PET film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium, gold, or other metal onto it. The result is much less permeable to gases (important in food packaging) and reflects up to 99% of light, including much of the infrared spectrum. For some applications like food packaging, the aluminized boPET film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene, which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance. The polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the boPET side shiny. Other coatings, such as conductive indium tin oxide (ITO), can be applied to boPET film by sputter deposition.  Applications  Uses for boPET polyester films include, but are not limited to: = Flexible packaging and food contact applications = * Laminates containing metallized boPET foil (in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss, achieving long shelf life. Examples are coffee \\"foil\\" packaging and pouches for convenience foods. * White boPET web substrate is used as lidding for dairy goods such as yogurt. * Clear boPET web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals. Due to its excellent heat resistance, it can remain on the package during microwave or oven heating. * Roasting bags * Metallised films * Laminated sheet metal (aluminium or steel) used in the manufacture of cans (bisphenol A-free alternative to lacquers) =Covering over paper= * A clear overlay on a map, on which notations, additional data, or copied data, can be drawn without damaging the map * Metallized boPET is used as a mirror-like decorative surface on some book covers, T-shirts, and other flexible cloths. * Protective covering over buttons/pins/badges * The glossy top layer of a Polaroid SX-70 photographic print * As a backing for very fine sandpaper * boPET film is used in bagging comic books, in order to best protect them during storage from environmental conditions (moisture, heat, and cold) that would otherwise cause paper to slowly deteriorate over time. This material is used for archival quality storage of documents by the Library of Congress (Mylar¬Æ type D, ICI Melinex 516 or equivalent) and several major library comic book research collections, including the Comic Art Collection at Michigan State University. While boPET is widely (and effectively) used in this archival sense, it is not immune to the effects of fire and heat and could potentially melt, depending on the intensity of the heat source, causing further damage to the encased item. * Similarly, trading card decks (such as Pok√©mon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh!) are packaged in pouches or sleeves made of metallized boPET. It can also be used to make the holographic artwork featured on some cards, typically known as \\"holos\\", \\"foils\\", \\"shinies\\", or \\"holofoils\\". *For protecting the spine of important documents, such as medical records. =Insulating material= * An electrical insulating material * Insulation for houses and tents, reflecting thermal radiation * Five layers of metallized boPET film in NASA's spacesuits make them radiation resistant and help regulate temperature. * Metallized boPET film emergency blankets conserve a shock victim's body heat. * As a thin strip to form an airtight seal between the control surfaces and adjacent structure of aircraft, especially gliders. * Light insulation for indoor gardening. * Fire shelters, used by wildland firefighters. * Aluminized proximity suits used by fire fighters for protection from the high amount of heat release from fuel fires. * Used in sock and glove liners to lock in warmth =Solar, marine and aviation applications= * Metallized boPET is intended to be used for solar sails as an alternative means of propulsion for spacecraft such as Cosmos 1 * Translucent Mylar film, as wide as 48\\" and in up to 12' in length, found widespread use as a non-dimensional engineering drawing media in the aerospace industry due to its dimensional stability (also see Printing Media section below). This allows production and engineering staff to lay manufactured parts directly over or under the drawing film in order to verify the fidelity of part profiles, hole locations and other part features. * Metallized boPET solar curtains reflect sunlight and heat away from windows. * Aluminized, as an inexpensive solar eclipse viewer, although care must be taken, because invisible fissures can form in the metal film, reducing its effectiveness. * High performance sails for sailboats, hang gliders, paragliders and kites * Use boPET films as the back face of the PV modules in solar panels * Metallized boPET as a reflector material for solar cooking stoves * To bridge control surface gaps on sailplanes (gliders), reducing profile drag =Science= * Amateur and professional visual and telescopic solar filters. BoPET films are often annealed to a glass element to improve thermal conductivity, and guarantee the necessary flat surface needed for even telescopic solar observation. Manufacturers will typically use films with thicknesses of , in order to give the films better resilience. thickness films with a heavy aluminium coating are generally preferred for naked-eye Solar observation during eclipses. * Films in annular ring mounts on gas-tight cells, will readily deform into spherical mirrors.

In 2016, the town had a population of 3965. The Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge, east of Prescott at Johnstown, connects the town with Ogdensburg, New York. The town is about an hour from both Ottawa and Kingston. The town was founded in the early 19th century by Edward Jessup, a Loyalist soldier during the American Revolution, who named the village after a former Governor-in-Chief, Robert Prescott. Before 1834, the town was a part of Augusta township; however, in that year the town became a police village and severed its ties with Augusta.Goldie A. Connell (1985) Augusta: Royal Township Number Seven. St. Lawrence Printing Co. ltd. p. 262 The land here was ideal for settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries as it was situated between Montreal and Kingston along the St. Lawrence River at the head of the rapids. History = French period = 1760 French map depicting Fort de Levis near Prescott, Ontario In the mid-to-late 1600s, the French occupied the area surrounding what was to become Prescott, Ontario. The first known location of a French settlement was a trading post in 1673 located east of Prescott in what is now Johnstown. By the 1680s, a small French fort was located in what is believed to be Prescott called Fort la Galette; according to O'Callaghan, the fortified post la Galette was located along the St. Lawrence River, north of Ogdensburg. Additionally, according to Queen's University Quarterly from 1895, the area around Prescott was sometimes referred to as la Galette which it attributed to references to the first fort taken from French diaries. The fort was built to protect their newly established trading posts from the British invasion. It is unclear when or why this fort fell into disuse; however, Fort de La Pr√©sentation was built in close proximity in 1749 which could have been built to replace la Galette. The French left the area after the Battle of the Thousand Islands, and little to no trace of their settlements exist.  Battle of the Thousand Islands  In 1760, the Battle of the Thousand Islands took place near present-day Prescott, Ontario. By 1760, tensions were high between the British and the French who both intended to settle the area located around Prescott. The French began building another fort, slightly east of Prescott on what is presently known as Chimney Island called Fort de Levis. The French forts were no match for the British. When the Battle of the Thousand Islands finally took place in August 1760, the British had 11,000 troops to the French's 300 men. Despite this, the French managed to hold back the British for a little over a week, sinking two British ships in the process. When the French ran out of ammunition on August 24, 1760, they surrendered to the British troops. Fort de Levis was renamed Fort Oswegatchie by the British and was later used in the Revolutionary War. The island on which this fort stood was submerged during the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. = Loyalists arrival and first settlement = In and around 1775 during the Revolutionary War, America was politically divided. Many American's were unsatisfied with British rule and sought their independence. Those who sided with the British or who remained neutral were considered to be rebels or traitors known as Loyalists, and this opposition was met with violence.Goldie A. Connell (1985) Augusta: Royal Township Number Seven. St. Lawrence Printing Co. ltd. p. 3-16 As tensions escalated, the Loyalists were forced from their homes, fleeing north to what would become Upper Canada. The Loyalists were in a terrible position, as they had fled their homes with few to no possessions, and were unable to return to their homes as the Americans had threatened the lives of many Loyalists attempting to return or collect any belongings. The British attempted to negotiate and failed. Eventually, the British needed to do something to accommodate the misplaced soldiers and their families; in 1783, the land was surveyed along the St. Lawrence River surrounding present-day Prescott to be divided amongst the Loyalists as land grants for their loyalty the Crown. Edward Jessup, born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1735, forfeited 500,000 acres of property near Albany, New York by taking up arms for the King during the Revolutionary War. During the war, he founded the Jessup's Loyal Rangers who served the British. It is this group of soldiers who first settled Prescott and the surrounding townships after disbanding at the end of the war around 1783. For his loyalty and service, Jessup was awarded extensive lands from the Crown. In 1810, Jessup surveyed a townsite on top of his land, the current location of Prescott, which he named after Robert Prescott, Governor-in-Chief of Canada from 1797‚Äì1807. The townsite was one square mile in size. Jessup is credited as the town's founder. = Nineteenth century =  Fort Wellington  During the war of 1812, in that year, Prescott witnessed American vessels from Ogdensburg heading for Lake Ontario; volunteers from Prescott quickly set out to investigate, and the vessels surrendered. Later, in the summer of 1812, British and American troops exchanged fire near Brockville. Both of these conflicts made authorities of Prescott believe it was necessary to build a fortification in the town.McKenzie, R. (n.d.). Leeds and Grenville: Their First 200 Years. McClelland and Stewart. In July, residents were employed to build a stockade which would be the main point of defence between Montreal and Kingston during the war. This would become the first Fort Wellington, consisting of a square blockhouse built of wood and earth with barracks, officers' quarters, stables and storerooms being added shortly after. The first fort needed to be built quickly, and as a result, it was ill-constructed and primitive. The second fort, which still stands today, was built in 1838. = War of 1812 = In late August 1812, Prescott received news that General Brock had captured Detroit; however, in September, a surprise raid took place at Gananoque, which was poorly defended. The American raiders seized arms and ammunition, as well as set fire to a storehouse. By the fall of 1812, Prescott and Ogdensburg were maintaining friendly relations; however, in September this changed when the Americans reinforced the town and fired at convoys of Bateaux moving up the river with British supplies. The British failed to retaliate at this time. A few months later, in February 1813, the Americans attacked the area again, this time at Elizabethtown (now Brockville); American troops marched to the courthouse and freed the prisoners while taking prominent citizens of the city prisoner. These attacks by the Americans angered the British troops of Fort Wellington, who decided to take revenge on the Ogdensburg troops for their raids of the area and other provocations. The garrison, led by Lieutenant-Colonel \\"Red George\\" MacDonell, set out across the frozen St. Lawrence River on foot so that the American troops would assume they were performing a drill. Instead, the plan was for the Glengarry Light Infantry to attack the fort and barracks, while the Fort Wellington garrison attacked the flank. Initially, the 500 men stationed at the Ogdensburg fort refused to surrender; however, when British troops entered the fort the Americans evacuated the fort and retreated fourteen miles. According to Mcdonell's account of the following events, the troops then burned the old and new barracks, as well as two schooners, the gunboats, guardhouses, scows, and a few houses. Overall, the attack was a success for the Fort Wellington soldiers. Prescott saw no further action, and the war ended soon after in 1814. Battle of the Windmill = Battle of the Windmill = Fort Wellington became part of its second conflict in 1838, known as the Battle of the Windmill. This battle occurred when a small group of American soldiers called Patriots were convinced that the Canadians across the river in Prescott wanted to be freed from British ‚Äúoppression‚Äù and essentially wanted to restart the rebellion by planning an invasion. Although no war ended up occurring, a battle took place when the Patriots attempted to cross into Prescott. The currents of the St. Lawrence caused problems, trapping their vessels on sandbars before forcing them to land east of Prescott in the new town of Newport, the site of a stone windmill. This gave troops from Fort Wellington plenty of time to prepare for what they assumed was an attack. The Americans eventually surrendered to the British troops, and were sent to Kingston for trial; eleven people, including their leader, were executed as punishment.  Forwarding industry  Due to Prescott's location at the head of the rapids and its excellent harbour, it became a vital transfer point for freight travelling up the river. In 1810, a wharf and warehouse were built and a forwarding business was established by a William Gilkinson; it was the first of many forwarding operations in the town. Prescott exported large amounts of lumber, potash, and other goods. The forwarding trade led to shipbuilding developments also taking place in Prescott, with many ships being launched from its harbour. Prescott forwarders, by 1833, had formed well- established connections with the steamboat lines running from Prescott to Montreal which allowed the forwarders here to prosper over others in the area. Forwarding became obsolete in the area much later, with the establishment of the railroads. The original forwarding warehouse built by Gilkinson is still standing, currently used as a museum dedicated to Prescott's forwarding industry. The building is made of stone but has been covered in white stucco. It was used as an American consulate, a lawyer's office, and later a laundromat before being purchased by the historical society in 1970. =Twentieth century=  Project Jericho  In the late 1980s, Prescott became infamous when one of the largest sexual abuse investigations in Canada was conducted, dubbed Project Jericho. The multiple-victim and multiple- offender case began in August 1989, after a young girl disclosed the details of the abuse to her foster parents. Five years later, close to 300 victims and over 100 perpetrators had been named in the investigations. This case was unique, as never before had a multi-victim, multi-offender case of this magnitude been confined to such a small, defined, geographical region without being enclosed within an institution. According to some sources, Project Jericho remains the largest sex abuse investigation in Canadian history. The investigation was a joint effort between many organizations; Project Jericho consisted of members of the Ontario Provincial Police and local police departments, a Special Crown Attorney and victim/witness assistance coordinator, Family and Children's Services of Leeds-Grenville, the town of Prescott council, the Ontario government's Ministry of Community and Social Services, as well as the Adult Mental Health services. The precise nature of the abuse varied from victim to victim, and is still disputed to this day. According to initial reports, the seven-year-old female who came forward in 1989 stated that on top of the sexual abuse, she and other children were submerged in water, confined beneath the floor, and forced to drink ‚Äúyucky juice‚Äù, which some have speculated to be blood. Additionally, adults are said to have terrorized or threatened her and other children with guns, knives and other weapons. Many of these abuses were documented on videotape. In addition to the abuse, victims alleged an infant boy, known only as \\"Joshua\\", had been murdered by the accused abusers. Little information is known regarding the infant or the murder, and nobody was ever found. Project Jericho was named in honour of the alleged murder victim. By 1990, arrests were being made with charges against four individuals being laid while 37 individuals were confirmed or suspected victims; some children began to be removed from their homes. By 1994, the total number of child victims had skyrocketed to 162, with the number of perpetrators being 119. Of these offenders, 97 were male and 22 were female. The victims were primarily child victims, around 162 being children; while 113 were adults, who came forward to disclose abuse suffered as children. Of the 65 cases that went to trial, the investigation saw a conviction rate of 91%. King Street, Prescott St Lawrence Shakespeare Festival The St Lawrence Shakespeare Festival (SLSF) runs annually in Prescott, Ontario in July and August, attracting thousands of audience members each season. SLSF contracts professional actors through Canadian Actors Equity Association, is a member of PACT (the Professional Association of Canadian Theatres), and a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association. The offerings of the Festival are based on two mainstage shows that run from mid-July to mid-August (often, but not always, both plays by Shakespeare) as well as additional productions that are presented in shorter runs of fewer performances.  Cemeteries  Prescott in home to two cemeteries, Prescott Cemetery (known as Sandy Hill) and St. Mark's Roman Catholic Cemetery. Prescott Cemetery is located along Edward Street across from South Grenville District High School and is one of the oldest burying grounds in the area.Goldie A. Connell (1985) Augusta: Royal Township Number Seven. St. Lawrence Printing Co. ltd. p. 211-213 The land for this cemetery was given to the town in 1830, in Edward Jessup III's will, which stated the area then known as Sand Hill was to become a ‚Äúburial ground for the different churches in the town of Prescott.‚Äù. Prior to becoming the town's cemetery, the area was already used as a burial ground for the Jessup family. The earliest-known burial was that of Susannah Jessup's father who died in 1798. Edward Jessup I, the original recipient of the land here was also buried in the cemetery early, in 1816. Along the south side of the front of the cemetery are many unmarked graves of pioneers who died of cholera. In 1929, the cemetery was expanded and the entrance gates added. In 1967, the stone steps leading up the hill to the Jessup family graves were placed. This cemetery is still in use today. The Roman Catholics of Prescott were originally buried in Prescott cemetery, which had a reserved area specifically for Roman Catholic burials. In the mid-1800s, the population of Roman Catholics felt as though they needed their own cemetery, and land was purchased from a local for $1 by a local reverend to become a new cemetery in 1859 with additional land purchased in 1875. This cemetery is located north of the 401 on the west side of County Road 18 and is known as St. Mark's Cemetery. The older, back section of the cemetery was blessed in 1860, and the newer part in 1935. The earliest legible tombstone in the cemetery dates to before the land was purchased, and belongs to a Thomas Allen who died in 1845. This cemetery is also currently still in use.  Churches  Currently, Prescott in home to six churches, all of which are still in operation. The town contains a Presbyterian, Anglican, Roman Catholic, United, Pentecostal and an Evangelist church. The Pentecostal church, called Seaway Christian Church is located on Churchill road and the Evangelist church, called Harvest Church, is located on Edward street; services are currently held in these churches regularly. St. Andrew's Presbyterian church is located on the corner of Centre and Dibble street in Prescott. The first St. Andrew's Presbyterian, located on the same site as the current church, was constructed in 1821 and dedicated in 1822. The first church was a frame structure built on land donated by Susannah Jessup. This church was replaced in 1850 by a stone church which burned in 1892. The present building replaced it in 1893. Prior to this church, the Presbyterian congregation met in the schoolhouse at the corner of West and King street. St. Andrew's is still in use today. View of the original St. Paul's Church Prescott in 1890 St. John's Anglican church in Prescott is located at the corner of James and Centre street. The first church to be erected on this site as St. John's was a frame building, erected in 1821 on land donated by Susannah Jessup. The present, gothic-style church was erected in 1860 to replace the frame building. This building is still in use as a church, with parts of it currently being renovated into apartments. The Roman Catholic church, known as St. Mark's Roman Catholic Church was built in the 1830s on land purchased from the Jessup family. Prior to its construction, a Roman Catholic priest served the area out of homes or community buildings. The present church stands on the same location as the original St. Mark's on Dibble street. Currently, St. Paul's United Church is located on George street; however, the former site of the St. Paul's United Church was on Dibble street, near St. Mark's church. Between the years 1854 and 1856, the Wesleyan Methodist congregation in Prescott planned, financed and erected their own church. This church became known as St. Paul's United church. On July 28, 1979, the church was burned beyond repair, and demolished.McGaughey, E. (1980). A Firm Foundation: A History of St. Paul's United Church. Kingston: Brown and Martin. Sometime after the fire, a new St. Paul's United Church was built to serve the congregation; this school is still used today.

Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. The PA-28 family of aircraft comprises all-metal, unpressurized, single-engined, piston-powered airplanes with low- mounted wings and tricycle landing gear. They have a single door on the right side, which is entered by stepping on the wing. The first PA-28 received its type certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration in 1960 and the series remains in production to this day. Current models are the Warrior, Arrow, and Archer TX and LX, and the Pilot 100 and i100. The Archer was discontinued in 2009, but with investment from new company ownership, the model was put back into production in 2010. The PA-28 series competes with the high-winged Cessna 172 and the similarly low-winged Grumman American AA-5 series and Beechcraft Musketeer designs. Piper has created variations within the Cherokee family by installing engines ranging from 140 to 300 hp (105‚Äì220 kW), offering turbocharging, retractable landing gear, constant-speed propellers and stretching the fuselage to accommodate six people. The Piper PA-32 (initially known as \\"Cherokee Six\\") is a larger, six-seat variant of the PA-28. The PA-32R Saratoga variant was in production until 2009. Development PA-28-151, built in 1976 At the time of the Cherokee's introduction, Piper's primary single-engined, all-metal aircraft was the Piper PA-24 Comanche, a larger, faster aircraft with retractable landing gear and a constant-speed propeller. Karl Bergey, Fred Weick and John Thorp designed the Cherokee as a less expensive alternative to the Comanche, with lower manufacturing and parts costs to compete with the Cessna 172, although some later Cherokees also featured retractable gear and constant-speed propellers. The Cherokee and Comanche lines continued in parallel production, serving different market segments for over a decade, until Comanche production was ended in 1972, to be replaced by the Piper PA-32R family. =The original design= The PA-28-161 Warrior II flying in the livery of the Singapore Youth Flying Club ‚Äì it is still widely used in basic flight training worldwide.

The original Cherokees were the Cherokee 150 and Cherokee 160 (PA-28-150 and PA-28-160), which started production in 1961 (unless otherwise mentioned, the model number always refers to horsepower). In 1962, Piper added the Cherokee 180 (PA-28-180) powered by a 180-horsepower (134-kW) Lycoming O-360 engine. The extra power made it practical to fly with all four seats filled (depending on passenger weight and fuel loading) and the model remains popular on the used-airplane market. In 1968, the cockpit was modified to replace the \\"push-pull\\"-style engine throttle controls with quadrant levers. In addition, a third window was added to each side, giving the fuselage the more modern look seen in current production. Piper continued to expand the line rapidly. In 1963, the company introduced the even more powerful Cherokee 235 (PA-28-235), which competed favorably with the Cessna 182 Skylane for load-carrying capability. The Cherokee 235 featured a Lycoming O-540 engine de-rated to and a longer wing which would eventually be used for the Cherokee Six. It included tip tanks of 17-gallon capacity each, bringing the total fuel capacity of the Cherokee 235 to 84 gallons. The aircraft had its fuselage stretched in 1973, giving much more leg room in the rear. The stabilator area was increased, as well. In 1973, the marketing name was changed from \\"235\\" to \\"Charger\\". In 1974, it was changed again to \\"Pathfinder\\". Production of the Pathfinder continued until 1977. No 1978 models were built. In 1979, the aircraft was given the Piper tapered wing and the name was changed again, this time to Dakota. In 1964, the company filled in the bottom end of the line with the Cherokee 140 (PA-28-140), which was designed for training and initially shipped with only two seats. The PA-28-140 engine was slightly modified shortly after its introduction to produce 150 horsepower (112 kW), but kept the -140 name. In 1967, Piper introduced the PA-28R-180 Cherokee Arrow. This aircraft featured a constant-speed propeller and retractable landing gear and was powered by a 180-horsepower (134-kW) Lycoming IO-360-B1E engine. A 200-hp (149-kW) version powered by a Lycoming IO-360-C1C was offered as an option beginning in 1969 and designated the PA-28R-200; the 180-hp model was dropped after 1971.Twombly, Mark: \\"Piper Arrow,\\" AOPA Pilot, June 1986. At the time the Arrow was introduced, Piper removed the Cherokee 150 and Cherokee 160 from production. The Arrow II came out in 1972, featuring a five-inch fuselage stretch to increase legroom for the rear-seat passengers. In 1977, Piper introduced the Arrow III (PA-28R-201), which featured a semi-tapered wing and longer stabilator, a design feature that had previously been introduced successfully on the PA-28-181 and provided better low-speed handling. It also featured larger fuel tanks, increasing capacity from 50 to 77 gallons. The first turbocharged model, the PA-28R-201T, was also offered in 1977, powered by a six-cylinder Continental TSIO-360-F engine equipped with a Rajay turbocharger. A three-bladed propeller was optional. In 1979, the Arrow was restyled again as the PA-28RT-201 Arrow IV, featuring a \\"T\\" tail that resembled the other aircraft in the Piper line at the time. In 1971, Piper released a Cherokee 140 variant called the Cherokee Cruiser 2+2. Although the plane kept the 140 designation, it was, in fact, a 150-hp plane and was shipped mainly as a four-seat version. In 1973, the Cherokee 180 was named the Cherokee Challenger and had its fuselage lengthened slightly and its wings widened and the Cherokee 235 was named the Charger with similar airframe modifications. In 1974, Piper changed the marketing names of some of the Cherokee models again, renaming the Cruiser 2+2 (140) simply the Cruiser, the Challenger to the Archer (model PA-28-181) and the Charger (235) to Pathfinder. Piper reintroduced the Cherokee 150 in 1974, renaming it the Cherokee Warrior (PA-28-151) and giving it the Archer's stretched body and a new, semi-tapered wing. In 1977, Piper stopped producing the Cruiser (140) and Pathfinder (235), but introduced a new 235-hp (175-kW) plane, the Dakota (PA-28-236), based on the Cherokee 235, Charger and Pathfinder models, but with the new semi-tapered wing. The PA-28-201T Turbo Dakota followed the introduction of the PA-28-236 Dakota in 1979. The airframe was essentially the same as a fixed-gear Arrow III and was powered by a turbocharged Continental TSIO-360-FB engine producing 200 hp (149 kW). The aircraft did not sell well and production ended in 1980.Taylor, John W.R.: Jane's Pocket Book Light Aircraft Revised Edition, page 171. Jane's Publishing Company Ltd, 1982. In 1977, Piper upgraded the Warrior to 160 hp (119 kW) PA-28-161, changing its name to Cherokee Warrior II. This aircraft had slightly improved aerodynamic wheel fairings introduced in 1978. Later models of the Warrior II, manufactured after July 1982, incorporated a gross weight increase to 2,440 pounds, giving a useful load over 900 pounds. This same aircraft, now available with a glass cockpit, was available as the Warrior III and was marketed as a training aircraft. =PA-32= In 1965, Piper developed the Piper Cherokee Six, designated the PA-32, by stretching the PA-28 design. It featured a lengthened fuselage and seating for one pilot and five passengers. =Brazilian, Argentinian and Chilean production= PA-28s were built under license in Brazil as the Embraer EMB-711A and EMB-711C Corisco (PA-28R-200), EMB-711B (PA-28R-201), EMB-711T (PA-28RT-201) and EMB-711ST Corisco Turbo (PA-28RT-201T) and the EMB-712 Tupi (PA-28-181). Argentinian production was carried out by Chincul SACAIFI of San Juan, Argentina. Chincul S. A. built 960 airplanes between 1972 and 1995, including the Cherokee Archer, Dakota, Arrow and Turbo Arrow.Pereira de Andrade, Roberto.: Enciclop√©dia de Avi√µes Brasileiros, Editora Globo, 1997. The PA-28-236 Dakota was also assembled under license by the Maintenance Wing of the Chilean Air Force (which later became known as ENAER). By September 1982, 20 Dakotas had been assembled in Chile.Taylor, John W.R. Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1982‚Äì83. London: Jane's Yearbooks, 1982. . pp. 31, 438. =New Piper Aircraft= Piper Archer DX The original Piper Aircraft company declared bankruptcy in 1991. In 1995, the New Piper Aircraft company was created. It was renamed Piper Aircraft once again in 2006. The company originally produced one variant, the 180-horsepower (134 kW) Archer LX (PA-28-181), and began testing two diesel versions, with 135 and 155 hp.\\"Aero-News\\" Video As of 2017, four variants of the PA-28 are in production: * Arrow with retractable landing gear, a fuel injected Lycoming IO-360-C1C6 engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G500 avionics suite * Archer with a Lycoming O-360-A4M engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G1000 avionics suite * Archer DX with a Continental CD-155 engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G1000 avionics suite * Warrior with a Lycoming O-320-D3G engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G500 avionics suite Design =Wing= Originally, all Cherokees had a constant-chord, rectangular planform wing, popularly called the \\"Hershey Bar\\" wing because of its resemblance to the convex, rectangular chocolate bar. Beginning with the Warrior in 1974, Piper switched to a semi- tapered wing with the NACA 652-415 profile and a wingspan. The constant chord is maintained from the root to mid-wing, at which point a tapered section sweeping backwards on the leading edge continues until the tip. Both Cherokee wing variants have an angled wing root; i.e., the wing chord is greater at the root, with the leading edge swept back as it leaves the fuselage body, rather than the wing meeting the body at a perpendicular angle. Debate is ongoing about the relative benefits of the two wing shapes. According to the Cherokee's lead designer, Fred Weick, the semi-tapered wing was introduced to \\"improve stall characteristics and increase wingspan,\\" and side-by-side testing of the two shapes found that with the semitapered wing, \\"the plane had better climb and flatter flight characteristics\\" Fred Weick, quoted by Terry Lee Rogers in The Cherokee Tribe, The Cherokee Pilot's Association (1991), p.11. The original 1974 version of the wing had a structural weakness that caused a structural failure during an aerobatic maneuver, but that was fixed for all later wings.The Cherokee Tribe, p.45. According to Terry Lee Rogers (summarizing interviews with Weick), \\"the outboard wing sections had a different taper than the wing root, which permitted them to retain control even when the inboard sections were stalled.\\" However, designer John Thorp, who collaborated with Weick in the late 1950s on an early 180 hp version of the PA-28 (with Hershey-bar wings) and was not involved in the later semi- tapered design, publicly disagreed: \\"Tapered wings tend to stall outboard, reducing aileron effectiveness and increasing the likelihood of a rolloff into a spin.\\" Aviation journalist Peter Garrison is also in the Hershey-bar wing camp, claiming that the semitapered shape has a neutral effect on drag: \\"to prevent tip stall, designers have resorted to providing the outboard portions of tapered wings with more cambered airfoil sections, drooped or enlarged leading edges, fixed or automatic leading edge slots or slats and most commonly, wing twist or \\"washout\\". The trouble with these fixes is that they all increase the drag, cancelling whatever benefit the tapered wing was supposed to deliver in the first place.\\" =Flight controls= For the Cherokee family, Piper used their traditional flight-control configuration. The horizontal tail is a stabilator with an antiservo tab (sometimes termed an antibalance tab). The antiservo tab moves in the same direction of the stabilator movement, making pitch control \\"heavier\\" as the stabilator moves out of the trimmed position. Flaps can extend up to 40¬∞ and 25¬∞ flaps are normally used for a short- or soft-field takeoff. The ailerons, flaps, stabilator and stabilator trim are all controlled using cables and pulleys.Piper Aircraft: Cherokee 140 PA-28-140 Owner's Handbook. Piper Aircraft Corporation publication 753 584, February 1964, Revised May 27, 1977 In the cockpit, all Cherokees use control yokes rather than sticks, together with rudder pedals. The pilot operates the flaps manually using a Johnson bar located between the front seats: for zero degrees, the lever is flat against the floor and is pulled up to select the detent positions of 10, 25, and 40¬∞. The cockpit of a Piper PA-28-151 Cherokee Warrior (2016) Older Cherokees use an overhead crank for stabilator trim (correctly called an antiservo tab), while later ones use a trim wheel on the floor between the front seats, immediately behind the flap bar. All Cherokees have a brake lever under the pilot side of the instrument panel. Differential toe brakes on the rudder pedals were an optional add-on for earlier Cherokees and became standard with later models. Some earlier Cherokees used control knobs for the throttle, mixture, and propeller advance (where applicable), while later Cherokees use a collection of two or three control levers in a throttle quadrant. Cherokees normally include a rudder trim knob, which actually controls a set of springs acting on the rudder pedals rather than an external trim tab on the rudder‚Äîin other words, the surface is trimmed by control tension rather than aerodynamically.

Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the demoscene. Groups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a pseudonym (called a \\"handle\\" or \\"nick\\"), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like \\"Scener of Demo Group\\" or \\"Scener/DG\\"). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games. Many demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via Bulletin Board Systems or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is IRC. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at demoparties and smaller meetings. Demogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate wordmarks, logos, catchphrases, and slogans for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for \\"managing the group's human resources\\", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying \\"trial periods\\" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often tongue-in-cheek), to maintain an \\"elite\\" image for the group. A group is perhaps the most important social unit in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several \\"one-man groups\\" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro. Demography , the countries with the most active demogroups and demoparties are the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark), Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary and France. Due to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon. Demoscener functions Demosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder- musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend. =Coder= The coder is the demogroup's programmer who creates the demo's software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and APIs for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as fractals or metaballs. In the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo's flow and arrangement, including the effect's synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as demotools are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design. In many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with \\"coder music\\" which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. \\"Coder graphics\\" and \\"coder palettes\\" are similar terms for graphics and color schemes. =Graphic artist= Graphic artists (or graphicians in scene lingo) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation. Originally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as (3D) modelers. =Musicians= Musicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering (and in some cases, performing) the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo. In the older days, musicians worked with trackers, and the world of tracked music was heavily dominated by demoscene musicians. In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional music sequencers. However, tracked music and other specialized formats still continue to be used in size- restricted intros as well as demos written for more restrictive platforms such as mobile devices and vintage computers. Fake groups Demosceners often form fake groups, which are essentially secret identities for making humorous or vulgar productions without scathing their original reputation - people in a fake group hide behind a pseudonym (which, considering their demoscene handles, usually becomes a pseudo-pseudonym). This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse na√Øve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof. \\"One-man\\" groups Though they are not strictly \\"demogroups\\" by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working. One-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because they're not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later. Perhaps the most successful one- man army of the demoscene is Dmitry \\"AND\\" Andreev, two-time winner of the Assembly demo party in the 64k intro category.

The show was created and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, with character designs by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, while the series' mechanical designs is split among Kunio Okawara, Mamoru Nagano, and Kazumi Fujita. The series was originally aired on Nagoya Broadcasting Network and its sister ANN stations between 1985 and 1986. The plot is set in the futuristic \\"Universal Century\\" timeline, and takes place eight years after the events of the original series. Zeta centers on a new conflict that is formed between two new factions - the Titans, a corrupt task force formed by the Earth Federation, and the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG), a rebel group who seek to end the Titans. The show is told through the perspective of Kamille Bidan, a teenage member of the AEUG and pilot of the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II, and later the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam. Several main characters from the previous Gundam series return in supporting roles, including Amuro Ray and his rival Char Aznable, the latter of which returns as a pilot for the AEUG under the new identity of Quattro Bajeena. Often regarded as one of the best shows in the franchise, the series is praised for its dark themes, characters, and its improvements over its predecessor. Between 2005 and 2006, the series was reproduced and compiled into a movie trilogy, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation. Though still directed by Tomino, it involved many changes in the original storyline. The films were considered to be a success in Japan.  Plot  Set in the year Universal Century (UC) 0087, eight years after the events of Mobile Suit Gundam (0079), and four years after the events of \\"Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory\\" (0083 to 0084) the series follows a rebel group called the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) as they try to defeat the Titans, an elite task force of the Earth Federation designed to hunt down Zeon remnants but which ruthlessly kills anyone demanding equal rights for the space citizens in cold blood. The story of Zeta Gundam is told through the viewpoint of Kamille Bidan, a civilian teenager and amateur mobile suit pilot whose parents are engineers working for the Earth Federation and the Titans. While traveling to the Green Noa colony to meet his parents, Kamille is insulted by and strikes a Titans officer named Jerid Messa. Following an AEUG attack led by Quattro Bajeena on the colony to capture a trio of Gundam Mk-II mobile suits undergoing field tests, Kamille takes the opportunity to steal Messa's Mk-II to repel the attack and follows Quattro back to the AEUG mothership Argama. The Titans, under the order of Bask Om, take Kamille's parents in an attempt to force the return of the stolen Gundam Mk-II's. Jerid, unaware of the hostage plot, mistakenly kills Kamille's mother. Because of this, and many other reasons, Kamille eventually joins the AEUG. As the war escalates, Kamille encounters people from all sides of the conflict, including brainwashed Titans, artificial Newtypes and the leaders of Anaheim Electronics, who are secretly funding the AEUG. The AEUG eventually launch a full-scale attack on the Earth Federation's assembly at Dakar, leading to an Earth Sphere civil war. Quattro reveals himself to be Char Aznable and presents evidence of the Titans' tyranny including using G3 nerve gas on a defenseless colony. The Earth Federation court soon rules the Titans' actions to be illegal and backs the AEUG in hunting down Titans leader Jamitov Hymem. After losing the support of the Earth Federation, the Titans turn to their original enemy, remnants of the Principality of Zeon now known as Axis Zeon, to form an alliance to regain control of the Earth Sphere. Axis Zeon's leader Haman Karn contacts the AEUG, using the civil war of the Earth Federation at hand to politically ask for the control of Side 3, the former Zeon colony. Axis involvement and Jamitov's assassination by Jupiter Fleet commander Paptimus Scirocco soon leads to a battle over the colony headquarters of the Titans, Gryps, which has been modified to be a colony laser. The war ends when Kamille, piloting the titular mobile suit Z Gundam, kills Scirocco in battle and the AEUG sinks Scirocco's flagship and most of the Titans' fleet. However, Kamille himself is psychologically broken and although survives without any physical harm to him or the Zeta Gundam, becomes mentally unstable with signs of memory lapse and/or insanity. The series concludes with both the AEUG and Earth Federation, after suffering considerable losses over the course of the war, facing the full force of Axis Zeon, leading into Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. Production Yoshiyuki Tomino crammed his frustrations into Zeta Gundam. He created the anime with the idea of telling viewers \\"Hey, watch my new Gundam, youngsters. Why are you not so lively like them in Z?\\" Tomino has mixed feelings about Zeta Gundam. Tomino did not like the series and believes he should have ended the story in the first TV series. However, at the same time he noted that thanks to Zeta the franchise became more popular. =Soundtrack= A majority of the series background music was written by Japanese composer Shigeaki Saegusa. The melodies of the two opening themes and sole ending theme were written by American pop singer/songwriter Neil Sedaka. The first opening song used is called which was performed by Mami Ayukawa, and used for the first twenty- three episodes. Zeta - Toki wo Koete was based upon the song \\"Better Days are Coming\\" from Sedaka's 1972 album Solitaire. The second opening song used is entitled and was performed by Hiroko Moriguchi, this second opening song is used in episodes twenty-four to fifty. The song \\"Mizu no Hoshi e Ai wo Komete\\" was derived from an unreleased song entitled \\"For Us to Decide\\". The sole ending song used for the series is called which was sung by Mami Ayukawa. \\"Hoshizora no Believe\\" was adapted from the song \\"Bad and Beautiful\\" from the 1976 album Steppin' Out. In addition to the opening/ending songs an insert song was also made called . This song is sung by Hiroko Moriguchi and is used in episode twenty. The opening and ending songs differed for the International release version, as well as Japanese streaming versions, as opposed to the original. The opening song used is called which was composed by Saegusa, while the song used for the endings entitled was also written by Saegusa. The songs used for the three movies that came out of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam were all performed by Gackt, and were compiled and released on his tribute album 0079-0088. The first movie Heirs To The Stars uses two songs; Metamorphoze is used as the opening song while is used for the ending. The second movie Lovers uses just one new song called Mind Forest for the ending song. Mind Forest is also featured on Gackt's album called \\"Crescent\\". The final movie made Love is the Pulse of the Stars uses two new songs. Love Letter is used as an insert song followed by the song Dybbuk which is used as the ending song.  International release  The show has been placed on rerun on the anime satellite television network, Animax, across Japan and later its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions. In 2004, after almost 2 years of delays and failed television and merchandising deals, Bandai released a limited edition Zeta Gundam boxset with dubbed English and original Japanese audio tracks. The box-set includes pencil sharpener collectibles and a 48-page booklet and poster. The English dub was done by Ocean Production's Blue Water Studio based in Calgary in Canada. Due to Bandai not having rights to the theme songs outside of Asia, the opening and closing sequences were altered. The English subtitles were criticized as inaccurate and appeared to be based on the script for the English dub, rather than a direct translation of the original Japanese script. Bandai corrected the subtitles to a properly translated version for later DVD releases in 5 cases with 2 discs each. Each disc contained five episodes. In 2006, Bandai Entertainment acquired the rights to the US release of the \\"A New Translation\\" movie trilogy, originally slated for release on June 22, 2010 but was later changed to July 6. The series and movies have been out of print, following the closure of Bandai Entertainment. On October 11, 2014 at their 2014 New York Comic-Con panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including the Zeta Gundam TV series and movies in North America though distribution from Right Stuf Inc., beginning in Spring 2015.  Reception  =Critical reception= Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is praised by fans of the Universal Century sect of the franchise, with many lauding it for its bleak tone, character development, and its complicated expression of war. However, the series has also been criticized for being overtly depressing, and frequently exhibiting a directionless plot. Even the series' director, Yoshiyuki Tomino, has expressed not liking the show, finding in retrospect much of the hostility and abuse inflicted upon characters to undermine any realistic depiction of war. The review website Mania.com gave the anime an overall 'B+' rating, regarding it as \\"one of Yoshiyuki Tomino's greatest works.\\" They stated that the \\"lack of an A/A+ is that this is recommended for fans who are already familiar with the Universal Century storyline,\\" recommending that audiences view \\"the original movie trilogy\\" first before watching Zeta Gundam. The reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com gave certain volumes of the series a full 'A' rating, describing the last ten episodes as being \\"the huge payoff episodes\\" where \\"you can almost feel the characters being rushed around a bit and moved through the paces. But at the same time, it all comes so fast that it's simply enjoyable to watch so much happen and change so quickly.\\" Beveridge would later review the Blu-Ray releases of the series for The Fandom Post, giving both sets of Blu-Rays a 'A-' rating. Beveridge writes in the review for the first set, \\"It‚Äôs hard to believe that it‚Äôs been almost ten years since I last saw this series as you realize just how much anime you consume. But it also makes you realize which ones truly stand out over the course of time and this one is definitely one of them.\\" Beveridge found the second half of the series weaker, though still claims that the show \\"hits most things right\\". While reviewing for the Blu-ray release of the series, Ollie Barder of Forbes gave the show a rave review, even titling it as \\"Possibly The Greatest 'Gundam' Series Ever Made\\". Barder praised the series' more realistic approach to war and its striking designs for the many different robots, though did find the transforming mechas out of placed in Zeta's more grounded reality. Lauren Orsini of Anime News Network also praised the series in a review for the first Blu-ray release, giving the dub for the first set a 'B', praising it for its powerful storytelling. Orsini was more critical of the second half of the series, finding the plot too chaotic and calling it Gundam's \\"awkward coming-of-age\\". But Orsini still praised the second half for its mecha designs and strong emotional payoffs, ultimately giving the subtitle version of the series a 'B'. In the NHK's 2018 mega \\"All Gundam Poll\\", Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam was place as the second best anime in the Gundam franchise, only behind the original 1979 Gundam show. The NHK reported that there was a total of 1,740,280 votes in the poll, with 46% of the votes for Zeta coming from voters between the ages 40 to 46.  Related media  = Manga = A manga adaptation of the series was released by Kodansha under the Comic Bon Bon label in 1994, three volumes were serialized. An official manga remake was also made entitled . This remake was written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Kitazume and serialized in Gundam Ace on June 25, 2011. = Compilation movies = In celebration of Gundam's 25th anniversary (and also the 20th anniversary of Zeta Gundam), the 50-episode series was compiled into a movie trilogy called Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation. According to Tomino, the movies were created to fix some of the problems he identified in the television series and to bring it into a 21st- century context for a new generation now experiencing the increasingly commercialized series, such as Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. The first movie, Heirs to the Stars, opened on May 28, 2005, followed by Lovers on October 29, 2005, and Love is the Pulse of the Stars on March 6, 2006. The compilations digitally remastered the television series of Zeta Gundam with new footage. Around 33% of \\"Heir to the Stars\\" was remastered footage, with 70% for \\"Lovers\\" and almost 80% for \\"Love is the Pulse of the Stars\\". However, several major plot events from the TV series were either edited or removed to allow the films to flow more smoothly, unlike Tomino's previous Gundam film compilations. Likewise, the fate of some characters in the television version were entirely changed, notably Kamille's ‚Äî in the original, his final battle renders him into a vegetative state, while he remains physically and mentally fit by the end of the movie trilogy. In addition, mobile suits belonging to the Gundam timeline, but designed after the television broadcast of Zeta Gundam, were also placed into the movies. Shigeaki Saegusa's musical score from the TV series was reused for the films, with the addition of new songs by Japanese singer-songwriter Gackt. A music video for the first film's opening theme \\"Metamorphoze\\" featured Gackt singing inside a mobile suit cockpit during battle. Majority of the original TV voice cast returned to reprise their respective roles. Y≈ç Inoue, who died in 2003 - was posthumously credited, as an archived recording of her voice was used for a cameo appearance of Sayla Mass in the third film. There were some changes to the voice cast - namely Yukana replacing Saeko Shimazu as Four Murasame, Satomi Arai replacing Miyuki Matsuoka as Fa Yuiry, and a few others. This change sparked controversy among fans, who suspected that Yukana used her relationship with sound director Sadayoshi Fujino to land her role. The films were a box office success in Japan. =Games= In 1985, Bandai released a special boardgame based on the series. Designed for two to four players, Mobile Suit Gundam: Take Off MKII has a paper map and 12 miniatures of various AEUG and Titans mobile suits, plus game rules and mission files. Kid≈ç Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble followed in 1986. the first Gundam video game for home consoles, Hot Scramble featured first-person and side-scrolling stages. this would be followed by a 3D-fighting game, Mobile Suit Z Gundam, for the Sony PlayStation in 1997. Featuring remastered cutscenes from the series, it comes on two discs, allowing players to experience the series from the viewpoints of Kamille and Char. Bandai later added the series' mobile suits as part of Gundam Vs. Zeta Gundam in 2004. In addition, Tecmo Koei and Namco Bandai have co-published the Dynasty Warriors: Gundam franchise since 2007.

They combined a piston engine with a turbine to recover energy from the exhaust and thereby improve fuel economy. Two versions were tested, the complex Nomad I which used two propellers, each driven by the mechanically independent stages, and the Nomad II, using the turbo-compound principle, coupled the two parts to drive a single propeller. The Nomad II had the lowest specific fuel consumption figures seen up to that time. Despite this the Nomad project was cancelled in 1955 having spent ¬£5.1 million on development, as most interest had passed to turboprop designs.  Design and development  At the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Napier Nomad 1 In 1945 the Air Ministry asked for proposals for a new class engine with good fuel economy. Curtiss-Wright was designing an engine of this sort of power known as the turbo-compound engine, but Sir Harry Ricardo, one of Britain's great engine designers, suggested that the most economical combination would be a similar design using a diesel two-stroke in place of the Curtiss's petrol engine. Before World War II Napier had licensed the Junkers Jumo 204 diesel design to set up production in the UK as the Napier Culverin, but the onset of the war made the Sabre all-important and work on the Culverin was stopped. In response to the Air Ministry's 1945 requirements Napier dusted off this work, combining two enlarged Culverins into an H-block similar to the Sabre, resulting in a massive 75 litre design. Markets for an engine of this size seemed limited, however, so instead they reverted to the original Sabre-like horizontally opposed 12 cylinder design, and the result was the Nomad. The objective of the design was to produce a civilian power plant with far superior fuel efficiency to the emerging jet engine. Thermal efficiency is given by 1 - T_e/T_p, where T is the exhaust temperature in kelvins and T is the peak combustion temperature. Jet engines have relatively low-temperature combustion systems which produce a T of no more than about 1,000 K, much less than the typical 5,000 K of a reciprocating engine, and so jets have very poor thermal efficiency. The Nomad design focused on replacing the low-temperature combustion chambers of the jet engine with highly efficient Diesel combustion chambers. In practice, it was much too difficult to couple the diesel power output back into the turbine cycle. The maximum practical power of the Nomad was , and it was much heavier than a pure jet of the same power. By this time civilian jets such as the Boeing 707 were nearing completion, and the Nomad was never seriously considered by any aircraft manufacturer. =Nomad I= Schematic drawing of Napier Nomad I and II. The initial Nomad design (E.125) or Nomad 1 was incredibly complex, almost two engines in one. One was a turbo- supercharged two-stroke diesel, having some resemblance to half of a Napier Sabre's H-24. Mounted below this were the rotating parts of a turboprop engine, based on the Naiad design, the output of which drove the front propeller of a contra-rotating pair. To achieve higher boost, the crankshaft drove a centrifugal supercharger, which also provided the scavenging needed for starting the engine from rest. During take-off additional fuel was injected into the rear turbine stage for more power, and turned off once the aircraft was cruising. The compressor and turbine assemblies of the Nomad were tested during 1948, and the complete unit was run in October 1949. The prototype was installed in the nose of an Avro Lincoln heavy bomber for testing: it first flew in 1950 and appeared at the Farnborough Air Display on 10 September 1951. In total the Nomad I ran for just over 1,000 hours, and proved to be rather temperamental, but when running properly it could produce and thrust. It had a specific fuel consumption (sfc) of . The prototype Nomad I is on display at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune Airfield in Scotland. =Nomad II= Front three-quarter view of a Nomad II Topside view Even before the Nomad I was running, its successor, the Nomad II (E.145) Nomad 6, had already been designed. In this version an extra stage was added to the axial compressor/supercharger, eliminating the separate centrifugal part and the intercooler. The turbine (which also received an additional stage) was now only used to drive the compressor, and feed back any excess power to the main shaft using a Beier variable-ratio gear; the separate propeller from the turbine was deleted, just as the whole of the \\"afterburner\\" system with its valves etc. So the system was now like a combination of a mechanical supercharger, and a turbocharger without any need for bypass. The result was smaller and considerably simpler: a single engine driving a single propeller. Overall about was taken off the weight. The wet liners of the cylinders of the Nomad I were changed for dry liners. While the Nomad II was undergoing testing, a prototype Avro Shackleton was lent to Napier as a testbed. The engine proved bulky, like the Nomad I before it, and in the meantime several dummy engines were used on the Shackleton for various tests. A further development, the Nomad Nm.7, of was announced in 1953.Flight Nov 1953 p 610 By 1954 interest in the Nomad was waning, and after the only project, the Avro Type 719 Shackleton IV, based on it was cancelled, work on the engine was ended in April 1955, after an expenditure of ¬£5.1 million.

Anderson\\", a Swedish akvavit Akvavit or aquavit (; also akevitt in Norwegian) is a distilled spirit that is principally produced in Scandinavia, where it has been produced since the 15th century.Lichine, Alexis. Alexis Lichine‚Äôs New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1987), pp. 80‚Äì81. Akvavit is distilled from grain and potatoes, and is flavoured with a variety of herbs. Akvavit is also popular in Germany. Akvavit gets its distinctive flavour from spices and herbs, and the dominant flavour must (according to the European Union) come from a distillate of caraway and/or dill seed. It typically contains 40% alcohol by volume or 80 proof (U.S.) The EU has established a minimum of 37.5% ABV for akvavit to be named as such.EU spirits regulation (PDF) Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89, Appendix II No. 24, Retrieved 2014-02-09. Etymology The word aquavit derives from the Latin aqua vitae, \\"water of life.\\" Compare the word whiskey, from Gaelic uisce beatha, which has the same meaning. Likewise, clear fruit brandy is called \\"eau de vie\\" (French for \\"water of life\\"). A story holding that the term really means \\"water from the vine\\" ‚Äì from a conflation of the Latin vƒ´tae (genitive of vita) and the Italian term vite (meaning grapevine) ‚Äì is no more than a picturesque piece of folk etymology. Drinking culture Akvavit is an important part of Nordic drinking culture, where it is often drunk during festive gatherings, such as Christmas dinners and weddings, and as an aperitif. In Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany aquavit is chilled and often sipped slowly from a small shot glass. This is usually attributed to tradition. It is not generally chilled in Norway, but similarly enjoyed slowly. In Sweden commonly the aquavit is consumed immediately following a song, called a snapsvisa. The most well-known song is Helan G√•r. In Finland and Sweden, aquavit consumed from a shot glass is commonly associated with crayfish parties, which are traditionally held during late August. In Denmark aquavit is called snaps or akvavit, and is primarily consumed in December during Christmas lunches or around Easter during Easter lunches. It is consumed year round though, mainly for lunches of traditional Danish dishes where beer is also always on the table. Drinking it without food or at a bar will be considered a little strange. In Norway, where most aquavit is matured in oak casks, the drink is served at room temperature in tulip-shaped glasses or shot glasses. Aquavit arguably complements dark beer well, and its consumption is very often preceded by a swig of beer. Production Akvavit is distilled from either grain or potatoes. After distillation, it is flavoured with herbs, spices, or fruit oil. Commonly seen flavours are caraway, cardamom, cumin, anise, fennel, and lemon or orange peel. Dill and grains of paradise are also used. The Danish distillery Aalborg makes an akvavit distilled with amber. The recipes and flavours differ between brands, but caraway is typically the dominant flavour. Akvavit usually has a yellowish hue, but this can vary from clear to light brown, depending on how long it has been aged in oak casks (Norway) or the amount of colorant used. Normally, a darker colour suggests a higher age or the use of young casks, though artificial caramel colouring is permitted. Clear akvavit is called taffel, meaning table aquavit. Taffel aquavit is typically aged in old casks that do not colour the finished spirit or it is not aged at all. Origin and traditional variants The earliest known reference to \\"aquavit\\" is found in a 1531 letter from the Danish Lord of Bergenshus castle, Eske Bille to Olav Engelbrektsson, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Norway. The letter, dated April 13, accompanying a package, offers the archbishop \\"some water which is called Aqua Vite and is a help for all sort of illness which a man can have both internally and externally\\".A transcription of the original letter can be found here: Diplomatarium Norvegicum ‚Äì XI p. 630, Date: 13 April 1531. Place: Bergenhus. \\"[...] Kiere herre werdis ether nade wiide att ieg szende ether nade nogit watn mett Jonn Teiste som kallis Aqua vite och hielper szamme watn for alle hande kranchdom som ith menniske kandt haffue indwortis. [...]\\" (\\"[...] Dear lord, will your grace know that I send your grace some water with Jon Teiste which is called Aqua vite and helps the same water for all his illness that a man can have internally and externally. [...]\\") While this claim for the medicinal properties of the drink may be rather inflated, aquavit is popularly believed to ease the digestion of rich foods. In Denmark, it is traditionally associated with Christmas and Easter lunches. In Norway, it is drunk at celebrations, particularly Christmas, Easter or May 17 (Norwegian Constitution Day). In Sweden, it is a staple of the traditional midsummer celebrations dinner, usually drunk while singing one of many drinking songs. It is usually drunk as snaps during meals, especially during the appetizer course ‚Äì along with pickled herring, crayfish, lutefisk or smoked fish. In this regard, it is popularly quipped that aquavit helps the fish swim down to the stomach. L√∏iten Linje Aquavit It is also a regular on the traditional Norwegian Christmas meals, including roasted rib of pork and rib of lamb (pinnekj√∏tt). The spices and the alcohol are said to help digest the meal, which is very rich in fat. Among the most important brands are L√∏iten, Lysholm and Gilde from Norway, Aalborg from Denmark and O.P. Anderson from Sweden. While the Danish and Swedish variants are normally very light in colour, most of the Norwegian brands are matured in oak casks for at least one year, and for some brands even as long as 12 years, making them generally darker in colour. While members of all three nations can be found to claim that \\"their\\" style of aquavit is the best as a matter of national pride, Norwegian akevitt tend to have, if not the most distinctive character, then at least the most overpowering flavour and deepest colour due to the aging process. Peculiar to the Norwegian tradition are Linje Aquavits (such as \\"L√∏iten Linje\\" and \\"Lysholm Linje\\"). Linje Aquavit is named after the tradition of sending oak barrels of aquavit with ships from Norway to Australia and back again, thereby passing the equator (\\"linje\\") twice before being bottled. The constant movement, high humidity and fluctuating temperature cause the spirit to extract more flavour and contributes to accelerated maturation. Norwegian aquavit distillers Arcus has carried out a test where they tried to emulate the rocking of the casks aboard the \\"Linje\\" ships while the oak barrels were subjected to the weather elements as they would aboard a ship. The finished product was, according to Arcus, far from the taste that a proper linje aquavit should have. Therefore, to this day boats loaded with \\"Line Aquavit\\" set sail from Norway to Australia and back again before they are tapped on bottle and sold as part of the Norwegian Christmas traditions. Outside the Nordic countries Aquavit is seldom produced outside of the Nordic countries, although there are domestic imitations of it in some countries, especially in areas that have a large community of Nordic immigrants, such as the United States. An exception, however, is Northern Germany, and in particular the German state of Schleswig- Holstein, which was part of Denmark until the 19th century (see: History of Schleswig-Holstein) and still has a notable Danish minority. Among the most important German brands are Bommerlunder from Flensburg, Kieler Sprotte from Kiel and Malteserkreuz. The latter brand has been produced in Berlin since 1924 by a subsidiary of Sweden's Vin & Sprit AB (now Pernod Ricard), the producer of many Swedish akvavits, and can be considered a German imitation of the Nordic aquavits, since it is based on an original Danish recipe. Brands from Schleswig-Holstein, however, often have a long history, comparable to their Nordic counterparts. Bommerlunder, for instance, has been made since 1760. Aquavit is also an important part of the traditional cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein. German aquavit is virtually always distilled from fermented grain, and generally has an alcohol content of 38% by volume, marginally less than Scandinavian aquavits. Psychopomp Microdistillery in Bristol, England, started producing an aquavit (termed 'Aqvavit' due to EU regulations) in 2017. In Canada aquavit is produced by Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery, Island Spirits Distillery, Long Table Distillery, Spirit of York Distillery Co. in Toronto, Ontario, and Sheringham Distillery on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Small distilleries in the United States also produce aquavit, especially in parts of the country with high populations of people of Nordic heritage, such as the distilleries in Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oregon and Washington. See List of Akvavit Producers in the United States for specifics. In Newfoundland, Canada The Newfoundland Distillery Co. produces aquavit from barley, honey and juniper-smoked peat from Newfoundland.

Life and career Gilmore is a native of the Texas Panhandle, having been born in Amarillo and raised in Lubbock, Texas. His earliest musical influence was Hank Williams and the honky tonk brand of country music that his father played. In the 1950s, he was exposed to the emerging rock and roll of other Texans such as Roy Orbison and Lubbock native Buddy Holly, as well as to Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley, the latter two being in the line up at a concert he attended on October 15, 1955, at Lubbock's Fair Park Coliseum. He was profoundly influenced in the 1960s by The Beatles and Bob Dylan and the folk music and blues revival in that decade. With Joe Ely and Butch Hancock, Gilmore founded The Flatlanders. The group has been performing on and off since 1972. The band's first recording project, from the early 1970s, was barely distributed. It has since been acknowledged, through Rounder's 1990 reissue (More a Legend Than a Band), as a milestone of progressive, alternative country. The three friends continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances, and in May 2002, released a long-awaited follow-up album, Now Again, on New West Records. After briefly attending Texas Tech University, Gilmore spent much of the 1970s in an ashram in Denver, Colorado, studying metaphysics with teenaged Indian guru Prem Rawat, also known as Maharaji. In the 1980s, he moved to Austin, where his first solo album, Fair and Square, was finally released in 1988. Gilmore's fans admire his tenor voice, which delivers expressive, pure, country-inflected singing. In 1994, Gilmore teamed up with Willie Nelson to contribute \\"Crazy\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. Gilmore appeared as himself in Peter Bogdanovich's 1993 film The Thing Called Love, a love story about young songwriters in Nashville. He also had a small but memorable acting role in the 1998 movie The Big Lebowski. He portrayed a bowler named Smokey, an aging, emotionally \\"fragile\\" pacifist threatened with a pistol by Walter Sobchak, \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski's best friend and sidekick (John Goodman). He has also been a guest on The Tonight Show, with host Jay Leno, the Late Show with David Letterman, Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion on NPR, and the Fresh Air radio program with Terry Gross. Gilmore's son, Colin Gilmore, is also a singer‚Äìsongwriter based in Austin. Gilmore's song \\"Braver Newer World\\" is featured in the 1995 Noah Baumbach film Kicking and Screaming. In 2005, Gilmore released Come on Back, an album of songs his father loved. Gilmore said of the album, \\"This new album is a compilation of recordings of some old songs that my dad loved. I love them too, and it is a project very dear to me.\\" His version of \\"Mack the Knife\\" from the album One Endless Night is on the soundtrack of Jacques Audiard's 2009 film A Prophet (Un Proph√®te). Gilmore has been nominated for three Grammys, Best Contemporary Folk Album for Spinning Around The Sun in 1993, Best Contemporary Folk Album Braver Newer World in 1996, and Best Traditional Folk Album Come On Back in 2005.\\"Recording Academy Grammy Awards\\", Retrieved Feb. 14, 2018.

One major difference was that C News was written with portability in mind. It ran on many variants of Unix and even MS-DOS. The relaynews program that handled article filing and feeding was carefully optimized and designed to process articles in batches, while B News processed one article per program invocation. The authors claimed that relaynews could process articles 19 times as quickly as B News. In 1992, Collyer gave C News a new index facility called NOV (or News Overview). This allowed newsreaders to rapidly retrieve header and threading information with relatively little load on the server. Virtually all news servers continue to use this method in the form of the NNTP XOVER command. Development of C News stopped about 1995, and the package was largely superseded by INN.

Henry Spencer (born 1955) is a Canadian computer programmer and space enthusiast. He wrote \\"regex\\", a widely used software library for regular expressions, and co-wrote C News, a Usenet server program. He also wrote The Ten Commandments for C Programmers. He is coauthor, with David Lawrence, of the book Managing Usenet. While working at the University of Toronto he ran the first active Usenet site outside the U.S., starting in 1981. His records from that period were eventually acquired by Google to provide an archive of Usenet in the 1980s. The first international Usenet site was run in Ottawa, in 1981; however, it is generally not remembered, as it served merely as a read-only medium. Later in 1981, Spencer acquired a Usenet feed from Duke University, and brought \\"utzoo\\" online; the earliest public archives of Usenet date from May 1981 as a result. The small size of Usenet in its youthful days, and Spencer's early involvement, made him a well-recognised participant; this is commemorated in Vernor Vinge's 1992 novel A Fire Upon the Deep. The novel featured an interstellar communications medium remarkably similar to Usenet, down to the author including spurious message headers; one of the characters who appeared solely through postings to this was modeled on Spencer (and, slightly obliquely, named for him). He is also credited with the claim that \\"Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.\\" Preserving Usenet In mid-December 2001, Google unveiled its improved Usenet archives, which now go more than a decade deeper into the Internet's past than did the millions of posts that the company had originally acquired when it bought an existing archive called Deja News. Between 1981 and 1991, while running the zoology department's computer system at the University of Toronto, Spencer copied more than 2 million Usenet messages onto magnetic tapes. The 141 tapes wound up at the University of Western Ontario, where Google's Michael Schmidt tracked them down and, with the help of David Wiseman and others, got them transferred onto disks and into Google's archives. Free Software contributions Henry Spencer helped Geoff Collyer write C News in 1987. At around the same time he wrote a non-proprietary replacement for \`regex(3)\`, the Unix library for handling regular expressions, and made it freely available; his API followed that of Eighth Edition Research Unix. Spencer's library has been used in many software packages, including Tcl, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, as well as being adapted for others, including early versions of Perl. Circa 1993, Spencer donated a second version of his RE library to 4.4BSD, following the POSIX standard for regular expressions. Spencer was technical lead on the FreeS/WAN project, implementing an IPsec cryptographic protocol stack for Linux. He also wrote 'aaa' (Amazing Awk Assembler), which is one of the longest and most complex programs ever written in the awk programming language. He also developed a 4 point font used by entomologists in labeling pinned insect specimens. Space Spencer is a founding member of the Canadian Space Society, and has served on its board of directors several times since 1984. He did mission analysis (planning of launch and orbits) for the CSS's Canadian Solar Sail project (now defunct), and was Software Architect for MOST, a Canadian science microsatellite dedicated to studying variable light from stars and extrasolar planets launched by Eurockot in 2003. The asteroid 117329 Spencer is named in his honour. He is a highly regarded space enthusiast, and is a familiar and respected presence on several space forums on Usenet and the Internet. From 1983 to 2007 Spencer posted over 34,000 messages to the sci.space.* newsgroups. His knowledge of space history and technology is such that the \\"I Corrected Henry Spencer\\" virtual T-shirt award was created as a reward for anyone who can catch him in an error of fact.

It is widely used in theatre, photography, film, radio and television production, and industrial staging work. While sometimes confused with duct tape, gaffer tape differs in the composition of both the backing, which is made from fabric as opposed to vinyl or other plastics, and the adhesive, which is more resistant to heat and more easily removed without damaging the surface to which it adhered.  History  The precise origin of the name is unknown, one theory being that it is named for the gaffer (chief lighting technician) on a film crew. When cables are taped down on a stage or other surface, either to prevent tripping hazards or conceal them from view of the audience or camera, they are said to be gaffed or gaffered. Gaffer tape was invented in 1959 by Ross Lowell, director, cinematographer, and founder of Lowel-Light. Lowell transferred the adhesive from Johnson & Johnson's Permacel tape, also known as duct tape, to silver fabric, and Lowel-Light introduced gaffer tape to the market.  Properties and uses  camera department remote on a film set Gaffer tape is manufactured in many colors, including fluorescent and custom colors, but perhaps the most common variety is matte black. A matte finish keeps the tape from reflecting light, so that it blends in with a typical stage floor. It is sold in a variety of widths, from to , with and being the most common. Gaffer tape is strong, yet can be torn by hand, so no cutting tools are necessary, and it can easily be ripped into narrower strips when desired. The synthetic adhesive typically leaves little or no residue and will generally not damage most surfaces when it is removed. Gaffer tape is usually more expensive than duct tape because it is manufactured in smaller quantities, has more exacting specifications, and is marketed for professional use. Rolls of gaffer tape in a variety of colors A common application for gaffer tape is securing cables to a stage floor, podium, or other surface, either for safety or concealment. It is also frequently used whenever a quick ad hoc fix is required, from temporarily attaching fixtures or props, to salvaging a broken piece of production equipment. A narrow version of gaffer tape, called spike tape, is used in theater productions for floor layout. In the absence of console tape or artist tape, live sound engineers or light board operators may use a strip of white gaffer tape along the bottom of a mixing board to label the channels or submasters used for a particular show. In rock climbing gyms, gaffer tape can be used to mark climbs on the wall. It is preferable to duct tape because it is stronger and lasts longer on the wall.

It is often used to indicate the masses of other stars, as well as stellar clusters, nebulae, galaxies and black holes. It is approximately equal to the mass of the Sun. This equates to about two nonillion (short scale) or two quintillion (long scale) kilograms: : The solar mass is about times the mass of Earth (), or times the mass of Jupiter (). History of measurement The value of the gravitational constant was first derived from measurements that were made by Henry Cavendish in 1798 with a torsion balance. The value he obtained differs by only 1% from the modern value, but wasn't as precise. The diurnal parallax of the Sun was accurately measured during the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, yielding a value of (9 arcseconds, compared to the present value of ). From the value of the diurnal parallax, one can determine the distance to the Sun from the geometry of Earth. The first known estimate of the solar mass was by Isaac Newton. In his work Principia (1687), he estimated that the ratio of the mass of Earth to the Sun was about . Later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax, which he had used to estimate the distance to the Sun. He corrected his estimated ratio to in the third edition of the Principia. The current value for the solar parallax is smaller still, yielding an estimated mass ratio of . As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of Solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using Kepler's third law. Calculation The mass of the Sun cannot be measured directly, and is instead calculated from other measurable factors, using the equation for the orbital period of a small body orbiting a central mass. Based on the length of the year, the distance from Earth to the Sun (an astronomical unit or AU), and the gravitational constant (), the mass of the Sun is given by solving Kepler's third law: :M_\\\\odot = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\times (1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{AU})^3}{G \\\\times (1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{yr})^2} The value of G is difficult to measure and is only known with limited accuracy (see Cavendish experiment). The value of G times the mass of an object, called the standard gravitational parameter, is known for the Sun and several planets to a much higher accuracy than G alone. As a result, the solar mass is used as the standard mass in the astronomical system of units. Variation The Sun is losing mass because of fusion reactions occurring within its core, leading to the emission of electromagnetic energy, and by the ejection of matter with the solar wind. It is expelling about per year. The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the red giant stage, climbing to y‚àí1 when it reaches the tip of the red-giant branch. This will rise to y‚àí1 on the asymptotic giant branch, before peaking at a rate of 10‚àí5 to 10‚àí4 y‚àí1 as the Sun generates a planetary nebula. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate white dwarf, it will have lost 46% of its starting mass. The mass of the Sun has been decreasing since the time it formed. This occurs through two processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the Sun's core, hydrogen is converted into helium through nuclear fusion, in particular the p‚Äìp chain, and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons. Most of this energy eventually radiates away from the Sun. Second, high-energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the Sun are ejected directly into outer space as the solar wind and coronal mass ejections. The original mass of the Sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass-loss rates than at present, and it may have lost anywhere from 1‚Äì7% of its natal mass over the course of its main-sequence lifetime. The Sun gains a very small amount of mass through the impact of asteroids and comets. However, as the Sun already contains 99.86% of the Solar System's total mass, these impacts cannot offset the mass lost by radiation and ejection. Related units One solar mass, , can be converted to related units: * (Lunar mass) * (Earth mass) * (Jupiter mass) * It is also frequently useful in general relativity to express mass in units of length or time. * (half the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun) * The solar mass parameter (G¬∑), as listed by the IAU Division I Working Group, has the following estimates: * (TCG-compatible) * (TDB-compatible) See also *Chandrasekhar limit *Gaussian gravitational constant *Orders of magnitude (mass) *Stellar mass *Sun References Mass Units of mass Mass ","title":"Solar mass"},{"id":"172990","text":"The use‚Äìmention distinction is a foundational concept of analytic philosophy,Wheeler (2005) p. 568 according to which it is necessary to make a distinction between a word (or phrase) and it,Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40‚Äì1W.V. Quine (1940) p. 24 and many philosophical works have been \\"vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention\\". Several philosophers have pointed out that demarcating the distinction can sometimes be pedantic or laborious, depending on syntax, but the main critique is of failures to demarcate it in simple cases where the failure may cause a needless distraction from the argument. The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word cheese: * Use: Cheese is derived from milk. * Mention: 'Cheese' is derived from the Old English word ƒãƒìse. The first sentence is a statement about the substance called \\"cheese\\": it uses the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a signifier: it mentions the word without using it to refer to anything other than itself.  Grammar  In written language, mentioned words or phrases often appear between single or double quotation marks (as in \\"The name 'Chicago' contains three vowels\\") or in italics (as in \\"When I say honey, I mean the sweet stuff that bees make\\"). In philosophy, single quotation marks are typically used, while in other fields (such as linguistics) italics are much more common. Style authorities such as Strunk and White insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. On the other hand, used words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic markings. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues. If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes customary to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other: * When Larry said, \\"That has three letters\\", he was referring to the word 'bee'. * With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that \\"The term refers to an umbrella.\\" A few authorities recommend against using different types of quotation marks for speech and mentioned words and recommend one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.For example, Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy- editors and Proofreaders. 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but The Chicago Manual of Style, section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that \\"philosophers\\" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.  In philosophy  The general phenomenon of a term's having different references in different contexts was called suppositio (substitution) by medieval logicians.See Read, Stephen (2006). Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms. In Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning‚Äîthat is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are the following: * Properly with a concrete and real referent: \\"That is my pig\\" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition) * Properly with a concrete but unreal referent: \\"Santa Claus's pig is very big.\\" (also personal supposition) * Properly with a generic referent: \\"Any pig breathes air.\\" (simple supposition) * Improperly by way of metaphor: \\"Your grandfather is a pig\\". (improper supposition) * As a pure term: \\"'Pig' has only three letters\\". (material supposition) The last sentence contains a mention example. The use‚Äìmention distinction is especially important in analytic philosophy. Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or meaningless statements or category errors. For example, the following sentences correctly distinguish between use and mention: * 'Copper' contains six letters, and is not a metal. * Copper is a metal, and contains no letters. The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word 'copper' and not the chemical element. The word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing. The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. The element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters. Stanis≈Çaw Le≈õniewski was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the fallacy that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. At the logical level, a use‚Äìmention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently. Donald Davidson told that in his student years, \\"quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions.\\" He presented a class of sentences like which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to W. V. Quine, to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of naming it or describing its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning. Self-referential statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical paradoxes, such as Quine's paradox. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of G√∂del's incompleteness theorem (diagonal lemma). There are many examples of self-reference and use‚Äìmention distinction in the works of Douglas Hofstadter, who makes the distinction thus: Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity. Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction \\"may seem rather pedantic\\". In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher John Searle, Jacques Derrida mentioned the distinction as \\"rather laborious and problematical\\".

Although very similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not typically leave visible markings on their target, and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets can sometimes leave red contusions or \\"welts\\" on exposed skin, the game relies heavily on an honor system in which the person who has been hit is ethically responsible for calling themselves out. The airsoft guns used are mostly magazine-fed, with some having manual spring charged systems similar to Nerf Blasters, or powered by replaceable compressed gas (e.g. propane (\\"green gas\\"), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or ) canisters, or are battery-powered. Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and cosmetically more resembling real guns. This makes them popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. There is also professional gun safety and weapon manipulation training conducted with airsoft in some fields, such as law enforcement,https://www.policeone.com/police- products/firearms/training/articles/4646982-New-Airsoft-training-for-law- enforcement/ due to better safety and lower cost. The United States Coast Guard, for instance, has officially adopted airsoft for training in 2018. Gameplay varies in style and composition, but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, close quarters battle, field, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. They are played in indoor courses or outdoor fields. Combat situations on the battlefield may involve the use of military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals. Before gameplay, an airsoft gun's muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually measured in feet per second (FPS). Some countries have a set velocity or kinetic energy restriction; guns shooting over the legal velocity can be confiscated. Some playing fields further restrict projectile velocity.  History  Airsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, where Ichiro Nagata thought about making model guns, guns that do not shoot and are made for modeling purposes, or shoot real projectiles that could not kill. These ‚Äúguns‚Äù were trademarked as \\"soft air gun\\", tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Japan's strict gun control. The name \\"soft air\\" referred to the compressed Freon-silicone oil mixture (later replaced by a propane-silicone oil mixture known as \\"Green Gas\\") that was used as a propellant, which was significantly weaker than the carbon dioxide used in proper airguns (pellet guns and BB guns). Originally designed for target shooting, their plastic pellets can be shot at humans without causing injury and this became popular for casual wargames, which the Japanese called . Airsoft guns spread to the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a company called LS. The guns were sold in pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of shooting pellets. Airsoft equipment was designed to closely emulate real guns. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft guns have been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages. Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in Asia. Many law enforcement agencies and military units within the United States now use Airsoft for force-on-force training drills.  Ballistics  An airsoft player shooting from behind cover, wearing goggles to fully seal the area around the eyes and a balaclava to protect the face On impact, the pain an airsoft pellet causes is directly related with the kinetic energy it has. This energy is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity. It is important to note that doubling the velocity of a pellet will quadruple its kinetic energy. As a reference value, a 6 mm 0.20 gram pellet, which is the most common size and weight, traveling at has one joule of kinetic energy. Calculating the Joules and energy generated by airsoft guns is important because of phenomenon like \\"Joule creep\\" where the FPS remains the same while the energy of the airsoft BB leaving the airsoft gun barrel increases. Different regions vary in the velocity airsoft guns are allowed to shoot at. In the United States, velocity differs from the type of gameplay field. Close Quarter Battle arenas typically regulate velocity on airsoft guns at around 110 metres per second (350ft). For outdoor fields, velocity is usually regulated by the type of gun. Fully automatic Airsoft Electric Guns (AEGs) are often set at and less, semi-automatic DMR-style AEGs at 120-140 metres per second (400-450ft/s), and 140-150 metres per second (450-500ft/s) for bolt- action sniper rifles. These are measured with a 0.20 gram pellet. The maximum effective range of field-legal airsoft guns is all around with a highly upgraded sniper rifle replica. Most airsoft guns used for field play will have an effective range of around , depending on the intended role of the equipment. Most Airsoft guns are capable of shooting from to , although it is also possible to purchase upgraded internals for some Airsoft guns that will enable the gun to shoot up to or higher. In California a common limit for CQB is . In Ireland, Italy, and Japan the energy limit for Airsoft guns is one joule no matter what the type of game play. Some UK sites allow semi- automatic-only equipment up to 88 m/s (290 ft/s) and bolt-action rifles up to 95 m/s (310 ft/s). However, the majority of UK sites allow both semi-automatic equipment and bolt-action rifles up to 107 m/s (350 ft/s). Northern Ireland has a maximum velocity of with 0.20 g pellets, without regard to the type of equipment. In Sweden the legal limitations of airsoft guns caps the energy limit at 10 joules for single fire guns and 3 joules for semi-automatic and fully automatic guns. The ballistics of spring or electrically powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy. In spring/electric airsoft equipment, barrel length does not have a significant effect on accuracy. The \\"sweet spot\\" for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around 450 mm. Past that length, added barrel length will not improve accuracy. In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy. Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel (ceteris paribus). This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500 mm, if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel. However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter. Gas powered replicas function more like real firearms. In gas powered guns, added barrel length (to an appropriate degree) will result in significantly increased velocity, and increased accuracy to a degree. Tighter bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have 6.05-6.08 mm bore barrels, but best performance is usually seen with \\"tightbore\\" barrels, which are 6.01 to 6.05 in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a good quality 6.01-6.02 mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good quality 6.03 mm or 6.05 mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy, and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between tightbore sizes is debatable and usually outweighed by bore consistency. Although with the new found popularity with HPA guns the debate has been opened that barrel's with a larger diameter (up to 6.13mm) could provide a more accurate shot. Due to the higher volume of air surrounding the pellet it negates the chance of the pellet coming into contact with the barrel throwing the pellets trajectory off similar to a musket, in how the bullet slams about before leaving the barrel.  Safety  Players in the 'safe zone' between games Many manufacturers and retailers suggest treating an airsoft gun like a real gun at all times. This will help alleviate safety issues resulting in an accidental/negligent discharge to an unknowing target or an airsoft gun being mistaken for a real firearm. Most manufacturers include an orange tip on the barrel of the airsoft gun for safety purposes. Manufacturers and retailers urge consumers to not remove the orange tip of the airsoft rifle as it is used to help distinguish them from a real firearm. The orange tip serves many purposes, one of them being for law enforcement to help discern airsoft guns from real firearms. The minimum safe level of gear required to participate in most games includes a pair of ballistic eyewear ANSI Z87.1 (impact-rated) goggles to protect participants' eyes. Traditional prescription glasses and sunglasses, or goggles not designed specifically for use with airsoft or paintball marker, may break or shatter upon being struck, causing injury to the eye. Airsoft guns are not to be confused with BB guns, which fire spherical metal pellets. = Community safety precautions = Airsoft replica of an H&K; G36C. This replica is not in use on a field, and has the magazine removed, the chamber cleared, and a barrel bag placed over the muzzle. Rules such as a maximum muzzle velocity and engagement distance guidelines are used by different groups. Some organizations have created common safety rules and guidelines. Most minimum engagement distances are 10 feet. When not actively playing, some fields require \\"barrel bags\\", also known as barrel socks, barrel condoms, barrel blockers, or barrel sleeves, to be placed over the muzzle of the gun. The magazine is usually removed as well, and the gun fired to clear the chamber. Most fields also require players to leave their guns set to the safety position when they are not shooting, a practice common when using real firearms. In certain countries, such as the Philippines, additional special rules have been adopted.Filipino Airsoft Players (FAP) Standard Rules and Regulations:  Legal restrictions  Airsoft is legal in most parts of the world. Some countries have specific restrictions,Complete list of Airsoft legal requirements in the world such as maximum muzzle velocity and \\"unrealistic\\" coloring to distinguish them from actual firearms. They are legal throughout the United States, but restrictions do exist in cities like Chicago and Detroit. The states of New Mexico, New York and New Jersey, however, do not allow airsoft guns to be used or handled publicly because of the resemblance to real firearms. They may be used on private property with the consent of the owner. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection FAQ page states that Airsoft guns are considered look-alike firearms which require the special blaze orange marking. In the Republic of Ireland Airsoft guns are classified as Realistic Imitation Firearms but not restricted as much as in the United Kingdom. Under the Criminal Justice Act of 2006 Airsoft guns are legal in the Republic. One can buy, sell and import Airsoft guns without notifying relevant law enforcement authorities. They do not need to be painted in fluorescent colors, they do not need to have an orange tip, but they cannot launch the projectile with a kinetic energy exceeding 1 joule. However, carrying an imitation firearm in public is prohibited, and a gun carry case is required, as for real firearms. Airsoft shops are spread over the country, and buyers must be aged 16 or over to purchase an airsoft gun. There is no age limit on Airsoft, as long as a minor has an adult's permission. In the United Kingdom, some Airsoft guns are classified as realistic imitation firearms or RIFs. The sale, manufacture, or importation (but not gifting) of these is illegal under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. A defence is allowed for selling for specific purposes including airsoft skirmishing The minimum age for buying any imitation firearm in the UK is 18.{ Most players use The British Airsoft Club (BAC) for a valid defence Q&A; accessdate=13 March 2008 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307184716/http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/18 archivedate=7 March 2008 url-status=dead df=dmy-all}} It is an offence to possess an imitation firearm in a public place without a reasonable excuse, for example travelling to, or from, or being at an airsoft skirmish site. Most UK airsoft sites and retailers participate in the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailer Association (UKARA) registration scheme. A player who has participated in at least 3 skirmishes over a period of at least 56 days at the same skirmish site can be registered by that site. Retailers have access to the database to verify that the purchaser can provide them with a defence. As an alternative to RIFs, IFs (Imitation Firearms, including 'two tones') are available in the UK. These are RIFs which have been painted a bright colour (excluding white/silver/gold) over at least 51% of the item. No specific defence is required for selling an IF, although the minimum age for purchasing remains 18. In Canada, there are laws pertaining to airsoft importing. All airsoft guns that are bought in Canada are legal, but when importing it, the gun has to have between 366FPS and 500FPS to pass inspection at customs, otherwise the gun will be shipped back or destroyed. In certain countries use of lasers of any kind is illegal, including airsoft gun scopes with integrated lasers. = Orange-tipped airsoft gun muzzles = Although airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not required by federal law. Manufacturers and importers may cite Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which stipulates that \\"no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\\" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to \\"traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof.\\" This language clearly exempts airsoft guns from these requirements, placing them in the same category as BB- guns, pellet, air, and paintball, none of which are conventionally sold or used with an orange tip, and many of which bear as much resemblance to real firearms as airsoft guns do.  Airsoft guns  Classic Army M4A1 Carbine AEG with Aimpoint Comp2 Replica Red dot sight The guns used in airsoft are typically imitation firearms. They have a mechanism for shooting projectiles 6 mm or 8 mm in diameter. Airsoft guns are classified according to their operating principle, which can be spring-loaded, electric (battery-powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or \\"AEGs\\"), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as \\"GBBs\\"). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart grenade launchers which fire a projectile spray of pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed gas propellant (i.e. green gas, propane, compressed air, or CO2). There is also a type of airsoft gun that is powered by a single (HPA) high-pressure air tank and a battery pack to power the internal FCU \\"Fire Control Unit\\" computer board. These guns are often known for their high and adjustable ROF or \\"rate of fire\\" and durability. These HPA replicas are most often referred to as \\"PolarStars\\", although this refers to a popular brand of HPA engines and accessories. Newer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and China, have metal internal and external parts. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts. A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its \\"real steel\\" counterpart due to the use of aluminum, alloy, and plastic, though some have weights in them for a more realistic feel. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism. Gas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real- capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low- capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun) type replicas. It is common for owners to \\"tech\\" or modify their guns. The majority of gearboxes are made to Tokyo Marui specifications and have upgrade parts available. Some gearboxes are proprietary in design. It is also possible to perform DIY modifications. = Hop-up = The \\"hop-up\\" system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and in most pistols, is used to add extra effective range by putting backspin on the pellets. The Magnus effect causes the pellets to experience lift as they are shot, counteracting against gravity. A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it flies past. Adjusting the hop-up makes the nub protrude more or less into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced. Ideally, the hop-up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far, or dropping to the ground too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the velocity of the projectile (a gun firing with the hop fully unwound can drop to as low as ). Ease and location of adjustment vary by gun design; some equipment provides control that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial dis-assembly. For example, a common location for Hop-Up adjustment is where the ejection port would be on a real firearm, which allows the machine to be covered while still allowing quick access to adjust the Hop-Up. = Airsoft projectiles = Most airsoft guns fire round plastic pellets, usually white, but black \\"invisible\\" or phosphorescent are common as well. The pellets mostly range from 0.12 to 0.48 g. However, the most popular weights for AEGs (automatic electric guns) and GBB* (Gas Blow-Back guns) are 0.20 g and 0.25 g (*These weights are generally specified for pistols whose muzzle velocity ranges from approximately to ). Mid to high end AEGs use 0.20‚Äì0.30 g pellets, while heavier rounds (0.30‚Äì0.43 g) are typically used in long range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind. Pellets are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round (65 kg) package of tournament grade pellets. Biodegradable pellets are a fraction more expensive than non-bio counterparts, but many fields require them. Pellets are typically 6 mm in diameter, though 8 mm pellets do exist. Pellets vary by diameter depending on the brand (e.g. Matrix pellets are 5.95 mm in diameter and let less air slip past it during travel through the barrel, whereas Crosman pellets are 5.93 mm in diameter and allow more air to slip past during travel through the barrel and allow for less velocity). Pellets are used for the majority of play, although foam balls may be used to represent M203 grenade launcher shells. = Customization = Some players customize their airsoft guns, either to improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, fore-grips, and flashlights, red dot sights being the most commonly used. Red dot sights are used to help aim, fore-grips are used to get a better grip on the airsoft gun, flashlights (whether mounted or held in another hand) are used to illuminate dark areas and/or to blind opponents. Even though in certain countries lasers are illegal, they are popular attachments in the U.S. and Europe. Laser sights are more for their appearance than any practical effect, largely because they must be weak enough not to carry a risk of damaging another player's eyesight, which rules out using any laser powerful enough to produce a visible dot on the target in sunlight (although lasers can be useful for night games). Also available are \\"mock suppressors/silencers\\". These resemble the actual firearm accessory that dampens sound. Since Airsoft does not use combustibles for propulsion these usually serve no function. Although there are models that function to \\"light up\\" a glow-in-the-dark BB using UV light similar to a tracer round.https://airsoftranch.com/how-does-an-airsoft-tracer-unit-work- helpful-guide/  Airsoft and military training  Airsoft technology is used in military training and law enforcement training. Due to airsoft's realism, relatively safe projectiles, and economical ammunition, it is well-suited to war games and scenarios to train troops. Multiple airsoft inventions were developed originally for military and law enforcement use. Marking rounds were invented by Kerry T. Bowden to allow trainees to see where each projectile landed. Much like paintball and simunitions, these marking pellets would break upon impact, marking the target with luminescent liquid. Unlike traditional plastic pellets, marking rounds are heavier to ensure breakage of the shell on impact. The weight can be adjusted by adding heavier liquid.\\"Patent US20140342858 ‚Äì Airsoft Marking round\\" , \\"Patent US20140342858 ‚Äì Airsoft Marking round.\\" Google Scholar. 20 November 2014. Weborn 27 September 2015. Marking rounds are critical for trainees because they allow the shooter to see exactly where they hit the target. This allows them to extrapolate their mistakes and improve their aim. Reusable grenades were improved by Scott Frank to emulate the fragmentation of a real grenade in war games and scenarios. The grenade can be loaded with paint or pellets. It uses a quick release of highly pressurized gas to break the shell and quickly disperse pellets or paint in all directions. Frank's grenade, although not the first, aimed to be as realistic and predictable as an actual grenade. He developed a more accurate timing mechanism and secondary safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.\\"Patent US8485101 ‚Äì Reusable Grenade.\\" , \\"Patent US8485101 ‚Äì Reusable Grenade.\\" Google Books. 16 July 2013. Weborn 27 September 2015. Both marking rounds and reusable grenades gave airsoft the edge it needed to enter into military and law enforcement training grounds. The airsoft guns used for training differ from civilian models. Guns manufactured for professional training are made to replicate the weight, feel and the sound of its real steel counterpart. In general, professional training airsoft guns are GBB models and enhanced with a weighted blowback mechanism to increase the force of the kick. Some are AEGs and are built with a blowback mechanism. They are also outfitted with muzzle protectors that amplify the sound to a decibel level comparable to that of a real firearm. The average FPS for professional training airsoft guns is higher than civilian models. Economically, airsoft is cheaper than simulation training. Benjamin Kratz, Fort Jackson's battalion executive officer, said that one blank M16 round can cost as much as 32 airsoft rounds.\\"Soldiers Test Integration of Popular Civilian Game into Pre- deployment Training.\\" , Reeves, Steve. \\"Soldiers Test Integration of Popular Civilian Game into Pre-deployment Training.\\" www.army.mil.

Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote , the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer. Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems. Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk. As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for exchanging newsgroup articles. A newsreader, also known as a news client, is a software application that reads articles on Usenet, either directly from the news server's disks or via the NNTP. The well-known TCP port 119 is reserved for NNTP. Well-known TCP port 433 (NNSP) may be used when doing a bulk transfer of articles from one server to another. When clients connect to a news server with Transport Layer Security (TLS), TCP port 563 is often used. This is sometimes referred to as NNTPS. Alternatively, a plain-text connection over port 119 may be changed to use TLS via the \`STARTTLS\` command. In October 2006, the IETF released which updates NNTP and codifies many of the additions made over the years since RFC 977. At the same time, the IETF also released which specifies the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) via NNTP over STARTTLS. Network News Reader Protocol During an abortive attempt to update the NNTP standard in the early 1990s, a specialized form of NNTP intended specifically for use by clients, NNRP, was proposed.

He became widely known as the \\"Hero of Bennington\\" for his exemplary service at the Battle of Bennington in 1777. Early life John Stark. John Stark was born in Londonderry, New Hampshire (at a site that is now in Derry) in 1728. His father, Archibald Stark (1693-1758) was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to parents who were from Wiltshire, England;Landmarks of the American Revolution: a guide to locating and knowing what happened at the sites of independence by Mark Mayo Boatner - Hawthorn Books, 1975 page 158-159 Stark's father met his future wife when he moved to Londonderry in Ireland.Ferling p. 36 When Stark was eight years old, his family moved to Derryfield (now Manchester, New Hampshire), where he lived for the rest of his life. Stark married Elizabeth \\"Molly\\" Page, with whom he had 11 children including his eldest son Caleb Stark. On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks. Stark grabbed the stick from the first warrior's hands and proceeded to attack him, taking the rest of the warriors by surprise. The chief was so impressed by this heroic act that Stark was adopted into the tribe, where he spent the winter.Caleb Stark, John Stark, Memoir and Official Correspondence of Gen.

Lyon, 1860 The following spring a government agent sent from the Province of Massachusetts Bay to work on the exchange of prisoners paid his ransom of $103 Spanish dollars and $60 for Amos Eastman. Stark and Eastman then returned to New Hampshire safely. French and Indian War Stark served as a second lieutenant under Major Robert Rogers during the French and Indian War. His brother William Stark served beside him in Rogers' Rangers. As a member of the daring Rogers' Rangers, Stark gained valuable combat experience and a detailed knowledge of the northern frontier of the American colonies. While serving with the rangers in 1757, Stark went on a scouting mission toward Fort Carillon in which the rangers were ambushed. General Jeffery Amherst, in 1759 ordered Rogers' Rangers to journey from Lake George to the Abenaki village of St. Francis, deep in Quebec. The Rangers went north and attacked the Indian town. Stark, Rogers' second-in-command of all ranger companies, refused to accompany the attacking force out of respect for his Indian foster-parents residing there. He returned to New Hampshire to his wife, whom he had married the previous year. At the end of the war, Stark retired as a captain and returned to Derryfield, New Hampshire. American Revolution Replica of the Green Mountain Boys flag in John Stark's collection. =Bunker Hill= The Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, signaled the start of the American Revolutionary War, and Stark returned to military service. On April 23, 1775, Stark accepted a Colonelcy in the New Hampshire Militia and was given command of the 1st New Hampshire Regiment and James Reed of the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment, also outside of Boston. As soon as Stark could muster his men, he ferried and marched them south to Boston to support the blockaded rebels there. He made his headquarters in the confiscated Isaac Royall House in Medford, Massachusetts. On June 16, the rebels, fearing a preemptive British attack on their positions in Cambridge and Roxbury, decided to take and hold Breed's Hill, a high point on the Charlestown peninsula near Boston. On the night of the 16th, American troops moved into position on the heights and began digging entrenchments. As dawn approached, lookouts on HMS Lively, a 20-gun sloop of war noticed the activity and the sloop opened fire on the rebels and the works in progress. This in turn drew the attention of the British admiral, who demanded to know what the Lively was shooting at. Subsequent to that, the entire British squadron opened fire. As dawn broke on June 17 the British could clearly see hastily constructed fortifications on Breed's Hill, and British Gen. Thomas Gage knew that he would have to drive the rebels out before fortifications were complete. He ordered Major General William Howe to prepare to land his troops. Thus began the Battle of Bunker Hill. American Col. William Prescott held the hill throughout the intense initial bombardment with only a few hundred American militia. Prescott knew that he was sorely outgunned and outnumbered. He sent a desperate request for reinforcements. Stark and Reed with the New Hampshire minutemen arrived at the scene soon after Prescott's request. The Lively had begun a rain of accurate artillery fire directed at Charlestown Neck, the narrow strip of land connecting Charlestown to the rebel positions. On the Charlestown side, several companies from other regiments were milling around in disarray, afraid to march into range of the artillery fire. Stark ordered the men to stand aside and calmly marched his men to Prescott's positions without taking any casualties. When the New Hampshire militia arrived, the grateful Colonel Prescott allowed Stark to deploy his men where he saw fit. Stark surveyed the ground and immediately saw that the British would probably try to flank the rebels by landing on the beach of the Mystic River, below and to the left of Bunker Hill. Stark led his men to the low ground between Mystic Beach and the hill and ordered them to \\"fortify\\" a two-rail fence by stuffing straw and grass between the rails. Stark also noticed an additional gap in the defense line and ordered Lieutenant Nathaniel Hutchins from his brother William's company and others to follow him down a bank to the edge of the Mystic River. They piled rocks across the beach to form a crude defense line. After this fortification was hastily constructed, Stark deployed his men three-deep behind the wall. A large contingent of British with the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the lead advanced towards the fortifications. The Minutemen crouched and waited until the advancing British were almost on top of them, and then stood up and fired as one. They unleashed a fierce and unexpected volley directly into the faces of the fusiliers, killing 90 in the blink of an eye and breaking their advance. The fusiliers retreated in panic. A charge of British infantry was next, climbing over their dead comrades to test Stark's line. This charge too was decimated by a withering fusillade by the Minutemen. A third charge was repulsed in a similar fashion, again with heavy losses to the British. The British officers wisely withdrew their men from that landing point and decided to land elsewhere, with the support of artillery. Later in the battle, as the rebels were forced from the hill, Stark directed the New Hampshire regiment's fire to provide cover for Colonel Prescott's retreating troops. The day's New Hampshire dead were later buried in the Salem Street Burying Ground, Medford, Massachusetts. While the British did eventually take the hill that day, their losses were formidable, especially among the officers. After the arrival of General George Washington two weeks after the battle, the siege reached a stalemate until March the next year, when cannon seized at the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga were positioned on Dorchester Heights in a deft night manoeuvre. This placement threatened the British fleet in Boston Harbor and forced General Howe to withdraw all his forces from the Boston garrison and sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Among the notable men who served under Stark was Captain Henry Dearborn, who later became Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson. Dearborn arrived with 60 militia men from New Hampshire.Dearborn, Henry; Peckham, Howard (ed.). Revolutionary War Journals of Henry Dearborn, 1775‚Äì1783. 2009. p. 5 =Trenton and Princeton= Statue at Stark Park in Manchester, New Hampshire As Washington prepared to go to New York in anticipation of a British attack there, he knew that he desperately needed experienced men like John Stark to command regiments in the Continental Army. George Washington immediately offered Stark a command in the Continental Army. Stark and his New Hampshire regiment agreed to attach themselves to the Continental Army. The men of the New Hampshire Line were sent as reinforcements to the Continental Army during the Invasion of Canada in the spring of 1776. After the retreat of the Continental Army from Canada, Stark and his men traveled to New Jersey to join Washington's main army. They were with Washington in the battles of Princeton and Trenton in late 1776 and early 1777. After Trenton, Washington asked Stark to return to New Hampshire to recruit more men for the Continental Army. Stark agreed, but upon returning home, learned that while he had been fighting in New Jersey, a fellow New Hampshire Colonel named Enoch Poor had been promoted to Brigadier General in the Continental Army. In Stark's opinion, Poor had refused to march his militia regiment to Bunker Hill to join the battle, instead choosing to keep his regiment at home. Stark, an experienced woodsman and fighting commander, had been passed over for someone with no combat experience and apparently no will to fight. On March 23, 1777, Stark resigned his commission in disgust, although he pledged his future aid to New Hampshire if it should be needed. =Bennington and beyond= General Stark's statue at the Bennington Battle Monument Four months later, his home state offered Stark a commission as brigadier general of the New Hampshire Militia. He accepted on the strict condition that he would not be answerable to Continental Army authority. Soon after receiving his commission, Stark assembled 1,492 militiamen in civilian clothes with personal firearms. He traveled to Manchester, Vermont. At this place, he was ordered by Major General Benjamin Lincoln (of the Continental Army) to reinforce Philip Schuyler's Continental army on the Hudson River. Stark refused to obey Lincoln, who was another general whom he believed was unfairly promoted over his head. Lincoln was diplomatic enough to allow him to operate independently against the rear of General John Burgoyne's British army.Boatner, 69 Burgoyne sent an expedition under Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum to capture American supplies at Bennington, Vermont. Baum commanded 374 Brunswick infantry and dismounted dragoons, 300 Indians, loyalists, and Canadians, and two 3-pound cannons manned by 30 Hessians.Boatner, 68 Stark heard about the raid and marched his force to Bennington. Meanwhile, Baum received intelligence that Bennington was held by 1,800 men. On August 14, Baum asked Burgoyne for reinforcements but assured his army commander that his opponents would not give him much trouble.Boatner, 70 The Brunswick officer then fortified his position and waited for Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann's 642 soldiers and two 6-pound cannons to reach him. Colonel Seth Warner also set out with his 350 men to reinforce Stark.Boatner, 72 After waiting out a day of rain, at 3:00 PM on the 16th Stark sent 200 militia to the right, 300 men to the left, 200 troops against a position held by Tories, and 100 men on a feint against Baum's main redoubt. In the face of these attacks, the Indians, loyalists, and Canadians fled, leaving Baum stranded in his main position. As his envelopment took effect, Stark led his remaining 1,200 troops against Baum, saying, \\"We'll beat them before night or Molly Stark's a widow.\\" After an ammunition wagon exploded, Baum's men tried to hack their way out of the trap with their dragoon sabers. Baum was fatally hit and his men gave up around 5:00 PM.Boatner, 73 With Stark's men somewhat scattered by their victory, Breymann's column appeared on the scene. At this moment Colonel Seth Warner's 350 Green Mountain Boys arrived to confront Breymann's men. Between Stark and Warner, the Germans were stopped and then forced to withdraw. The New Hampshire and Vermont soldiers severely mauled Breymann's command but the German officer managed to get away with about two-thirds of his force.Boatner, 74 Historian Mark M. Boatner wrote, > As a commander of New England militia Stark had one rare and priceless > quality: he knew the limitations of his men. They were innocent of military > training, undisciplined, and unenthusiastic about getting shot. With these > men he killed over 200 of Europe's vaunted regulars with a loss of 14 > Americans killed.Boatner, 75‚Äì76 Another version has Stark rallying his troops with the cry, \\"There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!\\" Stark's action contributed to the surrender of Burgoyne's northern army after the Battles of Saratoga by raising American morale, by keeping the British from getting supplies, and by subtracting several hundred men from the enemy order of battle. Stark reported 14 killed and 42 wounded. Of Baum's 374 professional soldiers, only nine men escaped. For this feat Stark won his coveted promotion to brigadier general in the Continental Army on October 4, 1777.Boatner, 76. Boatner also listed 700 captured. Saratoga is seen as the turning point in the Revolutionary War, as it was the first major defeat of a British general and it convinced the French that the Americans were worthy of military aid. After the Battle of Freeman's Farm Gen. Stark's brigade moved into a position at Stark's Knob cutting off Burgoyne's retreat to Lake George and Lake Champlain. John Stark sat as a judge in the court martial that in September 1780 found British Major John Andr√© guilty of spying and in helping in the conspiracy of Benedict Arnold to surrender West Point to the British. He was the commander of the Northern Department three times between 1778 and 1781 along with commanding a brigade at the Battle of Springfield in June 1780. Later years Gravesite in Stark Park, Manchester, New Hampshire After serving with distinction throughout the rest of the war, Stark retired to his farm in Derryfield, renamed Manchester in 1810, where he died on May 8, 1822 at the age of 93. It has been said that of all the Revolutionary War generals, Stark was the only true Cincinnatus because he truly retired from public life at the end of the war. In 1809, a group of Bennington veterans gathered to commemorate the battle. General Stark, then aged 81, was not well enough to travel, but he sent a letter to his comrades, which closed \\"Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.\\" The motto Live Free or Die became the New Hampshire state motto in 1945. Stark and the Battle of Bennington were later commemorated with the tall Bennington Battle Monument and a statue of Stark in Bennington, Vermont. Historic sites There is a New Hampshire historical marker (number 48) near John Stark's birthplace on the east side of New Hampshire Route 28 (Rockingham Road) in Derry, New Hampshire, just south of the intersection of Lawrence Road. There is a second stone marker at the actual homestead location. Stark's childhood home is located at 2000 Elm Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The home was built in 1736 by John's father Archibald. The building is now owned by the Molly Stark Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is open by appointment only. Manchester's Stark Park, also a listed property, is home to his grave and is named in his honor. There is a bronze statue of General Stark in front of the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord; it was dedicated in 1890. New Castle's Fort Stark was renamed for the General in 1900. It was one of seven forts built in the area to protect the nearby city of Portsmouth. The historic site is placed on a peninsula known as Jerry's point (or Jaffrey's Point) on the southeast side of the island.

This article focuses on poetry from the United Kingdom written in the English language. The article does not cover poetry from other countries where the English language is spoken, including Southern Ireland after December 1922. The earliest surviving English poetry, written in Anglo-Saxon, the direct predecessor of modern English, may have been composed as early as the 7th century. The earliest English poetry The first page of Beowulf The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation; Bede attributes this to C√¶dmon (fl. 658-680), who was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at Whitby.Bede, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. This is generally taken as marking the beginning of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically; for example, estimates for the date of the great epic Beowulf range from AD 608 right through to AD 1000, and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus.See, for example, Beowulf: a Dual-Language Edition, Doubleday, New York, NY, 1977; Newton, S., 1993. The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia. Cambridge. It is possible to identify certain key moments, however. The Dream of the Rood was written before circa AD 700, when excerpts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross.Brendan Cassidy (ed.), The Ruthwell Cross, Princeton University Press (1992). Some poems on historical events, such as The Battle of Brunanburh (937) and The Battle of Maldon (991), appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question, and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence. By and large, however, Anglo-Saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives, rather than its date of composition. The most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries, known as the C√¶dmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript. While the poetry that has survived is limited in volume, it is wide in breadth. Beowulf is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others such as Waldere and the Finnesburg Fragment show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase; elegies such as The Wanderer, The Seafarer, and The Ruin (often taken to be a description of the ruins of Bath); and numerous proverbs, riddles, and charms. With one notable exception (Rhyming Poem), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliterative verse for its structure and any rhyme included is merely ornamental. The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages With the Norman conquest of England, beginning in 1111 the Anglo-Saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language. The new aristocracy spoke predominantly Norman, and this became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. As the invaders integrated, their language and literature mingled with that of the natives: the O√Øl dialect of the upper classes became Anglo-Norman, and Anglo-Saxon underwent a gradual transition into Middle English. While Anglo-Norman or Latin was preferred for high culture, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the 13th century, Layamon wrote his Brut, based on Wace's 12th century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name; Layamon's language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence remaining. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of romances and lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law. It was with the 14th century that major works of English literature began once again to appear; these include the so-called Pearl Poet's Pearl, Patience, Cleanness, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Langland's political and religious allegory Piers Plowman; Gower's Confessio Amantis; and the works of Chaucer, the most highly regarded English poet of the Middle Ages, who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of Virgil and Dante. The reputation of Chaucer's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him, though Lydgate and Skelton are widely studied. A group of Scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by Chaucer. The rise of Scottish poetry began with the writing of The Kingis Quair by James I of Scotland. The main poets of this Scottish group were Robert Henryson, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas. Henryson and Douglas introduced a note of almost savage satire, which may have owed something to the Gaelic bards, while Douglas' Eneados, a translation into Middle Scots of Virgil's Aeneid, was the first complete translation of any major work of classical antiquity into an English or Anglic language. The Renaissance in England The Renaissance was slow in coming to England, with the generally accepted start date being around 1509. It is also generally accepted that the English Renaissance extended until the Restoration in 1660. However, a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date. A number of medieval poets had, as already noted, shown an interest in the ideas of Aristotle and the writings of European Renaissance precursors such as Dante. The introduction of movable-block printing by Caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers. Caxton also printed the works of Chaucer and Gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its European counterparts. In addition, the writings of English humanists like Thomas More and Thomas Elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an English audience. Three other factors in the establishment of the English Renaissance were the Reformation, Counter Reformation, and the opening of the era of English naval power and overseas exploration and expansion. The establishment of the Church of England in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the Catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life. At the same time, long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler. =Early Renaissance poetry= With a small number of exceptions, the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable. The Douglas Aeneid was completed in 1513 and John Skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late Medieval and Renaissance styles. The new king, Henry VIII, was something of a poet himself. Thomas Wyatt (1503‚Äì42), one of the earliest English Renaissance poets. He was responsible for many innovations in English poetry, and alongside Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1516/1517‚Äì47) introduced the sonnet from Italy into England in the early 16th century. Wyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English tongue, to civilise it, to raise its powers to those of its neighbours. Much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the Italian poet Petrarch, but he also wrote sonnets of his own. Wyatt took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \\"octave\\", rhyming abba abba, followed, after a turn (volta) in the sense, by a sestet with various rhyme schemes; however his poems never ended in a rhyming couplet. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee. This marks the beginnings of the English sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet.The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, p. 647 =The Elizabethans= The Elizabethan period (1558 to 1603) in poetry is characterized by a number of frequently overlapping developments. The introduction and adaptation of themes, models and verse forms from other European traditions and classical literature, the Elizabethan song tradition, the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments. Elizabethan Song A wide range of Elizabethan poets wrote songs, including Nicholas Grimald, Thomas Nashe and Robert Southwell. There are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period. Perhaps the greatest of all the songwriters was Thomas Campion. Campion is also notable because of his experiments with metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses. These quantitative metres were based on classical models and should be viewed as part of the wider Renaissance revival of Greek and Roman artistic methods. The songs were generally printed either in miscellanies or anthologies such as Richard Tottel's 1557 Songs and Sonnets or in songbooks that included printed music to enable performance. These performances formed an integral part of both public and private entertainment. By the end of the 16th century, a new generation of composers, including John Dowland, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Thomas Weelkes and Thomas Morley were helping to bring the art of Elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level. Elizabethan poems and plays were often written in iambic meters, based on a metrical foot of two syllables, one unstressed and one stressed. However, much metrical experimentation took place during the period, and many of the songs, in particular, departed widely from the iambic norm. Courtly poetry Edmund Spenser With the consolidation of Elizabeth's power, a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged. This encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at, and often set in, an idealised version of the courtly world. Among the best known examples of this are Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen, and Philip Sidney's Arcadia. This courtly trend can also be seen in Spenser's Shepheardes Calender. This poem marks the introduction into an English context of the classical pastoral, a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants. The explorations of love found in the sonnets of William Shakespeare and the poetry of Walter Raleigh and others also implies a courtly audience. Classicism Virgil's Aeneid, Thomas Campion's metrical experiments, and Spenser's Shepheardes Calender and plays like Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra are all examples of the influence of classicism on Elizabethan poetry. It remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology; Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and the Christopher Marlowe/George Chapman Hero and Leander are examples of this kind of work. Translations of classical poetry also became more widespread, with the versions of Ovid's Metamorphoses by Arthur Golding (1565-67) and George Sandys (1626), and Chapman's translations of Homer's Iliad (1611) and Odyssey (c.1615), among the outstanding examples. =Jacobean and Caroline poetry: 1603‚Äì1660= English Renaissance poetry after the Elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains; the Metaphysical poets, the Cavalier poets and the school of Spenser. However, the boundaries between these three groups are not always clear and an individual poet could write in more than one manner. Shakespeare also popularized the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch's model. A collection of 154 sonnets by Shakespeare, dealing with themes such as the passage of time, love, beauty, and mortality, were first published in a 1609 quarto. John Milton (1608‚Äì74) is considered one of the greatest English poets, and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his most renowned epic poems were written in the Restoration period, including Paradise Lost (1667). Among the important poems Milton wrote during this period are L'Allegro, 1631; Il Penseroso, 1634; Comus (a masque), 1638; and Lycidas (1638). The Metaphysical poets John Donne The early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty, complicated style. The most famous of the Metaphysicals is probably John Donne. Others include George Herbert, Thomas Traherne, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, and Richard Crashaw. John Milton in his Comus falls into this group. The Metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the Victorian era. Donne's reputation was finally fully restored by the approbation of T. S. Eliot in the early 20th century. Influenced by continental Baroque, and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism, Donne's metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or \\"unpoetic\\" figures, such as a compass or a mosquito, to reach surprise effects. For example, in \\"Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\\", one of Donne's Songs and Sonnets, the points of a compass represent two lovers, the woman who is home, waiting, being the centre, the farther point being her lover sailing away from her. But the larger the distance, the more the hands of the compass lean to each other: separation makes love grow fonder. The paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science, one that is no longer the centre of the universe. The Cavalier poets Another important group of poets at this time were the Cavalier poets. The Cavalier poets wrote in a lighter, more elegant and artificial style than the Metaphysical poets. They were an important group of writers, who came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639‚Äì51). (King Charles reigned from 1625 and was executed 1649). Leading members of the group include Ben Jonson, Richard Lovelace, Robert Herrick, Edmund Waller, Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, and John Denham. The Cavalier poets can be seen as the forerunners of the major poets of the Augustan era, who admired them greatly. They \\"were not a formal group, but all were influenced\\" by Ben Jonson.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 181. Most of the Cavalier poets were courtiers, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet. Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions, and are influence by Latin authors Horace, Cicero, and Ovid. The Restoration and 18th century John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), a story of fallen pride, was the first major poem to appear in England after the Restoration. The court of Charles II had, in its years in France, learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the Republic. Even if Charles had wanted to reassert the divine right of kingship, the Protestantism and taste for power of the intervening years would have rendered it impossible. One of the greatest English poets, John Milton (1608‚Äì1674), wrote during this period of religious and political instability. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his major epic poems were written in the Restoration period. Some of Milton's important poems, were written before the Restoration (see above). His later major works include Paradise Regained, 1671, and Samson Agonistes, 1671. Milton's works reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated Areopagitica (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press. William Hayley's 1796 biography called him the \\"greatest English author\\",McCalman 2001, p. 605. and he remains generally regarded \\"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\\".\\"Milton, John ‚Äì Introduction\\", Contemporary Literary Criticism. =Satire= The world of fashion and scepticism that emerged encouraged the art of satire. All the major poets of the period, Samuel Butler, John Dryden, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, and the Irish poet Jonathan Swift, wrote satirical verse. Their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government. However, writers such as Pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government. Pope's The Dunciad is a satirical slaying of two of his literary adversaries (Lewis Theobald, and Colley Cibber in a later version), expressing the view that British society was falling apart morally, culturally, and intellectually. =18th-century classicism= The 18th century is sometimes called the Augustan age, and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time. Not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the Roman ideal, they also translated and imitated Greek and Latin verse resulting in measured rationalised elegant verse. Dryden translated all the known works of Virgil, and Pope produced versions of the two Homeric epics. Horace and Juvenal were also widely translated and imitated, Horace most famously by John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester and Juvenal by Samuel Johnson's The Vanity of Human Wishes. =Women poets in the 18th century= Aphra Behn A number of women poets of note emerged during the period of the Restoration, including Aphra Behn, Margaret Cavendish, Mary Chudleigh, Anne Finch, Anne Killigrew, and Katherine Philips. Nevertheless, print publication by women poets was still relatively scarce when compared to that of men, though manuscript evidence indicates that many more women poets were practising than was previously thought. Disapproval of feminine \\"forwardness\\", however, kept many out of print in the early part of the period, and even as the century progressed women authors still felt the need to justify their incursions into the public sphere by claiming economic necessity or the pressure of friends. Women writers were increasingly active in all genres throughout the 18th century, and by the 1790s women's poetry was flourishing. Notable poets later in the period include Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Joanna Baillie, Susanna Blamire, Felicia Hemans, Mary Leapor, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. In the past decades there has been substantial scholarly and critical work done on women poets of the long 18th century: first, to reclaim them and make them available in contemporary editions in print or online, and second, to assess them and position them within a literary tradition. =The late 18th century= Towards the end of the 18th century, poetry began to move away from the strict Augustan ideals and a new emphasis on the sentiment and feelings of the poet was established. This trend can perhaps be most clearly seen in the handling of nature, with a move away from poems about formal gardens and landscapes by urban poets and towards poems about nature as lived in. The leading exponents of this new trend include Thomas Gray, George Crabbe, Christopher Smart and Robert Burns as well as the Irish poet Oliver Goldsmith. These poets can be seen as paving the way for the Romantic movement. The Romantic movement See also: Romantic literature in English; English Romantic sonnets William Wordsworth The last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence, with revolutions in the United States, France, Ireland and elsewhere. In Great Britain, movement for social change and a more inclusive sharing of power was also growing. This was the backdrop against which the Romantic movement in English poetry emerged. The main poets of this movement were William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Keats. The birth of English Romanticism is often dated to the publication in 1798 of Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads. However, Blake had been publishing since the early 1780s. Much of the focus on Blake only came about during the last century when Northrop Frye discussed his work in his book Anatomy of Criticism. Shelley is most famous for such classic anthology verse works as Ozymandias, and long visionary poems which include Prometheus Unbound. Shelley's groundbreaking poem The Masque of Anarchy calls for nonviolence in protest and political action. It is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. Mahatma Gandhi's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's verse, and would often quote the poem to vast audiences.Thomas Weber, \\"Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor,\\" Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28‚Äì29. In poetry, the Romantic movement emphasised the creative expression of the individual and the need to find and formulate new forms of expression. The Romantics, with the partial exception of Byron, rejected the poetic ideals of the 18th century, and each of them returned to Milton for inspiration, though each drew something different from Milton. They also put a good deal of stress on their own originality. Lord Byron To the Romantics, the moment of creation was the most important in poetic expression and could not be repeated once it passed. Because of this new emphasis, poems that were not complete were nonetheless included in a poet's body of work (such as Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\" and \\"Christabel\\"). This argument has, however, been challenged in Zachary Leader's study Revision and Romantic Authorship (1996). Additionally, the Romantic movement marked a shift in the use of language. Attempting to express the \\"language of the common man\\", Wordsworth and his fellow Romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience, countering the mimetic, tightly constrained Neo-Classic poems (although it's important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his/her own creative, expression). In Shelley's \\"Defense of Poetry\\", he contends that poets are the \\"creators of language\\" and that the poet's job is to refresh language for their society. The Romantics were not the only poets of note at this time. In the work of John Clare the late Augustan voice is blended with a peasant's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the English language. Another contemporary poet who does not fit into the Romantic group was Walter Savage Landor. Landor was a classicist whose poetry forms a link between the Augustans and Robert Browning, who much admired it. Victorian poetry The Victorian era was a period of great political, social and economic change. The Empire recovered from the loss of the American colonies and entered a period of rapid expansion. This expansion, combined with increasing industrialisation and mechanisation, led to a prolonged period of economic growth. The Reform Act 1832 was the beginning of a process that would eventually lead to universal suffrage. John Clare Elizabeth Barrett Browning The major Victorian poets were John Clare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Matthew Arnold, Christina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and Gerard Manley Hopkins, though Hopkins was not published until 1918. John Clare came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption. His biographer Jonathan Bate states that Clare was \\"the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self\\". Tennyson was, to some degree, the Spenser of the new age and his Idylls of the Kings can be read as a Victorian version of The Faerie Queen, that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire. The Brownings spent much of their time out of England and explored European models and matter in much of their poetry. Robert Browning's great innovation was the dramatic monologue, which he used to its full extent in his long novel in verse, The Ring and the Book. Elizabeth Barrett Browning is perhaps best remembered for Sonnets from the Portuguese but her long poem Aurora Leigh is one of the classics of 19th century feminist literature. Matthew Arnold was much influenced by Wordsworth, though his poem Dover Beach is often considered a precursor of the modernist revolution. Hopkins wrote in relative obscurity and his work was not published until after his death. His unusual style (involving what he called \\"sprung rhythm\\" and heavy reliance on rhyme and alliteration) had a considerable influence on many of the poets of the 1940s. =Pre-Raphaelites= Dante Gabriel Rossetti: selfportrait The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was a mid-19th century arts movement dedicated to the reform of what they considered the sloppy Mannerist painting of the day. Although primarily concerned with the visual arts, a member of the inner circle, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a poet of some ability, whilst his sister Christina Rossetti is generally considered a greater poet, whose contribution to Victorian Poetry is of a standard equal to that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Rossettis' poetry shares many of the concerns of the Pre-Raphaelite movement: an interest in Medieval models, an almost obsessive attention to visual detail and an occasional tendency to lapse into whimsy. Dante Rossetti worked with, and had some influence on, the leading arts and crafts painter and poet William Morris. Morris shared the Pre-Raphaelite interest in the poetry of the European Middle Ages, to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work. =1890s: fin-de-si√®cle= Towards the end of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French symbolism and Victorian poetry entered a decadent fin de si√®cle phase. Two groups of poets emerged, the Yellow Book poets who adhered to the tenets of Aestheticism, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Symons and the Rhymers' Club group that included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson and William Butler Yeats. =Comic verse= Comic verse abounded in the Victorian era. Magazines such as Punch and Fun magazine teemed with humorous inventionSpielmann, M. H. The History of \\"Punch\\", from Project Gutenberg and were aimed at a well-educated readership.Vann, J. Don. \\"Comic Periodicals\\", Victorian Periodicals & Victorian Society (Aldershot: Scholar Press, 1994) The most famous collection of Victorian comic verse is the Bab Ballads.Stedman, Jane W. (1996). W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian & His Theatre, pp. 26‚Äì29. Oxford University Press. The 20th century =The first three decades= The Victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new. These were Yeats and Thomas Hardy. Yeats, although not a modernist, was to learn a lot from the new poetic movements that sprang up around him and adapted his writing to the new circumstances. Hardy was, in terms of technique at least, a more traditional figure and was to be a reference point for various anti-modernist reactions, especially from the 1950s onwards. A. E. Housman (1859 ‚Äì 1936) was poet who was born in the Victorian era and who first published in the 1890s, but who only really became known in the 20th century. Housman is best known for his cycle of poems A Shropshire Lad (1896). This collection was turned down by several publishers so that Housman published it himself, and the work only became popular when \\"the advent of war, first in the Boer War and then in World War I, gave the book widespread appeal due to its nostalgic depiction of brave English soldiers\\".Poetry.org The poems' wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and the fact that several early 20th-century composers set it to music helped its popularity. Housman published a further highly successful collection Last Poems in 1922 while a third volume, More Poems, was published posthumously in 1936. The Georgian poets and World War I Rudyard Kipling's If‚Äî (1895), often voted Britain's favourite poem.Emma Jones (2004) The Literary Companion Robson, 2004.Mike Robinson (2004) Literature and tourism The Georgian poets were the first major grouping of the post-Victorian era. Their work appeared in a series of five anthologies called Georgian Poetry which were published by Harold Monro and edited by Edward Marsh. The poets featured included Edmund Blunden, Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, D. H. Lawrence, Walter de la Mare and Siegfried Sassoon. Their poetry represented something of a reaction to the decadence of the 1890s and tended towards the sentimental. Brooke and Sassoon were to go on to win reputations as war poets and Lawrence quickly distanced himself from the group and was associated with the modernist movement. Graves distanced himself from the group as well and wrote poetry in accordance with a belief in a prehistoric muse he described as The White Goddess. Other notable poets who wrote about the war include Isaac Rosenberg, Edward Thomas, Wilfred Owen, May Cannan and, from the home front, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling is the author of the famous inspirational poem If‚Äî, which is an evocation of Victorian stoicism, as a traditional British virtue. Although many of these poets wrote socially-aware criticism of the war, most remained technically conservative and traditionalist. Modernism Among the foremost avant-garde writers were the American-born poets Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot, H.D. and Ezra Pound, each of whom spent an important part of their writing lives in England, France and Italy. Pound's involvement with the Imagists marked the beginning of a revolution in the way poetry was written. English poets involved with this group included D. H. Lawrence, Richard Aldington, T. E. Hulme, F. S. Flint, Ford Madox Ford, Allen Upward and John Cournos. Eliot, particularly after the publication of The Waste Land, became a major figure and influence on other English poets. In addition to these poets, other English modernists began to emerge. These included the London-Welsh poet and painter David Jones, whose first book, In Parenthesis, was one of the very few experimental poems to come out of World War I, the Scot Hugh MacDiarmid, Mina Loy and Basil Bunting. =The Thirties= The poets who began to emerge in the 1930s had two things in common; they had all been born too late to have any real experience of the pre-World War I world and they grew up in a period of social, economic and political turmoil. Perhaps as a consequence of these facts, themes of community, social (in)justice and war seem to dominate the poetry of the decade. The poetic space of the decade was dominated by four poets; W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice, although the last of these belongs at least as much to the history of Irish poetry. These poets were all, in their early days at least, politically active on the Left. Although they admired Eliot, they also represented a move away from the technical innovations of their modernist predecessors. A number of other, less enduring, poets also worked in the same vein. One of these was Michael Roberts, whose New Country anthology both introduced the group to a wider audience and gave them their name. The 1930s also saw the emergence of a home-grown English surrealist poetry whose main exponents were David Gascoyne, Hugh Sykes Davies, George Barker, and Philip O'Connor. These poets turned to French models rather than either the New Country poets or English-language modernism, and their works were a proof of the importance of later English experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the English avant-garde tradition. John Betjeman and Stevie Smith, who were two other significant poets of this period, who stood outside all schools and groups. Betjeman was a quietly ironic poet of Middle England, with a command of a wide range of verse techniques. Smith was an entirely unclassifiable one-off voice. =The Forties= The 1940s opened with the United Kingdom at war and a new generation of war poets emerged in response. These included Keith Douglas, Alun Lewis, Henry Reed and F. T. Prince. As with the poets of the First World War, the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry. Technically, many of these war poets owed something to the 1930s poets, but their work grew out of the particular circumstances in which they found themselves living and fighting. The main movement in post-war 1940s poetry was the New Romantic group that included Dylan Thomas, George Barker, W. S. Graham, Kathleen Raine, Henry Treece and J. F. Hendry. These writers saw themselves as in revolt against the classicism of the New Country poets. They turned to such models as Gerard Manley Hopkins, Arthur Rimbaud and Hart Crane and the word play of James Joyce. Thomas, in particular, helped Anglo-Welsh poetry to emerge as a recognisable force. Other significant poets to emerge in the 1940s include Lawrence Durrell, Bernard Spencer, Roy Fuller, Norman Nicholson, Vernon Watkins, R. S. Thomas and Norman MacCaig. These last four poets represent a trend towards regionalism and poets writing about their native areas; Watkins and Thomas in Wales, Nicholson in Cumberland and MacCaig in Scotland. =The Fifties= The 1950s were dominated by three groups of poets, The Movement, The Group, and poets clarified by the term Extremist Art, which was first used by the poet A. Alvarez to describe the work of the American poet Sylvia Plath. The Movement poets as a group came to public notice in Robert Conquest's 1955 anthology New Lines. The core of the group consisted of Philip Larkin, Elizabeth Jennings, D. J. Enright, Kingsley Amis, Thom Gunn and Donald Davie. They were identified with a hostility to modernism and internationalism, and looked to Hardy as a model. However, both Davie and Gunn later moved away from this position. As befits their name, the Group were much more formally a group of poets, meeting for weekly discussions under the chairmanship of Philip Hobsbaum and Edward Lucie- Smith. Other Group poets included Martin Bell, Peter Porter, Peter Redgrove, George MacBeth and David Wevill. Hobsbaum spent some time teaching in Belfast, where he was a formative influence on the emerging Northern Ireland poets including Seamus Heaney. Other poets associated with Extremist Art included Plath's one-time husband Ted Hughes, Francis Berry and Jon Silkin. These poets are sometimes compared with the Expressionist German school. A number of young poets working in what might be termed a modernist vein also started publishing during this decade. These included Charles Tomlinson, Gael Turnbull, Roy Fisher and Bob Cobbing. These poets can now be seen as forerunners of some of the major developments during the following two decades. =The 1960s and 1970s= In the early part of the 1960s, the centre of gravity of mainstream poetry moved to Northern Ireland, with the emergence of Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin, Paul Muldoon and others. In England, the most cohesive groupings can, in retrospect, be seen to cluster around what might loosely be called the modernist tradition and draw on American as well as indigenous models. The British Poetry Revival was a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces performance, sound and concrete poetry as well as the legacy of Pound, Jones, MacDiarmid, Loy and Bunting, the Objectivist poets, the Beats and the Black Mountain poets, among others. Leading poets associated with this movement include J. H. Prynne, Eric Mottram, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley and Lee Harwood. The Mersey Beat poets were Adrian Henri, Brian Patten and Roger McGough. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Although not actually a Mersey Beat poet, Adrian Mitchell is often associated with the group in critical discussion. Contemporary poet Steve Turner has also been compared with them. English poetry now Some consider the late Geoffrey Hill to have been the finest English poet of recent years.William Logan, \\"Stouthearted Men\\", The New Criterion, June 2004. The last three decades of the 20th century saw a number of short-lived poetic groupings, including the Martians, along with a general trend towards what has been termed 'Poeclectics',\\"Making Voices: Identity, Poeclectics and the Contemporary British Poet\\", New Writing, The International Journal for the Practice and Theory of Creative Writing; Volume 3 (1); pp 66‚Äì77. namely an intensification within individual poets' oeuvres of \\"all kinds of style, subject, voice, register and form\\". There has also been a growth in interest in women's writing, and in poetry from England's minorities, especially the West Indian community. Performance poetry including poetry slam continues to be active. Some poets who emerged in this period include Carol Ann Duffy, Andrew Motion, Craig Raine, Wendy Cope, James Fenton, Blake Morrison, Liz Lochhead, George Szirtes, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Benjamin Zephaniah. Mark Ford is an example of a poet influenced by New York School.Helen Vendler compared him with John Ashbery. There has been recent activity focused on poets in Bloodaxe Books' The New Poetry, including Simon Armitage, Kathleen Jamie, Glyn Maxwell, Selima Hill, Maggie Hannan, Michael Hofmann and Peter Reading. The New Generation movement flowered in the 1990s and early 2000s, producing poets such as Don Paterson, Julia Copus, John Stammers, Jacob Polley, David Morley and Alice Oswald. A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley.Don Paterson, \\"The Dark Art of Poetry\\": T.S. Eliot Lecture, 9 November 2004: \\"Geniune talents such as, say, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley, working recognisably within the English and European lyric traditions, are drowned by the chorus of articulate but fundamentally talentless poet- commentators\\". Important independent and experimental poetry pamphlet publishers include Barque, Flarestack, Knives, Forks and Spoons Press, Penned in the Margins, Heaventree (founded in 2002 but no longer publishing) and Perdika Press. Throughout this period, and to the present, independent poetry presses such as Enitharmon have continued to promote original work from (among others) Dannie Abse, Martyn Crucefix and Jane Duran.

It is remembered for the one model it produced ‚Äî the stainless steel DeLorean sports car featuring gull-wing doors‚Äîand for its brief and turbulent history, ending in receivership and bankruptcy in 1982. In October 1982, John DeLorean was videotaped in a sting operation agreeing to bankroll drug trafficking, but was acquitted on the basis of entrapment. The DeLorean was memorably featured in the Back to the Future movie trilogy (1985, 1989 & 1990) as the model of car made into a time machine by eccentric scientist Doc Brown, although the company had closed down before the first movie was made. In 1995, Liverpool- born mechanic Stephen Wynne founded the current DeLorean Motor Company located in Humble, Texas and shortly thereafter acquired the remaining parts inventory and the stylized \\"DMC\\" logo trademark of DeLorean Motor Company.DeLorean Motor Company Home. History =Beginning= John DeLorean founded the DeLorean Motor Company in Detroit, Michigan on October 24, 1975. He was already well known in the automobile industry as a capable engineer, business innovator, and youngest person to become a General Motors (GM) executive. Investment capital came primarily in the form of business loans from Bank of America and from the formation of partnerships and private investment from select parties, including The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson and entertainers Roy Clark and Sammy Davis, Jr.. Capital was also raised through a dealer investment program in which those dealerships offering DeLorean's cars for sale were made shareholders in the company. DeLorean also sought lucrative incentives from various government and economic organizations to pay for constructing the company's automobile manufacturing facilities. To gain these, he looked to build his first factory in a country or area where unemployment was particularly high. One candidate was the Republic of Ireland, although that state's then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Desmond O'Malley, TD, decided not to support the project. A deal in Puerto Rico was about to be agreed when DeLorean took up a last-minute offer from the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland (the IDB). Besides taking some early seed capital from Hollywood stars Sammy Davis Jr. and Johnny Carson, DeLorean Motor Company relied on the British Government for about $120 million of its $200 million startup costs according to the newspaper The Times. The British Government was very keen to create jobs in Northern Ireland to reduce sectarian violence by reducing unemployment. As part of this offer, DeLorean was apparently under the impression that the British Government would provide his company with Export Credit financing. This would provide a loan of 80% of the wholesale cost of the vehicles (US$20,000) upon completion and delivery for shipping. =Manufacturing facility= In October 1978, construction of the six- building, 660,000 ft¬≤ (61,000 m¬≤) manufacturing plant began in Northern Ireland. It was designed and managed by Brodie & Hawthorn Architects of Belfast, and constructed in 16 months by Farrans, McLaughlin & Harvey. Officially known as DMCL (DeLorean Motor Cars, Ltd.), the facility was located in The Cutts in Dunmurry, a suburb on the south-western edge of Belfast. Unit production was scheduled to begin in 1979, but engineering delays and budget overruns caused the assembly lines to start only in early 1981. Workers at the factory were generally inexperienced; many never had jobs before joining DMC. This may have contributed to the reported quality issues attributed to the early production vehicles and the subsequent establishment of Quality Assurance Centers (QAC) located at various delivery locations. QACs were set up in California, New Jersey and Michigan where some of the quality issues were to be addressed and resolved before delivery to dealerships. Some of the issues related to the fitting of body panels, higher-output alternators, and gullwing door adjustments. The combined efforts of quality assurance improvements at the factory and the post-production quality assurance done at the QACs were generally successful, although workmanship complaints would still occasionally arise; the 1981 DeLoreans were delivered with a 12-month, warranty. By 1982, improvements in components and the more experienced workforce meant that production quality was vastly improved. Disputes between dealerships and customers arose later because many dealerships refused to do warranty work because they were not reimbursed. =Downturn and bankruptcy= The lack of demand, cost overruns, and unfavorable exchange rates began to take their toll on DMC's cash flow in late 1981. The company had estimated its break-even point to be between 10,000 and 12,000 units, but sales were only around 6,000. In response to the income shortfall, a restructuring plan was devised where a new \\"DeLorean Motors Holding Company\\" would be formed, which in turn would have become corporate parent to DMC and each of its subsidiaries: DeLorean Motor Cars Limited (manufacturer), DeLorean Motor Cars of America (distributor in the U.S.) and DeLorean Research Partnership (a research and development company). In January 1982, due to United States Securities and Exchange Commission questions about the company's viability, the company was forced to cancel the stock issue for the holding company that DeLorean had hoped would raise about $27 million. John DeLorean then lobbied the British government for aid, but was refused unless he was able to find a matching amount from other investors. What followed is a matter of debate between the British government, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, DeLorean, his investors, and the US court system. At some point in 1982, John DeLorean became the target of an FBI sting operation designed to arrest drug traffickers. He was arrested in October 1982 and charged with conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the US. The key element of evidence for the prosecution was a videotape showing DeLorean discussing the drugs deal with undercover FBI agents Benedict (Ben) Tisa and West, although DeLorean's attorney Howard Weitzman successfully demonstrated to the court that he was coerced into participation in the deal by the agents who initially approached him as legitimate investors. He was acquitted of all charges, but his reputation was forever tarnished. After his trial and subsequent acquittal, DeLorean quipped, \\"Would you buy a used car from me?\\" In the end, sufficient funds could not be raised to keep the company alive. DMC went bankrupt in 1982, taking with it 2,500 jobs and over $100 million in investments. The British government attempted to revive some usable remnants of the manufacturing facility without success, and the Dunmurry factory was closed. DeLorean himself retired in New Jersey, and the dream with which he had mesmerized Britain's Labour government, of industry rising out of the ashes of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, was shattered. He claimed that the DMCL was deliberately closed for political reasons, and at the time of closing was a solidly viable company with millions of dollars in the bank and two years of dealer orders on the books. Approximately 9,000 cars were made between January 1981 and December 1982, although actual production figures are unclear and estimates differ. Some of the cars manufactured in 1982, but not shipped to the states (as the US arm of DMC had no money to 'buy' the cars from the factory in Northern Ireland), with 15XXX and 16XXX Vehicle Identification Numbers are actually 1982 models that were given later VINs, dated 1983, by Consolidated International (now known as Big Lots), a company that had a buyback program with DMC and had bought out the remaining unsold cars and also the inventory of unused parts left in the factory after the bankruptcy. The DeLorean assembly plant was eventually occupied by the French automotive supplier Montupet, which began to manufacture cast aluminium cylinder heads automobile engines at the Dunmurry facility in 1989. As of Monputet's acquisition in 2015, the factory employed more than 600 people. The facility is currently operated as Montupet UK, a subsidiary of Linamar Corporation. Vehicles =Production vehicles= DeLorean DeLorean with gull-wing doors open. The DeLorean was the only car put into production by DMC. Reception by the car-buying public and automotive magazines was mixed. Although the early vehicles had impressive waiting lists of anxious consumers, the MSRP of $25,000; this is equivalent to approximately US$ in was cost- prohibitive for the majority of the market ‚Äî especially for what many considered to be an under-powered and impractical plaything. \\"It's not a barn burner,\\" observed Road & Track, \\"(with) a 0-60 mph time of 10.5 seconds. Frankly, that's not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category.\\" The stainless steel body panels were an attractive design concept and impervious to corrosion, but in practice the sheen surface tended to show fingerprints. It also meant that the car could not be easily painted; every factory original DeLorean looked virtually identical. Some dealerships painted their cars on delivery to help make theirs more distinctive. DMC was testing the use of translucent paint to help provide different color options on the cars while also allowing the stainless steel grain to show through, but no cars were sold with factory painted body panels. The only factory option initially available was an automatic transmission. A grey interior was offered later in 1981 as an alternative to the standard black interior. Several accessories including pinstriping and luggage racks helped provide further individuality.Misc. Information / Pictures. A DeLorean was prominently featured in the 1985 film Back to the Future and its two sequels, in which it was converted by the character Dr. Emmett Brown into a time machine; the DeLorean time machine entered popular culture as a result and played a major role in the continuing popularity of the model. =Concepts= DMC-24 A stretched version of the DeLorean, the DMC-24 would have been a 4-seater sedan version. It would retain the shape and gull-wing doors of the DeLorean. Several designs were drafted. One design, a 2-door, had the doors and cabin would have been stretched to allow rear entry and rear seating. Another design had a separate set of rear doors. The 4-door design had a rolling mock-up produced by ItalDesign, and based on the Lancia Medusa concept car. The bill for the ItalDesign version was not paid by DMC, and ItalDesign went on to modify it to become the Lamborghini Marco Polo. DMC-44 A DMC utility vehicle, the DMC-44, was mooted by the company. A prototype was produced of this tubular steel frame vehicle. The company went on to produce a promotional video to try to attract investors in the project. There would have been two versions, one a dedicated off-roader, and the second also road legal. DMC-80 A DMC bus, the DMC-80, was mooted by the company in the fall of 1981, with a variety of 6-cylinder engines and transmissions. The company went on to produce a promotional brochure for public transit corporations. The bus would have been an Americanized German low-floor bus, and be produced in the United States.  Today  A large number of the original cars are still on the road after over 30 years; most estimates put it at 6,500 cars surviving out of just over 9,000 built. There is an active enthusiast community around the cars, with strong owners' clubs. A number of businesses were set up after the demise of DMC to provide parts and service, and most of those are still in existence. In particular, DMC (based in Humble, Texas), operates under entirely new ownership and with no direct ties to the original DeLorean Motor Company. It purchased the parts surplus from Consolidated International and offers aftermarket parts to replace exhausted stock. Many aftermarket improvements have been offered over time to address some of the flaws in the original production cars, and to improve performance. A common opinion of the car is that in stock form it is somewhat underpowered, and a variety of solutions have been implemented, from complete engine swaps (either to a larger PRV engine, or to completely different engines such as the Cadillac Northstar engine), turbocharger kits (single or twin-turbo), down to simpler solutions such as improved exhausts and other normal engine tuning work.

DeLorean managed development of a number of vehicles throughout his career, including the Pontiac GTO muscle car, the Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Cosworth Vega, and the DMC DeLorean sports car, which was featured in the 1985 film Back to the Future. He was the youngest division head in General Motors history, then broke away to start the DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) in 1973. However, production delays meant that DMC's first car did not reach the consumer market until 1981, where a depressed buying market was compounded by lukewarm reviews from critics and the public. After a year, the DeLorean had failed to recoup its $175 million in investment costs, unsold cars were accumulating, and the company was in dire financial straits. In October 1982, DeLorean was charged with cocaine trafficking after FBI informant James Hoffman solicited him as financier in a scheme to sell of cocaine worth approximately $24 million. DMC was insolvent at the time and in debt for $17 million. Hoffman had approached DeLorean, a man whom he barely knew with no prior criminal record, and DeLorean was able to successfully defend himself at trial under the procedural defense of police entrapment. The trial ended in a not guilty verdict in August 1984, by which time DMC had declared bankruptcy and shut down. Early life DeLorean was born on January 6, 1925, in Detroit, Michigan, the eldest of four sons of Zachary and Kathryn (n√©e Pribak) DeLorean. DeLorean's father was Romanian, born in Sug√°g village, Als√≥-Feh√©r County, Austria-Hungary (currently »òugag, Alba County, Romania), who worked in a mill factory; Zachary emigrated to the United States when he was twenty. He spent time in Montana and Gary, Indiana, before moving to Michigan. By the time John was born, Zachary had found employment as a union organizer at the Ford Motor Company factory in nearby Highland Park. His poor English skills and lack of education prevented him from higher-paid work. When not required at Ford, he occasionally worked as a carpenter. DeLorean's mother was a fellow Hungarian citizen of Hungarian origin.https://longreads.com/2014/11/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-john- delorean/https://dyler.com/posts/16/j-delorean-s-story-one-of-the-most- colourful-chapters-in-automotive-historyhttps://autopro.hu/gyartok/film- keszul-az-amerikai-autogyarto-orias-magyar-vezererol/214153 She was employed at the Carboloy Products Division of General Electric throughout much of DeLorean's early life. She took work wherever she could to supplement the family's income. She generally tolerated certain intermittent episodes of erratic behavior by her husband, but during several of the worst times of Zachary's violent tendencies, she took her sons to live with her sister in Los Angeles, California, where they stayed for a year or so at a time. DeLorean's parents divorced in 1942. John subsequently saw little of his father, who moved into a boarding house, becoming a solitary and estranged drug addict. Education DeLorean attended Detroit's public grade schools and was then accepted into Cass Technical High School, a technical high school for Detroit's honor students, where he signed up for the electrical curriculum. DeLorean found the Cass experience exhilarating, and he excelled at his studies. His academic record and musical talents earned him a scholarship at Lawrence Institute of Technology in the Detroit suburb of Highland Park (today known as Lawrence Technological University and located in Southfield). The small college was the alma mater of some of the automobile industry's best engineers. At Lawrence, he excelled in the study of industrial engineering and was elected to the school's honor society. World War II interrupted his studies. In 1943, DeLorean was drafted for military service and served three years in the U.S. Army and received an honorable discharge. He returned to Detroit to find his mother and siblings in economic difficulty. He worked as a draftsman for the Public Lighting Commission for a year and a half to improve his family's financial status, then returned to Lawrence to finish his degree. While back in college, he worked part-time at Chrysler and at a local body shop, foreshadowing his later contributions to the automotive industry. DeLorean graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering. Instead of immediately entering the engineering workforce after earning his degree, DeLorean sold life insurance. He developed an analytical system aimed at engineers and sold \\"about $850,000 worth of policies in ten months\\". However, he found the work boring and moved on to work for the Factory Equipment Corporation. DeLorean states in his autobiography that he sold life insurance to improve his communication skills. Both endeavors were successful financially, but these areas held little interest for DeLorean. A foreman at Chrysler's engineering garage recommended that DeLorean apply for work at Chrysler and DeLorean agreed. Chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility named the Chrysler Institute of Engineering, which allowed DeLorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering. He briefly attended the Detroit College of Law, but did not graduate. In 1952, DeLorean graduated from the Chrysler Institute with a master's degree in Automotive Engineering and joined Chrysler's engineering team. DeLorean attended night classes at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business to earn credits for his MBA degree, which he completed in 1957. Career =Packard Motor Company= DeLorean's time at Chrysler lasted less than a year, ending in 1953 when he was offered a salary of US$14,000 () at Packard Motor Company under the supervision of the engineer Forest McFarland. DeLorean quickly gained the attention of his new employer with an improvement to the Ultramatic automatic transmission, giving it an improved torque converter and dual drive ranges; it was launched as the \\"Twin- Ultramatic\\". Packard was experiencing financial difficulties when DeLorean joined, because of the changing post-World War II automotive market. While Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler had begun producing affordable mainstream products designed to cater to the rising postwar middle class, Packard clung to their pre-World War II era notions of high-end, precisely engineered luxury cars. This exclusive philosophy was to take its toll on profitability. However, it proved to have a positive effect on DeLorean's attention to engineering detail, and after four years at Packard he became McFarland's successor as head of research and development. While still a profitable company, Packard suffered alongside other independents as it struggled to compete when Ford and General Motors engaged in a price war. James Nance, president of Packard, decided to merge the company with Studebaker Corporation in 1954. A subsequent proposed merger with American Motors Corporation (AMC) never passed the discussion phase. DeLorean considered keeping his job and moving to Studebaker headquarters in South Bend, Indiana, when he received a call from Oliver K. Kelley, vice president of engineering at General Motors, a man whom DeLorean greatly admired. Kelley called to offer DeLorean his choice of a job in any of five divisions of GM. =General Motors= Pontiac In 1956, DeLorean accepted a salary offer of US$16,000 () with a bonus program, choosing to work at GM's Pontiac division as an assistant to chief engineer Pete Estes and general manager Semon \\"Bunkie\\" Knudsen. Knudsen was the son of the former president of GM, William Knudsen, who was called away from his post to head the war mobilization production effort at the request of President Roosevelt. Knudsen was also an MIT engineering graduate, and at 42 he was the youngest man to head a division of GM. DeLorean and Knudsen quickly became close friends, and DeLorean eventually cited Knudsen as a major influence and mentor. DeLorean's years of engineering at Pontiac were successful, producing dozens of patented innovations for the company, and in 1961 he was promoted to the position of division chief engineer. DeLorean's best-known contribution to Pontiac was the Pontiac GTO DeLorean's most notable contribution to Pontiac was the Pontiac GTO (Gran Turismo Omologato), a muscle car named after the Ferrari 250 GTO. The Pontiac brand reached third place in total annual industry sales in the United States as a slightly bigger Chevrolet. To highlight a performance emphasis of the brand, the GTO debuted as a Tempest/LeMans option package with a larger, more powerful engine in 1964. This marked the beginning of Pontiac's renaissance as GM's performance division instead of its previous position with no clear brand identity. The car and its popularity continued to grow in the following years. DeLorean received almost total credit for its success ‚Äì conceptualizing, engineering, and marketing ‚Äì becoming the golden boy of Pontiac, and was rewarded with his 1965 promotion to head the entire Pontiac division. At the age of 40, DeLorean had broken the record for youngest division head at GM and was determined to continue his string of successes. Adapting to the frustrations that he perceived in the executive offices was a difficult transition for him. DeLorean believed there was an undue amount of infighting at GM between division heads, and several of Pontiac's advertising campaign themes met with internal resistance, such as the \\"Tiger\\" campaign used to promote the GTO and other Pontiac models in 1965 and 1966. In addition, there was Ed Cole's decision to ban multiple carburetors, a method of enhancing engine performance used by Pontiac since 1956, starting with two 4-barrel carburetors (\\"2x4 bbl.\\") and Tri-Power (three 2-barrel carburetors (\\"3x2 bbl.\\")) since 1957. In response to the \\"pony car\\" market dominated by the wildly successful Ford Mustang, DeLorean asked GM executives for permission to market a smaller version of the Pontiac Banshee show car for 1966. DeLorean's version was rejected because of GM's concern that his design would take away sales from the Corvette, their flagship performance vehicle. Their focus was on the new Camaro design. Pontiac developed its version, and the Firebird was introduced for the 1967 model year. Shortly after the Firebird's introduction, DeLorean turned his attention to development of an all-new Grand Prix, the division's personal luxury car based on the full-sized Pontiac line since 1962. Sales were sagging by this time, however, but the 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized Pontiac A-body (Tempest, LeMans, GTO). DeLorean knew Pontiac Division couldn't finance the new car alone, so he went to his former boss Pete Estes and asked to share the cost of development with Pontiac, having a one-year exclusivity before Chevrolet would release the 1970 Monte Carlo. The deal was done. The 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix featured sharp bodylines and a hood. The interior included a wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, bucket seats and center console. The new model offered a sportier, high performance, somewhat smaller, and lower-priced alternative to the other personal luxury cars then on the market, such as the Ford Thunderbird, Buick Riviera, Lincoln Continental Mark III, and Oldsmobile Toronado. The 1969, Grand Prix production ended up at over 112,000 units, far higher than the 32,000 1968 Grand Prix units built from the full-sized Pontiac body. During his time at Pontiac, DeLorean had begun to enjoy the freedom and celebrity that came with his position and spent a good deal of his time traveling to locations around the world to support promotional events. His frequent public appearances helped to solidify his image as a \\"rebel\\" corporate businessman with his trendy dress style and casual banter. Even as General Motors experienced revenue declines, Pontiac remained highly profitable under DeLorean, and despite his growing reputation as a corporate maverick, on February 15, 1969, he was again promoted. This time it was to head up the prestigious Chevrolet division, General Motors' flagship marque. Chevrolet The 1970 Chevrolet Nova was released behind schedule under DeLorean's leadership of GM's Chevrolet division. By this time, DeLorean earned an annual salary of US$200,000 (), with yearly bonuses of up to US$400,000 (). He was ubiquitous in popular culture. At a time when business executives were typically conservative, low-key individuals in three-piece suits, DeLorean wore long sideburns and unbuttoned shirts. He invited Ford president Lee Iacocca to serve as best man at his second wedding. DeLorean was a limited partner in a pair of American professional sports franchises. The first was the San Diego Chargers, as part of a syndicate led by Gene Klein and Sam Schulman that bought controlling interest for $10 million in August 1966. The other was the New York Yankees, of which he was one of fifteen investors led by George Steinbrenner and Michael Burke, who completed the purchase from CBS for $10 million on January 3, 1973.New York Yankees 1973 Yearbook. DeLorean continued his jet-setting lifestyle and was often seen hanging out in business and entertainment celebrity circles. He became friends with James T. Aubrey, president of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and was introduced to celebrities such as financier Kirk Kerkorian, Chris-Craft chairman Herb Siegel, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., and The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson. The executive offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity. When he was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a manager in that position to sort things out. The new model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova. He used the extra time to streamline Chevrolet's production overhead and reduce assembly costs. By 1971, Chevrolet was experiencing record sales in excess of 3 million vehicles, and his division alone was nearly matching that of the entire Ford Motor Company. John DeLorean and the Chevrolet Vega in 1970 The Vega was assigned to Chevrolet by corporate management, specifically by GM president Ed Cole, just weeks before DeLorean's 1969 arrival as Chevrolet division's general manager. In a Motor Trend interview in August 1970, DeLorean said, \\"Vega will be the highest quality product ever built by Chevrolet.\\"Motor Trend-August 1970. By DeLorean's orders, dozens of extra inspectors were assigned to the Vega assembly line and the first two thousand cars were road tested. He stated, \\"The first cars, from a manufacturing standpoint, were well built.\\" But in 1972, General Motors Assembly Division (GMAD) took over the Chevrolet Lordstown assembly plant and adjoining Fisher body plant. Their main goal was to cut costs and more than 800 workers were laid off, many of whom were additional inspectors. This led to assembly-line vandalism, with workers intentionally slowing the line, leaving off parts and installing others improperly. Incomplete and often non-functioning cars soon filled the factory lot, which then had to be reprocessed and repaired by a team assigned to this task by DeLorean. A one-month strike followed, and dealers did not receive enough cars for the demand in 1972. DeLorean regrouped for the 1973 model year with Vega sales of 395,792. The one millionth Vega was built in May 1973, a month after DeLorean's GM resignation.Hot Rod, December 1973. Rodden at Random In 1972, DeLorean was appointed to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press, \\"I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted.\\" However, it had been rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean took over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford II. GM was a major contributor to the group and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, as well as objecting to the idea of using rebates to sell cars: > \\"There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants > today...A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the > showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars > they're not interested in.\\" =DeLorean Motor Company= DMC DeLorean DeLorean and the prototype of the DMC DeLorean, 1980 DeLorean left General Motors in 1973 to form his own company, the DeLorean Motor Company. A two-seat sports car prototype was shown in the mid-1970s called the DeLorean Safety Vehicle (DSV), with its bodyshell designed by Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro. The car entered into production as the DeLorean. The car's body distinctively used stainless steel and featured gull-wing doors. It was powered by the \\"Douvrin\\" V6 engine developed by Peugeot, Renault, and Volvo (known as the PRV). The manufacturing plant to build the new car was built in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland, with substantial financial incentives from the Northern Ireland Development Agency of around ¬£100 million. Renault was contracted to build the factory, which employed over 2,000 workers at its peak production. The engine was made by Renault, while Lotus designed the chassis and bodywork details. The Dunmurry factory eventually turned out around 9,000 cars during 21 months of operation. In 1980, an American Express catalog featured an ad for a DeLorean plated in 24-karat gold. According to the ad, only 100 were going to be manufactured and sold for $85,000. In total, only 4 were actually purchased. Production delays meant the DeLorean did not reach the consumer market until January 1981 (nearly a decade after the company was founded), and in the interim the new car market had slumped considerably due to the 1980 US economic recession. This was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public, who generally felt the uniqueness of the DeLorean's styling did not compensate for the higher price and lower horsepower relative to other sport coupes on the market. While interest in the DeLorean quickly dwindled, competing models with lower price tags and more powerful engines (such as the Chevrolet Corvette) sold in record numbers during 1980-81 in spite of the ongoing recession. By February 1982, more than half of the roughly 7,000 DeLoreans produced remained unsold, DMC was US$175 million in debt, and the Dunmurry factory was placed in receivership. After going into receivership in February 1982, DMC produced another 2,000 cars until John DeLorean's arrest in late October, at which point liquidation proceedings were undertaken and the factory was seized by the British government for good.  1979 book about General Motors  After DeLorean left General Motors, Patrick Wright, author and former Business Week reporter, approached him with the idea of writing a book based on his experiences there. DeLorean agreed to dictate his recollections for Wright, who wrote the book. The final product, published in 1979, On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors, sold approximately 1.6 million copies, but disagreements over the content led to a conflict between the collaborators, with Wright eventually publishing the book on his own. Arrest and trial On October 19, 1982, DeLorean was charged by the US government with trafficking cocaine following a videotaped sting operation in which he was recorded by undercover federal agents agreeing to bankroll a cocaine smuggling operation. The FBI set him up with more than of cocaine (worth about US$6.5 million) in a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated DeLorean was the \\"financier\\" to help the financially declining company in a scheme to sell , with an estimated value of US$24 million. The government was tipped off to DeLorean by confidential informant James Timothy Hoffman, a former neighbor, who reported to his FBI superiors that DeLorean had approached him to ask about setting up a cocaine deal; in truth, Hoffman had called DeLorean and suggested the deal (which DeLorean then accepted) as part of Hoffman's efforts to receive a reduced sentence for a 1981 federal cocaine trafficking charge on which he was awaiting trial. Hoffman (whose name was redacted on the original indictment) also stated that he was aware of DeLorean's financial troubles before he contacted him, and had heard him admit that he needed US$17 million \\"in a hurry\\" to prevent DMC's imminent insolvency. Taken together, these two elements allowed DeLorean to successfully defend himself at trial with the procedural defense of police entrapment. DeLorean's lawyers successfully argued that the FBI and DEA had unfairly targeted and illegally entrapped DeLorean when they allowed Hoffman (an active FBI informant who only knew DeLorean casually) to randomly solicit DeLorean into a criminal conspiracy simply because he was known to be financially vulnerable. Another factor was DeLorean's lack of criminal history, whereas Hoffman was a career criminal who stood to directly benefit if he was able to convince DeLorean to incriminate himself on tape. The DeLorean defense team called one witness, Carol Winkler, DeLorean's Administrative Assistant. Her call log proved that Hoffman made the initial call. DeLorean was found not guilty on August 16, 1984, but by then DMC had already collapsed into bankruptcy and DeLorean's reputation as a businessman was irrevocably tarnished. When asked after his acquittal if he planned to resume his career in the auto industry, DeLorean bitterly quipped, \\"Would you buy a used car from me?\\"Harris, J., p. 101 On September 21, 1985, DeLorean was indicted on charges he defrauded investors and committed tax evasion by diverting millions of dollars raised for the company to himself. He was acquitted of all charges. Later enterprises On November 1, 1994, DeLorean filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office for a raised monorail transport. The transport was never built. In the years before his death, DeLorean planned to resurrect his car company and gave interviews describing a new vehicle called the DMC2. According to his family, he spent a lot of time in his last years working on this new venture. In an effort to gather funds, he designed and sold high-end watches via the Internet under the name DeLorean Time. The DeLorean Motor Company name was subsequently owned by a Texas-based firm that provided parts and professional restoration to DeLorean owners. Although John DeLorean was not involved in the business, its vice president James Espey spoke with him on the phone once a month. According to Espey, in their final conversation, DeLorean expressed his dismay at the direction of General Motors, saying \\"They have too many bean counters and not enough engineers.\\" Personal life DeLorean was married four times. He married Elizabeth Higgins on September 3, 1954; they divorced in 1969. He married Kelly Harmon on May 31, 1969, the sister of actor Mark Harmon and daughter of Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon and actress Elyse Knox; they divorced in 1972. DeLorean adopted a son whom he named Zachary Tavio, 14 months old at the time of his marriage to model Cristina Ferrare, who co-adopted Zachary. The Phoenix of Bel-Air: Since Her Divorce From a DeLorean, Cristina Has Become One Red-Hot Ferrare, LA Times by Dianne Klein, April 17, 1989 They had daughter Kathryn Ann, born November 15, 1977; they divorced in 1985. He then was married to Sally Baldwin who he had daughter Sheila Baldwin DeLorean with on February 19, 2002. He and Sally stayed married until his death in 2005. They lived in Morristown, New Jersey, having previously resided in Bedminster, New Jersey. DeLorean appeared in a magazine advertisement for Cutty Sark whisky the year before his arrest and the collapse of his company. It was captioned: \\"One out of every 100 new businesses succeeds. Here's to those who take the odds.\\" The film Back to the Future was released in 1985, featuring DeLorean's namesake car, and DeLorean wrote to writer and producer Bob Gale thanking him for immortalizing the car. In 1999, DeLorean declared personal bankruptcy after fighting some 40 legal cases following the collapse of DeLorean Motor Company. He was forced to sell his estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2000. Donald Trump bought it and converted to a golf course. DeLorean moved to a condominium in Morristown, New Jersey where he lived until his death five years later. According to his autobiography, both DeLorean and former wife Cristina Ferrare became born-again Christians following the entrapment controversy. Death DeLorean died at Overlook Hospital in Summit, New Jersey, from a stroke, on March 19, 2005 at the age of 80. His ashes are interred at the White Chapel Cemetery, in Troy, Michigan. His tombstone shows a depiction of his DeLorean sports car with the gull-wing doors open.

The River Corrib or Galway River connects the lake to the sea at Galway. It is the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland and the second largest on the island of Ireland (after Lough Neagh). It covers 176 km¬≤ and lies mostly in County Galway with a small area of its northeast corner in County Mayo. The first canal on the island of Ireland was cut in the 12th century. Known as the Friar's Cut, it allowed boats to pass from Lough Corrib to the sea at Galway. Lough Corrib was designated a Ramsar site on 16 June 1996. It has also been designated a Special Area of Conservation.  Name  Loch Coirib is a corruption of Loch Oirbsean. According to placename lore, this refers to Oirbsen or Oirbsiu‚Äîanother name for the Tuatha D√© Danann figure Manann√°n mac Lir‚Äîwho is believed to have been a god of the sea. In Irish the lough is also called An Choirib (\\"the Corrib\\").  Marine archaeology and charts  Surveys have been undertaken since 2007 by a local surveyor/cartographer to create up to date charts of Lough Corrib.http://www.anglingcharts.com These have uncovered a number of objects of historical significance which have been investigated by the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the National Monuments Service.The Underwater Archeology Unit and Ireland‚Äôs Submerged Cultural Resource National Monuments Service These include Bronze Age and Iron Age vessels (Dugout canoes), the \\"Annaghkeen Boat\\" being 40 ft in length and intricately carved, the \\"Carrowmoreknock Boat\\" a well preserved 10th century vessel carrying three Viking battle axes,http://www.anglingcharts.com/corribwrecks/thecarrowmoreknockboat.html and the wreck of a Victorian pleasure yacht. The lake is hence of international importance as a marine archaeological site. All historic wrecks in the lough are protected and a licence to dive them is required from the National Monuments Service.  Wildlife  The wildlife in Lough Corrib includes birds and hawks, otters, mink, stoat, frogs, and bats. Lough Corrib can be divided into two parts: a smaller shallower basin to the south and a larger deeper basin to the north. These two parts are connected by a narrow channel. In the southern and eastern parts of the lake, the lake bed is dominated by limestone bedrock covered by deposits of precipitated marl. The surrounding land is mostly pastoral farmland to the south and east and bog to the west and north. In addition to the lake basis, some areas of scientific interest adjoining the lake, e.g. woodland, callows grassland and raised bog, have been incorporated into the Special Area of Conservation.  Threats to ecology  A map taken from the Admiralty Chart made in 1846 In early 2007, large numbers of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium were detected in water from the lake, leading to contamination of the public water supply in Galway city and an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Another unwelcome visitor is the invasive species Lagarosiphon major (also known as 'curly-leaved waterweed' or 'South African pondweed') which is destroying fish habitat and the zebra mussel. = Cryptosporidium outbreak = On 21 March 2007, Cryptosporidium was confirmed to be present in the drinking water of Galway City, Moycullen, Oughterard and Headford, which had been instructed six days earlier to boil their water before drinking. The water taken from Lough Corrib was likely contaminated by migration of animal and human faeces. Controversy emerged when it was revealed that funds previously earmarked to improve Galway's water system had not been spent. Dick Roche, the Minister of the Environment, later announced allocation of additional funds to tackle the issue. Measures included upgrading existing water treatment and filtration systems, as well as the projected importing of water from nearby Luimnagh, Tuam, County Galway. This plant at Luimnagh has facilities for Cryptosporidium eradication and filtration. The Community Care Organisation, Cope, delivered bottled water to their elderly clients from 30 March 2007. A lobby group was formed in April 2007 to highlight the issue.  Islands  Minor islands in Lough Corrib While Lough Corrib is reputed to have 365 islands, a recent figure from the creator of the charts of the lake is 1,327.http://www.anglingcharts.com/charts/newcorribcharts.html These islands include Inchagoil Island, midway between Cong and Oughterard. It is one of the largest of the wooded islands along Lough Corrib. The island has views of the Maumturk range, Joyce Country and the mountains of Connemara. There are some beaches and woods with walks around the island. There is evidence of an early monastic settlement, and two churches - Saint Patrick's and the 12th century church known as the \\"saints\\" church. St. Brendan of Clonfert is also said to have spent some time on an island in this lake after returning from his travels in Britain. There are several paths around the island, an old cemetery and remains of four or five cottages which housed the few inhabitants. Another lake island is Caislean-na-Circe, between Maam and Doon. This section of Lough Corrib is free from islands except for the rock on which the ancient Hen's Castle of the O'Connor's and the O'Flaherty's stands. The castle was home of the pirate Queen Gr√°inne O'Malley, who lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth I of England. In 1225, the Lord Justice caused Odo O'Flatherty to give up Kirk Castle to Odo O'Connor, King of Connaught; for assurance of his fidelity. Cruises on the lough depart from Cong, Ashford Castle, Galway City, and Oughterard. Influence on writers William Wilde, father of Oscar Wilde, wrote a book about the lake, Lough Corrib, its Shores and Islands (1867). He built a summerhouse on the banks of the lake, called Moytura House. The Irish Times states that \\"the unspoilt countryside around Lough Corrib provided the inspiration\\" for The Hounds of the Morrigan, a children's novel by Pat O'Shea.

He was the father of Oscar Wilde. Early life and career Sketch of William Wilde by J.H. Maguire, 1847 William Wilde was born at Kilkeevin, near Castlerea, in County Roscommon, the youngest of the three sons and two daughters of a prominent local medical practitioner, Thomas Wills Wilde, and his wife, Amelia Flynne (d. c.1844),McGeachie, James (2004) 'Wilde, Sir William Robert Wills (1815‚Äì1876)' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. and received his initial education at the Elphin Diocesan School in Elphin, County Roscommon. In 1832, Wilde was bound as an apprentice to Abraham Colles, the pre-eminent Irish surgeon of the day, at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin. He was also taught by the surgeons James Cusack and Sir Philip Crampton and the physician Sir Henry Marsh. Wilde also studied at the private and highly respected school of anatomy, medicine, and surgery in Park Street (later Lincoln Place), Dublin. In 1837, he earned his medical degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In the same year, Wilde embarked on an eight-month-cruise to the Holy Land with a recovering patient, visiting various cities and islands throughout the Mediterranean. Porpoises were flung on board the ship, Crusader, and Wilde dissected them. Taking notes, he eventually composed a two-volume book on the nursing habits of the creatures.Belford, Barbara (2000) Oscar Wilde: A Certain Genius, Random House, Inc. Among the places he visited on this tour was Egypt. In a tomb he found the mummified remains of a dwarf and salvaged the torso to bring back to Ireland. He also collected embalmed ibises. Once back in Ireland, Wilde published an article in the Dublin University Magazine suggesting that one of the \\"Cleopatra's Needles\\" be transported to England (eventually in 1878 one of the Needles was transported to London, and in 1880 the other one was brought to New York's Central Park). In 1873 he was awarded the Cunningham Gold Medal by the Royal Irish Academy. Recognition He ran his own hospital, St Mark's Ophthalmic Hospital for Diseases of the Eye and Ear, in Dublin and was appointed to serve as Oculist-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria. At one point, Wilde performed surgery on the father of another famous Irish dramatist, George Bernard Shaw. Wilde had a very successful medical practice and was assisted in it by his natural son, Henry Wilson, who had been trained in Dublin, Vienna, Heidelberg, Berlin, and Paris. Wilson's presence enabled Wilde to travel and he visited Scandinavia, where he received an honorary degree from Uppsala, and was welcomed in Stockholm by Anders Retzius, among others. King Karl XV of Sweden conferred on him the Nordstj√§rneorden (Order of the North Star). In 1853, he was appointed Surgeon Occulist in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland, the first position of its kind, probably created for him.The Dublin University Magazine, Volume 85 (1875) He was awarded a knighthood in a ceremony at Dublin Castle on 28 January 1864The Irish Times, 29 January 1864. more for his involvement with the Irish census than for his medical contributions, although he had been appointed medical commissioner to the Irish census in 1841. In 1845, he became editor of the Dublin Journal of Medical Science, to which he contributed many articles. A marble bust of William Wilde on the main staircase of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, Ireland Marriage and children Wilde married the poet Jane Francesca Agnes Elgee in 1851, who wrote and published under the name of Speranza. The couple had two sons: Willie and Oscar, and a daughter, Isola Francesca, who died in childhood. In addition to his children with his wife, Sir William Wilde was the father of three children born out of wedlock before his marriage: Henry Wilson, born in 1838, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, of different parentage to Henry. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate children and provided for their education, but they were reared by his relatives rather than with his wife and legitimate children.Ellmann, Richard (1988) Oscar Wilde, Vintage Books, New York, Emily and Mary both died in 1871 following a Halloween party at which their dresses accidentally caught fire.Zapata, Mariana. \\"The Strange Secret Behind the Tragic Deaths of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs Half-Sisters\\", Atlas Obscura (21 October 2016). From 1855 to his death in 1876, William Wilde lived at No. 1 Merrion Square, now the headquarters of American College Dublin. The building is named Oscar Wilde House after William Wilde's son, who also lived at the address from 1855 until 1878. Sir William Wilde Later life Memorial to Sir William Wilde and his wife located in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin Wilde's reputation suffered when Mary Travers, a long-term patient of his and the daughter of a colleague, claimed that he had seduced her two years earlier.Fryer, Jonathan (2005) Wilde. Haus Publishing. She wrote a pamphlet crudely parodying Wilde and Lady Wilde as Dr and Mrs Quilp, and portraying Dr Quilp as the rapist of a female patient anaesthetised under chloroform. She distributed the pamphlets outside the building where Wilde was about to give a public lecture. Lady Wilde complained to Mary's father, Robert Travers, which resulted in Mary bringing a libel case against her. Mary Travers won her case but was awarded a mere farthing in damages by the jury. Legal costs of ¬£2,000 were awarded against Lady Wilde. The case was the talk of all Dublin, and Wilde's refusal to enter the witness box during the trial was widely held against him as ungentlemanly behaviour. From this time onwards, Wilde began to withdraw from Dublin to the west of Ireland, where he had started in 1864 to build what became Moytura, his house overlooking Lough Corrib in Connemara.

Production of the Th!nk City was stopped in March 2011 and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. The company was bought soon after by Electric Mobility Solutions AS and production ceased in August 2012 with no more announcements regarding future production. , a total of 2,500 units had been manufactured at Oslo-based TH!NK‚Äôs production facility.  History  The company was founded in January 1991 in Oslo, as Pivco (for Personal Independent Vehicle Company). The first practical prototype, the PIV2, like the vehicles that followed, were built around a chassis made of aluminum and carrying a body made of polyethylene thermoplastic rotomolded in one piece. The chassis were developed by Hydro Aluminium Tonder in T√∏nder in Denmark and were one of the main reasons that Ford later acquired 51% of the stock. 10 of 15 prototypes were built in time for the Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games in 1994. The battery technology was NiCd, driving a three-phase AC induction motor via the front wheels. PIV3, the City Bee. The PIV2 was followed by the PIV3, the City Bee (Citi in the US), introduced in 1995. 120 of these were produced, 40 of which participated in the San Francisco Bay Area Station Car Demonstration project from 1995 to 1998. Based on the experiences from the prototypes, Pivco then went on to develop their first true production model, PIV4, later called the TH!NK, with Lotus Cars in a consulting role. The basic construction concept from the prototypes was retained, except that the roof was made of ABS plastic, and the lower frame chassis elements were made of steel. The production model had a range of (modified ECE101 cycle) between charges, and a top speed of . Development took more time and resources than anticipated, so when development of the production model was finished in 1999, finances had dried up. The company was then acquired by Ford, who could start production of the TH!NK city. Ford even embraced the TH!NK concept, and marketed electrically driven bicycles as well as golf carts under the same brand. The TH!NK city Electric Vehicle (EV) Demonstration Program Project was initiated late 2001, and completed in April 2005. US. Partners include Federal, State and Municipal agencies as well as commercial partners. Phase I, consisted of placement of the vehicles in demonstration programs, and it was completed in 2002. Phase II, the monitoring of these programs was completed in 2004. Phase III, the decommissioning and/or exporting of vehicles concluded in 2005. Phase I - the Program successfully assigned 192 EV's with customers (including Hertz) in the state of California, 109 in New York (including loaner and demo vehicles), 16 in Georgia, 7 to customers outside of the US and 52 in Ford's internal operations in Dearborn, Michigan for a total of 376 vehicles. Phase II ‚Äì the monitoring of the operational fleet was ongoing and completed in 2004, and all vehicles were returned throughout 2004 and 2005. The Department of Energy (DOE) was involved with the monitoring of the New York Power Authority / TH!NK Clean Commute Program units through partnership with Electric Transportation Engineering Corporation (ETEC), which filed separate reports to DOE. The remainder of the field fleet was monitored through Ford's internal operations. Vehicles were retired from lease operation throughout the program for various operator reasons. Some of the vehicles were involved in re-leasing operations. At the end of the program, 376 vehicles had been involved, 372 of which were available for customer use while 4 were engineering prototype and study vehicles. At the end of leases, City vehicles have been decommissioned and/or exported to KamKorp in Norway. By April 2005, the last of the City vehicles had been returned and processed or exported to Norway.

Probably due to changes in the California zero-emissions vehicle policy, Ford gave up THINK on January 31, 2003. The company was sold to KamKorp, owned by Indian businessman Kamal Siddiqi. Development of a successor to the City was subsequently halted. The used cars from US and UK have been re-exportedgreenpeace.org Th!nk Again: Ford Does a U-Turn to Norway where they are in high demand due to the government's policy to promote the use of electrical cars (EVs are exempt from taxes, have free parking, pass toll roads for free, and are allowed to drive in the bus lanes avoiding traffic congestion). In 2004, the company turned its attention to development of the TH!NK public, a micro size electric bus to be rented to customers for inner city travel. By February 2006, prototypes of the vehicle had been developed, but the company went into receivership. At the end of March 2006, Think Nordic was acquired by Norwegian investment group InSpire, which includes the original founder Jan Otto Ringdal and Jan-Olaf Willums - a Norwegian engineer educated at the renowned ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Polytechnic) and expert in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)- as partners. The company was renamed THINK Global. For the next year, the THINK website showed a restyled \\"new THINK City\\" car which was under development. An open version of the car was also pictured but the company said it had no plans to put it into production. In March 2007, a completely new website was posted, with many more images of the new car rendered into artist's impressions and various exterior/interior photographs. This site is presented in Norwegian and English. The original English page reported: \\"The THINK city has ABS brakes, dual airbags, and meets all European and US safety requirements. It has a range of , a top speed of and has comfort and convenience features such as air conditioning, power steering, sun roof, electric windows and mirrors, and more\\".

The THINK assembly line was restarted in late November 2007 to start manufacturing the re-designed City car. On March 5, 2008, General Electric, battery manufacturer A123 Systems and THINK Global announced that they had entered a partnership to enable global electrification of transportation. GE invested in THINK and $20 million in A123 Systems to help A123 roll out batteries for THINK. A123 Systems and THINK at the same time signed a commercial supply agreement. The partnership was announced at the 78th annual international Geneva Motor Show. Also at the 2008 Geneva motor show, THINK unveiled its future five-seater, concept car, the TH!NK Ox.Think Ox In July 2008, THINK introduced the THINK City for the first time in the UK. As of August 2008, some 100 City cars had been manufactured for customers in Norway. It was reported that \\"the lean plant is ready for efficient production supported by the experts of Porsche Consulting\\".Green Wombat On December 15, 2008, THINK suspended all vehicle production and laid off 50% of its staff pending negotiation of up to $29 million in funding for working capital, citing \\"urgent financial distress.\\" As of January 13, 2009, THINK Global received a bridge loan of 40 million Norwegian kroner (~$5.69 million) to continue operation. Much of that bridge loan came from one of its battery suppliers, EnerDel. On August 27, 2009, THINK announced a successful recapitalization ($47 million) through existing and new investors, which allowed the company to exit court protection and resume normal business operations in terms of manufacturing and sales of the THINK City EV in Europe. Announced investors included battery manufacturer Ener1 in U.S. (31%); US venture capital firms RockPort Capital Partners (Boston); Element Partners (Philadelphia) and Kleiner Perkins (Palo Alto, CA) as well as Valmet Automotive based in Finland and Investinor (the venture capital sovereign fund of Norway). On the same day, the company also announced that the THINK City electric car would be produced in Valmet later that year. The deal also included engineering. Valmet invested around ($4.27 million) to the project, and became a minor shareholder of the company. Production of the THINK City car at Valmet Automotive started on December 10, 2009 in Uusikaupunki, Finland. On January 5, 2010 THINK announced plans to manufacture the THINK City in Elkhart, Indiana beginning in 2011. On April 6, 2010 THINK announced plans to begin selling the THINK City in the U.S. in 2010. December 2010, the first 15 THINK electric cars made in the Elkhart, Indiana, assembly plant were delivered to its customer ‚Äì the state of Indiana ‚Äì for government fleet use. This marks the first time that an American-made electric vehicle with Lithium- ion batteries has been purchased for U.S. fleet operation. The vehicles delivered were the THINK City model, which is a pure electric vehicle that produces zero emissions and is capable of traveling as far as on a single charge. ‚ÄúOur delivery today is part of a larger effort to help transform the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet from one that is mostly dependent on imported oil, to one that is fueled entirely by domestically produced electric energy,‚Äù said Barry Engle, THINK CEO. Engle continued, ‚ÄúAs part of that goal, we‚Äôve made a strategic decision to target initially the many millions of fleet vehicles in operation in the U.S. market‚Ä¶These fleets can jumpstart vehicle electrification in America‚Äôs cities and help push the industry past early adopters into mainstream consumer markets.‚Äù Production of the Th!nk City was stopped in March 2011 and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. Think Global's assets were bought by Electric Mobility Solutions AS in July 2011, including shares of wholly owned subsidiaries THINK North America and THINK UK. The new owners announced that production is scheduled to restart in early 2012 with a refined Think City. However, despite such announcements production ceased in August 2012. In January 2013, an email sent to existing Think City customer included the sentence \\"For 2013, our focus is on serving our customers, while developing the next model THINK EV.\\" thus hinting that another Think EV is in development.  Models  = TH!NK city = PIV5, Th!nk City electric car. The Th!nk City was a small two-seater or 2+2-seater highway capable electric car, with a top speed of and an in-town range of on a full charge. The Think City is available with either a Zebra Sodium (molten salt battery) battery or a lithium-ion battery, which both travel 100 miles, or 160 kilometres on a full charge, and based on the International Electrotechnical Commission's standards for electric cars. After a failed start up in Norway in 2008, mass production was restarted in Finland in December 2009. As of September 2010 the Th!nk City was sold in Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland and Finland. It was one of the first three electric cars in the world to be crash-tested and highway-certified, together with the Tesla Roadster (2008) and the Mitsubishi i MiEV. = TH!NK Ox = Think Ox The TH!NK Ox, presented at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, was a concept five-seater electric car with a top speed of and a 100 kW motor.

The municipal seat and largest community of the municipality is also called Coatepec. The Mexican census of 2005 reported a population of 49,608 in the city, while the municipality had 79,787 inhabitants. The municipality also includes many smaller communities within its boundaries. The largest of these are Tuzamapan, Pacho Viejo, and Mahuixtl√°n.  Details  Coatepec borders the municipalities of Xalapa and Tlalnelhuayocan (north); Teocelo and Jalcomulco (south); Emiliano Zapata (east); and Xico and Teocelo (west). Often called The Coffee Capital of Mexico, the name Coatepec comes from the Nahuatl coatl (serpent), and tepetl (hill), or \\"The Hill of the Snakes\\". This municipality has four small rivers: the Pixquiac, the Pintores, the Sordo and the Hueyapan; all flow into the Pescados (La Antigua) River. Coatepec was named a \\"Pueblo M√°gico\\" in 2006. Coatepec is known for its coffee, which both tastes and looks appealing. The best option to buy coffee in Coatepec Veracruz is in \\"La Vereda\\" or in \\"Bola de Oro\\", you really need to discover \\"Bola de Oro,\\" because it is the most popular variety in the country. Regarding other matters, Coatepec has many traditions, with the most important being The Feast of S√°n Jer√≥nimo, which the people celebrate on September 30 each year. The foods in Coatepec that are the most popular with the local population and tourists alike include: Tamales, Chilaquiles, Emmoladas, Gorditas, Lupitas, Enfrijoladas, and others. Climate Coatepec's yearly median temperature is 19.5 ¬∞C (67 ¬∞F). Seasonal variations in temperature are moderate as elsewhere in central Mexico, whilst precipitation has more pronounced changes. The warmest month is May, when temperatures top 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) on average, although at night because of the high elevation the mercury drops to 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F). The coolest month is January with temperatures varying from 9 ¬∞C (48 ¬∞F) to 22 ¬∞C (72 ¬∞F). Precipitation is at its lowest during the spring months (however still some rainfall falls from late cold fronts or early thunderstorm activity). Rainfall peaks at two times during the year, in June, at the beginning of the rainy season, and in September, towards the end of it. During these months precipitation exceeds on average 300 mm (11.8 in) and have been as high as over 25 in (640.7 mm in September 1974). The city's mild to warm temperatures have their extremes in 33 ¬∞C (92 ¬∞F) in May 1984 and -1 ¬∞C (28 ¬∞F) during February, 1976.

Since 2007, it has been manufactured under the name Buddy by Elbil Norge in Oslo, Norway. From inception in 1991 through October 2013, total combined sales of the Kewet and Buddy totaled approximately 1,500 units, mainly in Norway. It is similar to the Citicar of the 1970s. History In 1971, Knud Erik Westergaard started KEW Industries in Hadsund, Denmark. The company produced industrial washing equipment and high pressure cleaners. In 1988, this company was sold, and Westergaard founded Kewet (Knud Erik Westergaard Elektrisk Transport) to produce electric cars. In 1991, the first cars emerged from the production facilities. In 1995, production was moved to Nordhausen in the former East Germany. But this move was unsuccessful. Kewet went bankrupt in 1998. In August 1998, Kewet International was formed. Shortly thereafter, rights to the Kewet vehicle were transferred to the Norwegian company, Kollega Bil A/S, which changed its name to Elbil Norge AS. Currently, Kewet Service provides spare parts and repairs Kewet vehicles in Denmark, while Consys develops various systems for electric vehicles. Models Six generations of the Kewet were produced: *Models 1 and 2 used 48 volt systems, 5 kW motors equipped with a four-speed manual transmission. *Model 3 was equipped with a 48 volt system, a 7.5 kW motor and a single-speed transmission. *Model 4 used 60 volt systems and a 10 kW motor. *Model 5 used 72 volt systems with a 12 kW motor. It was also available as a van. *Model 6 (Buddy) uses 72 volt systems with a 13 kW motor. The car seats three, has a range of typically 50 to 80 km (~31 to 50 mi) between charges (150 km/~93 mi with Li-Ion), with a top speed of 80 km/h (~49.7 MPH), and features a 1.6 kW electric heater or an optional paraffin heater.

Biography Frank Stella was born in Malden, Massachusetts, to parents of Italian descent. His father was a gynecologist, and his mother was an artistically inclined housewife who attended a fashion school and later took up landscape painting.Deborah Solomon (September 7, 2015), The Whitney Taps Frank Stella for an Inaugural Retrospective at Its New Home The New York Times. After attending high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he learned about abstract modernists Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, he attended Princeton University, where he majored in history and met Darby Bannard and Michael Fried. Early visits to New York art galleries fostered his artistic development, and his work was influenced by the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline.The Art Sory, Biography Stella moved to New York in 1958, after his graduation. He is heralded for creating abstract paintings that bear no pictorial illusions or psychological or metaphysical references in twentieth-century painting. As of 2015, Stella lives in Greenwich Village and keeps an office there but commutes on weekdays to his studio in Rock Tavern, New York. Work =Late 1950s and early 1960s= Upon moving to New York City, he reacted against the expressive use of paint by most painters of the abstract expressionist movement, instead finding himself drawn towards the \\"flatter\\" surfaces of Barnett Newman's work and the \\"target\\" paintings of Jasper Johns. He began to produce works which emphasized the picture-as-object, rather than the picture as a representation of something, be it something in the physical world, or something in the artist's emotional world. Stella married Barbara Rose, later a well-known art critic, in 1961. Around this time he said that a picture was \\"a flat surface with paint on it ‚Äì nothing more\\". This was a departure from the technique of creating a painting by first making a sketch. Many of the works are created by simply using the path of the brush stroke, very often using common house paint. This new aesthetic found expression in a series of new paintings, the Black Paintings (1959) in which regular bands of black paint were separated by very thin pinstripes of unpainted canvas. Die Fahne Hoch! (1959) is one such painting. It takes its name (\\"The Raised Banner\\" in English) from the first line of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, the anthem of the National Socialist German Workers Party, and Stella pointed out that it is in the same proportions as banners used by that organization. It has been suggested that the title has a double meaning, referring also to Jasper Johns' paintings of flags. In any case, its emotional coolness belies the contentiousness its title might suggest, reflecting this new direction in Stella's work. Stella's art was recognized for its innovations before he was twenty-five. In 1959, several of his paintings were included in \\"Three Young Americans\\" at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, as well as in \\"Sixteen Americans\\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (60). From 1960 Stella began to produce paintings in aluminium and copper paint which, in their presentation of regular lines of color separated by pinstripes, are similar to his black paintings. However they use a wider range of colors, and are his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the Irregular Polygon series (67), for example. Also in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his Protractor Series (71) of paintings, in which arcs, sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the shaped canvas. =Late 1960s and early 1970s= Frank Stella Harran II, 1967 Stella began his extended engagement with printmaking in the mid-1960s, working first with master printer Kenneth Tyler at Gemini G.E.L. Stella produced a series of prints during the late 1960s starting with a print called Quathlamba I in 1968. Stella's abstract prints used lithography, screenprinting, etching and offset lithography. In 1967, he designed the set and costumes for Scramble, a dance piece by Merce Cunningham. The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a retrospective of Stella's work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one. During the following decade, Stella introduced relief into his art, which he came to call \\"maximalist\\" painting for its sculptural qualities. The shaped canvases took on even less regular forms in the Eccentric Polygon series, and elements of collage were introduced, pieces of canvas being pasted onto plywood, for example. His work also became more three-dimensional to the point where he started producing large, free-standing metal pieces, which, although they are painted upon, might well be considered sculpture. After introducing wood and other materials in the Polish Village series (73), created in high relief, he began to use aluminum as the primary support for his paintings. As the 1970s and 1980s progressed, these became more elaborate and exuberant. Indeed, his earlier Minimalism [more] became baroque, marked by curving forms, Day-Glo colors, and scrawled brushstrokes. Similarly, his prints of these decades combined various printmaking and drawing techniques. In 1973, he had a print studio installed in his New York house. In 1976, Stella was commissioned by BMW to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL for the second installment in the BMW Art Car Project. He has said of this project, \\"The starting point for the art cars was racing livery. In the old days there used to be a tradition of identifying a car with its country by color. Now they get a number and they get advertising. It's a paint job, one way or another. The idea for mine was that it's from a drawing on graph paper. The graph paper is what it is, a graph, but when it's morphed over the car's forms it becomes interesting, and adapting the drawing to the racing car's forms is interesting. Theoretically it's like painting on a shaped canvas.\\" In 1969, Stella was commissioned to create a logo for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial. Medals incorporating the design were struck to mark the occasion.Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960‚Äì1971 (bulk 1967‚Äì1970).

Guggenheim Museum, New York. During this time, the increasingly deep relief of Stella's paintings gave way to full three-dimensionality, with sculptural forms derived from cones, pillars, French curves, waves, and decorative architectural elements. To create these works, the artist used collages or maquettes that were then enlarged and re-created with the aids of assistants, industrial metal cutters, and digital technologies. La scienza della pigrizia (The Science of Laziness), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. It is fabricated from oil paint, enamel paint, and alkyd paint on canvas, etched magnesium, aluminum and fiberglass. In the 1990s, Stella began making free-standing sculpture for public spaces and developing architectural projects. In 1993, for example, he created the entire decorative scheme for Toronto‚Äôs Princess of Wales Theatre, which includes a 10,000-square-foot mural. His 1993 proposal for a Kunsthalle and garden in Dresden did not come to fruition. In 1997, he painted and oversaw the installation of the 5,000-square-foot \\"Stella Project\\" which serves as the centerpiece of the theater and lobby of the Moores Opera House located at the Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music on the campus of the University of Houston, in Houston, TX.About the Stella Project in the Moores Opera House His aluminum bandshell, inspired by a folding hat from Brazil, was built in downtown Miami in 2001; a monumental Stella sculpture was installed outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Stella's wall-hung Scarlatti K Series was triggered by the harpsichord sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti and the writings of the U.S. 20th-century harpsichord virtuoso and musicologist Ralph Kirkpatrick, who made the sonatas widely known.

With its monopoly on interstellar travel and banking, the power of the Guild is balanced against that of the Padishah Emperor as well as of the assembled noble Houses of the Landsraad. Mutated Guild Navigators use the spice drug melange to successfully navigate \\"folded space\\" and safely guide enormous heighliner starships from planet to planet instantaneously. Essentially apolitical, the Guild is primarily concerned with the flow of commerce and preservation of the economy that supports them; although their ability to dictate the terms of and fees for all transport gives them influence in the political arena, they do not pursue political goals beyond their economic ones. It is noted in Dune (1965) that Houses of the Imperium may contract with the Guild to be removed \\"to a place of safety outside the System\\"; in the past, some Houses in danger of ruin or defeat have \\"become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium\\". The Guild controls a \\"sanctuary planet\\" (or planets) known as Tupile intended for such \\"defeated Houses of the Imperium ... Location(s) known only to the Guild and maintained inviolate under the Guild Peace\\". John C. Smith analyzes the concept of the Guild in the essay \\"Navigators and the Spacing Guild\\" in The Science of Dune (2008). The original series =Dune= In Dune, Paul Atreides defeats Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV in a battle on Arrakis. He demands first the Emperor's daughter for a wife, which would make Paul heir to the throne, and second that the Emperor immediately step down. The demands are coupled with a threat to destroy the spice. Since that would end all interstellar transit, the Guild sides with Paul, threatening to strand the Emperor and his troops on Arrakis if he does not relinquish the throne. In 'Appendix A' of Dune, Herbert wrote that the Guild, along with the Bene Gesserit order, had been responsible for the standardization of religion in the Dune universe; they promoted the adoption of the Orange Catholic Bible and offered protection to the dissenting theologians who created this book. Nonetheless, in the same appendix, Herbert held that the Guild members themselves were atheists, and only promoted this move to promote a stable societal order from which they could profit. As discussed by Reverend Mother Mohiam and Paul Atreides at the beginning of the novel, the Guild arose in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad, when \\"thinking machines\\" that nearly overthrew humanity were defeated. This resulted in a general aversion to technologies that perfected Artificial Intelligence, which in turn led to various groups attempting to perfect the human mind and physical capacity, using incredibly refined training and psychoactive drugs. There was a chaotic period when \\"real sorcerers\\" from these different schools of human development rivaled each other, but at the same time made great new strides towards their goals - Mohiam calls it \\"a time of deep contrasts\\". From this competition, the various schools gradually coalesced into two formalized orders: the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit. Neither of them, however, actively tried to openly seize power over all of humanity and rule directly, instead sharing power with the Emperor and the Great Houses, and influencing events from the shadows. Paul later concludes that the Guild (and by extension the Bene Gesserit) did this out of a belief that any political empire is finite, ending sooner or later: the only way to guarantee their continual existence was to be a \\"parasite\\", propping up one imperial dynasty until it collapsed, then simply switching to support the next one. =Dune Messiah= Navigators are made prescient by the spice (a requirement of being a pilot), and are sometimes utilized as such: In Dune Messiah (1969), a Navigator named Edric takes part in a plot to assassinate the Emperor, Paul Atreides. The presence of a prescient hides the activities of that person, and those around him, from other prescients; Edric's involvement is solely to protect the conspirators from Paul's prescient sight. =God Emperor of Dune= In God Emperor of Dune (1981), God Emperor Leto II has secured complete control over of the scarce melange reserves through hydraulic despotism, making the Guild completely dependent on him. Leto II also notes in one occasion: =Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune= In the fifth and sixth novels of the series, Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), 5,000 years after the reign of Paul Atreides (a period that includes 3,500 years of Leto II's reign and 1,500 years following his death), the technocrats of Ix develop technology that the Ixians and the Administrative faction of the Spacing Guild refer to as \\"compilers\\". These compilers perform calculations very similar to computers, nearly violating the prohibitions against \\"thinking machines\\" that were imposed following the Butlerian Jihad several millennia before. These compilers eliminate the need for the Navigators, and the strategic disadvantage that this aspect of melange dependency has become, because the Navigators' abilities are slowly being compromised by the severe reductions in the availability of spice resulting from the destruction of Dune and the sandworms on that planet, and the strict control by the Bene Gesserit, who maintain a monopoly over the largest stockpiles of melange. The prescient rule of Leto II that lasted 3,500 years has shown the universe the perils of prescience, namely that the entire universe can be locked into the vision of a single entity, giving that entity absolute power. The Guild, facing obsolescence and suspicion, couples itself with Ix in decline; Navigators continue to exist, but their importance in the universe is severely diminished. As Paul Atreides notes in Dune, it was the Spacing Guild's obsession with the \\"safe path\\" that led them \\"ever into stagnation\\", and brought on their eventual obsolescence. =Prequels= In Dune: House Corrino (2001), the third novel in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999‚Äì2001), it is reiterated that Aurelius Venport is believed to have founded the Guild. In the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson Legends of Dune prequel series (2002‚Äì2004), however, it is confirmed that his lover Norma Cenva, a mathematical genius with great psychic power, had in fact invented the space-folding ships which would eventually be called heighliners. Ever uncaring about her own fame, Norma credits the invention to Aurelius as a gift to him in Dune: The Battle of Corrin (2004). Norma discovers that an excessive dose of melange allows her to safely navigate the ships using prescience; she allows herself to mutate to perfect the process, becoming the first Navigator. Aurelius and Norma's son Adrien Venport establish the Foldspace Shipping Company and find the ten volunteers to become the initial group of Navigators. After consolidating its hold on the space travel industry during the events of Sisterhood of Dune, this company, now called \\"Venport Holdings\\" or even \\"VenHold\\", evolves into the Guild of the later novels. VenHold originally has the monopoly on foldspace travel, granted to Aurelius Venport by Serena Butler. However, decades after the end of the Butlerian Jihad, Emperor Jules revokes the monopoly in order to curry political favor, resulting in several rival foldspace companies springing up, such as Celestial Transport and EsconTran. These new companies, however, are unable to provide 100% safe transportation due to their lack of Navigators, the creation process of whom is a proprietary secret tightly held by VenHold. Director Josef Venport ruthlessly crushes the competition and even executes a rival CEO. The Dune games In Emperor: Battle for Dune (2001), the Spacing Guild plays the role of a subhouse. It has its own private army with which it can back up its demands. The Guild uses its Heighliners to transport troops from the various homeworlds to Arrakis. Later in the game,they become evil, building an \\"Emperor Worm\\" through which they hope to rule the Universe. Depending on which House you use, and whether or not you win or lose, the campaign end cutscenes are different.

But England didn't exist until hundreds of years after the Romans left. Roman theatre at Verulamium (St Albans) Medieval period By the medieval period, the mummers' plays had developed, a form of early street theatre associated with the Morris dance, concentrating on themes such as Saint George and the Dragon and Robin Hood. These were folk tales re-telling old stories, and the actors travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality. =English mystery plays= Nineteenth-century engraving of a performance from the Chester mystery play cycle. Mystery plays and miracle plays (sometimes distinguished as two different forms,'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only. Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' although the terms are often used interchangeably) are among the earliest formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They developed from the 10th to the 16th century, reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre. The name derives from mystery used in its sense of miracle, but an occasionally quoted derivation is from misterium, meaning craft, a play performed by the craft guilds. There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late medieval period; although these collections are sometimes referred to as \\"cycles,\\" it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the York cycle of forty-eight pageants. They were performed in the city of York, from the middle of the fourteenth century until 1569. There are also the Towneley plays of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays and most likely performed around the Feast of Corpus Christi probably in the town of Wakefield, England during the late Middle Ages until 1576. The Ludus Coventriae (also called the N Town plays\\" or Hegge cycle), now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the Chester cycle of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament cycle acted at Coventry and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of Mary Magdalene, The Brome Abraham and Isaac and a sixteenth-century play of the Conversion of Saint Paul exist, all hailing from East Anglia. Besides the Middle English drama, there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia. These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the Fall of Lucifer, the Creation and Fall of Man, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood, Abraham and Isaac, the Nativity, the Raising of Lazarus, the Passion, and the Resurrection. Other pageants included the story of Moses, the Procession of the Prophets, Christ's Baptism, the Temptation in the Wilderness, and the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval craft guilds. The York mercers, for example, sponsored the Doomsday pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the Ark from the carpenters' guild; the five loaves and fishes miracle from the bakers; and the visit of the Magi, with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths. The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on pageant wagons. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the Second Shepherds' Play to Horbery Shrogys ( line 454) is strongly suggestive =Morality plays= The morality play is a genre of Medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as \\"interludes\\", a broader term given to dramas with or without a moral theme.Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98). Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a Godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century English morality play. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman examines the question of Christian salvation by use of allegorical characters, and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, [material] Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatized by the interactions between characters. Renaissance: Elizabethan and Jacobean periods William Shakespeare, chief figure of the English Renaissance, is here seen in the Chandos portrait. The period known as the English Renaissance, approximately 1500‚Äì1660, saw a flowering of the drama and all the arts. The two candidates for the earliest comedy in English Nicholas Udall's Ralph Roister Doister (c. 1552) and the anonymous Gammer Gurton's Needle (c. 1566), belong to the 16th century. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603) and then James I (1603‚Äì25), in the late 16th and early 17th century, a London-centred culture, that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553‚Äì1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend of and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include Gorboduc (1561) by Sackville and Norton and Thomas Kyd's (1558‚Äì94) revenge tragedy The Spanish Tragedy (1592), that influenced Shakespeare's Hamlet. William Shakespeare stands out in this period as a poet and playwright as yet unsurpassed. Shakespeare was not a man of letters by profession, and probably had only some grammar school education. He was neither a lawyer, nor an aristocrat as the \\"university wits\\" that had monopolised the English stage when he started writing. But he was very gifted and incredibly versatile, and he surpassed \\"professionals\\" as Robert Greene who mocked this \\"shake-scene\\" of low origins. He was himself an actor and deeply involved in the running of the theatre company that performed his plays. Most playwrights at this time tended to specialise in, either histories, or comedies, or tragedies. but Shakespeare is remarkable in that he produced all three types. His 38 plays include tragedies, comedies, and histories. In addition, he wrote his so-called \\"problem plays\\", or \\"bitter comedies\\", that includes, amongst others, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, A Winter's Tale and All's Well that Ends Well.M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms, 7th edition. (Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p.246. His early classical and Italianate comedies, like A Comedy of Errors, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies,. A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night. After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, and Julius Caesar, based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, which introduced a new kind of drama.; . Though most of his plays met with success, it was in his later years, that Shakespeare wrote what have been considered his greatest plays: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher. Other important playwrights of this period include Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Dekker, John Fletcher Francis Beaumont, Ben Jonson, and John Webster. Other important figures in Elizabethan theatre include Christopher Marlowe (1564‚Äì1593), Thomas Dekker (c. 1572 ‚Äì 1632), John Fletcher (1579‚Äì1625) and Francis Beaumont (1584‚Äì1616). Marlowe (1564‚Äì1593) was born only a few weeks before Shakespeare and must have known him. Marlowe's subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the renaissance man than any other thing. Marlowe was fascinated and terrified by the new frontiers opened by modern science. Drawing on German lore, he introduced the story of Faust to England in his play Doctor Faustus (c. 1592), a scientist and magician who is obsessed by the thirst of knowledge and the desire to push man's technological power to its limits. At the end of a twenty-four years' covenant with the devil he has to surrender his soul to him. Beaumont and Fletcher are less-known, but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his best dramas, and were popular at the time. One of Beaumont and Fletcher's chief merits was that of realising how feudalism and chivalry had turned into snobbery and make-believe and that new social classes were on the rise. Beaumont's comedy, The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1607), satirises the rising middle class and especially of those nouveaux riches who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much literature at all. Ben Jonson (1572/3-1637) is best known for his satirical plays, particularly Volpone, The Alchemist, and Bartholomew Fair. He was also often engaged to write courtly masques, ornate plays where the actors wore masks. Ben Jonson's aesthetics have roots in the Middle Ages as his characters are based on the theory of humours. However, the stock types of Latin literature were an equal influence.\\"Ben Jonson.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 20 September 2012. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127459/Ben Jonson. Jonson therefore tends to create types or caricatures. However, in his best work, characters are \\"so vitally rendered as to take on a being that transcends the type\\".\\"Ben Jonson.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. He is a master of style, and a brilliant satirist. Jonson's famous comedy Volpone (1605 or 1606) shows how a group of scammers are fooled by a top con-artist, vice being punished by vice, virtue meting out its reward. Others who followed Jonson's style include Beaumont and Fletcher, whose comedy, The Knight of the Burning Pestle (c. 1607‚Äì08), satirizes the rising middle class and especially of those nouveaux riches who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much about literature at all. In the story, a grocer and his wife wrangle with the professional actors to have their illiterate son play a leading role in the play. A popular style of theatre during Jacobean times was the revenge play, which had been popularised earlier in the Elizabethan era by Thomas Kyd (1558‚Äì94), and then subsequently developed by John Webster (1578‚Äì1632) in the 17th century. Webster's major plays, The White Devil (c. 1609 ‚Äì 1612) and The Duchess of Malfi (c. 1612/13), are macabre, disturbing works. Webster has received a reputation for being the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatist with the most unsparingly dark vision of human nature. Webster's tragedies present a horrific vision of mankind and in his poem \\"Whispers of Immortality,\\" T. S. Eliot memorably says, that Webster always saw \\"the skull beneath the skin\\". While Webster's drama was generally dismissed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there has been \\"a strong revival of interest\\" in the 20th century.Margaret Drabble, 'The Oxford Companion to English Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), p.1063. Other revenge tragedies include The Changeling written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, The Atheist's Tragedy by Cyril Tourneur, first published in 1611, Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois by George Chapman, The Malcontent (c. 1603) of John Marston and John Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. Besides Hamlet, other plays of Shakespeare's with at least some revenge elements, are Titus Andronicus, Julius Caesar and Macbeth. George Chapman (?1559-?1634) was a successful playwright who produced comedies (his collaboration on Eastward Hoe led to his brief imprisonment in 1605 as it offended the King with its anti-Scottish sentiment), tragedies (most notably Bussy D'Ambois) and court masques (The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn), but who is now remembered chiefly for his translation in 1616 of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. The Tragedy of Mariam, the Fair Queen of Jewry, a closet drama written by Elizabeth Tanfield Cary (1585‚Äì1639) and first published in 1613, was the first original play in English known to have been written by a woman. 17th and 18th centuries Aphra Behn was the first professional English woman playwright. During the Interregnum 1649‚Äì1660, English theatres were kept closed by the Puritans for religious and ideological reasons. When the London theatres opened again with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, they flourished under the personal interest and support of Charles II. Wide and socially mixed audiences were attracted by topical writing and by the introduction of the first professional actresses (in Shakespeare's time, all female roles had been played by boys). New genres of the Restoration were heroic drama, pathetic drama, and Restoration comedy. Notable heroic tragedies of this period include John Dryden's All for Love (1677) and Aureng-zebe (1675), and Thomas Otway's Venice Preserved (1682). The Restoration plays that have best retained the interest of producers and audiences today are the comedies, such as George Etherege's The Man of Mode (1676), William Wycherley's The Country Wife (1676), John Vanbrugh's The Relapse (1696), and William Congreve's The Way of the World (1700). This period saw the first professional woman playwright, Aphra Behn, author of many comedies including The Rover (1677). Restoration comedy is famous or notorious for its sexual explicitness, a quality encouraged by Charles II (1660-1685) personally and by the rakish aristocratic ethos of his court. In the 18th century, the highbrow and provocative Restoration comedy lost favour, to be replaced by sentimental comedy, domestic tragedy such as George Lillo's The London Merchant (1731), and by an overwhelming interest in Italian opera. Popular entertainment became more dominant in this period than ever before. Fair-booth burlesque and musical entertainment, the ancestors of the English music hall, flourished at the expense of legitimate English drama. By the early 19th century, few English dramas were being written, except for closet drama, plays intended to be presented privately rather than on stage. Victorian era left A change came in the Victorian era with a profusion on the London stage of farces, musical burlesques, extravaganzas and comic operas that competed with Shakespeare productions and serious drama by the likes of James Planch√© and Thomas William Robertson. In 1855, the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of (formerly risqu√©) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and were followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies. W. S. Gilbert and Oscar Wilde were leading poets and dramatists of the late Victorian period.Stedman, Jane W. (1996). W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian & His Theatre. Oxford University Press. Wilde's plays, in particular, stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a much closer relationship to those of the Edwardian dramatists such as Irishman George Bernard Shaw and Norwegian Henrik Ibsen. The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly during the Victorian period. As transportation improved, poverty in London diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy Our Boys, opening in 1875. Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by Charley's Aunt.Article on long-runs in the theatre before 1920 Several of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas broke the 500-performance barrier, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, and Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson's 1886 hit, Dorothy, ran for 931 performances. The theatre: 1901‚Äì45 Edwardian musical comedy held the London stage (not together with foreign operetta imports) until World War I and was then supplanted by increasingly popular American musical theatre and comedies by No√´l Coward, Ivor Novello and their contemporaries. The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only a limited challenge to theatre. But by the end of the 1920s, films like The Jazz Singer could be presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. Some dramatists wrote for the new medium, but playwriting continued. Irish playwrights George Bernard Shaw (1856‚Äì1950) and J. M. Synge (1871‚Äì1909) were influential in British drama. Shaw's career began in the last decade of the nineteenth-century and he wrote more than 60 plays. Synge's plays belong to the first decade of the twentieth century. Synge's most famous play, The Playboy of the Western World, \\"caused outrage and riots when it was first performed\\" in Dublin in 1907.The Oxford Companion to English Literature. (1996), p.781. George Bernard Shaw turned the Edwardian theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, \\"the morality of armaments and war\\" and the rights of women.\\"English literature.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. . In the 1920s and later No√´l Coward (1899‚Äì1973) achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever (1925), Private Lives (1930), Design for Living (1932), Present Laughter (1942) and Blithe Spirit (1941), have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. In the 1930s W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood co-authored verse dramas, of which The Ascent of F6 (1936) is the most notable, that owed much to Bertolt Brecht. T. S. Eliot had begun this attempt to revive poetic drama with Sweeney Agonistes in 1932, and this was followed by The Rock (1934), Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Family Reunion (1939). There were three further plays after the war. The period 1945‚Äì2000 An important cultural movement in the British theatre which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was Kitchen sink realism (or \\"kitchen sink drama\\"), a term coined to describe art (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by John Bratby), novels, film and television plays. The term angry young men was often applied to members of this artistic movement. It used a style of social realism which depicts the domestic lives of the working class, to explore social issues and political issues. The drawing room plays of the post-war period, typical of dramatists like Terence Rattigan and No√´l Coward were challenged in the 1950s by these Angry Young Men, in plays like John Osborne's Look Back in Anger (1956). Arnold Wesker and Nell Dunn also brought social concerns to the stage. Again In the 1950s, the absurdist play Waiting for Godot (1955) (originally En attendant Godot, 1952), by the French resident, Irishman Samuel Beckett profoundly affected British drama. The Theatre of the Absurd influenced Harold Pinter (1930-2008), (The Birthday Party, 1958), whose works are often characterised by menace or claustrophobia. Beckett also influenced Tom Stoppard (1937-) (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,1966). Stoppard's works are, however, also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. Both Pinter and Stoppard continued to have new plays produced into the 1990s. Michael Frayn (1933- ) is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas. He is also a novelist. Other Important playwrights whose careers began later in the century are: Caryl Churchill (Top Girls, 1982) and Alan Ayckbourn (Absurd Person Singular, 1972). An important new element in the world of British drama, from the beginnings of radio in the 1920s, was the commissioning of plays, or the adaption of existing plays, by BBC radio. This was especially important in the 1950s and 1960s (and from the 1960s on for television). Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill's early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with The Ants, there were nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton's dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play The Ruffian on the Stair, which was broadcast on 31 August 1964.Tim Crook, \\"International radio drama\\" Tom Stoppard's \\"first professional production was in the fifteen-minute Just Before Midnight programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists\\". John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief, starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio's Third Programme, later televised with the same cast, and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for Rumpole of the Bailey a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.\\"John Mortimer Radio Plays\\": ; John Mortimer Biography (1923‚Äì2009) Other notable radio dramatists included Brendan Behan, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC radio, from the early 1970s. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of The Quare Fellow (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play The Big House (1956); prior to this he had written two plays Moving Outand A Garden Party for Irish radio.The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, by Gabrielle H. Cody; \\"Brendan Behan\\" - RT√â Archives Among the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood (1954), Samuel Beckett's All That Fall (1957), Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache (1959) and Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons (1954).J. C. Trewin, \\"Critic on the Hearth.\\" Listener [London, England] 5 Aug. 1954: 224. Samuel Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television. Beckett's radio play Embers was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.Prix Italia \\"PAST EDITIONS ‚Äî WINNERS 1949‚Äì2007\\"  21st century  Three Girls is a three-part British television's real life drama series, written by screenwriter Nicole Taylor, and directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, that broadcast on three consecutive nights between 16 and 18 May 2017 on BBC One. the series is a dramatised version of the events surrounding the Rochdale child sex abuse ring, the mini series Three Girls attempts to create awareness about how complex criminal process of child grooming takes place while sexually abusing children and describes how the authorities failed to investigate allegations of rape because the victims were perceived as unreliable witnesses. The story is told from the viewpoint of three of the victims: fourteen-year-old Holly Winshaw (Molly Windsor), sixteen-year-old Amber Bowen (Ria Zmitrowicz) and her younger sister Ruby (Liv Hill) According to lawyers Richard Scorer & Nazir Afzal, the drama Three girls helps in building awareness around child protection issues of 21st century.

It was founded in 1866 in Springfield, Illinois, and grew to include hundreds of \\"posts\\" (local community units) across the nation (predominantly in the North, but also a few in the South and West). It was dissolved in 1956 at the death of its last member, Albert Woolson (1850‚Äì1956) of Duluth, Minnesota. Linking men through their experience of the war, the G.A.R. became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, promoting patriotic education, helping to make Memorial Day a national holiday, lobbying the United States Congress to establish regular veterans' pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at 410,000, was in 1890, a high point of various Civil War commemorative and monument dedication ceremonies. It was succeeded by the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), composed of male descendants of Union Army and Union Navy veterans. The Confederate equivalent of the GAR were the United Confederate Veterans. History G.A.R. Uniform Hat Badge from Post No. 146, \\"RG Shaw Post\\", established by surviving members of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment in 1871 (R. Andre Stevens Civil War Collection) After the end of American Civil War, various state and local organizations were formed for veterans to network and maintain connections with each other. Many of the veterans used their shared experiences as a basis for fellowship. Groups of men began joining together, first for camaraderie and later for political power. Emerging as most influential among the various organizations during the first post-war years was the Grand Army of the Republic, founded on April 6, 1866, on the principles of \\"Fraternity, Charity and Loyalty,\\" in Decatur, Illinois, by Dr. Benjamin F. Stephenson and the first GAR Post was established in Decatur, Illinois. http://www.suvcw.org/?page_id=167 The GAR initially grew and prospered as a de facto political arm of the Republican Party during the heated political contests of the Reconstruction Era. The commemoration of Union Army and Navy veterans, black and white, immediately became entwined with partisan politics. The GAR promoted voting rights for Negro veterans, as many white veterans recognized their demonstrated patriotism and sacrifices, providing one of the first racially integrated social/fraternal organizations in America. Black veterans, who enthusiastically embraced the message of equality, shunned black veterans' organizations in preference for racially inclusive and integrated groups. But when the Republican Party's commitment to reform in the South gradually decreased, the GAR's mission became ill-defined and the organization floundered. The GAR almost disappeared in the early 1870s, and many state-centered divisions, named \\"departments\\", and local posts ceased to exist. In his General Order No. 11, dated May 5, 1868, first GAR Commander-in-Chief, General John A. Logan declared May 30 to be Memorial Day (also referred to for many years as \\"Decoration Day\\"), calling upon the GAR membership to make the May 30 observance an annual occurrence. Although not the first time war graves had been decorated, Logan's order effectively established \\"Memorial Day\\" as the day upon which Americans now pay tribute to all their war casualties, missing-in-action, and deceased veterans. As decades passed, similarly inspired commemorations also spread across the South as \\"Confederate Memorial Day\\" or \\"Confederate Decoration Day\\", usually in April, led by organizations of Southern soldiers in the parallel United Confederate Veterans.

In the 1880s, the Union veterans' organization revived under new leadership that provided a platform for renewed growth, by advocating Federal pensions for veterans. As the organization revived, black veterans joined in significant numbers and organized local posts. The national organization, however, failed to press the case for similar pensions for black soldiers. Most black troops never received any pension or remuneration for wounds incurred during their Civil War service. The GAR was organized into \\"Departments\\" at the state level and \\"Posts\\" at the community level, and military-style uniforms were worn by its members. There were posts in every state in the U.S., and several posts overseas. The pattern of establishing departments and local posts was later used by other American military veterans' organizations, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (organized originally for veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Philippine Insurrection) and the later American Legion (for the First World War and later expanded to include subsequent World War II, Korean, Vietnam and Middle Eastern wars). The G.A.R.'s political power grew during the latter part of the 19th century, and it helped elect several United States presidents, beginning with the 18th, Ulysses S. Grant, and ending with the 25th, William McKinley. Six Civil War veterans (Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur; Benjamin Harrison, and McKinley) were elected President of the United States; all were Republicans. (The sole post- war Democratic president was Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th chief executive.) For a time, candidates could not get Republican presidential or congressional nominations without the endorsement of the GAR veterans voting bloc. Of the six mentioned US Presidents, at least four were members of the G.A.R.: *Ulysses S. Grant (Lt General of the Union Armies) Became a member of the Philadelphia PA George G.

Numerous male organizations jousted for the backing of the GAR, and the political battles became quite severe until the GAR finally endorsed the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War as its heir. =Female members= Although an overwhelmingly male organization, the GAR is known to have had at least two women who were members. The first female known to be admitted to the GAR was Kady Brownell, who served in the Union Army with her husband Robert, a private in the 1st Rhode Island Infantry at the First Battle of Bull Run in Virginia and with the 5th Rhode Island Infantry at the Battle of New Berne in North Carolina. Kady was admitted as a member in 1870 to Elias Howe Jr. Post #3, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The GAR insignia is engraved on her gravestone in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1897 the GAR admitted Sarah Emma Edmonds, who served in the 2nd Michigan Infantry as a disguised man named Franklin Thompson from May 1861 until April 1863. In 1882, she collected affidavits from former comrades in an effort to petition for a veteran's pension which she received in July 1884. Edmonds was only a member for a brief period as she died September 5, 1898; however she was given a funeral with military honors when she was reburied in Houston in 1901. It is possible that other women were members of the GAR, as well. File:Kady Brownell CDV.jpgKady Brownwell File:Sarah Edmonds.jpgSarah Emma Edmonds =Later years= The GAR reached its largest enrollment in 1890, with 410,000 members. It held an annual \\"National Encampment\\" every year from 1866 to 1949. Interesting anecdotes from the war were told around the many campfires at these reunions and compiled in a book of campfire \\"chats\\", including descriptions of the festivities at the 1884-1886 encampments in Minneapolis, Portland, Maine and San Francisco. At the final encampment in Indianapolis, Indiana, the few surviving members voted to retain the existing officers in place until the organization's dissolution. Theodore Penland of Oregon, the GAR's Commander at the time, was therefore its last. In 1956, after the death of the last member, Albert Woolson, the GAR was formally dissolved.

In 1951, the U.S. Postal Service printed a virtually identical stamp for the final reunion of the United Confederate Veterans. State posts Every state (even those of the former Confederacy) fell within a GAR \\"Department,\\" and within these Departments were the \\"Posts\\" (forerunners of modern American Legion Halls or VFW Halls). The posts were made up of local veterans, many of whom participated in local civic events. As the posts were formed, they were assigned to the home Department of the National Commander-in-chief of the year that they were chartered. There was no GAR post in London, but there was a Civil War Veterans Association Group that had many GAR members belonging to it. As Civil War veterans died or were no longer able to participate in GAR activities, posts consolidated or were disbanded. Posts were assigned a sequential number based on their admission into the state's GAR organization, and most posts held informal names which honored comrades, battles, or commanders; it was not uncommon to have more than one post in a state honoring the same individual (such as Abraham Lincoln) and posts often changed their informal designation by vote of the local membership. See: * List of Grand Army of the Republic Posts in Kansas * List of Grand Army of the Republic Posts in Kentucky In popular culture John Steinbeck's East of Eden features several references to the Grand Army of the Republic. Despite having very little actual battle experience during his brief military career, cut short by the loss of his leg, Adam Trask's father Cyrus joins the GAR and assumes the stature of \\"a great man\\" through his involvement with the organization. At the height of the GAR's influence in Washington, he brags to his son: Later in the book, references are made to the graves of GAR members in California in order to emphasize the passage of time. Sinclair Lewis also refers to the GAR in his acclaimed novel Main Street and in his novel It Can't Happen Here, as does Charles Portis's classic novel, True Grit, the GAR is briefly mentioned in William Faulkner's novel, The Sound and the Fury. and Willa Cather's short story \\"The Sculptor's Funeral\\" briefly references the GAR. The GAR is mentioned in the seldom-sung second verse of the patriotic song \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". The GAR is referenced in John McCrae's poem He Is There! which was set to music in 1917 by Charles Ives as part of his cycle Three Songs of the War. In Ward Moore's 1953 alternate history novel Bring the Jubilee, the Confederates won the Civil War and became a major world power while the rump United States was reduced to an impoverished dependence. The Grand Army of the Republic is the name of a nationalistic organization working to restore the United States to its former glory through acts of sabotage and terrorism.

The Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic was also a significant organization.

The Journal, along with its Asian editions, is published six days a week by Dow Jones & Company, a division of News Corp. The newspaper is published in the broadsheet format and online. The Journal has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser. The Wall Street Journal is one of the largest newspapers in the United States by circulation, with a circulation of about 2.834million copies (including nearly 1,829,000 digital sales) , compared with USA Todays 1.7million. The Journal publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine WSJ, which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues as of 2014. An online version was launched in 1996, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began. The newspaper has won 37 Pulitzer Prizes (as of 2019). The editorial pages of the Journal are typically conservative in their position. The Journal editorial board has promoted views that differ from the scientific consensus on climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos. It is regarded as a \\"newspaper of record\\", particularly in terms of business and financial news. History =Beginnings= Front page of the first issue of The Wall Street Journal, July 8, 1889 The first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Journal, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed \\"flimsies\\", hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers' Afternoon Letter. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.Dow Jones & Co. Inc., \\"Dow Jones History ‚Äì The Late 1800s\\" , Retrieved July 25, 2013. In 1896, The \\"Dow Jones Industrial Average\\" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the Journal Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow. Journalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting‚Äîa novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, Barron's, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.Crossen, Cynthia. \\"It All Began in the Basement of a Candy Store \\", The Wall Street Journal (New York), p. B1, August 1, 2007. Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007. The Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its \\"What's News\\" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials. In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group. The period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \\"Factiva\\", The Wall Street Journal Asia, The Wall Street Journal Europe, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \\"WSJ Weekend Edition\\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. WSJ., a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008. =Internet expansion= A complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements.\\"The Wall Street Journal Announces New Integrated Print and Online Sales and Marketing Initiatives\\".

Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer web site. In September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising. In 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1million, and an average age of 55.Mitchell, Bill. \\"The Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition: Expectations, Surprises, Disappointments \\".

The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival Financial Times. =Design changes= The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end. Front-page advertising in the Journal was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.\\"Wall Street Journal Introduces New Front Page Advertising Opportunity \\". Press release, July 18, 2006.

After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century‚Äîalways six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, \\"What's News\\" digest in the second and third, the \\"A-hed\\" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth columnWSJ.com Guided Tour: Page One, accessed August 30, 2007. ‚Äì the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12inches while keeping the length at 22inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18million a year in newsprint costs across all The Wall Street Journal papers. This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the \\"A-hed\\" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories). The paper still uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls,\\"Picturing Business in America\\" , Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Retrieved August 19, 2006. in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The Journal still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert.Caricaturist Captures the Corporate Market , Biz Bash Orlando, August 11, 2008. The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more \\"lifestyle\\" sections. The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997. =News Corporation and News Corp= On May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.For background and sequel, see: Ellison, Sarah, War at the Wall Street Journal: Inside the Struggle To Control an American Business Empire, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010. (Also published as: War at The Wall Street Journal: How Rupert Murdoch Bought an American Icon, Sydney, Text Publishing, 2010.) Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The US$5billion sale added The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, financial network unit and London's The Times, and locally within New York, the New York Post, along with Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9). On December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation. In an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the Journals news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent:L. Gordon Crovitz, \\"A Report to Our Readers\\". The Wall Street Journal (New York), page A14, August 1, 2007. A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor. A 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long \\"expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations\\". Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when \\"Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.\\" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.Steve Stecklow, Aaron O. Patrick, Martin Peers, and Andrew Higgins, \\"Calling the shots: In Murdoch's career, a hand in the news; his aggressive style can blur boundaries; 'Buck stops with me'\\" , The Wall Street Journal, June 5, 2007. In 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the Journal agreed to run \\"articles\\" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising. The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice. As a result, the then Wall Street Journal Europe CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue. Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created. The Journal, along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp. In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the Journal editor-in- chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections. The new \\"Business & Finance\\" section combined the former \\"Business & Tech\\" and \\"Money & Investing\\" sections. The new \\"Life & Arts\\" section took the place of \\"Personal Journal\\" and \\"Arena\\". In addition, the Journal \\"Greater New York\\" coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper. The \\"Personal Journal\\" section branding was brought back in July 2020. =Recent milestones= * WSJ Noted., a monthly digital magazine, launches on June 30, 2020 in a bid to attract younger readers. * Reaches 3 million subscribers in May 2020 *WSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011. *WSJ Weekend, the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: \\"Off Duty\\" and \\"Review\\". *\\"Greater New York\\", a stand-alone, full color section dedicated to the New York metro area, launched April 2010. *The Wall Street Journal San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print Journal and every day on online at WSJ.com/SF. *WSJ Weekend, formerly called Saturday's Weekend Edition: September 2005. *Launch of Today's Journal, which included both the addition of Personal Journal and color capacity to the Journal: April 2002. *Launch of The Wall Street Journal Sunday: September 12, 1999.

The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As; with Noted staff. Editorial board The Wall Street Journal editorial board members oversee the Journal's editorial page and represent the newspaper and its editorial page publicly. The Wall Street Journal does not provide details on the exact duties of board members. Every Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the Editorial Page, appear on Fox News Channel's Journal Editorial Report to discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958‚Äì1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972‚Äì2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.Richard Vetter, \\"Wall Street Journal\\", in Bruce Frohnen, ed. American Conservatism (2006), pp. 898‚Äì99. Editorial page and political stance The Journal won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to Robert L. Bartley in 1980 and Joseph Rago in 2011; for criticism to Manuela Hoelterhoff in 1983 and Joe Morgenstern in 2005; and for commentary to Vermont Royster in 1984, Paul Gigot in 2000, Dorothy Rabinowitz in 2001, Bret Stephens in 2013, and Peggy Noonan in 2017. The Journal describes the history of its editorials: Its historical position was much the same. As former editor William H. Grimes wrote in 1951: Each Thanksgiving the editorial page prints two articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled The Desolate Wilderness, and describes what the Pilgrims saw when they arrived at the Plymouth Colony. The second is titled And the Fair Land, and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, Vermont C. Royster, whose Christmas article In Hoc Anno Domini has appeared every December 25 since 1949. Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the Columbia Journalism Review criticized the Journal editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. In July 2020, more than 280 Journal journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages' \\"lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence,\\" adding, \\"opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by WSJ reporting.\\" The editorial board responded that its opinion pages ‚Äúwon‚Äôt wilt under cancel- culture pressure‚Äù and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the Journals news content and offer alternative views to \\"the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today‚Äôs media.\\" The board‚Äôs response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter. =Economic views= During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity. In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates. On September 12, 2018, the Census Bureau released data showing improvement in household income and the poverty rate during 2017, Trump's first year in office. The Journal published an editorial that day attributing the improvement to Trump's purportedly superior economic policies, compared to Obama's. However, The Journals news division reported that both figures also showed improvement in 2015 and 2016, and they improved to a greater degree in both those years than they did in 2017.Table 2: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical- poverty-people.html =Political stance= Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, being interviewed by the Journal The Journal editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in American conservative circles. Despite this, the Journal refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958‚Äì1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972‚Äì2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis. Some of the Journal former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase. The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984, editorial, the board wrote: \\"If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be open borders.\\" This stand on immigration reform places the Journal in contrast to most conservative activists, politicians, and media publications, such as National Review and The Washington Times, who favor heightened restrictions on immigration. The Journal editorial page has been seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill.Wagner, Michael W., and Timothy P. Collins. \\"Does Ownership Matter? The case of Rupert Murdoch's purchase of the Wall Street Journal\\". Journalism Practice (2014) 8#6 pp: 1‚Äì14. online The Journal editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy. On October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia. In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation. The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within the Wall Street Journal, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility. =Science= The Journal editorial board has promoted fringe views on scientific matters, including climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos. Scholars have drawn similarities between the Journal's fringe coverage of climate change and how it used to reject the settled science on acid rain and ozone depletion. Climate change denial The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. The Journal disputes that it poses a major threat to human existence and can be prevented through public policy and has published articles disputing that global warming is occurring at all. The Journal is regarded as a forum for climate change deniers,Shaun W. Elsasser, Riley E. Dunlap: Leading Voices in the Denier Choir: Conservative Columnists' Dismissal of Global Warming and Denigration of Climate Science. American Behavioral Scientist 57, No. 6, 2013, 754‚Äì776, .Karen Akerlof et al.: Communication of climate projections in US media amid politicization of model science. Nature Climate Change 2, 2012, 648‚Äì654 . publishing articles by individuals that reject the consensus position on climate change in its op-ed section. These columns frequently attack climate scientists and accuse them of engaging in fraud. A 2015 study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.Lauren Feldman et al.: Polarizing news? Representations of threat and efficacy in leading US newspapers' coverage of climate change. Public Understanding of Science 2015, . The Washington Post has characterized the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs editorial pages as \\"the beating heart of climate-change skepticism.\\" Climate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, has assessed that multiple opinion articles range between \\"low\\" and \\"very low\\" in terms of scientific credibility. The Journal has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change.Remarkable Editorial Bias On Climate Science At The Wall Street Journal , Peter Gleick, Forbes, January 27, 2012. According to a 2016 analysis, 14% of the guest editorials presented the results of \\"mainstream climate science\\", while the majority did not. Also, none of 201 editorials published in the Wall Street Journal since 1997 have conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change.  Other science coverage  In the 1980s and 1990s, the Journal published numerous columns disputing and misrepresenting the science behind acid rain and the scientific consensus behind the causes of ozone depletion and the health harms of second- hand smoke, and opposed public policy efforts to curb acid rain, ozone depletion and second-hand smoke. The Journal has also published columns attacking efforts to control pesticides and asbestos. By the 2000s, the Journal editorial board recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap- and-trade had been successful. =Bias in news pages= Pre-Murdoch Ownership The Journals editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. According to CNN in 2007, the Journal's \\"newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.\\" In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo argue the Journal news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of The Journal was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or The New York Times). The study did not factor in editorials. Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that \\"..the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.\\" [The authors assume that] \\"think tank ideology [...] only matters to liberals.\\" The company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1, 2007 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to \\"maintain the values and integrity of the Journal.\\" During Trump presidency In 2016 and 2017, the Journal leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom, who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid. Particularly controversial was the Journals November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's false claim that \\"millions of people\\" had voted illegally in the election, without noting that this statement was inaccurate. Also controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to Journal editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase \\"seven majority-Muslim countries\\" when writing about Trump's executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note \\"clarifying that there was 'no ban'\\" on the phrase, \\"but that the publication should 'always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.'\\" At a town-hall-style meeting with Journal staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being \\"dragged into the political process\\" through a dispute with the Trump administration. In June 2020, following the George Floyd killing and subsequent protests, journalists at the Journal sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance. The reporters stated that they \\"frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources‚Äô credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities\\". On 19 February 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing. China accused the ‚ÄúWall Street Journal‚Äù of failing to apologize for publishing articles that slandered China‚Äôs efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible. Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes The Journal has won 37 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting. =1987: RJR Nabisco buyout= In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO. =1988: Insider trading= In the 1980s, then Journal reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg, who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his book, Den of Thieves. =1997: AIDS treatment= David Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement.Sanford, David. \\"Back to the Future: One Man's AIDS Tale Shows How Quickly Epidemic Has Turned \\". The Wall Street Journal (New York), November 8, 1997.

(PDF). and wrote a book, 24 Days. =2001: 9/11= The Journal claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.Bussey, John. \\"The Eye of the Storm: One Journey Through Desperation and Chaos \\". The Wall Street Journal, page A1, September 12, 2001. Retrieved August 8, 2007. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then- Foreign Editor John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories. The Journal subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from The Wall Street Journal bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.Cullison, Alan, and Andrew Higgins. \\"Forgotten Computer Reveals Thinking Behind Four Years of Al Qaeda Doings\\". The Wall Street Journal (New York), December 31, 2001. It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. =2007: Stock option scandal= In 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic Gold Medal, for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value. =2008: Bear Stearns fall= Kate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns. =2010: McDonald's health care= A report published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report \\"speculative and misleading\\", stating they had no plans to drop coverage. The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets. =2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB= In 2015, a report published by the Journal alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper. The report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation. On 28 July 2020, Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1MDB scandal. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. =2015‚Äìpresent: Theranos investigation= In 2015, a report written by the Journal John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors. According to Vanity Fair, \\"a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham‚Äîthat its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment.\\" The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility. On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges in relation to her role as CEO of Theranos. Rupert Murdoch ‚Äî at the time a major investor in Theranos and owner of the Journal ‚Äî lost approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos. =2018‚Äìpresent: Investigation into Stormy Daniels payment= On January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in the Wall Street Journal that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair. In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered. In April of that year, FBI agents stormed the home of Michael Cohen (lawyer) seizing records related to the transaction. In August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment. The coverage earned them the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.

It is thus important in human development. GH also stimulates production of IGF-1 and increases the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to the receptors on certain types of cells. GH is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland. A recombinant form of hGH called somatreopleopin (INN) is used as a prescription drug to treat children's growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies by prescription from a licensed health care provider. In recent years in the United States, some health care providers are prescribing growth hormone in the elderly to increase vitality. While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial. Many of the functions of hGH remain unknown. In its role as an anabolic agent, HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982, and has been banned by the IOC and NCAA. Traditional urine analysis does not detect doping with HGH, so the ban was not enforced until the early 2000s, when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by WADA at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece targeted primarily HGH. Use of the drug for performance enhancement is not currently approved by the FDA. GH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in industrial agriculture and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production. These uses have been controversial. In the United States, the only FDA- approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called bovine somatotropin for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin. Nomenclature The names somatotropin (STH) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hGH. The main growth hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology has the approved generic name (INN) somatropin and the brand name Humatrope, and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992 Humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent, and in this context is referred to as HGH. Biology =Gene= Genes for human growth hormone, known as growth hormone 1 (somatotropin; pituitary growth hormone) and growth hormone 2 (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to human chorionic somatomammotropin (also known as placental lactogen) genes. GH, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and prolactin belong to a group of homologous hormones with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity. =Structure= The major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species, only human and Old World monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor. Several molecular isoforms of GH exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood. In particular, a variant of approximately 20 kDa originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio, while recently an additional variant of ~ 23-24 kDa has also been reported in post-exercise states at higher proportions. This variant has not been identified, but it has been suggested to coincide with a 22 kDa glycosylated variant of 23 kDa identified in the pituitary gland. Furthermore, these variants circulate partially bound to a protein (growth hormone-binding protein, GHBP), which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor, and an acid-labile subunit (ALS). =Regulation= Secretion of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. These cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or somatocrinin) and growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH or somatostatin) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary. GH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion. Somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete GH in a pulsatile manner, in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus. The largest and most predictable of these GH peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 ng/mL. Otherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals. Nearly fifty percent of GH secretion occurs during the third and fourth NREM sleep stages. Surges of secretion during the day occur at 3- to 5-hour intervals. The plasma concentration of GH during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 ng/mL. Between the peaks, basal GH levels are low, usually less than 5 ng/mL for most of the day and night. Additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of GH described in all cases less than 1 ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 ng/mL. A number of factors are known to affect GH secretion, such as age, sex, diet, exercise, stress, and other hormones. Young adolescents secrete GH at the rate of about 700 Œºg/day, while healthy adults secrete GH at the rate of about 400 Œºg/day. Sleep deprivation generally suppresses GH release, particularly after early adulthood. Stimulators of growth hormone (GH) secretion include: * Peptide hormones ** GHRH (somatocrinin) through binding to the growth hormone- releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) ** Ghrelin through binding to growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHSR) * Sex hormones ** Increased androgen secretion during puberty (in males from testes and in females from adrenal cortex) ** Testosterone and DHEA ** Estrogen * Clonidine and L-DOPA by stimulating GHRH release * Œ±4Œ≤2 nicotinic agonists, including nicotine, which also act synergistically with clonidine. * Hypoglycemia, arginine and propranolol by inhibiting somatostatin release * Deep sleep *Insulin *Glucagon * Niacin as nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) * Fasting * Vigorous exercise Inhibitors of GH secretion include: * GHIH (somatostatin) from the periventricular nucleus * circulating concentrations of GH and IGF-1 (negative feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus) * Hyperglycemia * Glucocorticoids * Dihydrotestosterone * Phenothiazines In addition to control by endogenous and stimulus processes, a number of foreign compounds (xenobiotics such as drugs and endocrine disruptors) are known to influence GH secretion and function. =Function= Main pathways in endocrine regulation of growth Effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic (building up). Like most other protein hormones, GH acts by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of cells. Increased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of GH. Height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms: # Because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble, they cannot penetrate cell membranes. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. # GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth. In addition to increasing height in children and adolescents, growth hormone has many other effects on the body: * Increases calcium retention, and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone * Increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy * Promotes lipolysis * Increases protein synthesis * Stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain * Plays a role in homeostasis * Reduces liver uptake of glucose * Promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver * Contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets * Stimulates the immune system * Increases deiodination of T4 to T3T.F. Davies (ed.), A Case-Based Guide to Clinical Endocrinology, 2008, pag.16 Biochemistry GH has a short biological half-life of about 10 to 20 minutes.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/021148s049lbl.pdf Clinical significance =Excess= The most common disease of GH excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. These somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly, gradually producing more and more GH. For years, the principal clinical problems are those of GH excess. Eventually, the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches, impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves, or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement. Prolonged GH excess thickens the bones of the jaw, fingers and toes, resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits, referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function. GH-secreting tumors are typically recognized in the fifth decade of life. It is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood, but, when it does, the excessive GH can cause excessive growth, traditionally referred to as pituitary gigantism. Surgical removal is the usual treatment for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like octreotide (somatostatin agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) can be used to block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary. =Deficiency= The effects of growth hormone (GH) deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur. Alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin, or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin. Major manifestations of GH deficiency in children are growth failure, the development of a short stature, and delayed sexual maturity. In adults, somatomedin alteration contributes to increased osteoclast activity, resulting in weaker bones that are more prone to pathologic fracture and osteoporosis. However, deficiency is rare in adults, with the most common cause being a pituitary adenoma. Other adult causes include a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or trauma, and very rarely idiopathic GHD. Adults with GHD \\"tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life\\". Diagnosis of GH deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process, usually culminating in GH stimulation tests to see if the patient's pituitary gland will release a pulse of GH when provoked by various stimuli. Psychological effects =Quality of life= Several studies, primarily involving patients with GH deficiency, have suggested a crucial role of GH in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level. Adults with GH deficiency often have higher rates of depression than those without. While GH replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of GH deficiency, the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown. =Cognitive function= GH has also been studied in the context of cognitive function, including learning and memory. GH in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of GH deficiency. Medical uses =Replacement therapy= Treatment with exogenous GH is indicated only in limited circumstances, and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects. GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, benefits have variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being. =Other approved uses= GH can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH. Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are Turner syndrome, chronic kidney failure, Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, and severe idiopathic short stature. Higher (\\"pharmacologic\\") doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal (\\"physiologic\\"). Despite the higher doses, side-effects during treatment are rare, and vary little according to the condition being treated. One version of rHGH has also been FDA approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to AIDS. =Off-label use= Off-label prescription of HGH is controversial and may be illegal.DEA, US Department of Justice. DEA: Genotropin Quote: \\"The illicit distribution of hGH occurs as the result of physicians illegally prescribing it for off-label uses, and for the treatment of FDA-approved medical conditions without examination and supervision\\" Claims for GH as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the New England Journal of Medicine published a study wherein GH was used to treat 12 men over 60. At the conclusion of the study, all the men showed statistically significant increases in lean body mass and bone mineral density, while the control group did not. The authors of the study noted that these improvements were the opposite of the changes that would normally occur over a 10- to 20-year aging period. Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti- aging agent.Stephen Barrett, M.D. Growth Hormone Schemes and Scams This has led to organizations such as the controversial American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine promoting the use of this hormone as an \\"anti-aging agent\\". A Stanford University School of Medicine meta-analysis of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of GH on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2 kg and decreased body fat by the same amount. However, these were the only positive effects from taking GH. No other critical factors were affected, such as bone density, cholesterol levels, lipid measurements, maximal oxygen consumption, or any other factor that would indicate increased fitness. Researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength, which led them to believe that GH merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth. This would explain the increase in lean body mass. GH has also been used experimentally to treat multiple sclerosis, to enhance weight loss in obesity, as well as in fibromyalgia, heart failure, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and burns. GH has also been used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total parenteral nutrition. In 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the Crime Control Act of 1990, that amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances and added a new section that stated that a person who \\"knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services\\" has committed a felony.Mannfred A. Hollinger. Introduction to Pharmacology, Third Edition. CRC Press, 2002 Pg 37621 U.S. Code ¬ß 333 - Penalties The Drug Enforcement Administration of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH. This section has also been interpreted by some doctors, most notably the authors of a commentary article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005, as meaning that prescribing HGH off- label may be considered illegal. And some articles in the popular press, such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off- label use (with concern of ethics violations) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe HGH off-label: \\"Unlike other prescription drugs, HGH may be prescribed only for specific uses. U.S. sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands.\\" At the same time, anti-aging clinics where doctors prescribe, administer, and sell HGH to people are big business. In a 2012 article in Vanity Fair, when asked how HGH prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients estimated to have HGH-deficiency, Dragos Roman, who leads a team at the FDA that reviews drugs in endocrinology, said \\"The F.D.A. doesn't regulate off-label uses of H.G.H. Sometimes it's used appropriately. Sometimes it's not.\\" =Side effects= Injection-site reaction is common. More rarely, patients can experience joint swelling, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and an increased risk of diabetes. In some cases, the patient can produce an immune response against GH. GH may also be a risk factor for Hodgkin's lymphoma. One survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver GH (which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established. Performance enhancement The first description of the use of GH as a doping agent was Dan Duchaine's \\"Underground Steroid handbook\\" which emerged from California in 1982; it is not known where and when GH was first used this way. Athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance. Some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes. Many athletic societies ban the use of GH and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it. However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor. Dietary supplements To capitalize on the idea that GH might be useful to combat aging, companies selling dietary supplements have websites selling products linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as \\"HGH Releasers\\". Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements, it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations. Agricultural use In the United States, it is legal to give a bovine GH to dairy cows to increase milk production, and is legal to use GH in raising cows for beef; see article on Bovine somatotropin, cattle feeding, dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy. The use of GH in poultry farming is illegal in the United States. Similarly, no chicken meat for sale in Australia is administered hormones. Several companies have attempted to have a version of GH for use in pigs (porcine somatotropin) approved by the FDA but all applications have been withdrawn. Drug development history The identification, purification and later synthesis of growth hormone is associated with Choh Hao Li. Genentech pioneered the first use of recombinant human growth hormone for human therapy in 1981. Prior to its production by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers. Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed. Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy to the treatment of idiopathic short stature. Very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an Old World monkey, the rhesus macaque, were conducted by John C. Beck and colleagues in Montreal, in the late 1950s. The study published in 1957, which was conducted on \\"a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma,\\" found that: \\"Human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage ... (and) there was a retention of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium. ... There was a gain in body weight during both periods. ... There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone. This was most marked with the human growth hormone. ... Impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone. No change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone.\\" The other study, published in 1958, was conducted on six people: the same subject as the Science paper; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years; a 15-year-old female with well- documented hypopituitarism secondary to a craniopharyngioma; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases; a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease. In 1985, unusual cases of Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease were found in individuals that had received cadaver-derived HGH ten to fifteen years previously. Based on the assumption that infectious prions causing the disease were transferred along with the cadaver-derived HGH, cadaver-derived HGH was removed from the market. In 1985, biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the U.S. and elsewhere. As of 2005, recombinant growth hormones available in the United States (and their manufacturers) included Nutropin (Genentech), Humatrope (Lilly), Genotropin (Pfizer), Norditropin (Novo), and Saizen (Merck Serono). In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a version of rHGH called Omnitrope (Sandoz). A sustained-release form of growth hormone, Nutropin Depot (Genentech and Alkermes) was approved by the FDA in 1999, allowing for fewer injections (every 2 or 4 weeks instead of daily); however, the product was discontinued by Genentech/Alkermes in 2004 for financial reasons (Nutropin Depot required significantly more resources to produce than the rest of the Nutropin line).

The Princes Highway runs through the town that is approximately south of Sydney and from Canberra. At the , Moruya had a population of 3982. Its built up area had a population of 2,525. The town relies predominantly on agriculture, aquaculture, and tourism. Moruya is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire Council and the shire chambers are located in the town. Rural areas around Moruya were affected by the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. History The South Coast region of New South Wales is the traditional home of the Yuin People, with the area in and around Moruya home to the Bugelli-Manji clan. The name Moruya is derived from an Aboriginal Tharawal word () believed to mean \\"home of the black swan\\", although this is not probable and not verifiable. Black swans can be seen in the lakes and rivers around Moruya, and the black swan is used locally as an emblem. European settlement commenced in the 1820s following the extension of the limits of location in 1829, although the coast from Bateman's Bay to Moruya was surveyed the previous year by Surveyor Thomas Florance. The first European settler was Francis Flanagan, a tailor from Ireland who was granted title to four square miles on the north bank of the river at Shannon View in 1829. In 1830, the next settler, John Hawdon, set up a squat at Bergalia but being beyond the limits, could not gain title to the land. However, in 1831 he was granted land on the north bank of the river, upstream from Flanagan. He called the property Kiora and it also occupied four square miles. A village named after the property soon grew. In 1835, across the river from Flanagan, William Morris, squatted a block he called Gundary. William Campbell took up as a manager there and eventually bought the place himself in 1845. The town centre was surveyed in 1850 by surveyor Parkinson and the town gazetted in 1851. It centred about the track opposite where the road from Broulee terminated at the river bank, the two being linked by a punt. As there was a blacksmith on that track, it was named Vulcan Street. Campbell Street owed its name to the squatter, Queen Street to patriotism and Church Street to the Catholic Church's presence there. Land sales commenced in 1852. Moruya was proclaimed a municipality in 1891. Local industries were timber getting, gold mining, dairying and quarrying for granite. The first bridge across the Moruya River was erected in 1876 though frequent flooding saw new bridges erected in 1900 and 1945 and, most recently, in 1966. During World War II Moruya aerodrome was used as an advanced operational base. The trawler Dureenbee was attacked offshore between Moruya and Batemans Bay by a Japanese submarine on 3 August 1942. On 25 December 1944 the US liberty ship was torpedoed off Moruya by the German submarine U-862, sinking the next day between Moruya and Bega. Casualties were 2 dead and 67 survivors.  Heritage listings  Moruya has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Moruya and District Historical Society 85 Campbell Street: Abernethy and Co Stonemason's Lathe * 13 Page Street: Moruya Mechanics' Institute Moruya granite Moruya is known for its granite stone that was used to build significant Australian landmarks including the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The granite used in the Harbour Bridge pylons was quarried in the area. The proximity of the quarries to the water meant it could be easily transported to Sydney. Quarrying for granite commenced in the district in the late 1850s by the brothers Joseph and John Flett Louttit who were from the Orkney Islands. Their quarry on the south side of the river produced stone for many Sydney landmarks including the columns of the General Post Office in Martin Place, and the base of the Captain Cook statue in Hyde Park. The Moruya Quarry, also known as the Government Quarry, opened in 1876 on the northern bank of the Moruya River. From 1925 to 1932, the Harbour Bridge works saw 250 stonemasons employed and relocated to Moruya by the contractor to produce of dimension stone for the bridge pylons, 173,000 blocks, and 200,000 yards of crushed stone that was used as aggregate for concrete. Moruya granite was also used for the Sydney Cenotaph in Martin Place. During the seven years of this work, a small town of about 70 houses grew up near the quarry called Granitetown; little remains of the town today. The quarry had a tramway that closed in 1931.Tramways of the Sydney Harbour Bridge Granite Quarry - Moruya Light Railways issue 133 July 1996 pages 3-9Coat hanger turns 80' Track & Signal issue 16/1 February 2012 page 61 The Moruya Quarry is operated by the New South Wales Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources. There was a third quarry west of the Moruya Quarry operated by the Ziegler family.http://granitetown.com.au/moruyahistory/  Retail  Moruya has various retailers, banks and services located on the high street, whilst supermarkets are located on the side streets. Harris Scarfe has a store in the town, it being a former branch of Goulburn retailer Allen's. Moruya has two supermarkets, one is a 10-aisle Woolworths (opened in 2000) and an IGA (opened in 2013). The former 8-aisle Franklins, which opened on 28 June 2011, ceased trading in February 2013. Moruya is also home to the regional telecommunications company, Southern Phone. The Tuesday afternoon and Saturday markets and fruit and vegetable markets are popular with local people and visitors. Landmarks Moruya Airport (code MYA) is located on the north side of Moruya Heads. The strip adjoins the beachfront, and flights to Moruya offer a slow and picturesque descent along the coastline. Regional Express (REX) flies mostly Saab 340B aircraft from Moruya to Sydney and Moruya to Merimbula, with connecting flights to Melbourne.

Forward. It is propelled by a microwave sail, similar to a solar sail in concept, but powered by microwaves from a human-made source. It would fly through the target system without slowing down.  Description  \\"Starwisp\\" is a concept for an ultra-low-mass interstellar probe pushed by a microwave beam. It was proposed by scientist and author Robert L. Forward in 1985, and further work was published by Geoffrey A. Landis in 2000.Landis, Geoffrey A. \\"Microwave Pushed Interstellar Sail: Starwisp Revisited\\" (paper AIAA-2000-3337, presented at the AIAA 36th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, Huntsville AL, July 17‚Äì19, 2000). The proposed device uses beam- powered propulsion in the form of a high-power microwave antenna pushing a sail. The probe itself would consist of a mesh of extremely fine carbon wires about 100 m across, with the wires spaced the same distance apart as the 3 mm wavelength of the microwaves that will be used to push it. Forward proposed that the wires would incorporate nanoscale computer circuitry, sensors, microwave power collection systems and microwave radio transmitters fabricated on the wire surfaces, giving the probe data collection and transmission capability. Being distributed across the entire sail, no \\"rigging\\" is needed, as would be the case if the mission electronics were placed in a separate probe that was pulled by the sail. The original Starwisp concept assumed that the microwaves would be efficiently reflected, with the wire mesh surface acting as a superconductor and nearly perfectly efficient mirror. This assumption is not valid. Landis showed that a grid will absorb a significant fraction of the power incident on it, and therefore cannot stay cool enough to be superconducting. The design is thermally limited, hence the use of carbon as the material in Landis's concept. Low mass was the key feature of the Starwisp probe. In Landis's calculations, the mesh has a density of only 100 kg/km2, for a total mass of 1 kg, plus a payload of 80 grams. Although the diffraction limit severely constrains the range of the transmitting antenna, the probe is designed to have an extremely high acceleration of 24 m/s2, so that it can reach a significant fraction of the speed of light within a very short distance, before passing out of range. The antenna uses a microwave lens 560 km in diameter, would transmit 56 GW of power, and would accelerate the probe to 10% of the speed of light. The probe would cruise without power for decades until it finally approached the target star, at which point the antenna which launched it would again target its beam on Starwisp. This would be done when the Starwisp was about 80% of the way to its destination, so that the beam and Starwisp would arrive there at the same time. At such extreme long range the antenna would be unable to provide any propulsion, but Starwisp would be able to use its wire sail to collect and convert some of the microwave energy into electricity to operate its sensors and transmit the data it collects back home. Starwisp would not slow down at the target star, performing a high-speed flyby mission instead. Since the antenna is only required for a few days at Starwisp's launch and again for another few days several decades later to power it while it passes its target, Starwisp probes might be mass-produced and launched by the maser every few days. In this manner, a continuous stream of data could be collected about distant solar systems even though any given Starwisp probe only spends a few days travelling through it. Alternatively, the launching transmitter could be used in the interim to transmit power to Earth for commercial use, as with a solar power satellite. Possible methods of fabrication Constructing such a delicate probe would be a significant challenge. One proposed method would be to \\"paint\\" the probe and its circuitry onto an enormous sheet of plastic which degrades when exposed to ultraviolet light, and then wait for the sheet to evaporate away under the assault of solar UV after it has been deployed in space. Another proposed method noted that the Starwisp probe wires were of the same physical scale as wires and circuit elements on modern computer microchips and could be produced by the same photolithographic fabrication technologies as those of computer chips. The probe would have to be built in sections the size of current chip fabrication silicon wafers and then connected together.  Technical problems  A major problem this design would face would be the radiation encountered en route. Travelling at 20% of light speed, ordinary interstellar hydrogen would become a significant radiation hazard, and the Starwisp would be without shielding and likely without active self-repair capability. Another problem would be keeping the acceleration of the Starwisp uniform enough across its sail area so that its delicate wires would not tear or be twisted out of shape. Distorting the shape of the Starwisp even slightly could result in a runaway catastrophe, since one portion of the Starwisp would be reflecting microwaves in a different direction than the other portion and be thrust even farther out of shape. Such delicate and finely-balanced control may prove impossible to realize. The possibility of using a dusty plasma sail in which a dusty substance that is maintained as a plasma within space is responsible for the reflection of electromagnetic radiation could circumvent problems associated with radiation damage to the medium responsible for the transfer of radiation pressure (the dusty plasma sail might not be as easy to damage as a thin film or the like). Dusty plasma sails can also adapt their three-dimensional structure in real time to ensure reflection perpendicular to any incident light/microwave beam.

In 1993, the group signed to Warp Records and released their debut album Bytes. In 1995, Handley and Turner departed the Black Dog to work on their spin-off project Plaid, leaving Downie to continue recording under the name. The band's early EPs were collected on the 2007 compilation Book of Dogma. Biography =Early career= In 1989, The Black Dog was unable to find a label to back its releases and started its own, Black Dog Productions, which released four vinyl records including the acclaimed Virtual. These were followed by a number of EPs on the General Production Recordings label. The Black Dog released their first full-length album Bytes on Warp Records on 15 March 1993. The albums Temple of Transparent Balls (GPR) and Spanners (Warp) followed. The music was often produced under a number of different names, such as Close Up Over, Xeper, Atypic, I.A.O., Balil and the Discordian Popes. The group did numerous remixes, notably for Bj√∂rk, with whom it collaborated on \\"'Sweet Intuition\\" (a B-side on the \\"Army of Me\\" CD single) and \\"Charlene\\" (a b side on the \\"Isobel\\" CD single). In the early 1990s, Downie was also running a bulletin board system called Black Dog Towers. In 1995, Handley and Turner left to focus on PlaidPlaid biography on NME.com but Downie continued working as The Black Dog on his own for a while, releasing the solo album Music for Adverts (and Short Films). With new management, and an increased vigour, Downie then teamed up with Steve 'Hotdog' Ash and Ross Knight (\\"thek1d\\"). Though they completed over a dozen critically acclaimed remixes during this period, only one album was ever released: Unsavoury Products featured the talents of Parisian beat poet Black Sifichi on vocals. =Current line-up= In 2001, Downie teamed up with Richard and Martin Dust, owners of the label Dust Science Recordings. Since then, they have started to play live again and have released eight EPs and four full-length albums on Dust Science.The Black Dog profile on the Dust Science website Their first album, Silenced, was released in 2005. The second, Radio Scarecrow, was released in 2008 and was very well receivedReviews at dogsquad.co.uk and nominated for DJ Mag's Best of British 2008. The follow-up to Radio Scarecrow, Further Vexations, was released in 2009. It was described as having a dark cynicism of Orwellian practices of government and the passivity of the general public. \\"We‚Äôve helplessly watched with mounting horror, while the government trashed the country, signed away its sovereignty to Brussels (with a flourish of a specially minted silver pen), sold off precious national industries and assets at next to bargain basement prices, and indulged itself with two utterly pointless wars which it couldn‚Äôt afford,\\" the group stated on their home page. In May 2010, the Black Dog teamed with creative agency \\"Human\\" to create Music for Real Airports,Music For Real Airports - The Project described by them as \\"a contemporary reply to Brian Eno's work from the 70s\\". While Eno's album is well known for being peaceful and sedate, The Black Dog intend theirs to be tense and bittersweet, saying \\"This record is not necessarily a comfortable listen. But it captures the spectrum of emotions stirred by airports.\\"Music For Real Airports - The Project Side projects The initial lineup kept themselves busy with numerous alter-egos and side- projects, including Echo Mike, Close Up Over, Xeper, Atypic, I.A.O., Plaid, Balil and the Discordian Popes. 1993's Bytes compiles an album's worth of tracks by these side projects under the mantle of Black Dog Productions. Of these side-projects, only Plaid continues to be active. More recently, the current lineup of The Black Dog (Ken Downie with Martin and Richard Dust) have collaborated with Psychick Warriors ov Gaia on a new ambient project called Dadavistic Orchestra. Taking inspiration from the Dada artists of the early 1900s, Dadavistic Orchestra have issued an album and two EPs, offering limited edition gelatin silver prints in homage to avant-garde photographer Man Ray with early copies sold via mail order.

In terrestrial radio broadcasting the radio waves are broadcast by a land-based radio station, while in satellite radio the radio waves are broadcast by a satellite in Earth orbit. To receive the content the listener must have a broadcast radio receiver (radio). Stations are often affiliated with a radio network which provides content in a common radio format, either in broadcast syndication or simulcast or both. Radio stations broadcast with several different types of modulation: AM radio stations transmit in AM (amplitude modulation), FM radio stations transmit in FM (frequency modulation), which are older analog audio standards, while newer digital radio stations transmit in several digital audio standards: DAB (digital audio broadcasting), HD radio, DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale). Television broadcasting is a separate service which also uses radio frequencies to broadcast television (video) signals. History Advertisement placed in the 5 November 1919 Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant announcing PCGG's debut broadcast scheduled for the next evening.\\"Vintage Radio Web: Philips\\" (vintageradio.nl) The earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio. For audio broadcasts to be possible, electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated. The thermionic valve (a kind of vacuum tube) was invented in 1904 by the English physicist John Ambrose Fleming. He developed a device he called an \\"oscillation valve\\" (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, or cathode, was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate (or anode) when it was at a higher voltage. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons. Later known as the Fleming valve, it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector. This greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat's whisker. However, what was still required was an amplifier. The triode (mercury-vapor filled with a control grid) was patented on March 4, 1906, by the Austrian Robert von Lieben DRP 179807Tapan K. Sarkar (ed.) \\"History of wireless\\", John Wiley and Sons, 2006. , p.335S≈çgo Okamura (ed), History of Electron Tubes, IOS Press, 1994 page 20 independent from that, on October 25, 1906, Lee De Forest patented his three-element Audion. It wasn't put to practical use until 1912 when its amplifying ability became recognized by researchers. By about 1920, valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable. However, an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on Christmas Eve in 1906 by Reginald Fessenden, although this is disputed.Fessenden ‚Äî The Next Chapter RWonline.com While many early experimenters attempted to create systems similar to radiotelephone devices by which only two parties were meant to communicate, there were others who intended to transmit to larger audiences. Charles Herrold started broadcasting in California in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year. (Herrold's station eventually became KCBS). In The Hague, the Netherlands, PCGG started broadcasting on November 6, 1919, making it, arguably the first commercial broadcasting station. In 1916, Frank Conrad, an electrical engineer employed at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, began broadcasting from his Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8XK. Later, the station was moved to the top of the Westinghouse factory building in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Westinghouse relaunched the station as KDKA on November 2, 1920, as the first commercially licensed radio station in America. The commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license; advertisements did not air until years later. The first licensed broadcast in the United States came from KDKA itself: the results of the Harding/Cox Presidential Election. The Montreal station that became CFCF began broadcast programming on May 20, 1920, and the Detroit station that became WWJ began program broadcasts beginning on August 20, 1920, although neither held a license at the time. In 1920, wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England. A famous broadcast from Marconi's New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was made by the famous soprano Dame Nellie Melba on 15 June 1920, where she sang two arias and her famous trill. She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. The 2MT station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922. The BBC was amalgamated in 1922 and received a Royal Charter in 1926, making it the first national broadcaster in the world, followed by Czech Radio and other European broadcasters in 1923. Radio Argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires on August 27, 1920, making its own priority claim. The station got its license on November 19, 1923. The delay was due to the lack of official Argentine licensing procedures before that date. This station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades.Atgelt, Carlos A. \\"Early History of Radio Broadcasting in Argentina.\\" The Broadcast Archive (Oldradio.com). Radio in education soon followed and colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula. Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs. Stations A radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission, though in practice broadcasting transmission (sound and television) take place using both wires and radio waves. The point of this is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology can receive the broadcast. Use of a sound broadcasting station In line to ITU Radio Regulations (article1.61) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily. Types Transmission diagram of sound broadcasting (AM and FM) Broadcasting by radio takes several forms. These include AM and FM stations. There are several subtypes, namely commercial broadcasting, non-commercial educational (NCE) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio, student-run campus radio stations, and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world. Many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using AM technology that can be received over thousands of miles (especially at night). For example, the BBC, VOA, VOR, and Deutsche Welle have transmitted via shortwave to Africa and Asia. These broadcasts are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and solar activity. Nielsen Audio, formerly known as Arbitron, the United States-based company that reports on radio audiences, defines a \\"radio station\\" as a government-licensed AM or FM station; an HD Radio (primary or multicast) station; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station; one of the satellite radio channels from XM Satellite Radio or Sirius Satellite Radio; or, potentially, a station that is not government licensed. =AM= AM broadcasting stations in 2006 AM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to amplitude modulation, a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted. The medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the long wave band. In response to the growing popularity of FM stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some North American stations began broadcasting in AM stereo, though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold. The signal is subject to interference from electrical storms (lightning) and other electromagnetic interference (EMI).Based on the \\"interference\\" entry of The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th edition, online One advantage of AM radio signal is that it can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed; building an unpowered crystal radio receiver was a common childhood project in the early decades of AM broadcasting. AM broadcasts occur on North American airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 kHz (known as the ‚Äústandard broadcast band‚Äù). The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine channels from 1605 to 1705 kHz. Channels are spaced every 10 kHz in the Americas, and generally every 9 kHz everywhere else. AM transmissions cannot be ionospherically propagated during the day due to strong absorption in the D-layer of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment, this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called clear-channel stations. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. During the night, absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections. However, fading of the signal can be severe at night. AM radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15 kHz (now limited to 10 kHz in the US due to FCC rules designed to reduce interference), but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5 kHz or less. At the time that AM broadcasting began in the 1920s, this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones, 78 rpm recordings, and loudspeakers. The fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably, but the receivers did not. Reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference. AM stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area. This prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other. Bob Carver created an AM stereo tuner employing notch filtering that demonstrated that an AM broadcast can meet or exceed the 15 kHz baseband bandwidth allotted to FM stations without objectionable interference. After several years, the tuner was discontinued. Bob Carver had left the company and the Carver Corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely. Shortwave, medium wave and long wave See shortwave for the differences between shortwave, medium wave, and long wave spectra. Shortwave is used largely for national broadcasters, international propaganda, or religious broadcasting organizations. =FM= FM radio broadcast stations in 2006 FM refers to frequency modulation, and occurs on VHF airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz everywhere except Japan and Russia. Russia, like the former Soviet Union, uses 65.9 to 74 MHz frequencies in addition to the world standard. Japan uses the 76 to 90 MHz frequency band. Edwin Howard Armstrong invented FM radio to overcome the problem of radio-frequency interference (RFI), which plagued AM radio reception. At the same time, greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum. Instead of 10 kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US, FM channels are 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) apart. In other countries, greater spacing is sometimes mandatory, such as in New Zealand, which uses 700 kHz spacing (previously 800 kHz). The improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s, but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband FM. Bandwidth of 200 kHz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal -- 20 kHz to 30 kHz is all that is necessary for a narrowband FM signal. The 200 kHz bandwidth allowed room for ¬±75 kHz signal deviation from the assigned frequency, plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. The larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15 kHz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38 kHz stereo \\"subcarrier\\"‚Äîa piggyback signal that rides on the main signal. Additional unused capacity is used by some broadcasters to transmit utility functions such as background music for public areas, GPS auxiliary signals, or financial market data. The AM radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - by a factor of approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion. Propagation speeds (celerities) are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50 MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels. The original FM radio service in the U.S. was the Yankee Network, located in New England.Halper, Donna L. \\"John Shepard's FM Stations‚ÄîAmerica's first FM network.\\" Boston Radio Archives (BostonRadio.org). Regular FM broadcasting began in 1939 but did not pose a significant threat to the AM broadcasting industry. It required purchase of a special receiver. The frequencies used, 42 to 50 MHz, were not those used today. The change to the current frequencies, 88 to 108 MHz, began after the end of World War II and was to some extent imposed by AM broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat. FM radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a commercial venture, it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts' medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station (\\"simulcasting\\"). The FCC limited this practice in the 1960s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and FM tuners, FM became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments. =Pirate radio= Pirate radio is illegal or non- regulated radio transmission. It is most commonly used to describe illegal broadcasting for entertainment or political purposes. Sometimes it is used for illegal two-way radio operation. Its history can be traced back to the unlicensed nature of the transmission, but historically there has been occasional use of sea vessels‚Äîfitting the most common perception of a pirate‚Äîas broadcasting bases. Rules and regulations vary largely from country to country, but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or shortwave signals over a wide range. In some places, radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received‚Äîespecially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered \\"pirate\\" due to the type of content, its transmission format, or the transmitting power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as a webcast or an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations. =Terrestrial digital radio= Digital radio broadcasting has emerged, first in Europe (the UK in 1995 and Germany in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and many other countries worldwide. The simplest system is named DAB Digital Radio, for Digital Audio Broadcasting, and uses the public domain EUREKA 147 (Band III) system. DAB is used mainly in the UK and South Africa. Germany and the Netherlands use the DAB and DAB+ systems, and France uses the L-Band system of DAB Digital Radio. The broadcasting regulators of the United States and Canada have chosen to use HD radio, an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast. HD Radio is owned by a consortium of private companies that is called iBiquity. An international non- profit consortium Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), has introduced the public domain DRM system, which is used by a relatively small number of broadcasters worldwide. Extensions Extensions of traditional radio-wave broadcasting for audio broadcasting in general include cable radio, local wire television networks, DTV radio, satellite radio, and internet radio via streaming media on the Internet. =Satellite= The enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters and restrictions on available radio spectrum licenses has restricted growth of Satellite radio broadcasts. In the US and Canada, just two services, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio exist. Both XM and Sirius are owned by Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which was formed by the merger of XM and Sirius on July 29, 2008, whereas in Canada, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada remained separate companies until 2010. Worldspace in Africa and Asia, and MobaHO! in Japan and the ROK were two unsuccessful satellite radio operators which have gone out of business. Program formats Radio program formats differ by country, regulation, and markets. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission designates the 88-92 megahertz band in the U.S. for non-profit or educational programming, with advertising prohibited. In addition, formats change in popularity as time passes and technology improves. Early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time, known as live broadcasting. As technology for sound recording improved, an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material. A current trend is the automation of radio stations. Some stations now operate without direct human intervention by using entirely pre-recorded material sequenced by computer control.

He was billed as Richard Keith because his Cajun French last name, \\"Thibodeaux\\", was considered too difficult to pronounce by producer Desi Arnaz. He is the last living regular appearing cast member from I Love Lucy. Career Desi Arnaz, Richard Keith, Maurice Chevalier from Lucy Goes To Mexico 1958 With Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz on I Love Lucy (1956) Thibodeaux showed skill on the drums at a young age, and was making $500 a week at the age of 3 while touring with the Horace Heidt Orchestra. His father took him to audition for the part of Little Ricky in 1955, \\"I walked on the set and there was Lucy, she was standing there and she was looking at me,\\" he said. \\"She said 'OK he's cute, but what does he do?' My dad said, 'Well he plays the drums' and she said, 'Oh, come on--I can't believe that.' Then, she says 'Look, we have a drum set over there, go ahead and let him play.' Eventually Desi Arnaz himself came over and started jamming with me on the drums and then he kind of stood up and said 'Well, I think we found Little Ricky.'\\" According to Lucie Arnaz, who was interviewed on the TV show Archive of American Television, he became like part of the family. \\"For a long time I thought Keith was related to us, because he went everywhere with us. Desi (Jr.) considered him his best friend and was responsible for teaching him the drums. He came over our house on many weekends and traveled with them during the summer. My mother kind of adopted him. He is in all of our home movies and photographs growing up and was a great kid, and still is.\\" As a child, he made numerous appearances on The Andy Griffith Show, between 1962 and 1966, as Opie's friend \\"Johnny Paul Jason\\". He also accepted small roles on other popular television shows. In 1964 Thibodeaux appeared for a split second in an episode of The Lucy Show titled \\"Lucy is a Process Server.\\" Initially he was featured in a comedic sequence at a train station in which a vending machine malfunctions. However, the scene was cut when the show ran too long. After the episode was edited, Thibodeaux is only seen for a moment, entering the station. Nevertheless, Thibodeaux remained in the credits listed as Richard Keith, the actor who played \\"Little Boy.\\" In 1969, Thibodeaux joined the rock group David and the Giants who were based in Laurel, Mississippi. The group recorded in its early years with Capitol Records, Fame Records, and Crazy Horse Records, primarily touring throughout the South, and enjoyed a few regional hits which were recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and were well known in the Northern Soul music scene in England. After turning 21 in 1971, Thibodeaux received a final payment of $8000 from a trust fund set up during his days on I Love Lucy Thibodeaux had developed a drug problem and eventually left the band, which broke up. His difficulties led to his becoming a born-again Christian in 1974. He witnessed to the band leader, David Huff, and the other members, who later converted. The group got back together. The band released nearly ten albums in the 1980s and 1990s for CBS Priority Records (Epic Records), The Benson Company, ABC Word Records (Myrrh) label, and the band's own label Giant Records. David and the Giants released a live CD in 2014 titled Still Rockin. In 2017 the band was honored along with other notable Mississippi musicians such as Steve Forbert, Tammy Wynette, George Soule, and Elvis Presley, by receiving \\"The Jimmie\\" Mississippi Dreamers (Jimmie Rodgers Award) for their musical contributions as Mississippi artists at a special concert at Peavey Electronics Corporate headquarters in Meridian, MS, along with Hartley Peavey. A live concert David and the Giants CD/DVD The Best Is Yet To Come was recorded in St. Louis, Mo. in August 2017 celebrating 40 years of David and the Giants music. In 1990, he became the Executive Director for his wife's company, Ballet Magnificat! which tours nationally and internationally. In 2017 the couple pioneered Ballet Magnificat! Brasil dance company and trainee program headquartered in Curitiba, Brazil. Personal life Raised as a Roman Catholic, Thibodeaux went to school at St. Victor's elementary in West Hollywood and St. Jane Frances de Chantal School in North Hollywood. He attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks for two years before his parents separated in 1966. After his parents separated, Keith, his mother, and siblings moved back to Lafayette, Louisiana. He graduated from Lafayette High School where he continued to play drums in rock and rhythm and blues bands. He left Louisiana for Mississippi in late 1969 after going to college for a short period where he said he \\"majored in drinking beer and playing pool\\" to pursue a career with the band David and the Giants. In 1976, he met and married a ballet dancer named Kathy Denton in Jackson, Mississippi. The couple moved briefly to Southern California in 1977 where he was asked to join the pop band Starbuck famous for the late 70s hit \\"Moonlight Feels Right\\". Thibodeaux returned to Mississippi in 1978, where he, his wife and daughter Tara (born 1979) eventually settled in Jackson, Mississippi. Thibodeaux played with jazz bands locally for a brief time before joining a newly revamped Christian rock band, David and the Giants in 1979. Thibodeaux's autobiography Life After Lucy was published in 1994.

History The phrase \\"Islamisation of knowledge\\" was first used and proposed by the Malaysian scholar Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas in his book \\"Islam and Secularism\\" (first published in 1978). It was also proposed by the Palestinian philosopher Ismail Al-Faruqi, in 1982, in response to what he called \\"the malaise of the ummah\\". He argued that by using tools, categories, concepts and modes of analysis that originated wholly in the secular West (like Marxism), there was a disconnect between the ecological and social reality of Muslim nations, and worse, a total inability to respect or even notice the violations of ethics of Islam itself. In his view, clashes between traditionalist ulema and reformers seeking to revive Muslim society with modern science and professional categories, were inevitable without the strong ethical constraints that applied to methods of early Muslim philosophy. He proposed therefore to revive those methods, restore ijtihad and integrate scientific method within Islamic limits. A significant example of the movement to islamize knowledge is the International Institute of Islamic Thought, based in the US state of Virginia.{Citation neededdate=July 2019}} Al-Faruqi died in 1986, but his program has already had a profound effect, especially on Islamic economics, which operates under traditional zero-interest, participatory labor-capital structures, and supports stronger community control of land (as in the traditional practices of haram and hima, the equivalent of the modern watershed protection and wilderness reserve laws). These practices were already well on the way to revival before Al-Faruqi's work, however. Islamic banks remain a relatively minor force in world finance. There are also debates on Islamic science and what it would mean to do science in a way that reflects the ethical teachings of Islam, and accept direction from the ijma on the priorities of such research. Al-Faruqi's analysis, called the \\"Islamization of Knowledge: General Principles and Workplan\\" remains the primary source for this program. Nasr's work on the congruence between classical Islam and the modern ecology movement is thought by some to be even more fundamental, and to suggest parallels between the ethical constraints that secular activists seek to place on science and technology, and the ethical constraints that Islam sought to place on philosophy and politics. An Islamic ecotheology would then converge with economics and put Islamic pillars under a form of ecological economics, with religious authority backing up sustainable development. This would be a significant first step towards Al-Faruqi's overall program. Criticism and debate Critics argue that there are vast differences between the kind of ethics that are applied in the modern labour movement or the anti- globalization movement, for example, and those that would be applied by any believer in the literal interpretation of the Qur'an. Thus, any cooperation of modern ethical reformers and those seeking guidance from classical Islam would be doomed from the start. There are, however, debates regarding Islamic feminism and ethics of technology wherein secular concerns (like vanity, consumerism, competing for attention, technological one-upmanship, runaway technologies) seem to often echo the terms of reference of a classical critique: Catholic theology was well integrated with scientific knowledge from the time of Aquinas to the time of Galileo, and that too was a deliberate program. Critics suggest that this also demonstrates the futility of trying to inhibit scientific research with reference to any religious fundamentalism. In modern times, Pope John Paul II called at times for restraining the sciences to work strictly within a Christian ethical framework, and respect the boundaries between what is known by faith versus reason - his \\"Fides et Ratio\\" and \\"Gospel of Life\\" make some points in common with Al-Faruqi, calling likewise for strong ethical limits and a curtailment of curiosity or \\"knowledge for knowledge's sake\\".

Typically, those labeled as outsider artists have little or no contact with the mainstream art world or art institutions. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states, unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds. The term outsider art was coined by art critic Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut (, \\"raw art\\" or \\"rough art\\"), a label created by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples psychiatric hospital patients and children.Roger Cardinal, Outsider Art, London, 1972Bibliography The 20th Century Art Book. New York, NY: Phaidon Press, 1996. Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream \\"art world\\" or \\"art gallery system\\", regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.\\"What the Dickens is Outsider Art?\\" The Pantograph Punch, December 2016, retrieved 2017-01-16 A more specific term, \\"outsider music\\", was later adapted for musicians.  Art of the mentally ill  Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children and the makers of \\"peasant art\\", was first demonstrated by \\"Der Blaue Reiter\\" group: Wassily Kandinsky, Auguste Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej Jawlensky, and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac. During World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives'. Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein Geisteskranker als K√ºnstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) about Adolf W√∂lfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. W√∂lfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. W√∂lfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf W√∂lfli Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern. A defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.\\"Outsider Art Sourcebook\\" (Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.4) People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia.Cornell case study: Early Onset Schizophrenia ‚Äì William Kurelek In the hospital he painted, producing The Maze, a dark depiction of his tortured youth.British Journal of Psychiatry (2001) He was transferred from the Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with Edward Adamson (1911‚Äì1996), a pioneer of art therapy, and creator of the Adamson Collection.  Jean Dubuffet and art brut View inside the 244x244px French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he called art brut or raw art. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art Brut along with other artists, including Andr√© Breton. The collection he established became known as the Collection de l'art brut. It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland. Dubuffet characterized art brut as: :\\"Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses ‚Äì where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere ‚Äì are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade.\\" ‚Äî Jean Dubuffet. Place √† l'incivisme (Make way for Incivism). Art and Text no.27 (December 1987 ‚Äì February 1988). p.36 Dubuffet's writing on art brut was the subject of a noted program at the Art Club of Chicago in the early 1950s. Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem ‚Äì only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated.  Cultural context  The interest in \\"outsider\\" practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, for example, abandoned \\"painterly\\" technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to re-contextualize existing \\"readymade\\" objects as art. Mid-century artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of \\"primitive\\" societies, the unschooled artwork of children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut ‚Äì of the insane and others at the margins of society ‚Äì is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values.  Terminology  A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as \\"outside\\" of official culture. Definitions of these terms vary and overlap. The editors of Raw Vision, a leading journal in the field, suggest that \\"Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary\\". Consequently, they lament the use of \\"outsider artist\\" to refer to almost any untrained artist. \\"It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or na√Øve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name.\\" *Art Brut: literally translated from French means \\"raw art\\"; 'Raw' in that it has not been through the 'cooking' process: the world of art schools, galleries, museums. Originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely outside culture and society. Strictly speaking it refers only to the Collection de l'art brut. *Folk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe ‚Äì though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill ‚Äì everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society's mainstream. *Intuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, Visionary Art unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art. *Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve Invention; refers to artists on the margins of the art world. *Na√Øve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to \\"normal\\" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists. *Neuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the Collection de l'art brut. *Visionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists ‚Äì range from decorated houses, to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The Palais Ideal by Ferdinand Cheval.  Notable outsider artists  *Nick Blinko (born 1961) is an English musician and artist diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. He is represented in the Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne. He is best known through his works with his band Rudimentary Peni. Justo Gallego in 2005 August Natterer's Weltachse mit Haase (Axle of the World, with Rabbit), 1919 *Sid Boyum (1914‚Äì1991) was an industrial photographer who turned his home and yard into a vast, dense array of concrete and wood sculptures, many of which have since been moved to public locations throughout his neighborhood in Madison, Wisconsin. *Al Carbee (1914‚Äì2005) was a prolific, multi-format artist who is known for his Barbie collages. Carbee created a massive imaginary utopia with his collages, which he called \\"Epicuma\\". When Carbee was in his 80s, his art was discovered accidentally by filmmaker Jeremy Workman, leading to a flurry of interest in his later years. Carbee was the subject of Workman's documentary film Magical Universe. *Benny Carter (1943‚Äì2014) was an American artist known for his paintings of New York City and rural North Carolina. * James Charles Castle (1899‚Äì1977) was a self-taught artist from Garden Valley, Idaho. *Nek Chand (1924‚Äì2015) was an Indian artist, famous for building the Rock Garden of Chandigarh, a forty-acre (160,000 m2) sculpture garden in the city of Chandigarh, India. *Ferdinand Cheval (1836‚Äì1924) was a country postman in Hauterives, south of Lyon, France.

Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in Bethlem and Broadmoor psychiatric hospitals. *Henry Darger (1892‚Äì1973) was a solitary man who was orphaned and institutionalized as a child. In the privacy of his small north side Chicago apartment, he produced over 35,000 pages of text and hundreds of large scale illustrations, including maps, collaged photos, and watercolors that depict the heroic struggles of his child characters, \\"the Vivian Girls\\", engaged in activities such as battle scenes combining imagery of the US Civil War with the presence of fanciful monsters. *Terry A. Davis (1969‚Äì2018), a schizophrenic computer programmer and creator of TempleOS. *Charles Dellschau (1830‚Äì1923) born in Prussia, Dellschau emigrated to the US and in his 70s secluded himself in an attic and over the course of 20 years created 12 large scale books filled with mixed media watercolors depicting the inventions of the Sonora Aero Club, chronicling the birth of the age of aviation.

His works mix abstraction and graphic signs and writings. *Mollie Jenson (1890‚Äì1973) created a series of large-scale concrete sculptures embellished with tile mosaics in River Falls, Wisconsin. *Daniel Johnston (1961‚Äì2019) a lo-fi musician with schizophrenia known for his \\"childlike\\" music. *Susan Te Kahurangi King (born 1951) is a New Zealand artist whose ability to speak declined by the age of four and stopped speaking altogether by age eight. King is an autistic savant who has methodically created an entire analogous world through extraordinary drawings using pen, graphite, colored pencil, crayon and ink. She drew prolifically through to the early 1990s and then without reason suddenly stopped.

Lewis painted bright scenes of rural Nova Scotian life on found objects, including boards, construction materials, etc. *Alexander Lobanov (1924‚Äì2003) was a withdrawn deaf Russian known for detailed and self-aggrandizing self-portraits: paintings, photographs and quilts, which usually include images of large guns. *Justo Gallego Mart√≠nez (born 1925) is a Spanish former monk who has been erecting a cathedral-like building in the town of Mejorada del Campo, Spain, since 1961. The building has neither any planning permissions, nor has it the benediction of any church authority. *Helen Martins (1897‚Äì1976) transformed the house she inherited from her parents in Nieu-Bethesda, South Africa, into a fantastical environment decorated with crushed glass and cement sculptures. The house is known as The Owl House. * Tarcisio Merati (1934‚Äì1995), an Italian artist, was confined to a psychiatric hospital for most of his adult life during which time he produced a vast amount of drawings (several dream toys, bird on nest etc.), text and musical composition. * Markus Meurer (born 1959), a German artist, transforms found objects into mythic creations, hybrid creatures of animal, man and machine. * Ataa Oko (1919‚Äì2012), a Ghanaian artist who was one of the first builders of fantasy coffins and who became in collaboration with a social anthropologist, Regula Tschumi, a painter at the age of 85. He started to draw and paint his former fantasy coffins, but also religious ceremonies and spirits he pretended to see. * The Philadelphia Wireman, a creator of wire sculptures. Nothing is known of their identity and they are presumed deceased. *Mart√≠n Ram√≠rez (1895‚Äì1963), a Mexican outsider artist who spent most of his adult life institutionalized in a California mental hospital (he had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic). He developed an elaborate iconography featuring repeating shapes mixed with images of trains and Mexican folk figures. *Achilles Rizzoli (1896‚Äì1981) was employed as an architectural draftsman. He lived with his mother near San Francisco, California. After his death, a huge collection of elaborate drawings were discovered, many in the form of maps and architectural renderings that described a highly personal fantasy exposition, including portraits of his mother as a neo-baroque building. *Royal Robertson (1936‚Äì1997), a schizophrenic sign painter who received vivid, violent visions of spaceships, God, and the apocalypse, which he then translated into bright, colourful, comic-book like sketches, often including references to his wife's unfaithfulness. *Sam (Simon) Rodia (1875‚Äì1965) was an itinerant construction worker and untrained in the arts. Plagued by personal problems, he abandoned his family to ride the rails until he settled in Los Angeles and created the landmark Watts Towers.

After being institutionalized for 35 years she attended Creative Growth Art Center (a center for artists with disabilities in Oakland, California) and went on to become an internationally renowned fiber art sculptor. *Richard Sharpe Shaver (1907‚Äì1975) produced photographs, paintings, drawings and writing connected to his unorthodox theories about the history of life on Earth. He believed that certain stones were actually image-filled \\"rock books\\" created by an ancient superior race, and that sadistic descendants of those ancients live inside the earth, using ancient \\"ray\\" machines to torment humankind. His paintings, based on rock slices, often incorporate unusual materials such as soap flakes. * Charles Steffen (1927‚Äì1995), Chicago artist, made art while institutionalized. * Kea Tawana (born c. 1935), American sculptor who created the Ark, an 86-foot-long ship made from architectural salvage in a vacant lot in Newark, New Jersey. * Miroslav Tich√Ω (1926‚Äì2011) was a photographer who took thousands of surreptitious pictures of women in his hometown of Kyjov in the Czech Republic, using homemade cameras constructed of cardboard tubes, tin cans and other at-hand materials. * Martin Thompson (born 1956) New Zealand artist self-diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. A mathematical savant, he hand draws obsessive fractal patterns on grid paper using art pens. * Harry Underwood (born 1969) is a self-taught American painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels, described by one critic as \\"a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of Edward Hopper meets Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol\\". He grew up in a deeply religious household and was expelled from high school, later taking up painting while working as a laborer. Despite his expulsion from high school, his works contain complex literary elements, often weaving the painting into a full story in relatively few words. * Pierre Vuitton (1880‚Äì1962), French artist. After being severely wounded, both physically and psychologically, in World War I, Vuitton abandoned his previous life as the child of wealthy merchants. After several stays in sanitariums and mental hospitals, he moved to Paris in 1920. A user of morphine and alcohol, he lived as a casual laborer in poverty despite the occasional sale of his pictures. His first works were probably during the war years; later he developed \\"time-excesses\\" in which he reportedly spent several days painting without eating or sleeping. Increasingly, however, his deteriorating mental condition spoiled any binding relationship, so he spent most of his later life in mental hospitals or in nursing homes. *Willem van Genk (1927‚Äì2005) is the best known Dutch representative of outsider art. He was considered schizophrenic and autistic, and made drawings in view from above of stations and wirings, European cities, busses and trolleys, zeppelins and bombers. He also created 300 intricately decorated rain coats. *Wesley Willis (1963‚Äì2003), a schizophrenic musician and artist from Chicago, known for his prolific (and bizarre) musical recordings as well as his hundreds of colored ink-pen drawings of Chicago street-scapes. Many of his drawings appear as covers to his albums. Although Willis was poor and often dependent on the charity of friends for housing, his drawings now sell for thousands of dollars apiece. *Scottie Wilson (1928‚Äì1972) (born Louis Freeman), emigrated from Scotland to Canada and opened a second-hand clothes store, found fame when his casual doodlings were noted for their dream-like character. *Adolf W√∂lfli (1864‚Äì1930), a Swiss artist, was confined to a psychiatric hospital for most of his adult life during which time he produced a vast amount of drawings, text and musical composition. W√∂lfli was the first well-known \\"outsider artist\\", and he remains closely associated with the label. *Kiyoshi Yamashita (1922‚Äì1971) was a Japanese graphic artist who spent much of his life wandering as a vagabond through Japan. He has been considered an autistic savant. *Joseph Yoakum (1890‚Äì1972), an African-American artist who spent his last years producing a vast quantity of sinuous, surreal landscapes based on both real and imagined travels. *Stephen Wiltshire is a prodigious savant, capable of drawing the entire skyline of a city after a helicopter ride.David Martin.

Although believed to be originally native to Asia, the disease was accidentally introduced into America and Europe, where it has devastated native populations of elms that did not have resistance to the disease. It has also reached New Zealand. The name \\"Dutch elm disease\\" refers to its identification in 1921 and later in the Netherlands by Dutch phytopathologists Bea Schwarz and Christine Buisman, who both worked with Professor Johanna Westerdijk. The disease affects species in the genera Ulmus and Zelkova; therefore it is not specific to the Dutch elm hybrid.  Overview  The causative agents of DED are ascomycete microfungi.Ascomycetes: Phylum Ascomycota, Biology of Plants, Seventh Edition, W. H. Freeman and Company, 2005. Three species are now recognized: *Ophiostoma ulmi, which afflicted Europe from 1910, reaching North America on imported timber in 1928.Clinton, G. P., McCormick, Florence A., Dutch elm disease, Graphium ulmi; New Haven, 1936 *Ophiostoma himal-ulmi, a species endemic to the western Himalaya. *Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, an extremely virulent species from Japan which was first described in Europe and North America in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s.Johnson, O. (2011). Champion Trees of Britain and Ireland. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Beetle feeding galleries on wych elm trunk An infected English elm at West Point, NY, July 2010 DED is spread in North America by three species of bark beetles (Family: Curculionidae, Subfamily: Scolytinae): *The native elm bark beetle, Hylurgopinus rufipes. *The smaller European elm bark beetle, Scolytus multistriatus. *The banded elm bark beetle, Scolytus schevyrewi. In Europe, while S. multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection, it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle, S. scolytus. H. rufipes can be a vector for the disease, but is inefficient compared to the other vectors. S. schevyrewi was found in 2003 in Colorado and Utah. Other reported DED vectors include Scolytus sulcifrons, S. pygmaeus, S. laevis, Pteleobius vittatus and –†. kraatzi. Other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors. =Field resistance= 'Field resistance' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place, rather than survive it. A clear example would be the European White Elm Ulmus laevis which, while having little or no genetic resistance to DED, synthesizes a triterpene, Alnulin, rendering the bark distasteful to the vector beetles, obliging them to look further afield for more suitable elms. Another would be the inability of the beetles to see elms which did not break the silhouette. 'Weeping' elms are often spared infection owing to the beetles' aversion to hanging upside-down while feeding. =Mechanism= In an attempt to block the fungus from spreading farther, the tree reacts by plugging its own xylem tissue with gum and tyloses, bladder-like extensions of the xylem cell wall. As the xylem (one of the two types of vascular tissue produced by the vascular cambium, the other being the phloem) delivers water and nutrients to the rest of the plant, these plugs prevent them from travelling up the trunk of the tree, starving the tree of water and nutrients, therefore, eventually killing it. =Symptoms= The first sign of infection is usually an upper branch of the tree with leaves starting to wither and yellow in summer, months before the normal autumnal leaf shedding. This progressively spreads to the rest of the tree, with further dieback of branches. Eventually, the roots die, starved of nutrients from the leaves. Often, not all the roots die: the roots of some species, notably the English elm, Ulmus minor 'Atinia' (formerly Ulmus procera), can repeatedly put up suckers, which flourish for approximately 15 years, after which they, too, succumb. Disease range =Europe= Dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental Europe in 1910, and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except Greece and Finland.Clouston, B., Stansfield, K., eds., After the Elm (London, 1979) In Britain, the disease was first identified in 1927 by T R Peace on English elm in Hertfordshire.Harris, E. (2017). The European White Elm, Ulmus laevis Pall. Quarterly Journal of Forestry, Vol. 111, No. 4, October 2017. p.263. Royal Forestry Society. This first strain was a relatively mild one, which killed only a small proportion of elms, more often just killing a few branches, and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses. The disease was isolated in The Netherlands in 1921 by Bea Schwarz, a pioneering Dutch phytopathologist, and this discovery would lend the disease its name. Salisbury Cathedral from Lower Marsh Close, 1820, Andrew W. Mellon Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.Circa 1967, a new, far more virulent, strain arrived in Britain, apparently via east coast ports on shipments of rock elm U. thomasii logs from Canada destined for the small-boat industry, confirmed in 1973 when another consignment was examined at Southampton Docks. This strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to European elms; more than 25 million trees died in the United Kingdom alone, while France lost 97% of its elms. The disease spread rapidly northwards, reaching Scotland within 10 years. By 1990, very few mature elms were left in Britain or much of continental Europe. One of the most distinctive English countryside trees (See John Constable's painting Salisbury Cathedral from the South-West), the English elm U. procera Salisb., is particularly susceptible as it is the elm most favoured by the Scolytus beetles. Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic, nearly all these trees, which often grew to more than 45 m high, are gone. The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts (\\"suckers\\"). These suckers rarely reach more than 5 m tall before succumbing to a new attack of the fungus. However, established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the United Kingdom. Sign on A27, Brighton The largest concentrations of mature elms in Europe are now in Amsterdam and The Hague. In 2005, Amsterdam was declared the \\"Elm City of Europe\\": the city‚Äôs streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms, including several generations of research-elms (see below: Resistant trees).Amsterdamse Bomem Some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in The Hague are elms, planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds. Since the 1990s, a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms, and of sanitation felling, has reduced annual elm losses in The Hague from 7% to less than 1% (see below: Preventive treatment). The losses are made up by the planting of disease-resistant cultivars. The largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where of the 30,000 elms in 1983Research on Dutch Elm Disease in Europe, ed. D. A. Burdekin (London, 1983) 15,000 still stand (2005 figures), several of which are estimated to be over 400 years old. Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area, between the English Channel and the South Downs, and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease.Brighton and Hove Council page on the city's elm collection (viewed 2 June 2010) Empowered by the Dutch Elm Disease (Local Authorities) (Amendment) Order 1988, local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber, although in practice they usually do it themselves, successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle Scolytus spp., the vector of elm disease. Sanitary felling has also, to date, preserved most of the 250,000 elms on the Isle of Man,Isle of Man elms, geocomputation.org where average temperature and wind speed inhibit the activity of the beetles, which need a temperature of at least 20 degrees to fly and a wind speed of less than five metres per second.prolandscapermagazine.com 24 February 2017 Felling a diseased elm, Edinburgh, November 2011 The largest concentration of mature elms in Scotland is in Edinburgh, where over 5000 remained in 2009 from some 35,000 in 1976.Coleman, Max, ed., Wych Elm (Edinburgh 2009) The city council gives the overall number of elms as 15,000 (2016).edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20064/parks_and_green_spaces/256/trees_and_woodlands Edinburgh's Leith Links and Meadows have some of the highest concentrations of mature elms among U.K. parks (2014). A policy of sanitary felling has kept losses in the city to an average of 1000 a year. Elm was the most common tree in Paris from the 17th century; before the 1970s there were some 30,000 ormes parisiens. Today, only 1000 mature elms survive in the city, including examples in the large avenues (Avenue d'Italie, Avenue de Choisy, Boulevard Lefebvre, Boulevard de Grenelle, Boulevard Garibaldi) and two very old specimens, one in the garden of the Tuileries in front of the l'Orangerie and another in the Place Saint-Gervais in front of l'h√¥tel de ville de Paris. Losses are now being made up with disease-resistant cultivars, especially the Dutch-French research elm 'Nanguen' (), named for the ancient Roman name for the city: Lutetia.Ulmus 'Nanguen' www.foretpriveefrancaise.com [http://www.foretpriveefrancaise.com/data/info/127219-P.pdf =North America= Arborist removing infected elm in Saint Paul, Minnesota DED was first reported in the United States in 1928, with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from The Netherlands destined for use as veneer in the Ohio furniture industry. Quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within 150 miles of metropolitan New York City until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them.Life, 11 September 1944, p. 58 The disease spread from New England westward and southward, almost completely destroying the famous elms in the \\"Elm City\\" of New Haven, Connecticut, reaching the Detroit area in 1950, the Chicago area by 1960, and Minneapolis by 1970. Of the estimated 77 million elms in North America in 1930, over 75% had been lost by 1989.New York Times, 5 December 1989, nytimes.com nytimes.com/1989/12/05/science/new-varieties-of-elm-raise-hope-of-rebirth-for- davastated-tree.html?sec=health&spon;=&pagewanted;=all Rows of American elm trees south of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. (November 11, 2006) The disease first appeared on the planted rows of American elm trees (Ulmus amercana) on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The United States National Park Service (NPS) used a number of methods to control the epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with DED-resistant American elm cultivars (see Ulmus americana cultivars). The NPS combated the disease's local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. As a result, the population of American elms planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years. DED reached eastern Canada during World War II, and spread to Ontario in 1967, Manitoba in 1975 and Saskatchewan in 1981. In Toronto, 80% of the elm trees have been lost to Dutch elm disease; many more fell victim in Ottawa, Montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s. Quebec City still has about 21,000 elms, thanks to a prevention program initiated in 1981. Alberta and British Columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of Dutch elm disease, although, in an isolated case, an elm tree in Wainwright, Alberta was found diseased in June 1998 and was immediately destroyed.CFIA annual pest survey report. 1999 Summary of Plant Quarantine Pest and Disease Situations in Canada (report available upon demand at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency: http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.831610/publication.html) The presence of DED was monitored in this area during subsequent years but was not seen again. Today, Alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by Dutch elm disease in the world. The provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan all prohibit the pruning of elm trees during the middle of the year (taking effect in April, and lasting through the end of September, July, and August respectively), which they deem to be the most active time of year for bark beetles. It is also illegal to use, store, sell, or transport elm firewood. The largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in North America is believed to be in the city of Winnipeg, where close to 200,000 elms remain ‚Äì at least double that of Amsterdam, the \\"Elm City of Europe\\". The city spends $3 million annually to aggressively combat the disease using Dursban Turf and the Dutch Trig vaccine. =New Zealand= Dutch elm disease has reached New Zealand. It was found in Napier where it was eradicated and was also found in the Auckland Region in 1989. The Ministry of Agriculture funded a national management programme but it was cancelled to allow more funds to be available for pests of a higher priority. A major outbreak occurred in New Zealand in July 2013, particularly at the site of Kingseat Hospital, south of Auckland. Auckland has 20,000 elms.Auckland's elms, bts.nzpcn.org.nz/bts_pdf/ABJ58(1)2003-38-45-Elms.pdf Preventive treatment =Mechanical= Diseased elm ringbarked to slow down transmission before felling.The first attempts to control Dutch elm disease consisted of pruning trees to remove and burn diseased timber. While this method was effective in New York State and adjacent areas, its cost made it uneconomical except in large cities where elms were considered valuable attractions. =Chemical= In the US, when Dutch elm disease spread away from the Atlantic coast, control focused on controlling the bark beetle by using insecticides such as DDT and dieldrin, which were sprayed heavily across all parts of elm trees, usually twice a year in the spring and again at a lower concentration in the summer. In its early years, it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the United States but as early as 1947, concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates. In areas sprayed during the 1950s, local people observed birds such as the American woodcock, American robin, white- breasted nuthatch, brown creeper and various Poecile species dying. Biologist Rachel Carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms, which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering Dutch elm disease. Although modern critics of Carson have argued that the bird deaths were caused by other factors such as mercury poisoning in the soil, spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962, a trend aided by fungicides without dangerous side-effects being discovered for the first time after many years of research. Lignasan BLP (carbendazim phosphate), introduced in the 1970s, was the first fungicide used to control Dutch elm disease. This had to be injected into the base of the tree using specialized equipment, and was never especially effective. It is still sold under the name \\"Elm Fungicide\\". Arbotect (thiabendazole hypophosphite) became available some years later, and it has been proven effective. Arbotect must be injected every two to three years to provide ongoing control; the disease generally cannot be eradicated once a tree is infected. Arbotect is not effective on root graft infections from adjacent elm trees. It is more than 99.5% effective for three years from beetle infections, which is the primary mode of tree infection. Alamo (propiconazole) has become available more recently, though several university studies show it to be effective only for the current season in which it is injected. Alamo is primarily recommended for treatment of oak wilt. Multistriatin is a pheromone produced by female elm bark beetles, which can be produced synthetically. It has potential in being used to trap male beetles, which carry the fungus. =Biological= Because of the ban on the use of chemicals on street and park trees in the Netherlands, the University of Amsterdam developed a biological vaccine by the late 1980s. Dutch Trig is nontoxic, consisting of a suspension in distilled water of spores of a strain of the fungus Verticillium albo-atrum that has lost much of its pathogenic capabilities, injected in the elm in spring. The strain is believed to have enough pathogenicity left to induce an immune response in the elm, protecting it against DED during one growing season. This is called induced resistance.About Dutch Trig¬Æ Trials with the American elm have been very successful; in a six-year experiment with the American elm in Denver, CO, annual Dutch elm disease losses declined significantly after the first year from 7 percent to between 0.4 and 0.6 percent; a greater and more rapid reduction in disease incidence than the accompanying tree sanitation and plant health care programs. Preventive treatment is usually only justified when a tree has unusual symbolic value or occupies a particularly important place in the landscape. Resistant trees Research to select resistant cultivars and varieties began in the Netherlands in 1928, followed by the United States in 1937 (see Ulmus americana cultivars). Initial efforts in the Netherlands involved crossing varieties of U. minor and U. glabra, but later included the Himalayan or Kashmir elm U. wallichiana as a source of antifungal genes. Early efforts in the USA involved the hybridization of the Siberian elm U. pumila with American red elm U. rubra to produce resistant trees. Resulting cultivars lacked the traditional shape and landscape value of the American elm; few were planted. In 2005, the National Elm Trial (USA) began a 10-year evaluation of 19 cultivars in plantings across the United States. The trees in the trial are exclusively American developments; no European cultivars have been included. Recent research in Sweden has established that early-flushing clones are less susceptible to DED owing to an asynchrony between DED susceptibility and infection.Ghelardini, L. (2007) Bud Burst Phenology, Dormancy Release & Susceptibility to Dutch Elm Disease in Elms (Ulmus spp.). Doctoral Thesis No. 2007:134. Faculty of natural Resources and Agricultural Services, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden =Testing for disease resistance= Elms are tested for resistance by inoculation with the fungal pathogen in late May when the tree's growth is at its annual peak. Clones raised for testing are grown to an age of 3 or 4 years. In Europe, the inoculum is introduced into the cambium by a knife wound. However this method, developed in the Netherlands, was considered too severe in America, where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle Scolytus multistriatus, a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to Europe, Scolytus scolytus, which is unknown in America. In the method devised by the USDA, the inoculum is introduced to the cambium via a 2 mm-diameter hole drilled through the bark in the lower third of the tree. This method was further refined by the University of Wisconsin team, which drilled holes in the branches to simulate natural infection by the bark beetles feeding in the twig crotches, but results from this method were found to exaggerate the genetic resistance of the host. Consequently, tests were conducted on specimens in a controlled environment, either in greenhouses or customized plant chambers, facilitating more accurate evaluation of both internal and external symptoms of disease. Another variable is the composition of the inoculum; while an inoculum strength of 106 spores / ml is standard in both continents, its composition reflects the different Ophiostoma species, subspecies and hybrids endemic to the two continents. In Italy for example, two subspecies, americana and novo- ulmi, are present together with their hybrid, whereas in North America, ssp. novo-ulmi is unknown. The differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the American cultivar 'Princeton', displaying high resistance in the USA, has often succumbed to Dutch elm disease in Europe. =Hybrid cultivars= Inoculation of virulent strains of Ophiostoma in elm cambium, Dorschkamp Institute for Forestry and Landscape planning, Wageningen 1984 (photograph: Mihailo Grbiƒá) Many attempts to breed disease resistant cultivar hybrids have usually involved a genetic contribution from Asian elm species which have demonstrable resistance to this fungal disease. Much of the early work was undertaken in the Netherlands. The Dutch research programme began in 1928, and ended after 64 years in 1992, during which time well over 1000 cultivars were raised and evaluated. Still in use are cultivars such as 'Groeneveld', 'Lobel', 'Dodoens', 'Clusius' and 'Plantijn' although the resistance levels in these trees aren't high enough for good protection. The programme had three major successes: 'Columella', 'Nanguen' \`LUT√àCE\`, and 'Wanoux' \`VADA\`,Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique. Lut√®ce, a resistant variety, brings elms back to Paris , Paris, France all found to have an extremely high resistance to the disease when inoculated with unnaturally large doses of the fungus. Only 'Columella' was released during the lifetime of the Dutch programme, in 1987; patents for the \`LUT√àCE\` and \`VADA\` clones were purchased by the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), which subjected the trees to 20 years of field trials in the Bois de Vincennes, Paris, before releasing them to commerce in 2002 and 2006, respectively. Asian species featured in the American DED research programs were the Siberian elm U. pumila, Japanese elm U. davidiana var. japonica, and the Chinese elm U. parvifolia, which gave rise to several dozen hybrid cultivars resistant not just to DED, but also to the extreme cold of Asian winters. Among the most widely planted of these, both in North America and in Europe, are 'Sapporo Autumn Gold', 'New Horizon' and 'Rebona'. Some hybrid cultivars, such as 'Regal' and 'Pioneer' are the product of both Dutch and American research. Hybridization experiments using the slippery or red elm U. rubra resulted in the release of 'Coolshade' and 'Rosehill' in the 1940s and 50s; the species last featured in hybridization as the female parent of 'Repura' and 'Revera', both patented in 1993, although neither has yet appeared in commerce. In Italy, research is continuing at the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante, Florence, to produce a range of disease-resistant trees adapted to the warmer Mediterranean climate, using a variety of Asiatic species crossed with the early Dutch hybrid 'Plantyn' as a safeguard against any future mutation of the disease. Two trees with very high levels of resistance, 'San Zanobi' and 'Plinio', were released in 2003. 'Arno' and 'Fiorente' were patented in 2006 and entered commerce in 2012. All four have the Siberian elm U. pumila as a parent, the source of disease-resistance and drought-tolerance genes. 'Morfeo' was released in 2011; it arose from a crossing of the Dutch hybrid clone '405' (female parent) and the Chenmou Elm, the latter a small tree from the provinces of Anhui and Jiangsu in eastern China, The '405' clone is a crossing of an English U. √ó hollandica and a French U. minor. In The Netherlands a new program has been initiated. From the old proving grounds of the Dorschkamp Research Institute, 10 fourth-generation hybrids survive in a DED-ridden area. These have been tested and some have a very high level of resistance. At Noordplant Nursery new hybrids have been tested since 2013. =Species and species cultivars= North America Results of artificial inoculation of Ophiostoma strains in elm cambium, Arlington Experimental Station, Wisconsin 1987 (photograph: Mihailo Grbiƒá) Ten resistant American elm cultivars are now in commerce in North America, but only two ('Princeton' and 'Valley Forge') are currently available in Europe. No cultivar is \\"immune\\" to DED; even highly resistant cultivars can become infected, particularly if already stressed by drought or other environmental conditions where the disease prevalence is high. With the exception of 'Princeton', no trees have yet been grown to maturity. Trees cannot be said to be mature until they have reached an age of 60 years. Notable cultivars include: * 'Princeton', is a cultivar selected in 1922 by Princeton Nurseries for its landscape merit. By coincidence, this cultivar was found to be highly resistant in inoculation studies carried out by the USDA in the early 1990s. As trees planted in the 1920s still survive, the properties of the mature plant are well known. However, 'Princeton' has not proven resistant in Europe, where the main vector of the disease is the larger elm bark beetle, Scolytus scolytus, capable of introducing far more fungal spores into the tree; many of the 50 trees planted by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales, in 2006 at Highgrove had died from Dutch elm disease by 2011. * 'American Liberty', is, in fact, a set of six cultivars of moderate to high resistance produced through selection over several generations starting in the 1970s. Although 'American Liberty' is marketed as a single variety, nurseries selling the \\"Liberty Elm\\" actually distribute the six cultivars at random and thus, unfortunately, the resistance of any particular tree cannot be known. One of the cultivars, 'Independence', is covered by patent (U. S. Plant patent 6227). The oldest 'American Liberty' elm was planted in about 1980. * 'Valley Forge', released in 1995, has demonstrated the highest resistance of all the clones to Dutch elm disease in controlled USDA tests. * 'Lewis and Clark' = , released in 2004 to commemorate the bicentenary of the Lewis & Clark expedition, was cloned from a tree found growing in North Dakota which had survived unscathed when all around had succumbed to disease. In 2007, the Elm Recovery Project of the University of Guelph Arboretum in Ontario, Canada, reported that cuttings from healthy surviving old elms surveyed across Ontario had been grown to produce a bank of resistant trees, isolated for selective breeding of highly resistant cultivars. The University of Minnesota USA is testing various elms, including a huge now-patented century-old survivor known as \\"The St. Croix Elm\\", which is located in a Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN suburb (Afton) in the St. Croix River valley ‚Äî a designated National Scenic Riverway. The slippery or red elm U. rubra is marginally less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than the other American species, but this quality seems to have been largely ignored in American research. No cultivars were ever selected, although the tree was used in hybridization experiments (see above). In 1993, Mariam B. Sticklen and James L. Sherald reported the results of NPS-funded experiments conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees. In 2007, AE Newhouse and F Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization. By 2013, researchers in both New York State and North Carolina were conducting field trials of genetically engineered DED- resistant American elms. Europe Among European species, there is the unique example of the European white elm U. laevis, which has little innate resistance to DED, but is eschewed by the vector bark beetles and only rarely becomes infected. Recent research has indicated it is the presence of certain organic compounds, such as triterpenes and sterols, which serves to make the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease. In Europe the testing of clones of surviving field elms for innate resistance has been carried out since the 1990s by national research institutes, with findings centrally assessed and published.Screening European Elms for resistance to 'Ophiostoma novo-ulmi' (Forest Science 2005) The first results of this ongoing project suggest that in some countries a very small number of native field elm genotypes have comparatively high levels of tolerance to DED. In Spain, for example, of around 5,000 native elms evaluated to 2013, some 25 genotypes (0.5% of those tested) fall into this category; and it is now hoped that the controlled crossing of the best seven of these (genetically and aesthetically) will produce Ulmus minor hybrids with effective 'field resistance' and market appeal.‚ÄòSpanish Clones‚Äô (Oct. 2013) resistantelms.co.uk Similar results are beginning to emerge in trials on surviving field elms in Greece.ŒîoŒ∫ŒπŒºŒÆ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ≥ŒµŒΩoœÑœçœÄœâŒΩ œÄŒµŒ¥ŒπŒΩŒÆœÇ œÜœÑŒµŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ (Ulmus minor) Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ œÑŒ∑œÇ OŒªŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ±œÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒµŒπŒ±œÇ, Œ£.

Perlerou) = United Kingdom = Much of the work in the United Kingdom is by the Forestry Commission's research arm, which has had Dutch elm disease on its agenda since the 1920s. In 1994 a Research Information Note (no 252) was published, written by John Gibbs, Clive Brasier and Joan Webber who are still active in the field; and in 2010 a Pathology Advisory Note, as well as throughout the period a stream of more academic papers: notable results have been the observation that the progress of the disease through Scotland has been quite slow, and that genetic engineering has been tried to improve the resistance of the English elm. In England the Conservation Foundation has begun propagating, distributing and planting clones of surviving indigenous elms, including field elms (but not the highly susceptible English elm), as part of a scheme to return elms to city and countryside.'\\"Super tree\\" from Northamptonshire helping to fight Dutch Elm Disease and repopulate woodlands', northamptonchron.co.uk The Foundation is currently running two elm programmes: the 'Great British Elm Experiment' and 'Ulmus londinium', an elm programme for London ‚Äì these use saplings cultivated through micropropagation from mature parent elms found growing in the British countryside: parent trees are monitored for disease, while saplings are offered free to schools and community groups, who are asked to monitor their trees' progress on the Foundation's online elm map; elms are available at a small price to others who do not qualify for a free tree; in London, places with 'elm' in their name are offered a sapling ‚Äì in an attempt to find out why some elms have survived while others succumbed to Dutch elm disease. The spread of DED to Scotland has focused attention on a small number of Wych elms U. glabra surviving in areas of high infectivity, prompting the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh to begin a programme of cloning of the trees and inoculation of their saplings with the fungus, with a view to determining innate resistance (2010). In 2001-4, English elm U. procera was genetically engineered to resist disease, in experiments at Abertay University, Dundee, Scotland, by transferring antifungal genes into the elm genome using minute DNA-coated ball bearings.'First Genetically Modified Dutch Elm Trees Grown', unisci.comresistantelms.co.uk, FAQ 'Disease Control' However, owing to the hostility to GM developments, there are no plans to release the trees into the countryside. = Spain = In Spain, the Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid , charged with discovering disease-resistant elms for use in forestry, has raised and patented seven cultivars of the field elm Ulmus minor, although two have subsequently been found to have Siberian elm U. pumila DNA, the species introduced to Spain in the 16th century. Although none have been released to commerce (2020), the clone 'Ademuz', pure U. minor, has been imported into the UK since 2014, and widely planted there. Possible earlier occurrences =The 'Elm Decline'= From analysis of fossil pollen in peat samples, it is apparent that elms, an abundant tree in prehistoric times, all but disappeared from northwestern Europe during the mid-Holocene period around 4000 BC, and to a lesser extent around 1000 BC. This roughly synchronous and widespread event has come to be known as the 'Elm Decline'. When first detected in the mid-20th century, the decline was attributed to the impact of forest-clearance by Neolithic farmers, and of elm-coppicing for animal fodder, though the numbers of settlers could not have been large. The devastation caused recently by DED has provided an alternative explanation. Examination of subfossil elm wood showing signs of the changes associated with the disease has suggested that a form of DED may have been responsible. Fossil finds from this period of elm bark beetles support this theory. A consensus today is that the Elm Decline was probably driven by both factors. =Historic period= A less devastating form of the disease, caused by a different fungus, had possibly been present in north-west Europe for some time. Dr Oliver Rackham of Cambridge University presented evidence of an outbreak of elm disease in north-west Europe, c. 1819‚Äì1867. \\"Indications from annual rings [a reference to the dark staining in an annual ring in infected elms] confirm that Dutch elm disease was certainly present in 1867,\\" he wrote, quoting contemporary accounts of diseased and dying elms, including this passage in Richard Jefferies' 1883 book, Nature near London: > There is something wrong with elm trees. In the early part of this summer, > not long after the leaves were fairly out upon them, here and there a branch > appeared as if it had been touched with red-hot iron and burnt up, all the > leaves withered and browned on the boughs. First one tree was thus affected, > then another, then a third, till, looking round the fields, it seemed as if > every fourth or fifth tree had thus been burnt. [...] Upon mentioning this I > found that it had been noticed in elm avenues and groups a hundred miles > distant, so that it is not a local circumstance. Earlier still, Rackham noted, \\"The name Scolytus destructor was given to the great bark beetle on evidence, dating from c. 1780, that it was destroying elms around Oxford.\\"Oliver Rackham, The History of the Countryside (London 1986), pp. 242‚Äì243, 232 In Belgium, elm die-back and death was observed in 1836 and 1896 in Brussels, and in 1885-6 in Ghent. In the later outbreaks the die-back was attributed to the elm bark beetle. It has been suggested that \\"for thousands of years elms have flourished in natural balance with the scolytidae, combating occasional infections of Dutch elm disease.\\"Vaclav Vetviƒçka, Trees and Shrubs (London 1985) Sir Thomas Browne, writing in 1658, noted in The Garden of Cyrus an elm disease that was spreading through English hedgerows, and described symptoms reminiscent of DED.Oliver Rackham, The History of the Countryside (London 1986), p.242-3 See also * Forest pathology * Forest disturbance by invasive insects and diseases in the United States References Further reading * Walter E.

The town is part of the conservation area Naturpark Neckartal- Odenwald and the UNESCO Geopark Bergstra√üe-Odenwald. History The settlement of Mosbach developed around the Benedictine monastery of Mosbach Abbey (\\"Monasterium Mosabach\\"), the first written record of which dates from the 9th century. In 1241 rights and privileges had been granted to Mosbach as an Imperial free city. These rights were lost in 1362 when Mosbach became part of the Electorate of the Palatinate. With the division of the lands of King Rupert in 1410, Mosbach became the capital of a small principality known as Palatinate-Mosbach as the inheritance for his son Otto I. With the death of his brother John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt 1443, the territory of Palatinate-Neumarkt was added in a personal union to Palatinate-Mosbach creating the territory of Palatinate-Mosbach-Neumarkt. This principality was dissolved with the death of Count Palatine Otto II in 1499. The city and adjoining territory reverted to the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Mosbach became the capital of the administrative district of \\"Oberamt Mosbach\\". In 1806 the city was made part of the Grand Duchy of Baden.

While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that \\"the poet in a poet\\" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon, Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios,revisionary ratios Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Excerpts which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric. Before writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Browning, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom since has changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called \\"six revisionary ratios\\" by Bloom. They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades. Six revisionary ratios Bloom introduces his six revisionary ratios in the following manner, which he consistently applies in this book as well as his successor volume titled A Map of Misreading. * Clinamen ‚Äì Bloom defines this as \\"poetic misreading or misprision proper\\". The poet makes a swerve away from the precursor in the form of a \\"corrective movement\\". This swerve suggests that the precursor \\"went accurately up to a certain point\\", but should have swerved in the direction that the new poem moves. Bloom took the word clinamen from Lucretius, who refers to swerves of atoms that make change possible. * Tessera ‚Äì Bloom defines this as \\"completion and antithesis\\". The author \\"completes\\" his precursor's work, retaining its terms but meaning them in a new sense, \\"as though the precursor had failed to go far enough\\". The word tessera refers to a fragment that, together with other fragments, reconstitutes the whole; Bloom is referring to ancient mystery cults, who would use tessera as tokens of recognition. * Kenosis ‚Äì Bloom defines this as a \\"breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions\\", in other words \\"a movement toward discontinuity with the precursor\\". The poet humbles himself, \\"as though he were ceasing to be a poet\\", but does so in such a way as to empty out the precursor poem too, so that the later poet is not deflated as much as may seem. Bloom took the word kenosis from St. Paul, who uses it to refer to Jesus accepting his own reduction from divine to human status. * Daemonization ‚Äì Bloom defines this as a \\"movement towards a personalized Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor‚Äôs Sublime\\". The author suggests that the powers in the precursor poem actually derive from something beyond it; the poet does so \\"to generalize away the uniqueness of the earlier work\\". Bloom took the term daemonization from Neoplatonism, where it refers to an adept being aided by an intermediary, who is neither divine nor human. * Askesis ‚Äì Bloom defines this as a \\"movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude\\". The author curtails the impression of his/her own \\"human and imaginative endowment\\" in order to separate themselves from others and stress his/her own individuality. The poet does this in such a way as to do the same to the precursor, whose limitations and individuality are also emphasized, separating him/her from the later poet. Bloom took the word askesis (asceticism) from the pre-Socratic philosophers. * Apophrades ‚Äì Bloom defines this as the ‚Äúreturn of the dead‚Äù. The poet, toward the end of his/her life, opens up his poem ‚Äì this time deliberately rather than naturally ‚Äì to the precursor's influence. But this deliberateness creates the uncanny effect that the precursor's work seems to be derivative of the later poet. Bloom took the word apophrades from the Athenian concept of the days on which the dead return to reinhabit the houses in which they once lived.

During what became known as the October Crisis, on October 5, 1970, members of the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Bernard Lortie, along with Chenier Cell leader Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose, and Francis Simard, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec Vice Premier and Cabinet Minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba. On November 6, 1970, Bernard Lortie was arrested when the police raided the hiding place of the FLQ's Chenier cell. Although the other three members escaped the raid, they were later captured in St-Luc, Quebec in late December. All four members were charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pierre Laporte. For his part in the kidnapping and murder, Bernard Lortie was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was granted parole by the Canadian Parole Board after seven years.

Olsen & Co. is a shipping company based in Oslo, Norway. The company was founded by Petter Olsen in 1848. Today it is the holding company that controls the Olsen family's interest through Bonheur and Ganger Rolf. History The company was founded by Petter Olsen (1821-1899) in 1848 and, by his death, the company had 16 ships with offices in Hvitsten. Petter's son Thomas Fredrik \\"Fred\\" Olsen (1857-1933) or Fred. Olsen, whom the company is named after, took the company from a small business with a few boats into a powerful multinational shipping and shipbuilding business. He had a vision of providing high-quality service on a network of lines, at first domestically and, afterwards, internationally. To do this required steamships, of which the first was acquired in 1897. By 1914, the first motor ship was put in use on the South America line. During World War I 23 of the company's 44 ships sank. After the first Fred. Olsen's death, his sons Rudolf Olsen and Thomas Fredrik Olsen took over the company. During their leadership, the company expanded, even entering the aviation business with its own airline Fred. Olsen Flyselskap in addition to later partial ownerships of Det Norske Luftfartselskap, Scandinavian Airlines System, Wider√∏e, and Sterling Airlines. During World War II, the company's ships were in Allied service, though 28 were lost ‚Äì about half the fleet. Rudolf died in 1951 and Thomas suffered ill health from 1955, eventually dying in 1969. Fred Olsen Express on the way to La Gomera Thomas's son, also named Fred. Olsen (born 1 January 1929), is now in control of the company, after becoming director in 1955. In the early 1970s, Fred. Olsen entered the offshore business, with Dolphin drilling rigs and part of Saga Petroleum. The Saga shares were sold in 1991 while Dolphin is now part of Fred. Olsen Energy. Fred. Olsen also had a major share in the construction and engineering company Aker and currently owns Timex Corporation. The company has also periodically entered the tanking business, operating a total of 40 ships since 1920. In 1973, it sold its tanking interests but reentered the industry again in 1986, creating the publicly listed company First Olsen Tankers in 1993 that was repurchased in 1999. Fred. Olsen Renewables has been involved in wind power since 1997 with wind farms in Norway, Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 1980, it was involved in Nimslo, a company making 3D cameras, which later went bankrupt. Fred. Olsen is today owned by Anette S. Olsen, the fifth generation of the family and daughter of Fred. Olsen. She took over ownership of Fred. Olsen & Co. in 1995 and has since been CEO, though Fred. Olsen has remained Chairman. At the end of 2008, Fred. Olsen sold its part of Comarit and is no longer a stockholder of the Moroccan passenger carrier. Companies in the Fred. Olsen Group * Bonheur * First Olsen Tankers * Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines * Fred.
