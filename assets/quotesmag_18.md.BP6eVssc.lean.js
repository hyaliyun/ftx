She invented Chipsafer, a software platform to track cattle, and remotely and autonomously detect anomalies in their behaviour. Early life María Victoria Alonsoperez was born in Uruguay. She studied electrical and space engineering at the University of the Republic in Montevideo. For her undergraduate thesis, she worked on system designs for the first Uruguayan satellite. In 2009, Alonsoperez was awarded a youth grant from the International Astronautical Federation which allowed her to participate in several astronautical congresses and become involved in the Space Generation Advisory Council. In 2011, she attended a space studies program at the International Space University and participated in a group competition, winning the Barcelona Zero-Gravity Aerobatics Challenge with two colleagues. She pursued a graduate degree in aerospace engineering, the first Uruguayan to study in the field. Career As a twelve-year-old-child, Alonsoperez invented a monitoring system to track the behavior of cattle, which could be used to prevent a repeat disaster of the 2001 Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Eleven years later, while working as a teaching associate the International Space University, she heard of the International Telecommunication Union's Young Innovators Competition. Alonsoperez developed her idea into a product called Chipsafer, sent it to the competition, and won. In 2013, Alonsoperez won the Best Young Inventor Award from the World Intellectual Property Organization. In 2014, the Inter-American Development Bank named Chipsafer the Most Innovative Startup of Latin America and the Caribbean, and the MIT Technology Review selected her as the Innovator of the Year for Argentina and Uruguay. One of the benefits of winning the competition was a course in entrepreneurship, where Alonsoperez learned how to set up a development company and create a prototype. She founded IEETech and with seed money from the Uruguayan National Research and Innovation Agency, Alonsoperez developed the prototype, tested it and moved into commercializing Chipsafer. Once the prototype was created, Alonsoperez began to search for investors to buy the device for broad scale testing. The device is a type of solar-powered collar which sends data to IEETech's servers which then analyze the data to detect anomalies. Servers can modify the information received or update function remotely, and cattle owners can modify data and desired output for customized reports. In 2015, Alonsoperez partnered with local farmers and the University of the Republic for further testing and as a way to build relationships and later that year was nominated as one of the most inspirational women of the year by they BBC 100 Women series. In 2016, Alonsoperez has been working to attract investor capitalists from Silicon Valley, after an initial product consultation in China proved difficult.

She is also an ambassador for The Eve Appeal, a British charity that raises awareness of and funds research into gynaecological cancers, and founded the Homeless Period Project, a campaign to support homeless women's access to menstrual products. Stop Taxing Periods campaign  Coryton started the Stop Taxing Periods campaign in May 2014 while a student at Goldsmiths. The campaign was centred around an online petition on campaign hosting website Change.org. By early 2016 the petition had gained more than 320,000 signatures and global recognition. Stop Taxing Periods also used protests, demonstration and viral social media. In 2015 the campaign gained the support of the then Prime Minister David Cameron, who said \\"I wish we could get rid of this… [but] there’s a problem with getting rid of VAT on certain individual issues because of the way this tax is regulated and set in Europe.\\" Change.org's UK director Brie Rogers cited Coryton as a successful example of clicktivism and the influence of online political activism on national politics. In March 2016 Parliament accepted a Tampon Tax amendment proposed by Paula Sherriff MP, the then Chancellor George Osborne pledged in his budget to make menstrual products exempt from sales tax. The amendment is set to be implemented by April 2018.

Early life and career  Romolo Polacchini was born in La Spezia in 1897 and attended the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno from November 6, 1911 to June 7, 1914, graduating as an Ensign. His first assignment was on the protected cruiser Etna; he then served on the battleships Dante Alighieri and Andrea Doria during World War I, receiving his first a War Merit Cross. In 1918, with the rank of sub-lieutenant, he became the executive officer of the submarine H 3, taking part in some missions in the Adriatic Sea.Erminio Bagnasco, Maurizio Brescia, I sommergibili italiani 1940–1943.

He remained in the submarine branch after the war; in 1923 he received his first command, the submarine N 3. In 1924 he was assigned for a year to the La Maddalena naval base; then, as a lieutenant, he was the commanding officer of the submarine H 1 and then (for four months) of the coastal torpedo boat 69 PN. In the following year, after promotion to Lieutenant Commander, he was given command of the minelaying submarine X 2; in 1929 he commanded the submarine F 19.Erminio Bagnasco, Maurizio Brescia, I sommergibili italiani 1940–1943. Parte 1ª-Mediterraneo, in Storia Militare Dossier, nº 11, Parma, Ermanno Albertelli Editore, November–December 2013, p. 64.

Parte 1ª-Mediterraneo, in Storia Militare Dossier, nº 11, Parma, Ermanno Albertelli Editore, November–December 2013, p. 13. in 1931 he was awarded the title of Officer of the Order of Ismail by the King of Egypt Fuad I, and in 1932 he was promoted to Commander. For some time he was given shore assignments in the Taranto Naval Department and the Castellammare di Stabia Naval Command. In 1933 he served as deputy chief of staff on the light cruiser Alberto di Giussano and then on its sistership Giovanni delle Bande Nere. He then commanded the submarines Argonauta, Otaria and the Taranto Submarine Group, after which he participated in some clandestine missions during the Spanish Civil War in command of the submarines Des Geneys and Santorre Santarosa. In 1936 he was promoted to captain and appointed commander of the Venice Naval Base.  World War II and later years  In 1940 Polacchini was given command of the light cruiser Luigi Cadorna, and in this role he participated in the Battle of Calabria after Italy entered World War II. For his behaviour in the battle, he was awarded a War Cross for Military Valor. He was then made commander of the High Command for the Traffic with Albania (Maritrafalba, with headquarters in Brindisi) during the Greco-Italian War, after which he was given command of the Submarine School in Pola. On April 15, 1941, Polacchini became chief of staff of the Italian BETASOM Atlantic submarine base in Bordeaux, replacing Captain Aldo Cocchia.Elio Andò, BETASOM. I sommergibili italiani negli oceani, Campobasso, Italia Editrice, 1997, p. 64. After promotion to rear admiral, on 18 September 1941, he replaced Vice Admiral Angelo Parona as the commanding officer of BETASOM. During Polacchini's command, BETASOM submarines saw the peak in their activity, successfully participating in Operation Neuland and obtaining their greatest successes.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini ad oggi, p. 503. During this period, Polacchini was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy by Italy, and the Iron Cross first class and second class by Germany. Probably as a result of his vocal skepticism concerning the claimed sinking of two American battleships by submarine commander Enzo Grossi, on 29 December 1942 Polacchini was called back to Italy, with Grossi replacing him as the commander of BETASOM.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo.

In January 1943 Polacchini was given command of the Palermo Naval Command; he participated in the organization of supply convoys to North Africa during the Tunisian campaign, receiving a Silver Medal of Military Valor for his efforts while Palermo was subjected to heavy Allied bombings. In June 1943 Polacchini was appointed commander of the Livorno Naval Command. After the armistice of Cassibile, when German troops enacting Operation Achse approached Livorno, he gave orders for resistance against any German offensive action; then, as the German forces were preponderant and his men inadequately armed (there were about 200 rifles for a garrison of 1,000 men, and many of them lacked ammunition), he ordered his men to save themselves. He also ordered some coastal batteries to open fire on German vessels that were attacking the auxiliary cruiser Piero Foscari and the steamer Valverde, in order to help them.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina dall’8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, p. 129. He narrowly escaped capture by a German motorized unit sent to his house,Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina dall’8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, p. 127. and then took refuge in the house of friends in Castiglioncello for some time, before joining his family in Venice in January 1944. In May 1944, in order to avoid being deported to Germany, Polacchini took a formal oath to the Italian Social Republic, but at the same time he began to work secretly with the Northern Italy National Liberation Committee. On August 8, 1944, he was arrested by the fascists and imprisoned in Venice with accusations of \\"subversive activities against Fascism\\" and \\"intelligence with the enemy\\". He remained in prison for five months; after the intercession of Cardinal Giovanni Urbani, the future Patriarch of Venice and uncle to his brother's wife, he was released with the obligation of signing to the police station every evening. At the end of war in Italy, with the fall of the fascism, on May 6, 1945 he assumed command of the Navy services in Venice, but he was placed in the reserve on February 20, 1946. On May 5 of the same year he was promoted to vice admiral. On February 19, 1950, having contracted serious illness to the lungs during the period spent in prison, he was forced to leave the service on health grounds and was placed in an absolute discharge and enrolled to the Role of Honour of the Navy. He was promoted to full admiral on June 27, 1958. He then retired to live in Venice Lido, where he died in 1968.

Rachel is also Professor of Biomedical and Nanotechnology at University College London and the London Centre for Nanotechnology. She is part of the UK's Cross Council Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance.The Digital Future of Public Health, presentation by Rachel McKendry  Early life and education  McKendry was born in London, the daughter of an engineer and a civil servant.R McKendry Correspondence She went to a comprehensive school before studying chemistry at Durham University (Trevelyan College), graduating in 1994. She was awarded a PhD from University of Cambridge in 1999, and won a Girton College, Cambridge Research Fellowship in 1998.  Career and research After working as a postdoctoral researcher at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, McKendry returned to the UK in 2001 to take up the Royal Society's Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship and work at University College London. McKendry says she is most proud of her Interdisciplinary research team and breakthroughs in nanosensors for antibiotic drug discovery and early disease diagnosis. In 2015, she presented a Tedx Talk in Exeter on \\"The Digital Future of Public Health\\", in which she discussed early warning systems for disease outbreaks – from Sars to Ebola – being developed along the lines of Google Flu Trends, based on anonymised social media chatter from the world's many billion users of Smart Phones and other digital devices. She has published many research papers in Nature, Nature Nanotechnology and Nature Materials and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. In 2008, writing in Nature Nanotechnology with colleagues from labs in the UK, Kenya and Australia, she showed how nano-sensors could 'feel' mechanical stresses in the cell walls of bacteria when the antibiotic Vancomycin attaches to them. Vancomycin was used in the study as it is one of the last powerful antibiotics in the battle against resistant bacteria and the 'hospital superbug' ... MRSA the paper explained. Nanosensors used in the study showed that it was approximately 1,000 times harder for Vancomycin to attach to the cell walls of antibiotic-resistant 'Superbugs.' Understanding the process by which Vancomycin attaches (or fails to attach) to bacterial walls and weakens or kills bacteria, led researchers in this study to suggest other, potentially more effective alternatives compounds worthy of investigation. In 2014, also in Nature Nanotechnology, McKendry, and her co-workers, Joseph Ndieyira et al, used nano sensors to test a theoretical approach to personalised antibiotic treatment for individual patients of the future. Their prototype nano- mechanical sensors measured the amount of antibiotic freely available to target bacteria in human blood plasma, which contains serum proteins that also bind weakly to antibiotics, neutralising their effect against bacteria. This study mimicked an aspect of the complex physiology of human blood in a living patient. and was used to compare effectiveness of a novel antibiotic, oritavancin with the older antibiotic, vancomycin (which is threatened by evolving antimicrobial resistance). 'Perhaps the most obvious diagnostic application,' the researchers concluded 'is to measure the active free drug availability in blood for a particular medical target and thereby determine appropriate doses tailored for individualised patients.' Such basic scientific advances are among those required for the future of smart phone-based, low cost, rapid-result infectious disease test kits of the kind McKendry described in her 2015 TEDx talk. \\"The grand challenge now,\\" said McKendry in a Nature Nanotechnology News and Views article in 2015, \\"will be to integrate nanosensors onto... cost-effective point-care devices that can examine clinically problematic bacteria in a variety of community settings, including doctors surgeries and developing countries.\\" = Membership of panels = * On the Steering Group of the Infectious Diseases Research Network, a mainly UK- based collaborative research project which ran between 2002 and 2015 and sought to reduce the toll of infectious diseases on the NHS, especially tuberculosis, health care associated infection, antimicrobial resistance, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections. * Part of the UK Government's Blackett Review Panel on Biological Detection which published its report in February 2014, identifying a number of technologies and capabilities that could improve government's ability to detect and respond to an airborne biological attack or infectious disease outbreak. * Formerly an expert to the UK Prime Minister's Council for Science and Technology = Awards and honours= In 2009 McKendry was awarded the Institute of Physics Clifford Paterson Medal and Prize.

He was not however happy with the layout of the estate as fields next to Torwood House had been sold off by the Ridgeways and thus \\"interfered with the demesne\\", that is to say interfered with his privacy. He attempted to buy back the fields in question from his neighbour Mr Cary of Torre Abbey, who refused to sell. He therefore decided to alter his plan of turning Torwood House into a palatial residence, and purchased another estate at Haldon, where he built Haldon House as his new seat, one of the grandest houses in Devon.Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, pp. 165–6 He let Torwood House and the Tor Mohun estate to a farmer (\\"converted it into a farm house\\" (Swete)Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, p.84). Torwood House was described by Rev. John Swete as follows, when he visited the area in 1793:Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, p.164 :\\"The house was not quite half mile distant from the quay: passing by an elm of great bulk I ascended some steps and through an arch'd gateway enter'd a spacious court of a quadrangular form surrounded by high walls. The house had a venerable aspect, its windows formed by stone mullions and over its projecting doorway was a sculpture, possibly the arms of the family of Ridgeway, its antient possessor. The rooms within have nothing remarkable but their size; the Hall in particular possesses from this circumstance no small degree of consequence and the chamber above, now converted into a general dormitory for the servants of the farmer who rents the estate, seems to be of equal dimensions. There are however no other remains of the magnificence of the family that inhabited it, no fretwork, no sculpture but the arms I have before noticed, no painted glass in the windows...\\" Swete painted three watercolours of the house and its setting in 1792/3, which survive in the Devon Record Office.DRO 564M/F4/14, 18 & 22, published in Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, pp. 163–5 The only element he found which reminded him of the \\"savour of antient workmanship\\" was the staircase, the steps of which were made not of planks but of solid blocks of oak. Eventually Palk, together with his neighbour Cary of Torre Abbey, devised a plan to develop the two adjoining estates of Tor Mohun and Torre Abbey into a seaside resort town for visitors, now Torquay. On a previous visit in 1792 to the then small village of \\"Torquay\\", Swete remarked in his Travel Journal: \\"About six in the evening I Torquay which under the auspices of Sir Robert Palk (if the plans which I have seen be carried into execution) will be one day raised into importance\\".Gray & Rowe, Vol.1, p.85 Torre Abbey: Cary In 1662 Torre Abbey was purchased by Sir George Cary (died 1678), knighted at Greenwich Palace by King Charles I, eldest son and heir of Sir Edward Cary of Dungarvon in Ireland and of Bradford in Devon, a grandson of Thomas Cary (died 1567) of Cockington in the parish of Tor Mohun, descended from Sir John Cary (died 1395), of Devon, Chief Baron of the Exchequer (1386-8) and twice Member of Parliament for Devon.Vivian, pp. 150–2, pedigree of Cary Cockington Chapel was anciently a chapel of ease of St Saviour's Church, Tor Mohun. Torre Abbey continued in the possession of his descendants until 1930 (although from 1916 via a female line which adopted the surname Cary in lieu of Coxon) when the mansion and grounds were sold by Commander Henry Cary, RN, to the Corporation of Torquay, although the family continued to own the surrounding estate and the (notional) lordship of the manor of Tor Mohun.

Policing career Edmonds joined the Metropolitan Police Service in 1971; he spent most of his career within the CID and reached the rank of Detective Sergeant. His tenure as a police officer saw a number of achievements and commendations most notably for his role in helping to prevent the kidnap attempt of Princess Anne, The Princess Royal in The Mall, London on 20 March 1974. Edmonds was on duty as a temporary detective constable at Cannon Row police station when the call about the attack was received. He drove to the scene in his own car, and saw a man with a gun running across St James's Park. Edmonds gave chase and, although threatened with the gun, brought the would-be kidnapper to the ground and arrested him. Princess Anne had been returning to Buckingham Palace from an official function with her then husband, Captain Mark Phillips, when a small car slewed in front of the royal limousine and braked sharply. A 26-year-old man, Ian Ball, leaped out brandishing two handguns, smashed one of the car's windows and, pointing a gun directly at the princess and Captain Phillips, ordered them to alight. Inspector James Beaton, the princess's protection officer, drew his firearm and confronted him, but was shot three times; he was later awarded the George Cross. In the end it was left to Edmonds to capture Ball, who was subsequently sentenced to indefinite detention under the Mental Health Act. As a detective, Edmonds served mainly in the East End and had several spells in such units as the stolen car squad. Three years after the incident in The Mall, Edmonds and a detective sergeant were confronted by a gunman who had stolen a car to rob a post office. The robber ordered Edmonds and the detective sergeant to raise their hands, then turned and ran, firing as he went. The two detectives eventually overpowered him, and Edmonds received a Commissioner's High Commendation. Edmonds retired from the Metropolitan Police as a detective sergeant in 1998. During his service he had been commended by an Old Bailey judge, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Bow Street magistrates; he had been awarded two Commissioner's High Commendations and received five Commendations for bravery and detective ability. Personal life Peter Roy Edmonds was born in Nottingham on 8 December 1948. His parents moved to Plymouth where Edmonds was educated at local schools. Relatively well known in the local live music circuit in 1960s Devon, Edmonds played keyboard and other instruments in bands such as Plymouth Sound. He became an apprentice shipwright at Devonport dockyard, but later went to South Africa for two years to work in a shipyard at Durban. On returning to England, he became a maintenance engineer in London before joining the Metropolitan Police. After retiring to Devon, Edmonds pursued his hobbies of building restoration, surfing and music. He achieved his life-long ambition of visiting New Orleans and playing keyboards with various groups. Edmonds died of a heart attack in Dolton Village, North Devon on 4 March 2005, and is survived by three children and four grand-children.

He headed the X-ray departments at Charing Cross Hospital and at the Hospital for Sick Children. He wrote an early book on X-ray techniques and he was president of the radiology section of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1921, Bruce was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, which his physicians attributed to his work with X-rays. He died two months after being diagnosed with the illness. Bruce's death led to the establishment of an X-ray safety committee in Great Britain. Early life Bruce was born the second son of an Aberdeenshire doctor. His uncle was J. Mitchell Bruce, a physician who wrote a widely read textbook, Materia Medica and Therapeutics. He was a cousin of Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside. Bruce completed medical school in 1900 at the University of Aberdeen. After medical school he served in the South African Field Force and he became interested in the applications of X-ray to the management of war injuries. Career After his military service, Bruce became an assistant to Sir James Mackenzie Davidson, a doctor at Charing Cross Hospital. Davidson was an ophthalmologist-turned-radiologist who had gone to Würzburg to receive his X-ray training from Wilhelm Röntgen in the 1890s; he was the first radiologist to achieve knighthood. Bruce worked for the hospital until his death. He also taught at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School. When Davidson retired, Bruce became the head of the X-ray department at Charing Cross Hospital. He was also the second radiographer at the Hospital for Sick Children. With an early clinical interest in X-rays, Bruce worked with powerful X-ray tubes that he thought would be more useful in treating cancers and blood diseases. In 1906, he published an article in The Lancet about ongoing radiation treatment that he was providing to two leukaemia patients. Early in his career, Bruce wrote a book, A System of Radiography, with an Atlas of the Normal, which was favorably reviewed in the Dublin Journal of Medical Science. He later devised a special type of X-ray couch with lead shielding, and he began to caution against the previous setups that required exposure of the radiographer's lower body to the X-ray beam, but he is thought to have been exposed to large amounts of radiation by that time. Bruce lectured to the students studying for the medical radiology diploma at Cambridge University. When Rudyard Kipling became ill in 1918, he carried out Kipling's X-ray examination. He was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine and had been president of the group's Section of Radiology. He had become president of the Section of Radiology and Electrotherapeutics of the British Medical Association in 1921. Death The monument to the Martyrs of Radiology in Hamburg Bruce became ill in January 1921, and he was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia. He wrote a letter to a colleague asking if he knew of anyone who would be interested in taking over his X-ray practice, as he had been advised to retire from X-ray work and move to the country. Bruce underwent a blood transfusion and other treatment, but he died at his home on 21 March of that year. Even a week before his death, Bruce remained optimistic that he would soon be able to return to lecture on radiology topics. Bruce's death aroused public concern about the effects of radiation exposure, leading to the founding of the British X-Ray and Radium Protection Committee, which was headquartered in London. In 1936, the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations was created in Hamburg to honor Bruce and 168 other people who died or suffered serious injury because of the early work they performed with X-rays.

Spike Peterson is a Professor of international relations in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona, and affiliated faculty in the Department of Gender and Women's Studies, the Institute for LGBT Studies, International Studies, Human Rights Practice Program, and the Center for Latin American Studies. Her cross-disciplinary research and teaching are focused on international relations theory, gender and politics, global political economy, and contemporary social theory. Her recent publications examine the sex/gender and racial dynamics of global inequalities and insecurities and develop critical histories of ancient and modern state formation and Anglo-European imperialism in relation to marriage, migration, citizenship and nationalism. Professor Peterson is 'considered to be among the most internationally important senior scholars currently working at the intersections of International Relations, Feminist and Queer Theory, and of International Political Economy.'  Career  Like other feminist scholars in the field of International Relations, Peterson studies the workings of power, and socially-constructed ideas about sex, gender and sexualities in global politics. Rethinking the terms of IR analyses, International Relations scholars using a feminist and/or queer lens seek to broaden the space in which critical approaches to politics are explored - amongst other features of the international system, critiques are applied to the social reproduction of identities and ideologies, heteronormativity, and structural hierarchies. Peterson describes her research and personal interests as concerned with difference, and with crossing borders - both 'conceptually and territorially'. She has written and published over 75 book chapters and journal articles. As well as her role at the University of Arizona, she has been an Associate Fellow at the Gender Institute, London School of Economics (2008-2011), and has held Visiting Research Scholar or Professorships at University of Bristol (2018), University of Manchester (2016), Durham University (2014), London School of Economics (2007, 2008), University of Göteborg (2000), University of Bristol (1998) and the Australian National University (1995). Peterson has been awarded a MacArthur Foundation Research and Writing Grant (1996), a Fulbright Scholarship for research in the Czech Republic (1997), an Udall Center Public Policy Fellowship (2007), and a Rockefeller Bellagio Scholarly Residency (2008). Throughout her career Peterson has received numerous awards, including the LGBTQA Eminent Scholar Award of the International Studies Association (2018), the Charles A.

Film noir directors tried to fulfill specific constructions of gender roles in this aesthetically driven cinema style, creating very specific false archetypes for women within the ongoing history of film noir.Hirsch, Foster. The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir. New York, NY: Da Capo, 1983. Print. 147 According to Andrew Spicer in “Film Noir,” the articulation of the patriarchy in film noir is understood as one of the style's most consistent features, no matter the decade of the film.Spicer, Andrew. Film Noir. Harlow, England: Longman, 2002. Print.84 Women's roles The roles that women play in film noir are the stylistic innovations of the heteronormative patriarchy, which are set up to be harmless supplements for the narrative. However, upon further investigation, these roles directly translate to the dark reality of the re-oppressed female post- World War II when women were expected to re-insert themselves back into the home after finding independence through the workforce.Silver, Alain, and James Ursini. Film Noir Reader. New York: Limelight Editions, 1996. Print. 129 The narrative of film noir and the ever-present domestic space during the 1940s and 1950s is an obvious thematic representation of woman as other, in which the “attack on the dominant social values [in film noir is] normally expressed through the representation of the family.”Harvey, Sylvia. Woman’s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36 Sylvia Harvey observes that the absence of the family in film noir indicates that a “woman’s place in the home determines her position in society, but also serves as a reflection of oppressive social relationships.” Harvey, Sylvia. Woman’s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36 This control over the domestic space that women carried when they entered the workforce during World War II was quick to be taken away when social order was attempted to restore itself after the war. Within the uneasy aesthetic of this film style, the harsh light and ominous visual cues of danger approaches the domestic space as a highly disturbed and broken social order, displacing viewers into recognising the tension in the home and the women's role in generating that narrative.Harvey, Sylvia. Woman’s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 42 In that recognizable visual cue that predetermines the gaze on film noir as male oriented, viewers are aware of the “artificial domestic milieu.”Dixon, Wheeler W. Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 38 Women that are represented in film noir are no strangers to the danger that lies beyond the veil of fiction. There is a disruption in the domestic space by the rebelling female moulds of film noir, to which the male protagonists do not take to the success of the over the top narcissist and empowered female character lightly, similar to the reality of the unhappiness of the patriarchal order losing its grip on women. Patriarchal order The patriarchal order of film noir escalates to a point that in some films, such as Double Indemnity (1944), the child becomes oppressed. The family home in Double Indemnity “is the place where three people who hate each other spend endlessly boring evenings together. The husband does not merely not notice his wife, he ignores her sexually”.Harvey, Sylvia. Woman’s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 42 As revenge against his attitude towards her, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Barbara Stanwyck) plots to murder her dull, oppressive husband with the facilitation of an insurance salesman. The two of them are then forced into an endless cycle of “desire, death, and retribution” as a repercussion of the acts that they have committed. At an attempt to deceive the woman and restore order, the insurance man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) soon finds out that the femme fatale has beat him at the game of domestic restoration when she attempts to murder him. Once he is killed, Phyllis is led to live in peace as a black widow, a true spider woman, a femme fatale.Harvey, Sylvia. Woman’s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed.

Hollywood, Freud and the Representation of Women. Regulation and Contradiction, 1945 early 60s. In Home is where the Heart is: Studies in Melodrama and the Woman's Film. Christine Gledhill, ed. London: British Film Institute, 1987. 197-214. Retrospectively, the female role in American cinema and the female role within the domestic space post-World War II were paralleled.Walker, Janet. Hollywood, Freud and the Representation of Women. Regulation and Contradiction, 1945 early 60s. In Home is where the Heart is: Studies in Melodrama and the Woman's Film. Christine Gledhill, ed. London: British Film Institute, 1987. 197-214. The interest that media and popular culture had with feminine psycho-sexuality is directly revealed in the visual cues and dark, sexual narratives in classic titles of Film Noir, such as Phantom Lady (1944), The Reckless Moment (1949), and The Big Sleep (1946). Claire Johnston, through her studies of Double Indemnity (1944), explains that “the Oedipus complex allows access to desire only through repression: it is through lack that desire is instituted”.Johnston, Claire. Double Indemnity. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 91 Women in film noir are often faced with the common theme of an embedded Oedipus complex in the narrative, a threat of castration done by the female antagonist to the male protagonist of the film.Johnston, Claire. Double Indemnity. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 91 In films which exhibit the challenge against the patriarchy and an internal struggle with the Oedipus complex, there are examples, such as Mildred Pierce (1945). The film noir narrative is set up to combat a melodramatic aesthetic - the “women’s perspective” of film, as opposed to the typical gaze that is fixated on male desire.Gledhill, Christine. Home Is Where the Heart Is : Studies in Melodrama and the Woman's Film. London: BFI Pub, 1987. Print. 5 Since Mildred Pierce denies the convention of the male narrative and alters the reception of her desired point of view of the story, the home is left to unravel and reveal its state of disarray as a consequence of her absence. While there is an attempt to balance the role of the loving and sensitive mother while acting as the sole income for the home, there is an obvious resentment that her eldest daughter Veda has for Mildred. On the surface, it is understood that the disgust towards her mother is because of the source of her income, through labour, however it is later revealed that her resentment for Mildred, the protagonist, is because the lack of a phallus. The audience comes to understand this when it is laid out that Mildred's business partner and platonic lover, Monty, is taking advantage of Mildred's funds and supplying Veda with all of her needs, to which Veda obliges happily, opposing her mothers same gestures.Cook, Pam. Duplicity in Mildred Pierce. In Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 69 One of the defining characteristics of film noir is the excess of light, shadow, and texture, all at once.Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 67 The monochrome is reliant on the extreme attempt of shape and contrast in wardrobe. Mildred Pierce relies heavily on visual cues in the attempt to illustrate a straightforward narrative for the audience, which can be seen through the apparel, such as Mildred's dominating shoulder pads and pantsuits as an attempt to combat against the male figure and its default of symbolizing power. Like in any cinema of the early evolution of film, there are specific roles for actors to accommodate in the narrative of the film. One specific example of a stock female character in film noir is the alluring and treacherous femme fatale and \\"Spider Woman\\". The direct translation from French for the term femme fatale is “fatal woman,” which is embedded in classic film noirs, such as Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity (1944), and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). These examples of deadly women commit crimes inside and outside the narrative of the films. As a consistent narrative trait in film noir, there are flashbacks embedded in the storyline, so as to signal towards the presence of a larger story outside of the feature film, an association with reality. As Karen Hollinger describes in “Film Noir, Voice-Over and the Femme Fatale,” women in film noir are subjected to the psychoanalytic perspective of the male, which forces a consistent attempt to try and interpret the meaning of femaleness, from the point of view of the phallus, which is deemed a problematic perspective, since it speaks for a silenced demographic by popular culture and media.Hollinger, Karen. Film Noir, Voice-Over and the Femme Fatale, Dixon, Wheeler W. Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 245 Christine Gledhill explains that there are “five features of film noir,” one of them being an “expressionist visual style and emphasis on sexuality in the photographing of women.” Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 27 Through this perspective and the common male voice over that film noir exhibits, it can neutralize the women's gaze and turn the narrative into the desired male fantasy, although the obvious attempt of the female character.Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 28 Through this gaze of cinema, which is a representation of reality, there is a fabrication that male is the perspective of normativity and female is considered other, as secondary and overlooked.Hollinger, Karen. Film Noir, Voice-Over and the Femme Fatale, Dixon, Wheeler W. Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 254 These female actors are then created as a fictional object and then made into objects of spectacle, made for enjoyment and sexual pleasure.Mulvey, Laura. Visual and Other Pleasures. London: Macmillan, 1989. To combat this perspective of the female figure, the femme fatale is both very useful and problematic. The femme fatale is defined by “her dangerous, yet desirable sexual presence,” rather than the typically weak and supplemental female characters that are cast in Hollywood films.Hollinger, Karen. Film Noir, Voice-Over and the Femme Fatale, Dixon, Wheeler W. Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 246 In these aesthetically loaded films, the glorification of the woman is translated into holding the “visual power” and the gaze of the audience, at times becoming the dominant character, displacing onlookers of their expectations of a sexualized female character and re-establishing the power of the weak female character that once was. This disorients the image of the erotic woman, even in the face of narrative repression.Place, Janey. Women in Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 47 Janey Place describes in “Women in Film Noir” that ‘film noir is a male fantasy, as is most of our art.” Place, Janey. Women in Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 47 The cinematic style of film noir, although problematic, given its glorification of white female golden beauty, gives an active, intelligent symbol of a female character, which is empowering and both relatable for women.Place, Janey. Women in Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 47 Strong female characters in film noir, specifically those of the Femme Fatale breed, manage to displace the viewer into tricking them into adoring the woman for her sexual appeal and reactivity to the mis-en-scene, considering her a prop for the highly aestheticized film style, then later committing crimes that oppose the visage of her characters expectation of being a simplified prop for the male's benefit. However, this character archetype does not come without a convoluted narrative - One example of a treacherous woman is Cora in The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946, she “exhibits a remarkable series of unmotivated character switches and roles.” Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 27 In her introductory shot she is seen as a sex bomb, a desired sex object through the narrator's eyes, yet she juxtaposes this vision as a hard working woman, then a “loving playmate in an adulterous relationship; a fearful girl in need of protection, [a] victim of male power; [a] hard, ruthless murderess; [a] mother-to-be;” then following that she is a sacrifice to the judicial system.Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 31 This inconsistency can be seen as a parallel to the unsureness of the hero's trajectory, although in the male hero's journey, he at least “maintains a consistency of values” in which Cora does not. In many ways, this problematic narrative confirms stereotypes about white women of the time of that decade, the late 1940s, yet still manages to allow an insertion of feminist ideologies through this character in her feats of violence and revenge.Gledhill, Christine. Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012.

A group of Rochester atheists started this critical thinking club as an alternative to the faith based club.

She is best known as the author of Copy-editing: The Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders, referred to throughout the English-speaking world as ‘the definitive handbook on the subject’. She played a role in developing the emerging craft of copy-editing into a fully fledged discipline and establishing it as an essential stage in the publishing process.  Cambridge University Press  For 20 years Butcher was 'chief subeditor' at the academic publishing house Cambridge University Press (CUP). She set up and managed what CUP's former chief executive Dr Jeremy Mynott has called ‘the best subediting department of any in the English-speaking world’. The unreliable and costly tradition of trusting the printer's readers to pick up errors after typesetting was replaced by a methodical system of preparing manuscripts for typesetting and eliminating errors in advance. By personal example and using the growing file of notes that eventually became Copy- editing, she trained scores of copyeditors, many of whom subsequently carried her principles and standards to other publishing houses and organisations in the UK and overseas.  Copy-editing: The Cambridge Handbook  Butcher turned her training notes into a house manual for CUP's copy-editors and later into the book published in 1975 by CUP as Copy-editing: The Cambridge Handbook. It was the first copy-editing manual in English and has remained the authority in its field for over 40 years. It has since been renamed Butcher's Copy-editing and is now in its fourth edition. When she retired from employment Butcher kept the book up to date, making extensive revisions to keep abreast of changes in publishing technology and procedures. However, the fundamental principles that she set out remain unchanged. The book set the standard for good editing practice and disseminated it throughout the UK, the English- speaking world and beyond: it has been translated into several languages. Copy-editing enabled standards to be maintained during the structural changes of the 1970s and 1980s, as publishing houses shed staff and turned increasingly to freelance copy-editors. Copy-editing is now predominantly a freelance occupation, and the book has provided guidance to generations of freelances without access to in-house training.  The Society for Editors and Proofreaders  It was to support the growing number of freelances that the Society of Freelance Editors and Proofreaders (now the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading) was founded in 1988, and Butcher became its first honorary president. She attended almost every annual conference of the society and continued to nurture new copy-editors and proofreaders.

Founded in July 2016 by Major Baisden the NWL promoted live events in Kansas City and St. Louis under the banners of NWL KC and NWL STL, respectively. The NWL's concept was centered around signing homegrown talent from each area, along with free agents from across the country, who would perform in family-friendly storylines centered around personal issues and intercity rivalries. The NWL product was geared primarily at families and men 34–48 who used to watch wrestling before becoming disinterested in the current product. The promotion closed on April 12, 2018. History Major Baisden decided to launch a professional wrestling company after observing a continual drop in popularity for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), a publicly traded company owned by Vince McMahon, and the emergence of popular regional “indies”—independently owned and operated wrestling promotions in former industry hotbeds nationwide. Baisden recognized a void in the marketplace for locally owned promotions with high production values, backed by professional marketing in cities where indie wrestling was thriving. In May 2016, Baisden began scouting indies in both Kansas City and St. Louis to purchase, with the idea of building on the foundation of loyal fans in each city and establishing communication with prospective talent. In July 2016, Baisden began negotiating with Metro Pro Wrestling, owned by Chris Gough. In August 2016, Baisden and Gough finalized terms on a deal that included Gough joining the NWL as director of talent relations and head of creative. Travis Scott Bowden, a former performer and writer for the Memphis Wrestling promotion owned by Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett, joined the NWL in July 2016 as VP of marketing and creative assistant. The NWL formally announced its definitive agreement to acquire the assets of Metro Pro on October 27, 2016. Baisden also made public that Metro Pro's founder, Chris Gough, had joined NWL as the promotion's general manager, helping oversee creative and talent relations. A November 1 article in the Kansas City Business Journal reported that Baisden was planning to open future NWL promotions in other former regional hotbeds such as Austin and Houston; Portland and Seattle; Los Angeles and San Francisco; and Memphis and Nashville. In late November 2016, the company announced plans to open its NWL Training & Development Center in North Kansas City, headed by Rob Messerli and wrestler Derek Stone. On April 12, 2018, Major Baisden announced that the NWL will cease all operations effective immediately. Signings On September 28, 2016, the NWL announced its first signings to multi-year deals: 24-year-old twin brothers Logan and Sterling Riegel, two natives of Lee's Summit, Missouri, who will perform under the names Jet and Jax Royal, a.k.a. Royal Blood. On October 5, 2016, the NWL signed 26-year-old Kevin Kwiatkowski to a multi-year contract, making the 328-pounder from south St. Louis County the first talent acquisition for NWL STL. On October 12, 2016, the NWL announced that it had signed its first nationally known talent in 28-year-old Sam Udell. On November 3, 2016, the NWL informed the media that it had reached a definitive agreement with Matt Jackson to acquire the assets of St. Louis Anarchy (SLA) Wrestling, a local promotion that will become part of NWL STL. Baisden said Jackson would stay on as NWL STL's general manager. Veteran Midwest wrestler Jake Dirden was announced as signing with NWL on November 10, 2016. The following week, NWL KC publicized that it had signed another national star in Bolt Brady, an Austin, Texas, native who will compete in Kansas City under the moniker Blane Meeks.

It is from the Old French \\"Raison\\", which means reasoning and intellectual faculty, and it would have been a nickname for an intelligent person.  Etymology and history  The surname was introduced to England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and it is an example of the sizable group of early European surnames that were created through the habitual use of nicknames. People with the surname include: *Charles L. Reason (1818–1893), American linguist and mathematician *Dana Reason, 20th/21st-century Canadian musician *Jumbo Reason, English footballer *Patrick H. Reason (1816–1898), American lithographer and engraver *J. Paul Reason (born 1941), American naval officer The surname Reason was first seen in Lincolnshire where they held a family seat at Market, Middle and West Rasen which was held by Bishop Odo of Bayeux. The under- tenant holding from the Bishop was Alfred of Lincoln (a Norman noble) and conjecturally most of the Reason family in Britain are descended from him.  Variations  Before the English dictionary and the printing press, no surnames were standardised. There were many variations, including Reason, Rasen, Rason, Rayson, Reson, Reasons, Resons, Reeson, Resen, Resun, Raysun and Rasne.

She previously was an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University, an associate scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and the associate director of the MBL's Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution. She also serves as the associate director of the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations, a National Science Foundation-supported program headquartered at the University of Southern California.  Early life and education  Huber spent her youth in Chicago and has cited frequent visits to the local Shedd Aquarium as part of her inspiration to pursue a career in marine biology. Huber was an undergraduate at Eckerd College in St Petersburg, Florida and received her B.S. in marine science in 1998. She received her Ph.D. in biological oceanography from the University of Washington in 2004 for work with oceanographer and astrobiologist John Baross on the microbial ecology of underwater volcanoes.  Academic career  Huber began work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Marine Biological Laboratory, a facility in Woods Hole, Massachusetts affiliated with the University of Chicago, in 2005; she became an assistant scientist there in 2007. She joined the faculty at Brown University as an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in 2008. She became an associate scientist at MBL and the associate director of the Josephine Bay Paul Center in 2013, and an associate professor at Brown in 2014. She moved her laboratory to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in June 2017.

Huber is also active in public outreach and science communication. You can find her on Twitter @julesdeep or Instagram @jules02543.  Research  Huber's research addresses questions that are central to the nature and extent of life on Earth in one of its least explored corners, the deep ocean. It is focused on microorganisms, who for more than three billion years have served as engines of Earth's biosphere, driving essential biogeochemical cycles that shape planetary habitability. Exploration of the sea over the last 40 years has resulted in astounding discoveries about the extent and diversity of life in the deep ocean, pushing our understanding of the intimate connections between the biosphere and geosphere to the extremes, including the discovery of chemosynthetic ecosystems at hydrothermal vents and active microbes buried in sediments, kilometers beneath the seafloor. In fact, the global ocean comprises Earth's biggest microbiome, with at least half of the ocean's microbial biomass occurring beneath the ocean floor. Her main environment of interest is the largest actively flowing aquifer system on Earth, the fluids circulating through oceanic crust underlying the oceans and sediments. There is a vast flow of fluid exchanging between ocean basins and crustal reservoirs and mediating transport of heat, solutes, genetic material, microorganisms, and viruses. Despite our advancing knowledge about life in the deep ocean, our understanding of microorganisms in the rocky oceanic crust and the fluids flowing through it is limited. The biogeochemical consequences of an extensive population of microbes living in the subseafloor remains unknown, and the potential for production of new biomass within the crust is rarely considered in traditional oceanographic paradigms of carbon cycling or microbial food webs.

In 1940, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the Indiana University (Bloomington). She then matriculated at the University of Chicago Law School, transferred to Indiana University Law School, and graduated with a law degree in 1942. Career Stoffregen worked for several years in private practice as an attorney, and was a member of the Indiana Association of Women Lawyers. During this time she also worked for peace and racial justice as a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. She worked with Bayard Rustin and other members of the Congress of Racial Equality when they visited Indiana. In 1946, she was asked to serve as a law clerk to Frank Richman, a member of the Indiana Supreme Court, who served as one of the American judges at the second round of war crimes trials in Nuremberg, Germany. She spent nearly all of 1947 living and working in the rubble of war-torn Europe. She was one of very few women attorneys working at the Nuremberg trials in any capacity. During this period she visited displaced person camps throughout Europe, where she met with individuals seeking permission to emigrate to the United States. She photographed candidates, and collected personal stories and records that could help people to emigrate. After her return to the United States, she visited numerous churches and other organizations, working to find American citizens who would be willing to sponsor the immigration of these war refugees. Through her personal efforts dozens of refugees found sponsors, and were able to immigrate. She also was frequently asked to describe her experiences in Europe to service organizations and church groups. It was at one such speaking engagement that she met her future husband, David Miller Stoffregen of Cincinnati, Ohio. They were married in a Quaker ceremony on June 18, 1949.

He wrote the critique of The Rebel, which eventually led to ending for good of the relationship between Sartre and Camus. He became acquainted with Emmanuel Mounier, who in 1948 opened for him the doors of the magazine Esprit, where there was a certain 'philocommunism' and who facilitated his entry into the intellectual seraglio of the post-war period. Mounier also invited him to the reading committee of the Éditions du Seuil and recommended him to its literary director, Paul Flamand.

This clandestine network of militants was disbanded in 1960. Fleeing abroad, Francis Jeanson was tried in absentia, convicted of high treason, and sentenced in October 1960 to ten years' imprisonment. He returned to Paris on the occasion of his amnesty in 1966, then worked with the Théâtre de Bourgogne (directed by Jacques Fornier) and was in charge of prefiguring the cultural policy of the Maison de la culture in Chalon-sur-Saône (1967–1971). He proposed and elaborated through this experience the notion of \\"non-public\\", which will be resumed in May 1968 in the Declaration of Villeurbanne, of which he was the main editor.

He served as the Rwandan ambassador to France and Belgium. He was a former Rehabilitation and Social Integration minister for the Rwandan government. In 1987, Bihozagara co-founded Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which had a significant impact during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. After retiring due to failing health, he began to invest his pension in small-scale real estate projects and various small business ventures. TOC  Life after political career  After retiring from his political career, Bihozagara began a six year long attempt to become a citizen of Burundi due to harassment and frustration caused by the regime in Kigali. His applications for citizenship were denied. It is presumed that the main factor in these denials was due to the fact that Bihozagara was not living in Burundi. Bihozagara then traveled to Burundi to conduct business and visit family. He owned assets and properties in Burundi.  Arrest and death  In December 2015, Bihozagara was arrested on suspicion of espionage after weapons were found in his house in Kinindo. He died in a Burundi jail in March 2016. The events surrounding his death remain unclear, though it has been rumored that Bihozagara was assassinated, most likely by poisoning. Other prisoners detained in the same prison stated that Bihozagara was in fairly good health until the day of his death. He died only minutes after arriving at the prison infirmary. It took more than a week for an autopsy to be performed. After the autopsy, his body was returned to his family. Due to the condition of the body, which appeared to have deep bruises and visible scarring on his face, it is assumed that Bihozagara had been tortured. A full autopsy was not performed prior to his funeral. After further investigation, his assassination may have happened because South Africa had been requesting his relocation. Later, information was leaked to the Rwanda supreme leader, Paul Kagame. The Burundi government tried to threaten Bihozagara’s family into signing documents ruling Bihozagara’s death to have been of natural causes, therefore immunizing the Burundi government from any responsibility for his death. Burundi currently faces pressure by human rights activists over their treatment of political prisoners.

For her master's degree she specialized in developmental and reproductive biology under Hameed Al Haj. She did her Ph.D. work in the United States at Colorado State University, graduating in 2005, working on migration of embryonic and metastatic cells under James Bamburg. She credited her family with being supportive of her career in science and her decision to relocate to the United States.  Career  Tahtamouni returned to Jordan after completing her Ph.D. in order to help inspire young women to advanced science studies there and out of commitment to the institutions that supported her move to the United States.

Career Römer was born in Elsfleth in Lower Saxony. Nothing is known about his background. He came to the Danish Gold Coast in an early age where he was a senior assistant (overassistent) when seeking refuge at a British fortress in 1744 when governor Jørgen Billsen wanted to arrest him in connection with a controversy among members of the Danish colonial administration. He then returned to Denmark where he wrote a number of complains to the Danish West India Company. He was licensed as a merchant of the Danish Gold Coast and returned to Africa on board the ship Wilhelmine Galej in 1746. He was promoted to overkøbmand before returning to Denmark. Back in Denmark he purchased a property at Nyhavn 11 in Copenhagen. In 1754, he was granted a license to open a sugar refinery at the site. He remained connected to the Danish colonies through his involvement with Det Københavnske Brødresocietet. Written works Rømer is now mainly remembered for his books. In 1756, he published Tilforladelig Efterretning om Negotien paa Kysten Guinea (German translation in 1758). It was followed by Tilforladelig Efterretning om Kysten Guinea in 1760 /German translation in 1769). The latter contains a foreword by the theologian Erik Pontoppidan in which he claims that black slavery is not incompatible with Christian commandments. The Danish historian Georg Nørregård has characterized Rømer's books as \\"overwhelmingly unreliable\\". Römer did, however, have good local sources and the books contain valuable information about the history of the Ashanti tribeshistorie.

Themes and Critical Response  The first book of the Naphar series, Quarreling, They Met The Dragon, won second prize in the Pacific Northwest Writers Conference Novel Contest in 1982, though the novel did not earn universal praise: writing for Library Journal, Jackie Cassada noted, \\"The strong emphasis on sex unfortunately fails to mesh comfortably with the story's plot.\\" Mary Turzillo, writing in the 1988 edition of Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review Annual, begins her review of the second book in the series (Journey to Membliar) with, \\"This is not a perfect book.\\" Some critique aside, however, the review is on the whole positive. \\"I wouldn't want to live on Naphar,\\" Turzillo says, \\"but I recommend the vicarious pleasure of Sharon Baker's narrative about its society.\\" Turzillo considered that the second book of the series outperformed the first, that \\"the themes of betrayal and loss are powerful,\\" and that Baker's \\"growth as an artist suggests high promise.\\" Turzillo compared Baker's poetic writing style to that of British sci-fi writer Tanith Lee. Writing in the New York Review of Science Fiction, Brian Stableford's longform review of the second and third installments of the Naphar series concludes its lengthy deliberations over Baker's combining of science fiction and fantasy elements with: \\"By virtue of importing and carefully developing the skeptical sciencefictional viewpoint within the emotionally-charged fantasy of self-development, [Baker] attains a particular blend of the two which does benefit from a kind of literary synergy.\\"Stableford, Brian. \\"The Spring of the Twin Moons (review).\\" The New York Review of Science Fiction, #9, May 1989, page 18,  Bibliography  * Quarreling, They Met The Dragon (1984) * Journey to Membliar (1987) * Burning Tears of Sassurum (1988)  References   External links  * at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database * at the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction * at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review Index * at Locusmag.com American science fiction writers American women novelists American fantasy writers 20th-century American novelists 1938 births Women science fiction and fantasy writers 20th-century American women writers 1991 deaths ","title":"Sharon Baker"},{"id":"52518737","title":"Aisha Nakiyemba"},{"id":"52518740","title":"Bad Day to Let You Go"},{"id":"52518750","text":"Acidipila dinghuensis is a chemoorganotrophic, aerobic and non-motile bacterium from the genus of Acidipila which has been isolated from the forest of Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve in the Guangdong Province in China.

It has an area of . It is in the south of the state, and covers part of the Ribeira de Iguape River basin. It provides the main link between the Serra do Mar State Park and the other conservation units in the Vale do Ribeira. The APA is part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve, recognized by UNESCO as the first such reserve in Brazil and one of the largest in the world to cover a forest area. History The Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area was created by SP governor Franco Montoro by decree 22.717 of 21 September 1984, protecting the slopes of the Serra de Paranapiacaba and adjoining region. It excluded the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park and the Jacupiranga State Park from the Serra do Mar APA. Decree 43.651 of 26 September 1998 stated that the APA did not include land recognized as the property of the remnants of quilombo communities. The main objective is to protect a part of the Serra do Mar that is covered by an extensive area of Atlantic Forest, one of the best-preserved areas of the center-south region of Brazil, with great diversity of fauna and flora including endemic and endangered species. Law 10.850 of 6 July 2001 altered the boundaries of the Jacupiranga State Park to exclude the quilombola communities of Nhunguara, Sapatu and André Lopes, and the Intervales State Park to exclude the quilombola communities of Pilões, Maria Rosa, São Pedro, Ivaporunduva and Pedro Cubas. These communities were included in the Serra do Mar APA. Law 12.810 of 21 February 2008 altered the boundaries of the Jacupiranga State Park, conservation units and Jacupiranga Mosaic. The quilombola communities that had formerly been in the Intervales State Park were made part of the Quilombos do Médio Ribeira Environmental Protection Area. São Paulo state decree 58.148 of 21 June 2012 created the Paranapiacaba Conservation Units Mosaic, including the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park, Intervales State Park, Carlos Botelho State Park, Xitué Ecological Station, Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park and the portion of the Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area in the municipalities of Eldorado, Sete Barras, Tapiraí, Juquiá, Ribeirão Grande and Capão Bonito.

The same year she was voted one of the BBC 100 Women. Background Springmuhl is the youngest of four children. Her maternal grandmother was a talented designer herself, and she displayed talent as a young girl in drawing and making clothes for her dolls. After graduating from college as a bachelor in Sciences and Letters, she applied to study fashion but was rejected because of her Down syndrome. She was eventually admitted to a school to study it. Style In her designs, Springmuhl is influenced by Guatemalan folklore. She has worked with numerous indigenous Guatemalan artists who are an influence on her. She makes accessories, wallets, ponchos and dresses, inspired by the culture of her country. She has also makes clothing designed especially for people with her condition. Her designs are typically vibrant, with colourful floral embroidery using old Guatemalan textiles. The BBC says of her designing: \\"She has her own unique design process. It starts with hand-picking vintage, authentic Guatemalan textiles from her trusted supplier in Antigua which are then taken back to her atelier and worked on by a seamstress and an embroidery expert, all according to Isabella's specifications.\\" Acclaim In 2015, Springmuhl was invited to showcase her work at the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing in Guatemala. It was a success, and she sold out of her collection. She has since grown in popularity, and her designs were shown in Panama. In 2016 her dresses were showcased at the International Fashion Showcase segment of London Fashion Week. In October 2016 she was invited to Rome to showcase her designs.

Wilson was best known for his works portraying themes of social justice and equality.  Family and early life  Wilson, commonly referred to by his professional name John Woodrow Wilson, was born the second of five children in Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1922.) Both of Wilson's parents were immigrants from British Guiana, a British colony in South America that is known today as Guyana. They emigrated to America a few years before Wilson was born. British Guiana had a plantation-based economy with sugar being the main good produced. In the colony, Wilson's parents came from a middle-class background. Wilson's maternal grandfather managed a refining plant in British Guiana and the sugar produced at his plant was so pure that the owners of the plantation, who lived in Great Britain, received national prizes almost annually. Wilson's maternal grandfather was transferred to Jamaica, so all of his children except for Wilson's mother, who at that point was married and already had their first daughter, relocated there. Wilson's father stayed in British Guiana because he had been trained as a technician in the sugar industry. One of Wilson's paternal great aunts died when his family was still living in British Guiana. The woman was very rich and left each of her nieces and nephews a portion of her wealth. Wilson recalls his father telling him this woman \\"was so wealthy, she left money to her cats.\\" His father used the money his aunt gave him to open up a variety store. Wilson was very aware of the racial inequalities that surrounded him, even at a very young age. In a 2012 interview, Wilson talked about remembering the newspapers his father would read, like The Amsterdam News, which had images of lynchings in \\"every other issue.\\" A mix of his political views and his intense interest in art led him create the important political statement pieces that he makes through the later years in his life.  Education and career  In Boston, Wilson took art classes at Roxbury Memorial High School and was the art editor of the school newspaper. He also took many classes at the Boys Club from teachers who were students at the school of the Museum of Fine Arts. After getting his work shown to faculty at the school via his teachers from the Boys Club, he received a full scholarship to the Museum of Fine Arts School, eventually graduating there with high honors in 1945. In 1947, Wilson graduated from Tufts University while teaching at Boris Mirski School of Modern Art. Wilson lived in Paris through the MFA fellowship, and studied with the modern artist Fernand Leger. Shortly after returning to United States and marrying Julie Kowtich, he lived in Mexico for five years on a John Hay Whitney fellowship. In his time in Mexico, he was drawn to mural paintings due to their accessibility to anyone regardless of one's means to get into museums or collections. When he returned to the United States from Mexico in 1956, he made artwork for labor unions in Chicago and taught for a bit in New York City before returning to Massachusetts in 1964 to teach at Boston University.  Relationships  Wilson married Julie Kowitch, a teacher who graduated from Brooklyn College, in 1950. The two lived in Mexico while through the John Hay Whitney Fellowship. Wilson and Kowitch were an interracial couple and were forced to drive in separate cars when they traveled in the Southern United States. Julie Kowitch says that her husband, \\"felt that his main objective as an artist was to deliver a message to people about black dignity, about racial justice, about poor people trying to get a better deal in life.\\" Wilson's daughter, Erica, attests that he drew wherever he went and whatever he could find. For example, when driving to New York City with Erica and her son, Wilson drew a series of sketches of his infant grandson. Wilson looked up to the work of Mexican painter Jose Clemente Orozco. Orozco's work focused primarily on political murals that inspired Wilson. When Wilson and his wife traveled to Mexico, Orozco had already passed away.  Major works  = Political pieces = Wilson was championed for his ability to fuse his artistic creativity with his passion for politics and social justice. Wilson's most famous and viewed work is the bronze bust of Martin Luther King Jr. that stands three feet tall in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington D.C.. Wilson won the sculptural commission in 1985 as part of a national competition to create a memorial statue of the civil rights leader for the United States Capitol, and the bust was revealed in the Rotunda on January 15, 1986, which would have been Martin Luther King Jr.'s fifty-seventh birthday. Although both men have ties to Boston University, they never met. In the original etching, Wilson portrays King's physical presence as a haunting vulnerability coupled with unwavering strength, while symbolizing King's assassination through the crosshairs of vertical and horizontal lines that intersect at King's throat that effectively silence the voice of the prolifically outspoken equal rights activist. One of Wilson's most overtly politically charged works, a lithograph called Deliver Us From Evil, was created while he was a student of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1943. In this piece, he comments on the paradoxical nature of World War II, critiquing the United States for fighting for democratic rights in Europe while simultaneously denying African-American citizens those same rights. The left side of the image shows a concentration camp, Nazi soldiers, and Jewish victims, while the right side shows run-down tenement buildings, a lynch mob, and African-American victims. However, despite his criticism of the American government, he did support the war in theory, as he was against fascism and anti-Semitism. Another critical work by Wilson is the lithograph Elevated Streetcar Scene, created in 1945. In this scene, a lone black man sits on a streetcar, surrounded by white women. While all of the other passengers seem to be absentmindedly looking away into different directions, the black man looks directly at the viewer. This creates the effect of identification between the viewer and the subject, as it begs the viewer to \\"ponder the burdens and responsibilities of his wartime life.\\" With this work, Wilson is criticizing Franklin D. Roosevelt's integration of factories. Wilson was quoted saying, \\"I resented the fact that almost everyone on my block was on welfare until they needed us in the shipyards and factories.\\" The subject of this lithograph is one of the Boston Navy Yard workers, wearing workman's coveralls, a cap, and holding a metal lunchbox, riding alongside fashionable women. The rich color palette is made up of mostly reds, whites, and browns, evoking a feeling of warmth from the painting. Wilson experimented with other mediums in his earlier years, like in his 1946 ink drawing \\"Man with Cigarette.\\" The bold lines and shadows in this work in addition to the diagonal composition of the bust create a sense of urgency. The man depicted also seems to share the same sensitive expression that is characteristic of Wilson's portraits, which is used to express Wilson's concerns regarding the African American experience in the United States at the time. He described the country as \\"a world that promised freedom and opportunity for anyone who worked hard… but clearly if you are black you realize that these nice sounding phrases did not include you.\\" Wilson's method for creating profound art can be seen in the sketches he made in preparation for the bust of King. The original drawing he made has been in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts since 1997. When a request was made to display the drawing in another museum for an extended exhibition, Wilson decided to create a print of it rather than expose the original work to the intense lighting in the exhibition space. The result was a \\"sensitive\\" depiction of the civil rights hero, which \\"focuses on King's face, manipulating the rich lights and darks of the etching by scraping and burnishing the plate.\\" He humanizes King by tilting his head and by giving the face \\"an almost weary expression\\" that \\"emphasizes King's profound humanity in his struggle for equality.\\" Eventually, the Museum of Fine Arts purchased this print, along with the copper plate and the nineteen working proofs that Wilson made. This group of works make it possible to understand Wilson's process for making art and are effective in teaching students about printmaking techniques. Wilson's raw and powerful depictions of Martin Luther King, Jr. convey his indirect involvement with the civil rights movement. Even though he did not actively participate in the movement, he did remark that King was \\"a very important symbol\\" in his life. Two of Wilson's illustrated books, Striped Ice Cream and Malcolm X, can be found at the Princeton University Library. Additionally, Wilson's drawing, Steel Worker, was used for the cover design of The Reporter on July 23, 1959, and is currently housed in the Princeton University Art Museum.  Influences  In 1952, Wilson made the lithograph \\"The Trial\\" depicting a young black man awaiting a pronouncement from three looming white judges. This lithograph is now in the Brooklyn Museum. Wilson was very interested by murals and was influenced by the painted Jose Clemente Orozco. He saw murals as a way to reach a wider, more diverse audience who did not have the means to visit art museums. Many artists of the Harlem Renaissance intended their art to make people happy and proud. But Wilson, coming a generation later and living through the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, wanted his art to convey a message and make people think. In an interview with the Boston Globe in 1986, Wilson explained why he sculpted the bust of King in the way that he did. He said \\"the head is tilted forward, as if to communicate with the viewer. I hope the sculpture will stimulate people to learn more about King, to perpetuate his struggle.\\" When Wilson described the bust, he went beyond the physical markings of the head, saying \\"to [him] the eloquence of the piece is not only in the face, but in the rhythms of the gesture.\\" In 1995, Wilson had an exhibit of his own work at the Museum of Fine Arts called Dialogue: John Wilson/Joseph Norman. The exhibit consisted of many of Wilson's sculptures and sketches.  Praise and legacy  Wilson died on Thursday, January 22, 2015 at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was ninety-two years old. Though Wilson is no longer alive, his art continues to make an impact. In Wilson's career survey \\"Eternal Presence\\" of 2012, Boston Globe art critic Sebastian Smee said that Wilson is one of \\"Boston's most esteemed and accomplished artists.\\" Following Wilson's intent to spark political discussion, Smee stated that Wilson's sketches and charcoal drawings are \\"an impulse toward clarity, toward truth.\\" Wilson helped found a museum called the National Center of Afro-American Artists (NCAAA) in Roxbury, where he was born. In this museum, there is an exhibit honoring the life and work of Wilson, which is called John Wilson Remembered 1923–2015. This temporary exhibit included many of his sculptures and graphic art Wilson is represented by Martha Richardson. He had his work featured around Boston throughout his life, including pieces of art in the Museum of Fine Arts and at Martha Richardson Fine Art on Newbury Street.

She wrote: David Orr, reviewing Four Reincarnations for the New York Times, wrote: Orr also quoted, then commented on the end of Ritvo's poem, \\"The Hanging Gardens\\": According to Lucie Brock-Broido of Boston Review, Ritvo is \\"a Realist, a gifted comic, an astronomer, a child genius, a Surrealist, a brainiac, and a purveyor of pure (and impure) joy. His work is composed, quite simply, of candor, of splendor, and of abandon.\\" Louise Glück wrote of his first published collection that it was \\"one of the most original and ambitious first books in my experience... marked by intellectual bravado and verbal extravagance.\\" Stephen Burt of the Los Angeles Review of Books wrote, \\"...the poems are equally conscious of impending death and of the next day’s life, having spent time in a pool of self-skepticism and then emerged shining, shockingly clean...\\" While noting that Ritvo \\"seems to have written most of this book with the clarity, the near equanimity, the distance from ordinary reversals and struggles, of much older poets who know that they are dying,\\" Burt also writes, \\"But mortality is rarely his only subject: shyness, gratitude, and erotic attachment are as important as death itself.\\"  Legacy  In 2017, Milkweed Editions announced the Max Ritvo Poetry Prize, an annual US$10,000 award and publication contract, supported by Riva Ariella Ritvo- Slifka and the Alan B.

Influenced by her grandfather’s work as a tailor, Jarrell learned about fabrics and sewing at a young age.Bouthillier, Rose, Megan Lykins Reich, and Elena Harvey Collins. How to Remain Human. Cleveland: Museum of Contemporary Art, 2015. It was learning these skills that set her on her path as an artist, fashion designer, and vintage clothing dealer. In 1968, Jae Jarrell, along with Wadsworth Jarrell, Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, and Gerald Williams, founded AfriCOBRA, the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists.\\"Jae Jarrell\\", Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. 2015. Accessed September 26, 2016. As part of their manifesto, Jarrell strived to provide positive representation of the African diaspora. Her goal was to produce garments that inspired pride, power, energy, and respect in African American communities.  Early life and education  Jarrell grew up in the historical neighborhood of Glenville in Cleveland, Ohio. During her childhood, she was inspired by the legacy of her grandfather. His work as a tailor led to her develop knowledge of clothing fabrics, fibers, and weaves. She was also influenced by the success of her uncle’s haberdashery shop, where he sold fabric and sewing tools. His achievements in business made her want to open her own store In addition to the influence of her grandfather and uncle, her mother took her to vintage shops and taught her to respect the craftsmanship that goes into making clothing. This set Jarrell further on her path as an artist. When speaking about this experience with Rose Bouthillier (2015), Jarrell said: > And so I always thought of making clothes in order to have something unique, > and later I learned to sew very well and made it my business to always make > my garments. And I also have a love for vintage, knowing that it has secrets > of the past that I can unfold (p. 64). Jarrell attended Bowling Green State University before moving to Chicago to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago During the late 1950s and early 60s, she attended the same art school as Wadsworth Jarrell, a fellow artist who would later become her husband Zorach, Rebecca. \\"Wadsworth and Jae Jarrell.\\" Never The Same. 2013. Accessed September 25, 2016. https://never- the-same.org/interviews/wadsworth-and-jae-jarrell/. However, the couple didn't meet until 1963 after Jarrell opened her own vintage boutique Douglas, R. L. (1996). Wadsworth Jarrell: The Artist as Revolutionary. Rohnert Park, California: Pomegranate.  Career  = Chicago = During her early years in Chicago, Jarrell worked a temporary job at Motorola. During her time there, a female co-worker helped her create the name, \\"Jae\\", which she then continued to use when producing her art. According to Jarrell, after she shared her secret desire to be a designer and own a shop, the woman suggested that she use the reverse order of her maiden name, Elaine Annette Johnson, as an acronym. Following her advice, Jarrell opened a store near the famous Hyde Park and called it \\"Jae of Hyde Park\\" Chicago would also be important for both Jae and Wadsworth as it would be the city in which they would help create AfriCOBRA. In an interview, Jarrell credited Chicago for being a forward thinking city and appreciated it for its open-mindedness; without these traits, she says that she would be unsure as to whether or not AfriCOBRA would have succeeded In 1967, she married Wadsworth Jarrell, and they honeymooned in Nassau, Bahamas. She had their first child, Wadsworth Jr., on January 7, 1968. After giving birth to their second child, Jennifer, the Jarrells decided to relocate to New York to escape the social and economic downturn in Chicago Following her involvement with AfriCOBRA in Chicago, Jarrell would eventually move to Washington D.C. to once again pursue learning by completing her BFA and graduate work at Howard University = AfriCOBRA = Much of Jarrell's art was created as a member of AfriCOBRA, the African American artist collective that sought to invoke the styles of African art while infusing a strong call for revolution. AfriCOBRA formed out of the remains of the Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists (COBRA) and centralized around the idea of Black pride and Black empowerment that comes from feeling powerful and standing tall AfriCOBRA even had a manifesto written by one of its founding members, Jeff Donaldson, in which he wrote out some of the main staples of AfriCOBRA's art making as well as what the collective stood for. In one section, Donaldson spoke of the kind of art that the members would make, saying that it would fit into one of three categories: # definition—images that deal with the past # identification—images that relate to the present # direction—images that look into the future Donaldson, Jeff R. \\"Africobra Manifesto?: 'Ten in Search of a Nation.'\\" Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art 30, no. 1 (2012): 76-83. Going further in the manifesto, Donaldson gave very thorough detail about the artistic direction of the collective, providing a list of qualities that he cut down to the six most important ones which are as follows: # Expressive Awesomeness- the feeling \\"that one experiences in African art and life in the U.S.A.\\" # Symmetry and Rhythm- \\"repetition with change, based on African music and African movement\\" # Mimesis- \\"the plus and the minus, the abstract and the concrete\\" # Organic looking- \\"We want the work to look like the creator made it through us\\" # Shine- \\"We want the things to shine, to have the rich luster of a just-washed 'fro, of spit-shined shoes, of de-ashened elbows and knees and noses\\" # Color- \\"color that shines, color that is free of rules and regulations…. Color that is expressively awesome\\" This manifesto would dictate the way that AfriCOBRA was conducted and, as a result, was influential in the way that Jae Jarrell would shape her art while a part of the collective. With AfriCOBRA, Jarrell, along with the rest of the collective, aimed to use her art to build a positive learning community that promoted Black pride among the community as well as to whoever was lucky enough to experience any art from the collective. During an interview with the Never the Same Foundation, Jarrell said: > We made an effort to raise a consciousness. In our hearts, when we put this > all together we thought it was going to be an explosion of positive imagery, > and things that gave kids direction, and knowing some of our leaders now > portrayed in a fresh way. I saw a result of our raising the consciousness, > particularly about our history Despite being grouped into the same realm as the Black Panthers and other radical Black groups, AfriCOBRA, as Jarrell saw it, was always driven by positivity and empowerment of African Americans. In the same interview, Jarrell talked about how she used history as a reference only when looking at times of African empowerment and thereby avoided using things like segregation as a reference, not only for herself, but for the AfriCOBRA collective as well When creating art for AfriCOBRA, Jarrell made her unique garments, using the body as a vessel for revolution and identity Her pieces reflect the goal of the group, which was to create an African American aesthetic that celebrated black power and a sense of community. During the interview with the Never the Same Organization in Chicago, Jarrell described her work with AfriCOBRA, which involved making textile designs done on leather or suede that she would then tie-dye, screen print, hand paint, and applique The most famous pieces she did at this time are her Revolutionary Suit (1968), Ebony Family (1968), and Urban Wall Suit (1969). The Revolutionary Suit (1968) is a two-piece suit that has Jarrell’s signature style from the late 60s. The suit has a tweed, collarless jacket and a-framed skirt, which matched the fashion trends of the time. This ensemble also incorporates a colorful, faux bandolier that stands out against the salt-and-pepper color of the suit. This piece, which inspired ideas about wearing clothing for protest and revolution, motivated Jet magazine to write a piece called \\"Black Revolt Sparks White Fashion Craze\\" which criticized white, mainstream fashion for cultural appropriation. The magazine accused the fashion world of taking the bandolier, which was meant to be a symbol of the righteous protest against the unfair treatment of African Americans, and attempting to turn it into a trendy accessory. Following one of the themes of AfriCOBRA, which emphasized the Black Family, Jarrell made her suit called Ebony Family (1968). It is meant to be a symbol of the power within strong black families. Ebony Family also emphasizes AfriCOBRA’s interest in the influence of African art and the use of bright and vivid \\"Cool-ade\\" colors. These \\"Cool-ade\\" colors were a play on the bright orange, cherry red, lemon yellow, lime green, and grape purple of the drink Kool-aid. Jarrell accomplishes this by crafting her suit to be like a poster which takes form as a dashiki, a traditional West African men's dress. The suit depicts a colorful, Black family, using the forms reminiscent of the African mask to create their faces. Jarrell’s Urban Wall Suit (1969) is a piece inspired by graffiti and concert posters that filled the streets and African American neighborhoods in Chicago. Jarrell incorporated AfriCOBRA's desire to emphasize images with language by making the suit a symbol of the message boards of the community. All over the suit, there are images of posters that proclaim things like \\"Vote Democrat\\" as well as white graffiti messages that say things like \\"Black Princess\\" and \\"Miss Attitude.\\" Furthermore, with Urban Wall Suit, Jarrell reused her fabric to follow one of the tenets of AfriCOBRA, which was to reinvent yourself in order to create something fresh. She used small pieces and scraps from her store to make the patchwork resembling bricks, adding velvet ribbon as the mortar. These fabric scraps are of all different colors and patterns, including stripes, polka dots, and plaid. She then incorporated the graffiti and poster elements that resembled the message boards The AfriCOBRA group identified themselves as a ‘family’. They came together in a cooperative, merging their unique styles into a collective aesthetic. In doing so the group was able to represent unity and strength in their art and their movement, while still letting their individual aspects and styles remain in each of their artworks. Through this unified, ‘family’ front the AfriCOBRA group was able to reject racialized stereotypes like that of the supposed dysfunctional black family. Their conjoined efforts brought a voice to the community; a voice representing their message and movement through their art. While Jae Jarrell and her husband continually worked with their art family for a movement they wholeheartedly believed in, they did eventually step away from the coalition. Jarrell has since emphasized the lasting and present influence AfriCOBRA has in her art – they didn’t leave coalition fully behind, the direction of their futures simply differed. Though Jarrell is no longer with the AfriCOBRA collective, she still holds all those who were ever a part of the collective as family and says that she is still influenced by them when making art to this day In an interview with Rebecca Zorach Jae Jarrell explains that AfriCOBRA, > \\"It’s like a family, you know, you could never divorce yourself from the > family. You can only grow, and you could always understand those who have > not moved in the same kind of direction you have, but there’s a language you > have, and an eye contact and a trust and a respect. It goes a long way.\\" = Later work = In more recent years, Jarrell has not lost her passion for design, but she has shifted her focus to sculpting and constructing furniture Some of her recent works, which were displayed in the How to Remain Human exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, include Maasai Collar Vest (2015), Shields and Candelabra Vest (2015), and Jazz Scramble Jacket (2015). The Maasai Collar Vest (2015) is reminiscent of the ornate garments and jewelry of the Maasai people in Africa. This piece draws on the idea of embracing her African heritage, which is something seen throughout all of her work. Jarrell continues emphasizing African art and culture in Shields and Candelabra Vest (2015) by making the piece from cactus plants turned over to make frames for vibrant African shields. For her Jazz Scrabble Jacket (2015), Jarrell brings together notions of jazz and blues music with images from the board game, Scrabble. Imitating the crossword aspect of Scrabble, Jarrell intersects the names of important musicians to examine the influence of music in building scenes, styles, power, and history for African American communities.  Exhibitions  Jarrell's work has appeared in several major exhibitions, including the Brooklyn Museum of Art’s 2014 exhibition Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the Sixties and the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland's 2015 exhibition How to Remain Human. Jarrell's work was also featured in the 2015 exhibit The Freedom Principle: Experiments in Art and Music, 1965 to Now at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MoCAC).

Hopscotch is the first programming language designed for a touch screen device. John and Leavitt aimed to create a programming language that was simple enough for children to use, while still allowing children to learn and be creative. The app involves a visual programming language, rather than employing lines of code. Hopscotch, which is aimed at children ages eight to 12, was downloaded 20,000 times in its first week. They first launched the app for the iPad in 2013, and have since developed the app for the iPhone. Within one year, users created over 2.5 million projects. Most children use the app to build games and create animated artwork while learning programming basics. According to the founders, nearly half of Hopscotch's users are girls.

Prior to 2005, State Farm offered two types of insurance policies to homeowners: flood insurance, which would be reimbursed by the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program, and general homeowner insurance, which would be paid directly by State Farm.

The attack was claimed by the Republican Action Force believed to be a covername used by Provisional IRA (IRA) volunteers. Earlier in the day, two Catholic civilians were killed in a bomb attack in a Belfast pub carried out by the Protestant Action Force a name used by the Ulster Volunteer Force to claim some attacks. An elderly Catholic man was shot later the same night by loyalists bringing the death toll to eight for the day. Background and events leading up to the attack By 1975, the religious-political conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles was more than six years old. On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British government entered into a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches.Extracts from The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA by Kevin J. Kelley. Zed Books Ltd, 1988. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals wanted no part of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when—they claimed—they had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA. There was a rise in sectarian killings during the truce, which 'officially' lasted until early 1976. Ulster loyalists, fearing they were about to be forsaken by the British government and forced into a united Ireland,Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.142 increased their attacks on the Irish Catholic and nationalist community. They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus hasten an end to the truce.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 Under orders not to engage the security forces, some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused serious problems of internal discipline and some IRA members, with or without permission from higher up the command chain, engaged in tit-for-tat killings. Early in 1975 around the time of the IRA ceasefire starting, loyalist paramilitaries, specifically the UVF and the UFF of the UDA began stepping up their campaign of sectarian killings. On 9 February 1975 two Catholic civilian teenagers were killed by loyalists as they left St. Brigids Roman Catholic Church in Belfast. On 10 February Loyalists shot dead three more Catholic civilians, two in a pub were killed by the UVF and one who was doing his job as a road sweeper was shot by an unnamed loyalist group. On 13 March the UVF carried out a gun and bomb attack on Conway's Bar, Greencastle, Belfast, in which two more people died. One of those killed was a Catholic civilian, and the other was a member of the UVF who died when the bomb he was planting in the pub exploded prematurely. That same day the UDA also shot dead a Catholic civilian. The attack The attack was carried out by a three-man active service unit. At around 6.00pm two members of the unit opened fire in the bar with handguns before the third member of the unit ran in with the bomb, placed it where it would do most damage near the doorway, lit the fuse and then the unit ran out of the pub and drove away. The force of the explosion was massive and brought the roof crashing in on the customers. The bar was packed with people waiting to watch the Grand National horse race when the attack happened. The bar was known to be popular with Volunteers of the UVF. The getaway car used in the attack was found abandoned in the Springfield Road area: a stronghold for the IRA. It took rescue services hours to free people from the rubble. The Mountainview Tavern attack was similar to the Bayardo Bar attack carried out by the IRA's Belfast Brigade, in that attack 5 people were also killed, including one loyalist paramilitary from the UVF and 4 Protestant civilians, and close to 60 injured as well. Because both attacks were so similar most people believe the IRA was responsible for the Mountainview attack. However, unlike the Mountainview attack, the IRA was caught at the Bayardo attack and Brendan \\"Bik\\" McFarlane was sentenced to life imprisonment for leading the attack. Aftermath Throughout 1975 sectarian attacks grew worse. With the IRA in talks with the British government they stopped attacks on the British Army and RUC whereas the UVF and UDA stepped up their killings of the Nationalist community. So the IRA concentrated on tackling the Loyalist paramilitaries and loyalist politicians, a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA started the same year causing several deaths throughout Ireland. On 12 April the UVF killed 6 Catholic civilians in a gun and bomb attack at a bar in Anderson Street, Short Strand, Belfast, it was similar to the attack carried out at Mountainview Tavern. Two of those killed in the Anderson town attack were two women in their mid 60s and another woman in her late 50s. Nine days later on 21 April the PAF claimed responsibility for killing 3 Catholic civilians when they bobby-trapped a car owned by one. Less than one week later on 27 April the PAF shot dead 3 more Catholic civilians in a social club. On 23 May the PAF claimed responsibility for shooting dead two brothers after they were lured to a house in Mount Vernon, Belfast. On 3 June two Protestant civilians and a UDR soldier were shot dead by the IRA in Killen, Armagh. One week later the IRA shot dead a UVF member at his greengrocer's shop, Crumlin Road, near Ligoniel Road, Belfast. On 22 June two Protestant civilians were shot dead by the IRA in an attack at Westland Road, Belfast. Later on the same night the UVF stabbed a 48-year-old Catholic man to death. On 31 July the Ulster Volunteer Force carried out a gun and bomb attack on the members of the Miami Showband. Three members of the band were killed and one seriously injured during the attack. This attack shocked and outraged most people in Ireland. Two weeks after the Miami Showband attack on 13 August the IRA killed 5 people and injured 50+ in a gun and bomb attack on a Belfast bar. see also - Bayardo Bar attack The sectarian tit-for-tat killings culminated at the start of 1976 with two brutal sets of killings. On 4 January 1976 six Catholic civilians from two different families died as a result of two separate gun attacks by the UVF, 3 members of the O'Reavey family killed were all brothers and from the O'Dowd family of the three, two brothers and their father were killed. see also - Reavey-O'Dowd killings The next day on 5 January, in the Kingsmill massacre about 20 members from the Provisional IRA (and possibly the INLA using the cover-name South Armagh Republican Action Force shot 11 Protestant civilians returning home from their work, they were lined up against the van they were travelling in and then machine gunned to death, out of the 11 shot, one person managed to survive despite being shot over a dozen times. In 1973, 119 civilians were killed, in 1974, 192 were killed, 1975 had a small decrease as 174 civilians died that year but it jumped to 207 in 1976, making it the second worst year of the conflict behind 1972 for civilian deaths.Deaths in each year of the Troubles, Northern Ireland, 1969-1998CAIN: Sutton Index of DeathsCAIN: Sutton Index of DeathsCAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths See also *Miami Showband killings *Bayardo Bar attack *Kingsmill massacre *Hillcrest Bar bombing Sources *CAIN project References 1975 in Northern Ireland 1975 murders in the United Kingdom 1970s in County Antrim April 1975 crimes April 1975 events in the United Kingdom Attacks on bars in the United Kingdom Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Explosions in 1975 Explosions in Belfast Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland Mass murder in 1975 Mass murder in Belfast Massacres in Northern Ireland Provisional IRA bombings Terrorist incidents in Belfast Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1975 The Troubles in Belfast Building bombings in the United Kingdom ","title":"Mountainview Tavern attack"},{"id":"52520316","text":"The RBC Emerging Playwright Award (presented by Playwrights Guild of Canada as part of the annual Tom Hendry Awards) is a national playwriting competition in Canada which gives its winner a 6-month mentorship and cash prize.

Surface tension forces will only begin to dominate gravitational forces below length scales on the order of the fluid's capillary length, which for water is about 2 millimeters. Because of this scaling, biomimetic devices that utilize surface tension will generally be very small, however there are many ways in which such devices could be used.  Applications  = Coatings = Lotus Leaf (5780807820) Unitary roughness structure versus hierarchical structure A lotus leaf is well known for its ability to repel water and self-clean. Yuan and his colleagues fabricated a negative mold of alotus leaf from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to capture the tiny hierarchical structures integral for the leaf's ability to repel water, known as the lotus effect. The lotus leaf's surface was then replicated by allowing a copper sheet to flow into the negative mold with the assistance of ferric chloride and pressure. The result was a lotus leaf-like surface inherent on the copper sheet. Static water contact angle measurements of the biomimetic surface were taken to be 132° after etching the copper and 153° after a stearic acid surface treatment to mimic the lotus leaf's waxy coating. A surface that mimics the lotus leaf could have numerous applications by providing water repellent outdoor gear. Salvinia auriculata-lake-yercaud-salem-India Various species of floating fern are able to sustain a liquid-solid barrier of air between the fern and the surrounding water when they are submerged. Like the lotus leaf, floating fern species have tiny hierarchical structures that prevent water from wetting the plant surface. Mayser and Barthlott demonstrated this ability by submerging different species of the floating fern salvinia in water inside a pressure vessel to study how the air barrier between the leaf and surrounding water react to changes in pressure that would be similar to those experienced by the hull of a ship. Much other research is ongoing using these hierarchical structures in coatings on ship hulls to reduce viscous drag effects. = Biomedical = Bronchial anatomy A lung is composed of many small sacks called alveoli that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of the blood respectively as the blood is passed through small capillaries that surround these alveoli. Surface tension is exploited by alveoli by means of a surfactant that is produced by one of the cells and released to lower the surface tension of the fluid coating the inside of the alveoli to prevent these sacks from collapsing. Huh and his fellow researchers created a lung mimic that replicated the function of native alveolar cells. An extracellular matrix of gel, human alveolar epithelial cells, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on a polydimethylsiloxane membrane that was bound in a flexible vacuum diaphragm. Pressurization cycles of the vacuum diaphragm, which simulated breathing, showed similar form and function to an actual lung. The type II cells were also shown to emit the same surfactant that lowered the surface tension of the fluid coating the lung mimic. This research will hopefully some day lead to the creation of lungs that could be grown for patients that need to have a transplant or repair performed. = Locomotion = 20140427 130230 7250M Microvelia exploit surface tension by creating a surface tension gradient that propels them forward by releasing a surfactant behind them through a tongue-like protrusion. Biomimetic engineering was used in a creative and fun way to make and edible cocktail boat that mimicked the ability of microvelia to propel themselves on the surface of water by means of a phenomenon called the marangoni effect. Burton and her colleagues used 3D printing to make small plastic boats that released different types of alcohol behind the boat to lower the surface tension and create a surface tension gradient that propelled each boat. This type of propulsion could one day be used to make sea vessels more efficient. = Actuators = Polypody (a fern) - the underside - geograph.org.uk - 974672 Image from page 395 of \\"The structure and development of mosses and ferns (Archegoniatae)\\" (1918) (14598564448) Fern sporangia consist of hygroscopic ribs that protrude from a spine on the part of the plant that encapsulate spores in a sack (diagram). A capillary bridge is formed when water condenses on to the surface of these spines. When this water evaporates, surface tension forces between each rib cause the spine to retract and rip open the sack, spilling the spores. Borno and her fellow researchers fabricated a biomimetic device from polydimethylsiloxane using standard photolithography techniques. The devices used the same hygroscopic ribs and spine that resemble fern sporangia. The researchers varied the dimensions and spacing of the features of the device and were able to fine-tune and predict movements of the device as a whole in hopes of using a similar device as a microactuator that can perform functions using free energy from a humid atmosphere. Leaf Beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) - male A leaf beetle has an incredible ability to adhere to dry surfaces by using numerous capillary bridges between the tiny hair-like setae on its feet. Vogel and Steen noted this and designed and constructed a switchable wet adhesion mechanism that mimics this ability. They used standard photolithography techniques to fabricate a switchable adhesion gripper that used a pump driven by electro-osmosis to create many capillary bridges that would hold on to just about any surface. The leaf beetle can also reverse this effect by trapping air bubbles between its setae to walk on wet surfaces or under water. This effect was demonstrated by Hosoda and Gorb when they constructed a biomimetic surface that could adhere objects to surfaces under water. Using this technology could help to create autonomous robots that would be able to explore treacherous terrain that is otherwise too dangerous to explore. Water strider, from Kerala Various life forms found in nature exploit surface tension in different ways. Hu and his colleagues looked at a few examples to create devices that mimic the abilities of their natural counterparts to walk on water, jump off the liquid interface, and climb menisci. Two such devices were a rendition of the water strider. Both devices mimicked the form and function of a water strider by incorporating a rowing motion of one pair of legs to propel the device, however one was powered with elastic energy and the other was powered by electrical energy. This research compared the various biomimetic devices to their natural counterparts by showing the difference between many physical and dimensionless parameters. This research could one day lead to small, energy efficient water walking robots that could be used to clean up spills in waterways. = Environment = stenocara dentata The Stenocara beetle, a native of the Namib Desert has a unique structure on its body that allows it to capture water from a humid atmosphere. In the Namib Desert, rain is not a very common occurrence, but on some mornings a dense fog will roll over the desert. The stenocara beetle uses tiny raised hydrophilic spots on its hydrophobic body to collect water droplets from the fog. Once these droplets are large enough, they can detach from these spots and roll down the beetle's back and into its mouth. Garrod et al. has demonstrated a biomimetic surface that was created using standard photolithography and plasma etching to create hydrophilic spots on a hydrophobic substrate for water collection. The optimal sizing and spacing of these spots that allowed the most water to be collected was similar to the spacing of the spots on the body of the stenocara beetle. Currently, this surface technology is being studied to implement as a coating on the inside of a water bottle the will allow the water bottle to self fill if left open in a humid environment, and could help to provide aid where water is scarce.

Each episode ends with a disclaimer stating that 'while the investigative techniques shown are real, some procedures have been replicated for broadcast.' Some information the hunters obtained — such as the Enterprise rental agreement and the car’s location — came from the production itself, provided to the hunters when they requested it. Also, participants granted access in advance to their personal records, homes and phones, and then that information was meted out to the hunters the same way it would have been during an actual investigation. There was a clear firewall between the hunter team and fugitive team. The production team did considerable research to ensure that the requests and receipt of information simulated what would happen in the real world, such as waiting for a subpoena. Additionally, the hunters had to make proper requests, and were sometimes denied information by the production team. Hunted was picked up by Channel 4 in the UK, but renamed Hunted USA to avoid confusion with the UK version.

She became a symbol of the fight against Pretoria Girls High School's policy regarding black girls' hair in 2016, at the age of 13. She and her classmates held a demonstration that led to not only a change in school policy, but also an inquiry into allegations of racism at the school. She is quoted as saying: “Asking me to change my hair is like asking me to erase my blackness.” Zulaikha Patel in a photoshoot. Pretoria Girls' High School, is located in Pretoria, Republic of South Africa. The school was founded in 1902, and was all white during apartheid, but since 1990, the school is open to all races. According to CNN, Pretoria Girls' Code of Conduct does not specifically mention Afros, but it does lay out rules for general appearance, including prescribing that all styles \\"should be conservative, neat and in keeping with the school uniform.\\" Teachers had told the students that their afro hair is \\"exotic\\" and needed to be tamed. It was implied that girls' hair needed to be straightened or tied back, not worn as afros. Zulaikha Patel was among the students who led a demonstration against Pretoria Girls High, against the all girl school's hair policy. The demonstrating teenagers were threatened with arrest as Zulaikha Patel led the silent protest. A video posted online showed Zulaikha Patel's calm defiance as she faced three armed security guards who were hired by the school management to break up the demonstration. This video caused a large backlash against the school. Zulaikha Patel's actions inspired other protests in South Africa, at Lawson Brown High School in the Eastern Cape, and St. Michael's School for Girls in Bloemfontein where parents marched as well. People worldwide began sharing pictures of their own afros on social media, in solidarity with the female students of Pretoria High School. International press coverage ensued. The protests showed that racial divisions persist, despite the 1991 end of apartheid. Patel's defiance initiated more protests and change. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi visited Pretoria Girls' High School to hear the black students’ grievances, not only about the hair policy, but about racism in general at the school. For example, girls are not permitted to speak African languages on the school premises, only English or Afrikaans. Patrick Gaspard, US ambassador to South Africa, tweeted: \\"All societies have rules. And sometimes those rules are biased and need to be exposed and protested.\\" An online petition had almost 25,000 signatures within a day. The Gauteng Department of Education suspended the hair policy.

It is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by György Dragomán and follows Djata (Lorenzo Allchurch) growing up in a dictatorship, without access to the rest of the world, while dealing with persecution against him and his parents by the government. It had its world premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival and its international premiere at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival. Plot The film follows Djata (Lorenzo Allchurch), a 12-year-old boy growing up in a dystopian territory called Homeland, under a dictatorship and without access to the rest of the world. His father, Peter (Ross Partridge), tells him of the true nature of Homeland as well as of a treasure guarded by a man named Pickaxe (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson). Peter is later taken away by two government agents, leading to him and Djata's mother, Hannah (Agyness Deyn), being labelled traitors by the government and the citizenry. Djata visits his father's parents who are devoted to the totalitarian government. Once there, his grandfather shows him a gun and orders him to kill a cat. When Djata hesitates, his grandmother presses him to shoot. Later that night his grandfather gives him a medal his father won as a boy for being a great shooter. When Djata returns home his mother gives him a birthday cake but notices Djata is hiding something. When she sees the medal she is angered that he accepted a gift from his grandparents. She yells at him that she won't let his grandparents brainwash him and sends him to his room. The next day, while Djata is playing with his friends with the football his father gave him, two bullies known as \\"the twins\\", Romulus and Remus, drive up to them, force candy on them and take Djata's ball. Later Djata and his mother are standing on a line at the local market, but when they try to buy food they are turned away because they have been blacklisted. Djata is sitting in his hangout when an older boy throws a dead bird with a note through the window. Djata and his friends see the note is an invitation by the bullies to fight to get his ball back. During the fight the next day, Djata manages to get into the bullies' base, but he is caught by the twins who try to intimidate him into saying that the ball is theirs. He refuses, breaks free and escapes with his football. When Djata returns home, his mother is trying to find a way to find his father. She reaches out to her father-in-law but he refuses to help. Djata and his mother then visit the local General to ask for help. The General sends Djata out of the room so she can discuss \\"business\\" with his mother. Djata wanders through the building and finds a female android who plays chess (linking back to the film's opening sequence which included shots of Djata and his father playing chess), but he then hears his mother fighting off advances by the General. They demand to leave, and the General lets them go, but only after telling Djata that he will die like his father. When they get back home Djata's mother tries to find anything and everything she can sell to buy his father's freedom. Djata stops his mother and tells her everything will be okay. Djata decides to go with his best friend to find the treasure his father told him about. When they find the cave, it's not full of treasure but scattered human skeletons and other rubbish. His friend becomes angry and pushes Djata into the pit. Pickaxe finds him and tells him the government put him there to guard their secrets. Before sending him home, Pickaxe asks Djata what he's willing to sacrifice to find his father; he shows Djata that he has no eyes, and hugs him farewell. As Djata leaves the forest, his grandfather finds him and in a panic tells him that all he wanted for his father was a better life. He tells Djata he's been trying all this time to find Djata's father, but to no avail. He tells Djata that he and his mother need to escape the country. He returns Djata home to his mother but then collapses and dies from a heart attack. At the funeral, Djata and his mother are refused seats at the front of the meeting hall. In the middle of the eulogy given by Djata's grandmother, Djata's father is brought in, in chains. His grandmother appears shaken by his appearance. Djata and his mother run to him and embrace him until a guard breaks it up. Djata's mother screams at the guard; Djata's father lunges at the guard and is dragged out. Djata's mother is knocked down and Djata picks up a stick to chase after the guards dragging his father away. Djata knocks a guard down, but he can't catch the guards holding his father who is thrown into a truck which drives away. Djata runs after them while his mother tries to follow on her bicycle. Djata runs behind the truck, his mother is riding behind him. The film ends.

The film was directed and written by Alex Helfrecht and Jörg Tittel and was shot in Hungary. Its production started in June 2015 as principal photography began for the film, where it used settings such as a former Soviet air force base. The directors first became aware of the book when Helfrecht was working in London, and became emotionally invested in the book after only a few pages. The directors intentionally portrayed the dystopian setting's nature as beautiful rather than dismal. They also wanted to make a story where the viewer is granted as little information as the protagonist. However, the directors opted to include an animated sequence at the beginning that \\"tells the story through the language of propaganda, the symbols that will be seen through the film.\\" For this, they sought out the animation studio Spov, which had worked on content in the Call of Duty and Titanfall video game series. Release The film received its world premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2016 on June 18, 2016. It was also featured at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival as part of its \\"First Features Competition\\" alongside 13 other films; it was its international debut. Reception The White King has received generally positive reception; it holds an average rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 71%, based on 21 reviews. It also received a nomination for the \\"Michael Powell Award for Best British Feature Film\\" and \\"The Award for Best Performance in a British Feature Film\\" at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Neil Young, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, felt that the film was intriguing but ended on an unsatisfying note; he however felt that lead actor Lorenzo Allchurch did a quality job, given his inexperience, and that he hopes to see more out of him in the future. Charles Gant of Screen Daily compared the film to the novel 1984, similarly giving Allchurch praise for his performance. Gant felt that while it succeeds at presenting the world in the tone that it wants, it suffers somewhat from a relatively weak narrative due to the novel being a \\"loose collection of stories. Writer Emma Simmonds called it a \\"moderately successful dystopian adventure,\\" similarly comparing it to 1984 but also The Hunger Games and The Goonies. She felt that it may have a good appeal to older teens. MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher, however, commented: \\"This sad mess of a vaguely sci-fi coming-of-age tale seemingly could not be more plugged into current fears, and yet it feels utterly irrelevant.\\"http://www.flickfilosopher.com/2017/01/white-king-movie-review- boys-eye-view-dystopia.html  References   External links   2016 films English-language films Films shot in Hungary ","title":"The White King (film)"},{"id":"52520456","text":"The 229th Brigade Engineer Battalion is an Engineer Battalion in the Virginia Army National Guard, part of the 29th Infantry Division's 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

Chen Shaoxing worked across mediums including paint, photography, and collage, though he has become increasingly focused on the combination of ink, video, and installation.  Early life  Chen Shaoxiong was born in 1962 in Shantou, a city in the eastern part of Guangdong province. Chen Shaoxiong graduated from Guangzhou Fine Art Academy in 1984, trained in Chinese ink. In 1990, he was a founder of conceptual art group Big Tail Elephant Group with Lin Yilin, Liang Juhui, and Xu Tan.  Artist profile  Chen belongs to a generation of Chinese artists who grew up during a period of significant political, socio- economic and cultural change in China, when information and images were routinely suppressed and restricted, and when distinctions between fact and fiction were blurred. Perhaps because of this experience, Chen is acutely conscious and skeptical of the ways in which history is misread and misrepresented, stating that even today \\"in our education, history is deliberately misinterpreted, randomly deleted and repeatedly distorted\\". Although his works are politically engaged, Chen refrains from making bold political statements, preferring a more multi-layered and open-ended approach, which he is able to achieve through the moving image.  Ink History  Ink History (2010) visually chronicles China’s history, from the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 to the beginning of the twenty-first century with images of the last Emperor, Japanese military presence, the Long March, and Mao Zedong announcing the People’s Republic of China, among others. Carefully selected and sparingly released at a time when all media were under Party control, these pictures became iconic—saturated with political meanings as well as personal memories. Ink History explores the relationship between personal and collective memory within the context of China’s historical trajectory. The work is accompanied by a soundtrack of well known propaganda songs, historical speeches and the relentless ticking of a clock. Whether it represents a clock or a time bomb is for viewers to decide.  Exhibitions  Chen Shaoxing's work is currently on at the Solomon R.

It is owned and operated by the Colombian company, Zuliana De Esmeraldas Ltda.  History  La Pita mountain view La Pita is one of Colombia's largest emerald mines in Colombia, tantamount to its competitor, previously called Puerto Artuto, at present known as the Muzo Mine. La Pita has been one of the biggest contributors to Colombia's emerald production at times producing more than 80% of the total output of emeralds in Colombia. La Pita was discovered when an access road was being built, the workers and owners of the land descended towards Río Minero and noticed a yellowish patch of earth accompanied by the black carbonate altered shales of the Muzo Formation. This area is known as Amariallal and marked the establishment of La Pita Mine. The entrance of the mine was first opened in a ravine at the bottom of the mountain near Río Minero and extends approximatelt until the tunnel makes contact with the principle fault line running through the length of the La Pita property. La Pita is north of neighboring mine Cunas. Previously, a dispute between the two mines existed and both groups founded a mining agreement, that is defunct today. The agreement proposed that mining north and south of the border between the mining districts was allowed by both parties. Today, the building structures and campsite are located on the property of Cunas. Recently, La Pita had entered into an agreement with a publicly traded company, FURA Emeralds Inc. This has since been terminated. Following that, a Canadian company entered into a non-binding agreement and was unable to successfully close on the contract. In 2016, a third company was entering into agreements for full operation at La Pita Mine and to acquire a stake in Zuliana De Esmeraldas Ltda.  Geology  La Pita mine is mining emeralds from the Muzo Formation, operations are currently focused wholly in the footwall of the Río Minero Fault. The property lies on a productive portion of the fault, with ~1 km of the NNE, moderate to steeply dipping fault (~025/75(?)) running along the long-axis of the property. The Rio Minero fault is characterized by an ~80m wide, very irregular, but sharp contact breccia zone. This breccia is a carbonate altered, with minor content kaolinite altered clasts, localized fluorite matrix, polymicitic carbonate altered shale and carbonate vein clasts, laminated to massive euhedral to anhedral carbonate matrix, chaotic order, clast-supported to matrix-support, fine to very coarse unsorted sharp clast contacts, sub-angular to angular. At present the mine is focused only on the footwall of the fault, exploiting oblique fractures in the Muzo Formation shales of the western flank of the fault. There appears to be a periodicity to the occurrence of variable thickness () calcite veins (observed between 070/35 and 320/65 orientations), that are the primary target for emerald production. The intersections of vein sets are a fertile setting and may represent an upgrading feature. Where these secondary fractures intersect with the primary vein orientation, anecdotally it has been observed that there appears to be an improvement in both quality (colour and clarity) as well as, sometimes, quantity/size. These oblique vein sets (which may simply be conjugate fractures as a product of how the faulting influenced the host Muzo Formation (rheology during formation)) represent the primary source of emeralds in the current operations at La Pita. These vein sets are productive up to several meters away from the fault itself. = Muzo Formation = Muzo Formation (K1m - Hauterivian-Barremian age), outcropping in the sector of Las Pavas, Peñas Blancas, Coscuez, also appears in Vélez, Chiquinquirá and La Palma. It is part of the flanks of La Chapa-Borbur Anticlinal, also observed in the syncline of Otanche, in the sector of Coscuez. In the region of Muzo and Calcetero, the formation is also part of the syncline of El Almendro and forms the nucleus of the Pauna Anticlinal. This unit houses most of the emerald-producing mines in the region such as Coscuez. The Muzo Formation is a generally calcareous sequence, while to the north of the Ibacapí Fault it is observed to be weathered and its calcareous composition is not recognized. To the north of Pauna the formation has a siliceous character. In general it is composed of dark gray calcareous claystones with lenses and limestone concretions. Additionally, it is common to find pyrite and calcite veins. These claystones are interspersed with sandy siltstones and quartz sandstones. Towards the middle of the segment arise shales and albitized limestone, somewhat calcareous. At this level appear a brecciated and mineralized zone with veins of calcite and sheets of oxidized sulphides. The upper part of the segment is interspersed with layers of gray claystones with layers of siltstones containing fauna depicted in ammonite molds. At the bottom of this unit is the La Marina Mine and to the south the emerald mines of La Pita, Consorcio, Totumos, Polveros and others. The first calcareous package becomes thicker towards the south, it has a thickness of , and in the sector of Totumos and Polveros reaches , and is composed of intercalations of limestone (micrite), loam and sandy siltstones. The zone of hydrothermal breccias that is immediately above the calcareous rocks, in the La Pita Mine has a thickness of approximately , and at the Totumos Mine can reach to . This unit in the area of Coscuez and Muzo presents emeralds; its characteristic remains limestone in layers of calcareous siltstones interspersed with calcareous claystones. To the south of the area, this unit presents similar characteristics. A stratigraphic column along the La Palma-Yacopí road, shows that this unit is composed of a black marl with a solid appearance with black calcareous claystone intercalations.Acosta and Ulloa, 2001 In the upper part, intercalations of black shale with gypsum flakes and abundant pyritic micritical concretions appear, some with ammonites.Reyes et al., 2006Ortega Medina, 2007, p.22  Mining licence  The La Pita concession agreement is active and registered with the National Mining Agency of Colombia. The title holders of Las Pita have a 30-year exploration/exploitation license, this title granted the exclusive right to extract the corresponding minerals and to conduct the necessary efforts to explore, exploit, process, transport and ship the relevant minerals.  Mine safety and security  Site security currently has several weak points, from the working face to processing of potential ore. The mine is not currently managed with consideration for who is in the mine when it is open and material is not properly processed before being dumped and accessed by the general public. Improvement in security would be relatively simple both from a capital expenditure and implementation perspective. There are 4 points of access, which can be controlled by guards, cameras and doors/walls. The ore would need to be handled differently than it currently is, as there is a substantial amount of material being moved out of the mine and into public area, with only the identified mineralization isolated, but emeralds being present in the other material after. Although effort is made to capture emeralds coming off the face, it has been demonstrated that there are emeralds winding up in the tailings with regularity, of variable quality. The two primary security issues are, access to the mine site when the workings are open and ore processing. Porto Gringo access to the north may represent the greatest weakness to securing the site right now, because of the agreement to allow access to the neighbouring operation. The mining region, despite its poor reputation is actually safe and community orientated, the violence is now a faint memory of the past. Security in the mine is a collaboration between private security, National Police of Colombia and the National Armed Forces of Colombia. This presence provides for a very secure work place and community support, where the police and military often participate in community social projects ranging from building homes, aqueducts and road maintenance.

Her scholarly writing in queer theory, critical race theory, and performance studies highlights the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and embodiment in constructing subjectivity.  Biography  Born Juana María de la Caridad Rodríguez y Hernández in Placetas, Cuba, Rodríguez emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her family.Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces. New York: NYU Press, 2003, p. 126. She has two siblings: her sister Dinorah de Jesús Rodríguez,an experimental filmmaker and visual artist who works between Havana and Miami, and her brother René. Rodríguez identifies as queer and bisexual, and has published work about what she terms \\"bisexual erasure.\\"Rodríguez, Juana María. \\"Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics.\\" Lambda Nordica 1-2 (2016): 169–182. = Education and career = Describing herself as an \\"accidental academic\\" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended City College of San Francisco before graduating with a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University, and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley where she studied with Norma Alarcón, Judith Butler, VèVè A. Clark, and Gerald Vizenor. Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at Bryn Mawr College, and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of California, Davis where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group. At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society, where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster. In 2014, she was appointed to the University of California President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by Janet Napolitano.  Academic contributions  The author of two books, Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces (NYU Press, 2003) and Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies; Women & Performance: a journal of feminist theory; Radical History Review; PMLA; MELUS; Profession and others. Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into queer theory that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference. = Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces = Rodríguez's first book, Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces (NYU Press, 2003) introduced the idea of queer latinidad as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity. In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida; law through the asylum case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Afro-Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.  Queering Spanish language  In her chapter on the IRC, \\"'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut\\" in Queer Latinidad, Rodríguez documents the use of the \\"@\\" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a \\"creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish.\\" She writes, \\"Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or \\"at sign,\\" literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender.\\" She has also discussed the use of the \\"x\\" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. \\"Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language.\\" Latino USA. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016. = Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings = Rodriguez's second book Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, sodomy laws in Puerto Rico, Latin dance styles, commercials, pornography, burlesque, queer pride marches, alongside sexual practices such as BDSM, polyamory, daddy-play, and butch- femme role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the politics of respectability that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.Grossman, Sara. \\"Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse  Haas Institute.\\" Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016. Throughout the book, she uses the idea of gesture to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist Xandra Ibarra, and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.  Sexual practices  Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.Dorrance, Jess. \\"Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings.\\" Women & Performance: a journal of feminist theory 0.0 (2016): 1–3.

She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms \\"sexual archives\\" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.Dahl, Ulrika. \\"The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access.\\" Lambda Nordica 1-2 (2016): 191–196.

The principal educational sponsor is Highgate School, a leading independent school in North London. Eight other leading independent schools in London and the South East will act as partner schools and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is the business sponsor.  Background  The sixth form free school offers the fifteen A-Level subjects most valued by prestigious universities and employers. It is based on the successful model of the London Academy of Excellence in the London borough of Newham, which was voted the \\"Best State Sixth Form in the Country\\" in 2015 and saw half of all A-level grades at A/A* in their 2016 A-level results. The sixth form was named by Tatler in its list of the \\"Best Secondary Schools 2017\\", praising its \\"super\\" academic facilities and \\"eagle-eyed\\" tutoring system. As of January 2017, 20 students held offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge. The sixth form has substantial links with the local community, with all students volunteering in partnership teaching activities involving local schools based at the sixth form. 50% of offers are guaranteed to be made to students studying in five schools in the east of Haringey: Duke's Academy, Gladesmore Community School, Heartlands High School, Park View School and Woodside High School. In December 2016, it was recommended by the Haringey STEM commission that the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham should be a centre for STEM teaching excellence, acting as a hub \\"for improvement, support and professional development\\" throughout the borough.  Educational sponsor  The principal educational sponsor is Highgate School, a leading independent school in North London. As part of its charitable activity, the school has funded the Chrysalis Partnership, a scheme supporting 26 state schools in six London boroughs, a number of which acts as feeder schools for the new sixth form. Highgate School has been, since 2010, a founding partner of the London Academy of Excellence in Stratford. As the principal educational sponsor, Highgate School recruited and deployed the full-time equivalent of five members of the total teaching staff, as well as assisting with wider administrative, pastoral and management support. Eight other leading independent schools – Alleyn's School, Chigwell School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Harrow School, John Lyon School, Mill Hill School, North London Collegiate School, and St Dunstan's College – share their expertise and teaching staff.  Business sponsor  The business sponsor is Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, providing financial support as well as the school premises and facilities management. The sixth form is situated in Lilywhite House, owned and operated by the football club. The opening of a state-of-the-art school complements the ongoing Northumberland Development Project to build a football stadium which will replace White Hart Lane.

She was first elected to parliament in the , three years after Goff. Background Following the Labour government's defeat in the 2008 general election, Prime Minister Helen Clark resigned after 15 years as party leader, including three terms as prime minister, prompting the leadership election. Candidates There was only one candidate, Phil Goff. =Phil Goff= Phil Goff had been an MP since 1981 except for three years after losing his seat in 1990. He had served in Clark's government concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice and later as Minister of Defence. He had previously served in various capacities in David Lange's cabinet in the 1980s. Goff and Clark did not always see eye to eye and in 1996 he attempted an abortive coup to oust Clark. Outcome and aftermath Goff had been widely tipped as Clark's successor and faced no other candidates and was acclaimed with unanimous support on 11 November 2008. Annette King was elected as deputy leader, and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick were elected as the senior and junior whips, respectively. Both Goff and King were also perceived by many as merely caretaker leaders until newer, younger figures could emerge. After initially performing well in the opinion polls, Goff's Labour Party dropped in support in contrast to the popular National government led by John Key, hitting a 10 year low of 27% support in July 2011 after controversy over Labour's proposal for a capital gains tax hurt the party's support. While party support recovered somewhat, Goff still led Labour to defeat in the 26 November 2011 general election with a loss of 8 seats and 6.5% of the popular vote compared to 2008.

Westmeath. Career Ray was born in Moate, County Westmeath to Patrick, a baker, and Nora, a shopkeeper. He was one of three sons, his brothers being Padraic and John. His first venture into the music scene was when he played saxophone for a local group \\"the Merrymen\\" while still attending the local Carmelite College Secondary School. By 1969 he had joined and was lead singer for the group Ray Lynam and the Hillbillies and had their first Irish Charts success with a cover of the Buck Owens song \\"Sweet Rosie Jones\\". During the Wembley Country Music Festival of 1974, he teamed up with one of Irelands leading female country singers, Philomena Begley and went on to record many hit duets with her, including My Elusive Dreams in 1975. Style Lynams singing voice is closely modeled on those American country singers that influenced his early career, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard, rather than the more popular (in Ireland at that time) Country and Irish style. He has had hits on the Irish charts during the 1970s and 1980s with cover versions of some of their well-known tracks including He Stopped Loving Her Today and If We're Not Back in Love by Monday.

Corruption accusations and counter-accusations between Dr. Alfred Mutua and Bernard Kiala have since 2014 created a frosty relationship between them. The two are Leader and Deputy leader of the Machakos County Executive respectively. Bernard Kiala survived an impeachment process against him in 2014. Initially, the Machakos County Assembly voted to impeach him for allegations of insubordination to Governor Alfred Mutua, nepotism and abuse of office. The impeachment was however overturned by the Kenyan Senate. In his evidence against the impeachment motion at the senate, Bernard Kiala stated that he was only being a victim of revenge by corruption cartels in the County Government =2017 Gubernatorial Contest= Bernard Kiala was among Deputy Governors in Kenyan counties who have declared intentions to compete with their county's Governors in the upcoming 2017 general election in the country.

The exhibition centre, large about 400 square metres, is on the first floor; at the entrance there are an information desk, a meeting room (the old chapel of Jesuits) and a bookshop.  History  Arcade of the Ex Collegio dei Gesuiti The museum was created in 2014 thanks to the municipal administration led by the Lord Mayor of that period, Dr. Sebastiano Bonventre M.D. In the following October they realized the ambitious project Creative Lab, an integrated system of cultural services aiming at the requalification of the urban space and supporting the development of the territory; the municipality of Alcamo, the University of Palermo and the cooperatives Agrigest and Nido d’Argento. On 28 February 2015, there was the exhibition entitled Art on loan, whose protagonists were Cielo d'Alcamo, Giacomo Serpotta and embroidery; the exposition, attended by the artistic director Enzo Fiammetta, has filled the new museum with works from important museums, such as the Foundation Orestiadi di Gibellina, and from other Italian regions. On 30 May 2015, the new museum presented the exhibition Ottocelle (that is Eight Cells): the title took inspiration from the same configuration of the rooms which were the cells of the ex convent of Jesuits. There were the works of four Italian artists (Elisa Nicolaci, Francesco De Grandi, Sergio Zavattieri and Luisa Mazza), the winners of the competition launched by the municipality of Alcamo, whose aim was the promotion of its territory through the production of works site specific that today belong to the patrimony of the museum. In October 2016 they created a new arrangement of the museum that has also taken part in the XII Edition of the Contemporary's Day called by AMACI (Association of the Museums of Italian Contemporary Art).

It was held at Lillebonne, in the northeast of Normandy. Wace, the 12th-century historian, wrote of the council, convened shortly before the actual invasion, likely in January 1066. William of Poitiers, a chronicler of the Norman invasion, claims that the duke also obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The council, also called the Norman Council and Assembly of Lillebonne, began with the refusal of Harold to relinquish the crown of England. Two such councils were held, a smaller council of trusted advisors and a larger council to discuss the planned conquest. Relatives and allies of William participated including many of the proven Companions of William: * Robert, Count of Mortain, half-brother of William * William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford, cousin of William and a proven companion, a strong advocate of the invasion who convinced the doubters that the mission was feasible * Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, William’s half-brother * Odo, Count of Champagne, William’s brother-in-law * Richard, Count of Évreux, father of William, Count of Évreux, a proven companion * Hugh of Eu, Bishop of Lisieux, brother of the traitor Busac * Roger de Beaumont, who murdered William’s tormentor Roger I of Tosny, who advised William but did not participate in the invasion due to his advanced years * Raoul IV de Conches, grandson of Roger of Tosny * Hugh de Grandmesnil, a proven companion of William’s, originally banished but reinstated * Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, who had previously cursed William * Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville, a known companion of William’s * Hugh de Montfort, Lord of Montfort-sur-Risle, a known companion of William’s * William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. Cajoled by William FitzOsbern, the council approved the invasion plans. William of Poitiers nevertheless describes the council and gives an account of a debate that took place between among the nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some formal meeting probably was held, it is unlikely that there was significant debate, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and those assembled would want to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England.

It lasted between June and December 1651, pitting the Catholic Palatinate-Neuburg against the Protestant Margraviate of Brandenburg. It ended in peaceful settlement, confirming the distribution of church property on the basis of the year 1651. Background The rapid spread of the Lutheran and Calvinist doctrines following the Protestant Reformation was followed by a period of Catholic resurgence known as the Counter-Reformation. Interdenominational conflicts such as the Cologne War and Strasbourg Bishops' War prompted the creation of the Catholic League and the Protestant Union, with the intention of safeguarding the interests of the Holy Roman Empire's Catholic and Protestant nobility respectively. These alliances entered their first conflict in 1609, when a succession crisis in the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg sparked the War of the Jülich Succession. The territories in question covered an area of , having both geopolitical importance due to their proximity to the Spanish Road and a booming economy, fueled by refugees from the lands ravaged by the Eighty Years' War. The mentally ill duke Johann Wilhelm died on 25 March 1609, leaving no children, and the Emperor Rudolf II had claims to the duchies stemming from intermarriage but was unable to openly declare his intentions without compromising his perceived neutrality. Six other claimants appeared, with the rulers of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg having the only credible claims through their marriages to Johann Wilhelm's aunts. On 2 April, a regency was established, including the duke's widow Antoinette of Lorraine, the privy councilors and an imperial commissioner. On 24 May, Rudolf II announced that the Aulic Council was to provide a definite verdict within four weeks. Brandenburg and Neuburg viewed this as a direct attempt at annexing the duchy. On 10 June 1609, they signed the , rejecting all other claimants and establishing a provisional government together with the local estates. Their troops entered the duchy in defiance of the regency and the Emperor. In January 1610, Henry IV of France signed a draft military pact with the Protestant Union, dispatching 22,000 men under to north–east France. A comparable number of troops were dispatched by the Dutch towards Schenkenschanz, in an apparent show of force towards Spain. Archduke Leopold V sought to raise his profile in the power struggle between the Emperor and Archduke Matthias by convincing the former to annul the Treaty of Dortmund and appoint him as the imperial commissioner. Leopold triumphantly entered Jülich but soon found himself besieged by an army three times his size, as fighting spread to Aachen and Düren. The struggle between the Catholic royal family and the Protestant princes brought fears of a larger religious war. The Protestant Union mobilized 5,000 men, while Leopold recruited 1,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry in the Prince-Bishopric of Strasbourg. His Habsburg relatives and the rest of the Catholic League refused to openly support Leopold, only gathering troops for their own protection. On 13 March 1610, the Protestant count Otto von Solms–Braunfels invaded Strasbourg with 2,000 troops. The Catholics simply retreated into walled towns such as Saverne, waiting until the ill-disciplined invaders ran out of money and retreated. A meeting was set in Prague on 1 May 1610, to broker a settlement. Rudolf's initial decision to enfeoff the entire duchy to Christian II, Elector of Saxony was rejected by a number of moderate princes, leading to the postponement of negotiations until August. A second Protestant invasion, this time consisting of 9,800 troops and artillery, succeeded in seizing Dachstein, Mutzig and Molsheim but was also brought to a halt after the local population refused to supply the troops with food. In the meantime Leopold fled Jülich, leaving 1,500 troops inside. Their fate was sealed as the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic finally intervened in support of the Protestants, aiming to antagonize Spain by putting further pressure on the Spanish Road. The Dutch intercepted a relief party heading from the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, while also bolstering the besiegers into a combined total of 25,200 troops. On 1 September, the garrison surrendered in return for free passage into upper Alsace. On 24 October, the Protestant Union and the Catholic League agreed to withdraw their forces and disband them until the end of the year. The war severely depleted the coffers of all the involved parties, leading to increased taxes which in their turn triggered the 1612 Tyrol Peasant Revolt. Occupiers Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Joachim Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach took over the duchy by military might, without being able to secure official recognition. In 1611, Protestantism spread to the villages of Stolberg and Weiden in the vicinity of Aachen. The city council of Aachen imposed a fine on those inhabitants who attended these services. Five citizens were detained for ignoring the town's decree and banished as they refused to pay the fine. This caused a riot against the council on 5 July. The Catholic councillors were expelled and many Catholic buildings were sacked. The rebels assaulted the church and the college of the Jesuits, smashed the altars and images and held a mock mass dressed in priestly garments. A new Protestant council was established and appealed for support to the occupying forces. In 1612, Rudolf ordered the Count Palatine and the Margrave to reinstate Catholicism in the city of Aachen under the menace of a ban. The Protestants ignored the command and seriously wounded an Imperial commissioner sent to implement the Emperor's edict. Upon Rudolf's death, Emperor Matthias confirmed Saxony's rights to the fief, rekindling the dispute and the conversions of the Count Palatine and the Margrave to Calvinism and Catholicism respectively completely restructured their past alliances. Brandenburg and Neuburg officials ceased communicating with each other by the beginning of 1614. In May 1614, 300 Dutch troops ejected the Neuburg garrison from Jülich, in an attempt by the Dutch statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt to prevent a Brandenburg plot against the former. Wolfgang Wilhelm interpreted it as a declaration of war, raising 900 troops and taking Düsseldorf. The new Brandenburg incumbent, George William, was indeed plotting a coup, but his financial dependence on the Dutch prevented him from fulfilling his plans. Another misunderstanding took place when Spain and Albert VII, Archduke of Austria interpreted the Dutch military buildup as a violation of the Twelve Years' Truce, mobilizing 13,300 infantry and 1,300 cavalry under Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola. On 20 February 1614, Emperor Matthias ordered the restoration of Catholic rule in Aachen. Fearing an attack, the town council requested the aid of the Elector of Brandenburg, who sent several hundred soldiers under General Georg von Pulitz to reinforce the local militia. On 24 August, Spinola besieged Aachen on the premise of imposing a two year old imperial edict issued by Rudolf. After several days of negotiations, the garrison was allowed to leave together with Protestant clerics and non-citizens. The old city council was reinstated while participants in the 1611 riots were punished. From Aachen Spinola pressed on towards Düren, Neuss, Wesel and Mülheim, which he captured with Wolfgang Wilhelm's help. The Dutch occupied the duchy of Mark and the rest of Cleves, while also reinforcing Jülich. On 13 October, Spinola and Maurice of Nassau initiated peace negotiations under French and English mediation known as the Treaty of Xanten. The territories of Jülich-Berg and Ravenstein went to Wolfgang Wilhelm of Neuburg, while Cleves-Mark and Ravensberg went to George William. Spain gained a total of 62 towns including three Rhine crossings, namely Wesel, Orsoy and Rheinberg, significantly enhancing its position in north-west Europe. The Dutch retained their garrisons at Jülich and Pfaffenmütze but were outflanked or isolated, putting them in an unfavourable position when the Twelve Years' Truce expired in April 1621. The defeat of the Protestant Union forces during the Palatinate campaign of the Thirty Years' War coincided with the end of the Twelve Years' Truce. Spain seized the opportunity to strengthen its hold on the Rhineland region by dispatching a 10,000 man army under Hendrik van den Bergh towards Jülich besieging it in September 1621. The Dutch responded by launching raids on Wolfgang Wilhelm's possessions in an attempt to prevent him from supplying straw and oats to the Spanish. Wolfgang Wilhelm raised a force numbering 2,500 troops, which assisted the Spanish in taking Jülich and Pfaffenmütze in July 1622 and January 1623 respectively. Fearing that Brandenburg would be Bergh's next target, George William secretly transferred 1,300 men into Dutch service. In May 1624, George William conceded Ravenstein to Wolfgang Wilhelm, in return for the recognition of their mutual possessions. The Spanish pushed the Dutch and Brandenburgers from Jülich, most of Mark and Ravensberg, isolating the Netherlands from potential German Protestant allies. However by 1646, the tide of the Thirty Years' War had turned in favour of the Protestants. George William's son Frederick William was persuaded by his confidant Johann von Norprath (a Neuberg defector) to move his court from Berlin to Cleves, while also increasing the local garrisons to 4,100 men. In November 1646, Frederick William invaded Berg, but the invaders soon ran out of food and returned home, achieving only the return of Ravensberg. Conflict The Peace of Westphalia finally settled the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Three years later, the Holy Roman Empire found itself on the brink of war when Wolfgang Wilhelm claimed that the normative year imposed by the treaty took precedence over the Treaty of Xanten in regard to church properties. Since more parishes were in Catholic hands in 1624 than a decade before, Wolfgang Wilhelm hoped to stabilize his control over Jülich and Berg. The Aulic Council was still reviewing the evidence when Frederick William declared himself a protector of the Protestant population living in the two duchies. In June 1651, 3,800 Brandenburg troops invaded Berg, killing two civilians, bombarding Wolfgang Wilhelm's palace and seizing a herd of cows belonging to his wife. After rallying at Kaßlerfeld, the Brandenburgers created an encampment at Angermund and unsuccessfully beleaguered Düsseldorf. The Neuburg envoy in Vienna described the incident as a \\"Cow War\\", comparing Brandenburg's ruler to a cattle rustler. By July, Brandenburg had reinforced its expedition by 2,700 troops, mobilizing 16,000 more across its various territories. Wolfgang Wilhelm employed the help of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who launched a counter invasion of Mark with the intention of obtaining provisions for his army. The estates of all five duchies refused to provide money to either side, while Duisburg's city council requested Dutch protection. The Dutch condemned the actions of their former ally, while Sweden persuaded both sides to disengage through their envoy Melchior von Hatzfeldt. By the end of the year, Neuburg and Brandenburg had disbanded their troops. The Aulic Council distributed the church property on the basis of the current year, ending the conflict. Further negotiations in 1666 and 1672 confirmed the 1651 arrangements, putting an end to the dispute.

The image is widely known due to claims of miraculous healing and flood safety. It further retained its standing posture despite the controversy of its original image in Onate, Spain being seated. Pope Francis granted the image a Canonical coronation on 31 May 2017.  History  The church where the current image is enshrined. The history of Christianity in San Mateo, Rizal dates back to the early Spanish era of 1596, when the Augustinians friars built the first settlements in the place. On 29 August 1596, the first parish was built under and in honor of the patron Saint Matthew. On 6 December 1696, the Jesuits came and gained control of the town. The history of the Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu (also known as Birhen ng Bayang San Mateo) in San Mateo, Rizal dates back to the early Spanish era of 1705. A Jesuit priest, Padre Juan de Echazabal, started the devotion to Our Lady of Aranzazu from Spain and changed the patron of the town from St. Matthew to Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu.https://sanmateo2016.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/church-of-nuestra- senora-de-aranzazu/ In 1716, a new church was constructed on the site of the current church and placed the church of San Mateo under the patronage of the Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu. The first image of the Virgin of Aranzazu was brought to the Philippines by a Spanish captain from the Basque region. In 1732, the Dominican Order of Letran in Intramuros made effort in spreading the devotion to the Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu among Filipinos during the Spanish era. The church was proclaimed as Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu on 16 July 2004. Description Mary, holding the Christ Child, is vested in imperial regalia, and holds an apple symbolising her role as the \\"New Eve\\" (La Nueva Eva). The image depicts the 1469 apparition, with the Virgin standing on a thorn bush with a small quadrilateral bell hanging from it. It includes the statue of Rodrigo de Balzategui in a kneeling position. The image is known for its controversial artistic posture. While the original image in the Sanctuary of Arantzazu in Oñate, Spain, is a seated Madonna, the image in San Mateo is depicted standing up.https://traveleronfoot.wordpress.com/tag/national-shrine-of-the-nuestra- senora-de-aranzazu/ A similar reconstructed once more in 1990, when its controversy was officially settled by the Diocese of Antipolo in 2012 by the decision of the Bishop-Emeritus Gabriel Reyes. The image retained its standing posture, as per local custom and wishes of its devotees.  Veneration  The image was granted an Episcopal Coronation on 9 November 2013 by the Bishop of Antipolo, Gabriel V. Reyes, while the coronation ceremony was officiated by Reverend Francisco M. De Leon, D.D. The image being crowned by Archbishop Orlando Cardinal Quevedo in behalf of Pope Francis The Canonical Coronation of the image was granted in response to the petition made by the community through the late parish priest (+) Rev. Fr. Lawrence C. Paz with documents prepared by the Cofradia de Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu. The decree was promulgated on 17 June 2016 by Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the sacraments, Cardinal Robert Sarah. The coronation was held on 31 May 2017. With Reverend Francisco M. De Leon, D.D as the mass celebrant, and Archbishop Orlando Cardinal Quevedo as the crowning prelate in behalf of Pope Francis  Devotion  The feast day of the Virgin is celebrated every September 9 with much solemnity and joy for the people will carry her image in procession while waving their white hanker chiefs singing her joyful hymn. Her feast day was once celebrated every Sunday or Sunday near Pentecost until it was discovered by then Parish Priest Reverend Father Marcelino Prudente that in Onate, Spain, they celebrate her feast day on September 9 and through his efforts, Bishop Protacio Gungon, then the Bishop of the Diocese of Antipolo, declared that the feast of the Virgin will be celebrated on September 9 in 1989. Today, every ninth and Second Saturday of the month is dedicated for the devotion to the Virgin of Aranzazu that is still practiced in the shrine up to the present. The devotion to Nuestra Senora de Aranzazu continues to inspire the people of San Mateo to strive for their faith. Miracles continued to be reported through her intercession up to the present and pilgrims from all over the country flocked to her shrine to seek her intercession.  Miracles  Thousand of devotees offer testimonials of miracles through the intercession of the Virgin of Aranzazu. One of the most popular is when during one typhoon season in the country, San Mateo was in danger of flooding that it was decided to bring out the image of the Virgin from her shrine and to be brought in every area in San Mateo. It is said that once the Virgin faced each household or area, the floods suddenly subsided. Another case was during the Typhoon Yolanda that would also threaten Rizal area and it was at that time the Episcopal Coronation of Nuestra Senora de Aranzazu will take place. Heavy rain downpour was looming in the area yet when the Virgin arrived for her Episcopal Coronation, the rain suddenly stopped and the coronation ceremony took place. Other miracles from her devotees were recorded by the shrine and can be seen in the prayer chapel of the Virgin from cures from different diseases like cancer, passing of qualifying examinations for different professions, financial aids, reconciliation of families, conversion of non believers among others that the people of San Mateo gave their loving devotion and affection to their beloved patroness over the centuries.

His life is only described in sources dating from the 16th century or later.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 1-12. According to these sources he was the first ruler of Ternate to use the title Sultan rather than Kolano, or king, and enacted a number of changes in the government, based on Islamic Law, technically transforming Ternate into an Islamic kingdom. Tidore Wonge and the Muslim Javanese princess By far the oldest account is provided in a Portuguese text from c. 1544, A treatise on the Moluccas. It says that Islam came to Maluku about 80-90 years previously, brought by Malay, Javanese and other merchants. Along with them arrived a Muslim Javanese woman of high birth who subsequently married the King of Ternate, Tidore Wonge. The king was then converted for her sake. A variant version provided by the same text says that Tidore Wonge, who had recently accepted Islam, travelled to Melaka and Java to learn about foreign lands and to be confirmed in his fate. On his return journey he married the Javanese princess whose influence paved the way for the new religion. After his death, Tidore Wongi was succeeded by his son Abu Lais (Bayan Sirrullah).Hubert Jacobs (1971) A treatise on the Moluccas (c. 1544). Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 83-5. Valentijn's and Rijali's versions According to the more elaborated version by François Valentijn (1724) the future Sultan was the son of Kolano Marhum, the eighteenth king of Ternate.Amal (2016), p. 238. Other chronicles say that his father was the seventeenth ruler Gapi Baguna II (Ngolo-ma-Caya) while his mother was a lady from the Sula Islands. Valentijn indicates that Marhum was the first recorded convert to Islam, and as such provided the young prince with an Islamic education.Amal (2002), p. 128. Under Marhum's rule, the first tenets of Islam were preached by a merchant-cum-cleric from Java named Dato Maulana Hussein who stunned the as-yet illiterate Ternatans with his reading skills.François Valentijn (1724) Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien, Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder de Linden, p. 140. Some traditions, including the oldest chronicle Hikayat Tanah Hitu by Rijali (before 1657), nevertheless hold that Zainal Abidin himself first converted to the new religion.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 6. Rijali relates that a prince and missionary from Samudra Pasai in Sumatra, Mahadum by name, travelled to Maluku via Melaka and Java, successfully converting the rulers of Jailolo, Tidore and Ternate in turn. Mahadum stayed in Ternate and died there, his son marrying Zainal Abidin's daughter.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 5. Valentijn gives Zainal Abidin's regnal years as 1486-1500, though it is unclear what this is based on.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 10. Islamization of Ternate Ternate was one of the four traditional kingdoms in North Maluku, the others being Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. Of these, Ternate emerged as the stronger component at an early date, though it was severely contested by the others. As soon as he was appointed ruler, according to Valentijn, Zainal Abidin had to deal with aggression from the powerful Jailolo kingdom that was based in Halmahera and allied with Tidore. Eventually the warring parts made peace in 1488, leaving the ruler free to bring Ternate on the track to ordered Islamic governance.Hanna & Alwi (1996); François Valentijn (1724), p. 141. Many Muslim Javanese traders frequented Ternate at the time and incited the king to learn more about the new creed. In c. 1495, he traveled with his companion Hussein to study Islam in Giri (Gresik) on Java's north coast, where Sunan Giri kept a well-known madrasa.Soejono (2008), p. 194; François Valentijn (1724), p. 143.. While there, he won renown as Sultan Bualawa, or Sultan of Cloves.Amal (2016), p. 64. He was well respected, known as a valiant warrior and pious scholar, and developed friendships which developed into strong alliances. One story told of his time there is that he stood up to a crazed killer on the rampage while others fled, beheading him with a single stroke.Amal (2016), p. 65. According to the Hikayat Tanah Hitu, Zainal Abidin stopped in Bima in Sumbawa on his way back to Maluku. He and his crew got into trouble with the local king and a fight took place where a Bimanese wounded Zainal Abidin with his spear. The bodyguards of the ruler brought him back to the ship, though he passed away on board. The account of François Valentijn, on the contrary, insists that he survived the battle and made it back to Ternate.Hans Hägerdal (2017), Held's history of Sumbawa. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University press, p. 34. On his return, he replaced the royal title Kolano with Sultan, and it may have been now that he adopted the Islamic name Zainal Abidin.Putuhena (2007), p. 101. He brought back a mubaligh from Java named Tuhubahanui to propagate the Islamic faith and created a Bobato (headman) to assist in all matters relating to the rule of Islamic law across the Sultanate.Office of Islamic Information Service (1980), p. 28. The background to this transformation is the inter-regional network that developed during the 15th century with the lucrative trade in cloves and exotic forest products. This trade attracted Indian, Javanese and Malay traders who were often Muslims. European accounts date the introduction of Islam to about the 1460s or 1460s.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 32. Far into the 16th century, however, European observers noted that Islam was mostly confined to the highest elite. The great dissemination of Islam in Maluku came later, after 1570.Leonard Andaya (1993) The world of Maluku. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 57, 134. Expansion of political influence Zainal Abidin's reign coincided with the rise of the noble houses of Tomaitu and Tomagola who were instrumental in spreading the political influence of Ternate. Members of the Tomaitu went to the Sula Islands where they acted as sub-rulers with the title Kimelaha. The Tomagola, on their part, settled in Buru Island and later established their authority in the Ambon Quarter, settling at the inner coast of Ceram.François Valentijn (1724), p. 142. These migrations had a long lasting impact. The friendship pact that the Sultan concluded with Pati Puti (or Pati Tuban), one of the petty rulers from Ambon, also contributed to the claims made by Ternate to the southern parts of Maluku: Buru, Seram, Ambon, the Lease and Banda Islands.Abdurachman (2008), p. 188. A 19th-century chronicle claims that Zainal Abidin, at the time when he returned from Java, subdued half of Sulawesi.Naïdah (1878) \\"Geschiednis van Ternate\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 4:II, p. 443. These areas are, however only documented as Ternatan vassals in the second half of the 16th century.P.A. Tiele (1877-1887) \\"De Europëers in den Maleischen Archipel\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 25-35, Part V:1, p. 161-2. Family Zainal Abidin had two wives and six children, including the sons Kaicil Leliatu, Kuliba, and Vaidua, and the daughter Jamanula who married Syaku, son of the preacher Mahadum.Christiaan van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 5, 15.

Origins A proposal to construct a stadium in Luton in 1927 on a seven acre site on Beechwood Road in nearby Leagrave had failed to get planning permission after drawing objections from several fronts but mainly the clergy. One year later a second attempt was made with the suggested site being open land on Icknield Road. The proposal by the Luton and Dunstable Greyhound Racing Club was refused planning permission on appeal by the District Council in April 1928. The Luton and Dunstable Greyhound Racing Club finally gained permission and constructed a stadium in 1931 on the south side of the Dunstable Road and east side of Skimpot Road in Skimpot, Luton. Opening The stadium offered a simple covered grandstand on the home straight with very few other facilities when racing got underway in 1931. Speedway A 311 yard speedway track inside the dog track hosted the Luton Hatters from 1934 but due to financial problems only lasted three years. History After the war in 1946 the totalisator turnover was £308,810 and the stadium was run by Luton Stadium Ltd in 1953. The racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). By the mid-1960s racing was held on Tuesday and Saturday nights with trial days every other Thursday afternoon. The track had a circumference of 405 yards and race distances of 410, 470 and 675 yards with an 'Inside Sumner' hare. Fourteen bookmakers were in attendance and the principal races were the Bedfordshire Derby and the Bedfordshire St Leger. Closure Racing continued until November 1973 when the stadium was closed. The exact circumstances of closure were confusing because the track had been purchased by the Totalisators and Greyhound Holdings (T.G.H) who owned some prominent tracks including Crayford & Bexleyheath, Leeds, Brough Park, Gosforth, Willenhall and Monmore and around the same time a deal was on the table for a Ladbrokes takeover of TGH. When the Ladbrokes takeover was complete the track did not figure in the company plans and it was sold and demolished for industrial units. They then built a new car park for their Caesars Palace Casino on part of the site which today is the site of a Mecca Bingo, casino and fitness centre and the car parks for all three.

It tells the story of French convict Henri Charrière (Charlie Hunnam), nicknamed Papillon (\\"butterfly\\"), who was imprisoned in 1933 in the notorious Devil's Island penal colony and escaped in 1941 with the help of another convict, counterfeiter Louis Dega (Rami Malek). The film's screenplay is based on Charrière's autobiographies Papillon and Banco, as well as the former's 1973 film adaptation, which was written by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. and starred Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Papillon premiered on September 9, 2017, in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Henri \\"Papillon\\" Charrière, a safecracker from the Parisian underworld, is framed for murder. Though he has an alibi from his lover, Nenette, Papillon is convicted and condemned to the notorious penal colony in French Guiana — a hellish prison from which nobody has escaped. On the ship to South America, Papillon meets a quirky counterfeiter named Louis Dega. That evening Dega is awakened as two convicts murder a prisoner sleeping next to him in order to cut open his stomach and steal the money he had swallowed. Papillon forms an unlikely alliance with Dega, who is targeted by the other prisoners who suspect him of also hiding money. Papillon saves Dega's life and is punished for fighting by the guards. In exchange for Papillon's protection, Dega agrees to finance Papillon's escape, ultimately resulting in a bond of lasting friendship. While Papillon and Dega are ordered to carry away a guillotined body, a guard starts to whip Dega. Papillon strikes the guard with a rock and runs into the jungle for his first escape. He is given two years of silent solitary confinement. After the warden learns he has been receiving extra food, his rations are cut in half until he gives up the name of his supplier. Papillon did not betray Dega. The second escape plan is made from the prison infirmary. Papillon is feigning insanity from his confinement. Dega is an aide to the warden and still has money to fund the escape. Celier has a connection to get a boat. The sexually abused Maturette is the fourth to join the dangerous venture. Dega drugs the guards using pills meant to sedate a supposedly insane Papillon and the three others escape over the walls, with Dega injuring his leg in the process, to the jungle and to a boat Dega paid for. As a storm approaches, it is clear they will not all survive in the small leaky boat. Celier wants to kill the injured Dega but in the battle it is Celier who dies. Next the three survivors find themselves being cared for in a Colombian convent. Their apparent freedom is short lived because the Mother Superior turns them in. Maturette is killed and Papillon gets five years in solitary confinement. Papillon is released as a weathered older man on Devil's Island with high cliffs. He finds Dega who has adjusted to prison life and has no interest in escape. A fall from the cliffs is certain death. Papillon bags coconuts together for a raft and in a swell of waves he survives the fall. The third escape is a success and he is a free man. He writes a memoir. The movie postscript reads: \\"Over 80,000 prisoners were condemned to the penal colony in French Guiana, most of whom never returned to France. Henri Charriere's autobiography 'Papillon' became the number one bestseller for 21 weeks in France. To date, it has sold over 13 million copies in 30 languages. In 1970, the French Minister of Justice signed a decree allowing Charriere to return to France. For the remainder of his life, he lived a free man. The penal colony in French Guiana did not survive him\\".

The simple, stylized composition depicts a patterned flowing river with a white plum tree on the left and a red one on the right. The plum blossoms indicate the scene occurs in spring. The work is one of the best-known paintings in Japan, where it is a registered National Treasure. It resides in the MOA Museum of Art in the city of Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture. Description Kōrin depicts stylized prunus mume trees. The simple, stylized composition of Red and White Plum Blossoms depicts a patterned flowing river with a white plum tree on the left and a red plum tree on the right. The plum blossoms indicate the scene occurs in spring. The work is undated, but believed to be from Ogata's later period, and probably one of his final works. Based on evidence such as the signature, technique, and composition, art historian dates the work to 1714 or 1715, just before the artist's death. The seal Hōshuku appears on both screens, but each has a different signature: Hokkyō Kōrin on the left and Sei Sei Kōrin on the right, the latter a signature he began to use after he left Edo, which he visited between 1704 and 1709. It is in coloured pigments on paper placed on a pair of two-panel byōbu folding screens. Each screen measures . Kōrin achieved the mottling texture on the trees using tarashikomi, a technique in which the painter applies a second layer of pigment or ink before the first layer has dried. The work is considered exemplary of the Rinpa school that Kōrin cofounded. Square lattice patterns throughout the composition have led to the assumption the painting was made with a lower layer of silver and gold leaf. The lower layers of the painting have a gold colour that was assumed to have been achieved with gold leaf. XRF analysis has shown only organic pigments mixed with a small amount of gold. The black in the painting has been assumed to be either silver leaf that has blackened from exposure to sulphur, or blue pigment that has blackened as the azurite in the pigment has come off. Again, XRF imaging has found only organic dyes. Analysis of the trees has been inconclusive, but found that they were painted with pigments likely made with the minerals cinnabar and calcite, as well as organic pigments elsewhere, such as in the buds. KORIN-Plum-trees-L.jpg KORIN-Plum-trees-R.jpg Provenance No documentation exists from before the 20th century on the commission or provenance of the screens. They receive mention in no Edo-period publications on Kōrin's works and were not copied by his followers, which suggests they were not well known. A journal article in 1907 is the first known publication about them, and their first public display came in a 200th-anniversary exhibition of Kōrin's work in 1915. The MOA Museum of Art in the city of Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture displays the work each winter when plum blossoms are in bloom. Mokichi Okada began negotiations to purchase the screens in 1953 with the descendants of the daimyōs of the Tsugaru clan, who may have been the original owners; the transfer was concluded in 1954. The screens reside at the MOA Museum of Art in the city of Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture, along with the rest of Okada's collection. The museum displays the screens a month per year in late winter, the season when the plum blossoms bloom. Nearby is a garden reproduction of the screens' subject: two hillocks dotted with 360 plum trees, the number of plum trees said to surround the shrine of Lin Bu, a Chinese poet renowned for writing about plum blossoms. The display attracts large crowds. Legacy The screens are considered one of Kōrin's greatest works and are amongst the best known works of Japanese art. The NHK historical drama used a computer animated version of Red and White Plum Blossoms during its opening credits.

Its construction, completed in 1915, was a project undertaken by local real estate developer Meir Wolf. It was built as a two-story building a block away from the passenger and freight depots of the Chicago and North Western Railroad and the Chicago Great Western Railway. The building was meant to be used as a railroad hotel so passengers and rail employees would not have to travel the six to eight blocks to the hotels downtown. It is the only remaining railroad hotel left in Mason City. with Hotel guests stayed in the 29 rooms on the second floor, and three commercial spaces on the first floor were occupied by a variety of restaurants, grocery stores and barbershops. Its most famous guest was track star Jesse Owens, who was in town in December 1937 for a basketball exhibition. He could not stay at the other hotel's in town because of his race. In 1975 the hotel's name was changed to the Dodge House and the Long Branch Saloon occupied the space that had previously housed a cafe. By that time it was largely used as a rooming house, and it was used to house the homeless. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. An arsonist set fire to the building on September 6, 2006 and did significant damage to the structure. It had been vacant for five years at that time.

In November 2016, McDermott gave a TEDx talk entitled 'The Genetics of Politics'.  Research  In her latest publication \\"Man is by nature a political animal: Evolution, Biology and Politics\\", she has focused on differentiating between conservatism and liberalism, rather than between democrats and republicans, and investigates how respectively conservatives and liberals experience the world differently. Before beginning the research it is recognized that your ideology is the result of processes of socialization and due to your environment, however this doesn't tell the whole story. The relative genetic importance is common in between cultures, however the relative influence from family and environment varies a lot depending on the society and the time. A part of this research was carried out by having test persons look at different photos, and by eye tracking techniques, tracking whay their eyes focused on. This could be related to their political ideology. An example would be that liberals tend to look at emotions - eyes, faces - compassion for a specific person or situation. Whereas conservatives would focus on authorities, a threat etc. The conclusion of this would be, that even though looking at the same photo, the persons would have different experiences of the same situation. This is interesting and relevant in regards to politics, because it's then possible to track the reaccion and therefore the difference in ideology, but also how different people experience different actions by governments, political actions etc. Furthermore, it shows that ideology has a greater personal impact, than just politics, but also actually defines certain characteristics and personal values. Other researches carried out was by using human smell - having different test persons smell other people, and whether the ideology actually also had an impact here. They could conclude that liberals prefer the smell of liberals and conservatives prefer the smell of other conservatives, even though not knowing the ideology of the person they smelled. An overall conclusion was that biology has a greater impact on politics than maybe expected. That politics not only has to do with the mindset or ideas about societal structures, but rather encarved values, that define how you experience the world.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THILuP582iw Education *1991, Ph.D. Stanford University, Political Science *1990, M.

Siming is both an abstract deity (or title thereof) and a celestial asterism. Siming, as Director of Destinies, has the bureaucratic function of human lifespan allocation. Siming seems to have roots in the shamanic traditions, then later to have somewhat assimilated with the Kitchen God, as in the Daoist case of the Three Worms, in which Siming becomes a deity to whom home household activities are periodically reported, As an asterism, or apparent stellar constellation, Siming is associated with the Wenchang Wang star pattern, near the Big Dipper, in what is more or less Aquarius. Sometimes the term Siming is qualified by (da, meaning \\"big\\" or \\"greater\\") or by (shao, meaning \\"small\\" or \\"lesser\\"). Siming (deity) From an illustrated version of the Chuci poetry anthology section \\"Nine Songs\\" (Jiu ge), poem the \\"Greater Master of Fate\\" The Siming deity has the bureaucratic function of human lifespan allocation. In bureaucratic terms, Si ( wikt:司司}}) is a common term, meaning \\"in charge of\\", \\"a person or department which is in charge of something\\", often translated as \\"secretary\\". Commonly, in real life or in imagined bureaucracies, there were Chief and Assistant Secretaries (Dasi and Shaosi). Ming ( wikt:命命}}) is a complicated word with a long folk and technical history, basically meaning \\"life\\" or \\"the balance of fate or destiny\\", personified as Siming. Often, a deified entity such as Siming receives increased sanctity over time, signified by additional official titles. =Powers and duties= As a deity Siming takes his, her, or their place in a complex cosmological system of Chinese religion and mythology. Over time, this system became a visualization of a complex cosmology including the elaboration of a heavenly bureaucracy, somewhat parallel to the earthly bureaucracy of the Chinese state, and invoking the same sort of explicit hierarchy. Siming's special concern (and power) is the balancing of yin and yang (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 109). Of particular relevance here is the relation between yin and yang balance and human health, and the importance to individual human health of such balance, as articulated in traditional Chinese medicine. Siming has the power to balance or unbalance yin and yang, and thus to lengthen or shorten human lifespans, or to provide health or prolong illness. =Three Deathbringers= An idea from Daoism/traditional Chinese medicine relates to the Siming. Also known as the sanshi ( \\"Three Corpses\\") or sanchong ( \\"Three Worms\\"), the Three Deathbringers are part of a Daoist physiological belief that demonic creatures live inside the human body, and they seek to hasten the death of their hosts. These three supernatural parasites allegedly enter the person at birth, and reside in the three dantian \\"energy centers\\" (head, chest, and abdomen). Succeeding the demise of their human host, they become free of the body as malevolent \\"ghosts\\". However, this process is regulated by Siming, who may or may not permit this process: in this regard, Siming is said to rely on the reports which the Three Deathbringers (and perhaps Kitchen God) provide on specifically regulated dates. Based on these reports, and perhaps other information, Siming alters the fine yin-yang balance of each individual, thus regulating each one's health or sickness, and ultimately each's lifespan. Nevertheless, humans are believed to have various recourses available to alter the judgement of Siming regarding their fates, such as interfering with the reporting process, praying to Siming or his superiors, or following treatment from a doctor to improve the yin-yang balance, and thus extend the lifespan. =Zhuangzi and the skull= One of the early literary references to Siming as a deity is in a section of the book Zhuangzi, from about 300 BCE (: Zhuāngzǐ, Zhì lè). One of the great literary figures of China, Zhou of the Zhuang family became known as Master Zhuang, Zhuangzi, to many subsequent generations. Living in about the 3rd century BCE, Zhuangzi's words and anecdotes have since become a central part of philosophy and culture around the globe. One anecdote, presumably relayed by the Master himself is that one day, while traveling down the road, he came upon a skull. After a prolonged and introspective session of speculation on what unhappy events had led to some unknown person's lack of proper burial, in such an inappropriate final resting spot: whose it had been and by what event the skull came to be lying here, abandoned by the wayside. Master Zhuang then became tired, and lay down to sleep, pillowing his head upon \\"Mr. Skull\\". In his sleep, the skull came and lectured the Master upon the great tranquillity and happiness experienced by the dead. Zhuangzi retorted that he could petition Siming to use his or her powers over Fate and Destiny to restore the skull to be again a living human being, and then he or she could return to both hometown and family. The skull emphatically denies any such desire, and ends the encounter by rhetorically asking why anyone in such a state of unassailable happiness as experienced by the dead would ever wish give this up in exchange for suffering the vicissitudes of the living? Astronomical Siming Starmaps showing two Siming asterisms In ancient times, astrology and astronomy were hardly distinguished. In China, on the one hand, there was the observation of phenomena in the sky, particularly trans-atmospheric phenomena: this observational study of experiential events became differentially known as Chinese astronomy. On the other hand, cerebral and emotional impulses lead to the development of a more philosophic, religious, and sometimes superstitious phenomenon known as Chinese astrology. It is worth emphasizing that the differentiation between the two is relatively modern. The astronomical asterisms of Siming (itself, actually part of asterism , \\"Emptiness\\") consist of the Deified Judge of Life star group. Sīmìngyī: (24 Aquarii, ) and Sīmìngèr (26 Aquarii, ); that is, Siming One and Siming Two. Astrological considerations appear to have had some influence on the assignment of names. =Wenchang= Wenchang Wang (), also known as Wenchang Dijun (), or simply as Wen Qu, or Wen, is a Taoist god of Culture and Literature. Literally he is King () of Flourishing () Culture/Language (). Wenchang Wang is physically represented by a constellation of six stars near the Big Dipper. The stars traditional names are: Shangjiang (), Cijiang (), Guixiang (), Siming (), Sizhong (), and Silu (). Wenchang Wang is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by two attendants, Tianlong ( or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya ( or Earth- Mute). Wenchang has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or help right before an exam, in especial, traditionally, the Imperial examination. Poetry Illustrated version of the poem \\"Lesser Master of Fate\\", probably fourteenth century The ancient poetry text Chu Ci features to Siming in two titles of the Jiu Ge (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 95 and following, and 118 and following): the so-called \\"Greater Siming\\" and the \\"Lesser Siming\\". The Chuci poetry anthology (collected late BC - early BCE) has a section Nine Songs (Jiu Ge). To of its poems are titled \\"Greater Master of Fate\\" and \\"Lesser Master of Fate\\". The \\"Greater\\" and \\"Lesser\\" may refer to two different Siming deities, two aspects of the same deity (such as Jin and Chu (state) shamanic cult versions, both of which were prominent at the time the poems were collected and both of which listed Siming as a god), the greater and lesser may refer to the length of the poems, have some seasonal connotation, or perhaps there is some other explanation. (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 110) Pop culture Two Siming are found in The Legend of Qin film. There are a Greater Siming (), appearing as the Priestess of Death and a Lesser Siming () as Priestess of Birth.

She is best known as the proprietor of the Cotton Club, an early integrated jazz club in Colorado Springs named for the famous club in Harlem. In 2012, Duncan was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame. She was recognized for \\"her courageous stand fostered the peaceful integration of Colorado Springs.\\"  Early life  Fannie Mae Bragg was born on July 5, 1918, in Luther, Oklahoma. Her parents, Herbert and Mattie Brinson Bragg, had worked as sharecroppers in Oklahoma. She was one of seven children, all of whom helped with the work. From an early age, Fannie Mae wanted to help at the farm stand and sell produce; her father encouraged this entrepreneurial inclination. In 1926, Herbert Bragg died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Her mother moved the family to Colorado in 1933. Five years later, she was the first in her family to graduate from high school; she attended Colorado Springs High School.  Career  After having married Edward Duncan, she began to work with the military who trained in Colorado Springs during World War II. At Camp Carson, she opened a soda fountain at the facility established for African-American soldiers called Haven Club. Flip Wilson was stationed at the camp and Duncan said that she gave him his first chance to perform. She opened a United Service Organizations (USO) center, after convincing the city manager to issue her a business license, at a time when it was very rare for an African-Americans and particularly African- American woman to own a business there. Duncan then opened Cotton Club to serve, and be served by, people irrespective of their ethnic heritage. Her customers included soldiers and their brides. Among the notable people that played at the jazz club included Duke Ellington, Etta James, Lionel Hampton, Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, and Count Basie. At the time, hotels in the city would not serve African-Americans and she bought a historic mansion to provide lodging for performers and other visitors, including Medgar Evers. In addition, it was standard practice for blacks to enter restaurants through rear doors and sit in balconies of theaters. Duncan's business approach was that she wanted to serve people of color, while also serving white people. Denying whites admittance to the Cotton Club, she felt meant that she would be denying their constitutional rights. This raised objections among local authorities, but she took a stand and peacefully provided for integrated patronage of the club. One of the concerned individuals was I.B. Bruce, the police chief. Nicknamed \\"Dad\\", Bruce became a good friend of Duncans and was successful in ensuring that there was no trouble at the business. Duncan worked out a deal with Bruce wherein patrons were free to mingle without interference, and in return Duncan tipped them off if she saw a customer they were looking for. To ensure safety, Duncan did not serve people who had too much to drink or were making trouble; she also hired her own security. To promote inclusiveness, she had a permanent sign in the club's window, \\"Everybody's Welcome\\" Due to urban renewal, the club closed in 1975 and the club at a new location was unsuccessful. Civic activist She was active in civic organizations, often the first woman to become a member. She donated the first iron lung in the city and was a fundraiser for medical research. She was cofounder of the Sickle Cell Anemia Association chapter in the city and the philanthropic 400 Club. Duncan provided for college educations and was a mentor and role model. Death and legacy Duncan died on September 12, 2005 in Denver. Having no children of her own, she had close relationships with her nieces and nephews. Her husband, Edward Duncan, a porter for the railroad, died in 1957. The annual multicultural event, \\"Everybody Welcome\\", honors Duncan's business and civic career. In 2012, Duncan was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame. She was recognized for her role in fostering the racial integration.

ISIL previously controlled the city from May 2015 until March 2016. The unexpected blitz offensive occurred concurrently with three major anti-ISIL offensives: the Turkish Western al-Bab offensive and Battle of al- Bab north of Aleppo, the Kurdish-Arab Raqqa campaign, and the Iraqi Battle of Mosul in Iraq, which saw all three gaining ground from the Islamic State. In January 2017, the Syrian Army and allied forces launched another offensive to recapture Palmyra and its surrounding areas. Background ISIL captured the ancient city of Palmyra in May 2015 after the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) withdrew from the town. The Syrian Army recaptured the city in March 2016. The group however still held territory in the eastern Homs Governorate and had started carrying out insurgent attacks on the Syrian Army after losing the city. The city is historically and internationally important and the offensive comes at the same time that ISIL is being targeted militarily at its headquarters of Mosul and Raqqa. Palmyra is also strategically important as it is close to oil fields. The offensive was launched at a moment when the Syrian and Russian militaries were focused on the Aleppo offensive. The Tiyas Military Airbase is near to the city. It is an important security installation for the Syrian Army as it provides them with close air support. It would also be difficult to recapture Palmyra without it.  Offensive  = ISIL capture of Palmyra = Liwa Fatemiyoun militiamen gather outside of Palmyra on 10 December in an attempt to counter the ISIL offensive. ISIL launched the offensive in the northeastern countryside of Homs on 8 December 2016, targeting the SAA's defenses near the village of Huwaysis and the Jazal Mountains located north of Palmyra. The group began the attack by sending two waves of fighters to storm its defenses near Huwaysis, resulting in heavy clashes. It was however unable to penetrate the first line of defense and was forced to withdraw. Local media reported that 60 militants were killed, while eight of their armored vehicles were destroyed. The group launched another assault later in the day, with simultaneous attacks near the Jazal, Mahr and Shaer oil and gas fields as well as the areas of Huwaysis, Arak, Palmyra Silos, al-Hayyal Mount, al-Sekkary, the ancient al-Hallabat Palace and an abandoned base near the T4 airbase. It was able to capture seven checkpoints from the Army, which withdrew after heavy clashes. In addition, it also captured the al-Hallabat Palace, al-Hayyal Mount, South Sawamea and Huwaysis. At least 34 pro-government fighters were killed and four, including an officer, were captured. With these advances, the group came within of Palmyra.The “Islamic State” advances in new places at Palmyra area in the eastern desert of HomsViolent and large-attack by the “Islamic State” in Palmyra on sites of the regime forces and on ancient Palace causes tens of casualties and injuries The group also captured grain silos northeast of Palmyra as well as the Jazal village and its oil fields. Meanwhile, Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve launched a massive air-raid on an Islamic State fleet of 168 oil tanker trucks, destroying them. The SAA counter-attacked on 9 December, to recapture the positions it lost the previous day, in addition to bringing in reinforcements and launching airstrikes. 15 soldiers were killed in an ISIL ambush near the Mahr oil field. The Islamic State captured the al-Berej hills, Jihar oil fields, Mahr oil fields as well as a checkpoint near it during the clashes.IS advances in Homs countryside over regime forces, and continued clashes in the area On 10 December, Army reinforcements arrived in Palmyra. At least 45 militants were killed by the Army, with three Islamic State tanks destroyed near Palmyra Silos. An earlier assault by the group on the silos had failed, but it was able to capture them later on, thus reaching the entrance to Palmyra. The Russian and Syrian Air Forces targeted ISIL positions in oil fields around Palmyra, destroying several armoured vehicles and a number of technical vehicles. A Syrian Air Force MiG-23 crashed in the Jazal area. ISIL claimed to had shot it down, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported it was not known whether it crashed due to technical fault or was shot down. Clashes also started taking place around Wadi al-Ahmar where the Army brought reinforcements.The Latest: IS says it shot down Syrian jet near Palmyra The group later captured the Tar Mountain to the west of the city, in addition to the northern suburb of Amiriyeh, and entered Palmyra. By the end of the day, they had captured most of the city, including Palmyra Castle,Russian warplanes target IS in Tadmur and IS takes almost full control on the city and were on the verge of taking full control of Palmyra. Palmyra's residents were evacuated in the evening by the Army. Early on 11 December, after the arrival of reinforcements, the Syrian Army, backed by Syrian and Russian air units, launched a successful counterattack to drive out ISIL forces from the city. The militants withdrew to the orchards on the fringes of Palmyra. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, ISIL suffered over 300 dead. However, later in the day, ISIL launched a new assault on Palmyra after regrouping, entering the city once again and capturing Amiriyeh, its hilltop and the Officers Housing complex. Eventually, ISIL took full control of the city as the Army withdrew south of Palmyra. = Attack on Tiyas Airbase = Liwa Fatemiyoun troops near Palmyra during the offensive ISIL started advancing westwards from Palmyra to the Tiyas Military Airbase (also called al-Taifor and T4 airbase) after the city's capture on 11 December. The group captured two villages to the west of city during the day. It also captured an abandoned base to the west of the airbase. Early on 12 December, ISIL launched an attack against the strategically important Jihar Crossroad near the airbase, and captured it after heavy clashes. It later captured security checkpoints in the nearby districts of Mashtal and Qasr al-Hir, allowing it to launch an attack against the airbase spearheaded by two car bombs, resulting in an hours-long battle with the entrenched SAA defenders. Aided by numerous Russian airstrikes, the government forces eventually repelled the assault, as ISIL forces regrouped for another attempt at breaching the airbase's defenses. Meanwhile, hundreds of pro-government reinforcements arrived at the frontline, which belonged to the National Defence Forces-affiliated Qalamoun Shield and Golan Regiment. Russia carried out airstrikes against ISIL in Palmyra, killing five people. The group attacked the airbase again on 13 December, after advancing around it in an attempt to besiege it.

ISIL meanwhile captured al- Sharifah village to the west of the airbase.The “Islamic State” achieves a new advancement in the eastern countryside of Homs and clashes continue near the T4 airbase Later that day, ISIL launched another attack on the airbase, but thanks to newly arrived government reinforcements, belonging to the paratrooper forces of the Republican Guard's 800th Regiment, the assault was repelled. The following night, a SAA counter-attack drove ISIL from the airbase's outskirts. The US-led coalition stated on 16 December that it had carried out airstrikes near the airbase against ISIL on the previous day, destroying the heavy weaponry it seized after recapturing Palmyra. An air defense artillery system, 14 tanks, three artillery systems, two ISIL-held buildings and two tactical vehicles were destroyed in total. The strikes reportedly killed at least 38 militants. The Syrian Army launched another counterattack on 16 December, recapturing the Qaryatayn-T4 crossroads area. They later also recaptured the road between al-Sharifah and al-Qaryatyn and reopened the direct route between al-Qaryatayn and the airbase. Umar As'ad, a leader of ISIL, was killed in the clashes. The Army recaptured a checkpoint near al-Qaryatayn on 17 December.Clashes in the Syrian Desert and airstrikes target Palmyra Desert, shelling target the countryside of Quneitra and casualty in the countryside of Daraa Another attack by ISIL later in the day was repelled, while the Army captured Al-Sha'arah Hills to the north of the abandoned base.

Diplomatic reactions  On 12 December 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented that the Islamic State's offensive in Palmyra may have been \\"orchestrated\\" to distract forces from militants in eastern Aleppo, and ISIL's reinforcements then moved from Mosul to Palmyra via routes which could have been blocked by the US-led coalition's aviation. A spokesman for Russian Defense Ministry Igor Konashenkov stated that the Islamic State made use of pause in the Mosul and Raqqah offensives to shift reinforcements to Palmyra, and that ISIL were sure that these offensives would not be immediately renewed. Konashenkov commented that the government setbacks at Palmyra shows that the Islamic State should not be allowed to regroup. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault stated that the proof of Russia's stated aim of targeting militants in Syria being false lay in reports that ISIL had retaken Palmyra, while accusing it of being there to save Assad's government and \\"making Aleppo fall\\".

Her only published work, Filipson, Memórias da primeira colônia judaica no Rio Grande do Sul (Filipson: Memories of the First Jewish Colony in Rio Grande do Sul) (1967) describes the Jewish immigrant farming colony established in the Brazilian countryside of Rio Grande do Sul in the early 20th century. She was the first woman to publish stories about Jewish immigrants living in Brazil's farmlands, and the only woman from Filipson to write about the colony from a first-hand perspective. Biography Frida Schweidson was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants who had come to Brazil with the support of the Jewish Colonization Association. She was born and raised on her parents' farm, which was named Filipson, and was educated in the school run by the colonists. In her late teens she married Boris Alexandr, a Russian immigrant, and moved to São Paulo, where he played piano in silent-movie theaters. They had two sons and a daughter. In São Paulo she became an active volunteer for the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO). She wrote her only book, Filipson, as a WIZO project. She began writing the book at the request of her children, who had heard her stories of growing up when they were younger. She began writing the memoir 20 years after she had left Filipson, and completed it 20 years later. A few copies of the first edition were sold, but most were donated for charity. No subsequent editions were published. Filipson Filipson, Memórias da primeira colônia judaica no Rio Grande do Sul (Filipson: Memories of the First Jewish Colony in Rio Grande do Sul) is a compilation of 56 narratives describing the Jewish agricultural colony between the years 1905 and 1925 through the eyes of Alexandr and others who experienced these events. It is noted as the only first-hand description of Jewish life in Filipson told by a woman who lived there, and the first book published in Portuguese that exclusively dealt with Jewish immigrants to Brazil's farming areas. Alexandr drew on her memories of her own childhood and teen years in Filipson, as well as memories of her brothers and other residents, to write the narratives. Written in Portuguese, the book is peppered with regional colloquialisms. The narratives detail the lives and activities of Jewish \\"peasants, cattle handlers, milk collectors, pharmacists, healers, midwives and schoolteachers, as well as others involved in the plowing, planting and harvesting in the fields\\". Attention is paid to the religious practices and life cycle ceremonies of the residents, their construction of a synagogue, and children's education. Outside events that impacted on the colony, including \\"epidemics, natural calamities and outlaws\\", are also discussed. Alexandr gives voice to the desire of many young female residents to leave the \\"suffocating confines\\" of the farming community, a desire that would only be fulfilled through marriage. Hussar and Igel note that Alexandr writes more like a novelist than a historian, liberally employing narrative techniques such as \\"unity of setting and recurring characters, archetypes, themes and symbols\\". The fact that she did not specify dates for the historical record also indicates that she did not intend to write a history per se.

He served as Chamberlain and Colonel of the military staff of King Kalākaua and traveled with the monarch on his 1881 world tour. Early life Charles Hastings Judd was born September 8, 1835, at the Old Mission Home across the street from the modern Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site in Honolulu. He was the fourth child and second son of American missionaries Gerrit P. Judd and Laura Fish Judd. Charles' younger twin sister was also named Laura Fish Judd (1835–1888) and his father, who had worked as a missionary physician, resigned his post to work as a political advisor and cabinet minister to King Kamehameha III. Charles' younger brother Albert Francis Judd served as Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court. Judd was educated at Punahou School from 1842 to 1849 before attending the Royal School when the children of cabinet ministers were admitted to the institution. His classmates included fellow missionary descendant William Nevins Armstrong and the future King Kalākaua, both of whom developed a lifelong friendship with Judd during their childhood. From 1854 to 1856, Judd returned to Punahou and traveled with his mother and two sisters to the United States via the Isthmus of Panama to visit his relatives in 1855. Business career From 1859, Charles Judd engaged in guano mining for the American Guano Company on Jarvis Island and Baker Island, which were made American possession by the Guano Islands Act of 1858. On November 1, 1859, he married Emily Catherine Cutts of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in Honolulu. Cutts was in Hawaii to visit her aunt Catherine Whitney, wife of Henry Martyn Whitney. The Judds lived on Baker Island from 1860 to 1861 and served as an agent for the American Guano Company. After returning to Oahu, Judd and his brother-in-law Samuel Gardner Wilder engaged in agriculture and purchased plantations on the island's eastern coast, including Kualoa, which was previously owned by Judd's father, and Kaalua, where they grew tobacco, cotton, rice, and sugarcane. This venture ended in 1871. Judd also partnered in ranching with John Adams Cummins at Waimānalo. In 1866, Judd purchased Rosebank, the Honolulu residence of Robert Crichton Wyllie, and resettled in the city with his family. Political and military career Charles Judd served in many political and court posts during the monarchy. He worked a number of governmental jobs as commissioner of private ways and water rights, marriage license agent, commissioner of fences in Oahu, and tax collector for Koolaupoko. In 1868, Judd was elected to the House of Representatives in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii and served during the sessions from 1868 to 1873. He also held many honorary military ranks in the Hawaiian military; he was appointed Captain of the Honolulu Cavalry in 1863 and elevated to the rank of Major in 1866 during the reign of Kamehameha V. After his election to the House of Representatives, Lunalilo appointed Judd a Colonel on his military staff and Judd served as adjutant general of the Household Guards. On September 7, 1873, the Royal Guards mutinied at ʻIolani Barracks due to their resentment of Judd and the Hungarian drillmaster Captain Joseph Jajczay. Unable to control their subordinates, Judd and Jajczay were beaten and attacked by the angry troops and a demand for their removal was sent to the king. Lunalilo responded by disbanding the military unit, leaving Hawaii without a standing army for the remainder of his reign. After Lunalilo's death and the monarchical election of 1874 that followed, Judd openly supported Queen Dowager Emma's candidacy for the throne against Kalākaua but switched sides after Kalākaua's victory over Emma in the legislative vote, which gained him the distrust of the king's sister Liliuokalani.; During the reign of Kalākaua, in 1874, Judd was reappointed to the King's Staff as a Colonel. Kalākaua also appointed Judd to serve on his Privy Council of State, the monarch's advisory council. On September 8, 1879, he was appointed a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, and served in this legislative post during the session from 1880 to 1886. He also served as Commissioner of Crown Lands from 1878 and member of the Board of Health from 1880. On July 6, 1878, he was appointed the King's Chamberlain and served as his private secretary. Edward William Purvis served as his vice-chamberlain. Colonel Judd (left) with King Kalākaua (center) and Colonel George W. Macfarlane (right) In this capacity, Judd traveled with Kalākaua on his 1881 world tour along with their childhood classmate Armstrong and Colonel George W. Macfarlane, the king's aide-de-camp. Judd's dark complexion and physical resemblance to Kalākaua led a few people, including Qing politician Li Hongzhang to mistake him for a Native Hawaiian, and the 5th Earl Spencer mistook him for the king. According to the Evening Star, a Washington, D. C. newspaper, \\"Col. Judd looks very much like Kalakaua, except that he wears a moustache simply. He was born in the islands, of New York parentage, but is burned as brown as a nut.\\" During this trip, Judd received many decorations from foreign governments. Along with Kalākaua, he was made an honorary member of the Pacific Yacht Club in Sausalito, California. In Japan, he was bestowed with the Order of the Rising Sun. Judd was voted into the Freemasonry brotherhood at Perseverance Lodge No 1165 in Hong Kong and was bestowed with the masonry third degree at the Lodge Zetland in the East, No. 548, in Singapore. In Siam, he received the Knight Grand Cross of the Crown of Siam, Third Class. At the 1883 coronation of Kalākaua and Kapiolani, Judd served as Lord High Chamberlain while his wife served as lady-in-waiting to the queen. After a disagreement about the king's increased expenditure, Judd was removed from the office of Chamberlain in August 1886. This was stated as a resignation in public announcements but Judd had been removed by the administration of Prime Minister Walter M. Gibson for disagreeing with Gibson's cabinet. Curtis P. Iaukea was appointed to succeed Judd as Chamberlain to the Royal Household. Judd regarded his removal from office as a \\"defection of the king, a lifelong friend, [which] preyed upon his mind with devastating effect and his health\\".; ; Judd resigned from politics, and devoted his time to business and managing property. He moved his family from Honolulu to the Leilehua Ranch house, which he co-owned with the king, and in 1889 to the Kualoa Ranch, where he died on April 18, 1890. He was buried at Oahu Cemetery in Honolulu.; ; ; Family and descendants Charles Judd married Emily Catherine Cutts (March 19, 1840 – May 2, 1921) on November 1, 1859, and they had four children: #Julie Judd (November 26, 1860 – September 2, 1941), who married Francis Mills Swanzy on November 9, 1887, at Honolulu. They had three children. #Helen \\"Haunani\\" Judd (May 5, 1862 – January 7, 1935), who married Arthur Christopher Farley on March 9, 1882, at Boston.

The school offers dual enrollment courses, vocational courses, a music program, interscholastic sports, and a work-study program, as well as an English language learner program for international students. Campion is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.  Accreditation  Campion Academy is accredited by the Adventist Accrediting Association (AAA and the CTC, the National Council for Private School Accreditation (NCPSA), and the Middle States Association of Colleges and School Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools (MSACS).  History  Founded in 1907 on land donated by William A. Hankins, a homesteader who filed a claim in the 1880s, Campion Academy was founded in order to train young people to spread the gospel at home and around the world. The first school year opened to 29 students attending grades 1-9, in spite of no desks and little other equipment. Throughout the Great Depression and World Wars I and II, the school grew thanks to dedicated families and local church members who helped raise money, build, and work at the school. By 1963, enrollment had grown to 339 students. Located between Loveland and Berthoud, Colorado, the academy's location along the railroad allowed it to develop industries at which students could work and help pay part of their tuition. Some of the industries included Silver State Plastics (1960), Harris Pine Mills (1962), and Rhodes Baken N Serve (1966). Today, students still participate in a work-study program in both on- and off-campus jobs.

Thomas Market. He was also active in the local Chamber of Commerce, Civitan, American Legion, Dokkies and Woodmen of the World Thomas succeeded John C. Towler and initially served alongside fellow Democrats Ray L. Garland of Roanoke and Richard Cranwell of Salem, Virginia (who would become majority leader). Beginning in 1979 Thomas ran on a Democratic ticket with Chip Woodrum in Roanoke. They handily defeated Republicans Elizabeth T. Bowles and Mary Brooks that year, and soundly defeated Independent Zaman K. McManaway in 1981. His district, which comprised parts of the City of Roanoke as well as the County of Roanoke, was initially numbered the 7th Virginia district (1975–1980), but briefly became the 6th district in 1981 (comprising only the City of Roanoke). Further redistricting required by a judicial decision mandating single-member districts again combined parts of the city and county, and renumbered it as the 17th district. Thomas often faced no opponent when re-elected, but again in 1991 soundly defeated Independent Zaman K. McManaway and Republican Jeffrey L. Artis in 1995.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1974/year_to:2005/office_id:8/district_id:27320 After the Republican party took control of the House of Delegates in 2000 and approved a partisan redistricting, Thomas won his seat once more. He declined to seek re-election in 2003, and Republican W. H. Fralin Jr. handily defeated both Democrat L.F. Wyatt and Independent G.M.

LDAP injection exploits a security vulnerability in an application by manipulating input parameters passed to internal search, add or modify functions. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it is possible for an attacker to modify an LDAP statement. Technical Implementation LDAP injection occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and then used as part of a dynamically generated LDAP filter. This results in potential manipulation of the LDAP statements performed on the LDAP server to either view, modify, or bypass authentication credentials. Prevention LDAP injection is a known attack and can be prevented by simple measures. All of the client supplied input must be checked/sanitized of any characters that may result in malicious behavior. The input validation should verify the input by checking for the presence of special characters that are a part of the LDAP query language, known data types, legal values, etc. White list input validation can also be used to detect unauthorized input before it is passed to the LDAP query. Example In the below example a query is constructed to validate a user's credentials for the purpose of logging in. \`String filter = “(&(USER = ” + user_name + “) (PASSWORD = “ + user_password + “))”;\` In a typical use case, a user would provide their user credentials and this filter would be used to validate these credentials. However, an attacker can enter a crafted input for the variable \`user_name\` such as \`johnDoe)(&)\` and any value for password the finished query will become \`(&(USER = johnDoe)(&))(PASSWORD = pass))\`. Only the first portion of this query is processed by the LDAP server \`(&(USER = johnDoe)(&)\`, which always evaluates to true allowing the attacker to gain access to the system without needing to provide valid user credentials.

The painting measures . It depicts a portrait of a female figure, composed in an unusually lively expressionistic style. It was acquired by the Galleria Ricci-Oddi in Piacenza in 1925. In 1996, X-ray analysis revealed that the portrait was an overpainted version of Klimt's lost work Portrait of a Young Lady (in hat and with scarf), which disappeared in 1917. The original portrait showed a woman with whom Klimt is believed to have had a love affair, but after she died suddenly, he painted over the work. The painting was believed stolen on 22 February 1997, shortly before a special exhibition was planned at the gallery, during the renovation of the building. The frame was found discarded on the roof next to a skylight, which was, however, too small for the painting to have been removed through. In April 1997, the Italian police authorities discovered a high-quality forgery at Ventimiglia, on the Italian border with France, in a package addressed to the former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi who was hiding from the law in Hammamet, Tunisia. The \\"theft\\" in February may have been staged shortly before the exhibition to cover up the swap of the original painting with the forgery some months before. The case was reopened in 2014 according to the new facts. Various copies of the painting are known to the Italian police. In December 2019, 23 years after the theft, a bag containing what was believed to be the missing painting was recovered from a recess in an exterior wall of the gallery by gardeners clearing away ivy, which had overgrown over the recess at least 10 years prior. The painting was confirmed to be the missing Portrait of a Lady the following month. Tests will be carried out to confirm if the painting had been in the wall since it was stolen, or placed in there later. The painting will then go back on display at the gallery.

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One, PBS, Channel One and 1+1 on 15 January 2017. Plot A panic-stricken little girl wakes up on an aeroplane and finds everybody asleep. She picks a mobile phone up and hears Jim Moriarty announce \\"Welcome to the final problem\\". Mycroft Holmes is at home, where Sherlock and Watson disable his home security to trick him into revealing that his sister, Eurus, exists. At 221B Baker Street, Mycroft explains that Eurus was an era- defining genius on a par with Isaac Newton, with abilities far greater than Sherlock's and Mycroft's, coupled with a total lack of normal sensation and emotion. Mycroft reveals that their parents sent Eurus to a mental institution after she kidnapped and drowned Sherlock's dog Redbeard, and after she burned their home down. Mycroft withheld this from Sherlock because Eurus had psychologically traumatized him as a child, taunting him with an enigmatic song, and leading ultimately to Mycroft having his memories 'rewritten', he'd also been lying to their parents about Eurus not surviving the blaze she had set. An adult Mycroft then sent her to a Government 'Black site' and maximum- security facility a quote \\"Prison within a prison\\", in the North Sea, Sherrinford, unknown to anyone outside very high ranking government officials and only on a need to know basis. When Mycroft insists that she is secured, a quadcopter carrying a motion-activated grenade flies into Sherlock's flat. John, Sherlock, and Mycroft flee as the bomb detonates, blasting Holmes and Watson out of the windows. Later, John and Sherlock hijack a fishing trawler to travel to Sherrinford, carrying out a diversionary plan so that Sherlock can reach Eurus' cell. Mycroft and John corner the prison governor, discovering that he has explicitly disobeyed Mycroft's protocol and has allowed Eurus to interact with prison staff. Using her skill to \\"reprogram\\" everyone she speaks with, Eurus has effectively taken full control of the prison. Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him unconscious. The guards lock Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell. Mycroft reveals that five years before, he granted Eurus an unsupervised interview with Moriarty as a Christmas present in exchange for detecting national security threats to Britain. During that time, Moriarty agreed to record video messages for her. After forcing the governor to commit suicide, Eurus torments Sherlock, Mycroft and Watson in a series of psychological ordeals, forcing Sherlock into sinister games to save their lives while videos of Moriarty heckle him. Although Eurus forces Sherlock onward with the prospect of saving the girl on the aeroplane, he eventually stops the games by threatening to shoot himself when she orders him to shoot either John or Mycroft. Furious, Eurus uses tranquilliser darts on the three of them. Sherlock wakes up near the burnt-out wreckage of his family's old house. He speaks to the girl in the aeroplane to try to guide her in landing safely. John wakes up chained at the bottom of a well. As Eurus raises the water level in the well, John finds a human skull there, and Sherlock realizes that what he thought was his dog Redbeard was in fact his childhood friend, Victor Trevor. Eurus threw him into the well and left him for dead because she felt left out of Sherlock's attention as a child. Sherlock then deciphers the real meaning of the song that Eurus originally taunted him with when Victor went missing, which reveals that she wants him to find her. Sherlock deduces that the girl in the plane is actually Eurus's mental metaphor and that the game has been a cry for help. With Eurus' puzzle solved, Sherlock is able to send her back to Sherrinford after rescuing John. Mycroft explains to his and Sherlock's parents, who are angry that they had been told that Eurus was dead, that she refuses to speak to people anymore. Sherlock visits her and they play the violin together, giving performances for their parents and Mycroft. While helping Sherlock repair his destroyed flat, John receives a video sent by Mary before she died, encouraging him to continue working with Sherlock.  Sources  The title of the episode is a reference to \\"The Final Problem\\" (1893). The episode was partially based on \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" (1893), which it directly references.'Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel', Jane Stanford, Carrowmore, pps. 87,88. Watson's mention of the east wind and the name of Eurus Holmes are a reference to \\"His Last Bow\\" (1917), where Holmes says, \\"There's an east wind coming, Watson.\\" The three Garrideb brothers seen in a puzzle sequence are an adaptation of \\"The Adventure of the Three Garridebs\\" (1924). The character Victor Trevor is a reference to \\"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott\\" (1893), where he appears as Holmes' first ever close friend, albeit in university rather than in childhood. Jim Moriarty's brother is mentioned as a broadcast station master, a reference to The Valley of Fear (1915), where James Moriarty's brother is noted to be a railway station master. The message on the coffin lid is a reference to \\"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\\" (1911). The closing shot shows Holmes and Watson exiting \\"Rathbone Place\\", a reference to Basil Rathbone, who played Sherlock Holmes in fourteen films and a radio series. In the final sequence, \\"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\\" (1903) is referenced with the following cipher seen on a chalkboard, which reads \\"AM HERE ABE SLANEY\\": A diagram drawn by Conan Doyle  Production  The setting for Sherrinford, the high-security prison, was filmed at St Catherine's Fort, St Catherine's Island off Castle Beach in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Wales. Musician Paul Weller made a cameo appearance, in a non-speaking role as a man lying on the floor in a Viking costume, seen near the end of the episode.  Leak and investigation  On 14 January, one day before the episode's broadcast, it was released online with Russian dialogue. Both the official Sherlock Twitter account and members of the Sherlock team acknowledged this and asked people to not share it and keep the Internet free of spoilers. On 16 January Channel One Russia, the network holding the rights to the broadcast in Russia, issued an apology, having determined that the material had been hacked from their system. Channel One Russia announced it was conducting an investigation, while BBC, through BBC Worldwide, announced its own full-scale investigation of the leak. Broadcast and reception \\"The Final Problem\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Among the more positive reviews was Sean O'Grady of The Independent who gave the episode four out of five stars, stating that \\"Benedict Cumberbatch and Tim Freeman are their usual accomplished double act\\" although suggesting \\"Maybe Sherlock needs a little more reimagining\\". Meanwhile, Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode five out of five stars, praising that \\"the dazzling script delivered laughs, excitement, and emotion .. we were left with a wiser Holmes and Watson.\\" He also commented about the possibility of series 4 being the last series for Sherlock, stating \\"if this was the last-ever episode, which it surely won't be, it worked well as a sign off.\\" Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek wrote \\"this was fun to watch. Fun and ultra-tense with a terrific, whooshing sense of momentum. It went like the clappers, held its breath, went like the clappers again, held its breath some more until you thought you might pass out with the dizziness.\\" Neela Debnath of the Daily Express was also positive, writing \\"I can't fault the thrill ride that The Final Problem takes viewers on from the beginning to the end. Sherlock has clawed itself back from the edge.\\" Two separate reviews in The Observer or The Guardian were positive, with one describing it as too byzantine, but \\"much better than it looked\\" and the other writing \\"with a visual swagger far beyond the budget – and including an eerily beautiful high-security violin duet for Sherlock and Eurus – this was a fine way to go.\\" However, some reviews were more critical. A third Guardian review was negative, stating Holmes had \\"become a parody of himself\\". Kaite Welsh of IndieWire scored the episode a grade of B-, writing \\"Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss wrap up their 13th episode on an elegiac note, musing on the legend that is Sherlock and Watson. It's just a shame the rest of the episode was such a mess, really\\". Ian Hyland of The Daily Mirror stated that he preferred it \\"when Holmes and Watson were just solving fairly believable mysteries. If it went back to that I'd welcome another series or two with open arms.\\" He compared the series to the BBC series Taboo, suggesting that the latter would be a better television series for those who love Sherlock. Aja Romano of Vox also criticized the episode, praising the usual drama of Sherlock, but being critical of the fact that the episode \\"collapses into a muddled mess of melodrama and confusion ... there is even less logic.\\" Romano considered the episode to be an anticlimax, saying \\"the episode feels like a window dressing on a completely different story.\\" Issues of representation within the episode were raised by some commentators. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of The Daily Dot called the episode the \\"most sexist\\" of the TV show. She noted that Eurus, a stereotypical female villain, \\"ticks every box for the kind of madwoman who gets locked up in an asylum in a 19th century melodrama\\" and commits crimes only motivated \\"by a desire for male attention.\\" References External links * 2017 British television episodes Television episodes written by Steven Moffat Television episodes written by Mark Gatiss Sherlock (TV series) episodes Fiction about mind control Death games in fiction ","title":"The Final Problem (Sherlock)"},{"id":"52524501","text":"Lapham is a populated place situated in Yavapai County, Arizona.

The theme of the game is planetary formation and the birth of a new solar system. In 2015, the game won the Le Plateau d'or, a game design contest presented during Les journées Ludique de Québec, an annual gaming convention held in Canada. In July 2015, the publishing rights to the game were acquired by tabletop game publisher Game Salute, and for one year Stéphane Vachon and Dann May (Chief Creative Officer at Game Salute) worked together to modify the game design, develop the game play and redesign the components. In June 2016, Planetarium launched on Kickstarter, in a campaign that ran for 3 weeks. 3,000 backers supported the project with funding raised of $126,815. The game is scheduled to be delivered to Kickstarter backers in March 2017 and will be available in the retail market 1 or 2 months later.  Description  Matter swirls around a new born star, coalescing on the planetoids that orbit it. Planets evolve, grow and migrate in their orbits, forming a unique solar system by the end of every game. Planetarium is a game of creation, chaos and terraforming on the grandest scale. Players are competing to crash combinations of elements onto planets that then allow them to play cards to evolve the planets in a variety of ways, with each player looking to evolve planets in the system to suit their own secret endgame goals. On a turn a player will firstly move a matter or planet token in a clockwise direction around the star. The board is mapped with a series of lines, tracing orbits around the star, and it is along these lines that the tokens are moved. If a matter token moves onto a space occupied by planet token then the matter token is placed on the player's mat (on the respective planet). In the same way, planets can also be moved onto matter tokens, placing the matter tokens on the player's mat. In the second part of a turn a player can play Evolution cards from their hand at the cost of the matter tokens they have collected on their player mat (some cards have other special requirements to play). If a player plays a card, they score the cards points and check to see if their card has changed the state of the planet from hostile to habitable by checking the total habitable and hostile points played to the planet (some end game goals require planets to be hostile or habitable). The player may then draw a card from one of three decks, Low Evolution (cards that score less points but require less matter to play), High Evolution (cards that score more and are harder to play), and Final Evolution (cards that can only be played on a player's final turn). The theme of the game has been developed with an eye on the science, led by a scientist working on NASA's search for life on Mars. Evolution cards thematically include all kinds of planetary phenomenon, from asteroid impacts, atmospheric effects, to geological events. Final Evolution cards mark the relatively stable state a planet is in at the end of the solar system's development and include classifications for the final planets such as Hot Jupiter or an uninhabitable frozen dwarf planet. The game consists of a beautiful game board with handfuls of matter tokens, approximately 36 Evolution cards and 16 Final Evolution cards (all with unique space art and flavor), player mats, and player and score markers.  The Idea  The idea of the game came from when Stéphane Vachon saw a documentary on a TV show about planetary formation theory. After this he saw many other documentaries on YouTube and made some searches on this subject. Originally, the game included five kinds of matter: water, gas, rock, metal and carbon. The carbon was removed and the final product keeps only 4 kinds of matter. After 3 years of work, the game was entered in the game design contest at Quebec City.  Plateau d’or  Plateau d'or logo This game contest is a popular in Quebec and has existed for almost 10 years. In 2015, approximately 50 games were submitted. Exactly 25 games were preselected 3 weeks later as part of the first round of judging. In the second round, the list was narrowed to 10 games, and the designers were invited to present their game during the event Les journées Ludique de Québec. Two weeks later, the final round saw 5 games selected and presented to a jury of experts. The jury played these 5 games during the event and selected one winner. Planetarium was the winner of the contest in 2015.  Reviews  The Board Game Family playtest the game during the Kickstarter Campaign and enjoy the game.

Education Held received her A.B degree from Douglass College, and her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Research Held's body of work reflects at least three related lines of inquiry, which have evolved over the course of her career. Her best-known work relates to her philosophical analysis and trenchant critiques of the positive psychology movement. Articles such as \\"The Negative Side of Positive Psychology\\" (2004) point out a number of different ways to conceptualize \\"negative\\" and \\"positive\\" behavior and attitudes from the standpoint of psychology, and suggest that the way positive psychology frames these concepts is potentially problematic and even oppressive. Her earliest line of research, beginning in the mid-1980s, applied an epistemological framework in evaluating the basis for constructivist family therapy approaches. This eventually developed into a formal inquiry about the philosophical underpinnings of the postmodern psychotherapy movement. Held's more recent work has broadened this lens beyond psychotherapy to encompass the field of psychology as a whole, including attendant philosophy-of-science issues. In Psychology's Interpretive Turn (2007), she examined—and at times criticized—recent efforts by theoretical psychologists to balance the shortcomings of both postmodern and overly positivist, scientistic accounts of human nature with so-called \\"middle-ground\\" theories designed to preserve aspects of both.

Biography Jacobson received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics from McGill University (in 1981 and 1983, respectively), and both a M.S. and a Ph.D. in operations research from Cornell University (in 1986 and 1988, respectively). Subsequently, he joined the faculty of the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in 1988, and then the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech in 1993. In 1999, he joined the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, moving to the Department of Computer Science in 2006. From 2012 to 2014, he served as the Program Director for Operations Research at the National Science Foundation. He has served on the National Research Council's Committee on Airport Passenger Screening: Backscatter X-Ray Machines (2013-2015) and the National Academy of Medicine's Standing Committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Strategic National Stockpile (2015-2017). =Aviation Research= In 1995, Jacobson and John E. Kobza authored the first paper demonstrating how operations research models could be used to optimize the performance of aviation security systems. They co-led the first study analyzing the costs and benefits of 100% checked baggage screening. Jacobson also designed and analyzed a class of multi-level passenger prescreening models to optimize the performance of aviation passenger and baggage security operations using a risk-based paradigm. This research, funded by the National Science Foundation, served as a precursor for risk-based aviation security policies (including the Transportation Security Administration's PreCheck program) that are now used at commercial airports throughout the United States. This research was recognized with the 2018 INFORMS Impact Prize for its contributions to risk-based security in aviation security and its influence on TSA PreCheck. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in the United States, Jacobson argued that risk-based security screening concepts could also be applied to the health threat. After the 2016 Atatürk Airport attack in Istanbul, Turkey, Jacobson contended that decreasing pressure on checkpoints inside airports is essential, advocating for more enrollment in expedited screening such as TSA PreCheck. In late 2016, he published a study showing that waiving the $85 TSA PreCheck fee would result in a net savings of $34 million due to reduced screening costs. =Public Health Research= Jacobson was one of the first researchers to apply operations research models to public health problems. His contributions focused on the design and optimization of pediatric vaccine formularies, with implications on pediatric vaccine formulary design, pediatric vaccine pricing (particularly combination vaccines), and pediatric vaccine stockpiling to mitigate shortages. Jacobson’s research on the relationship between obesity, fuel consumption, and transportation established the first association between a public health problem and how the built environment may have unexpected, deleterious societal consequences, in this case, costing over a billion extra gallons of gasoline each year. =Outreach= Jacobson spearheaded the launch of three web sites which showcase data analytics applied to issues of broad interest. Election Analytics provides forecasts for the United States Presidential and Senate elections. Its model correctly predicted 49 out of 50 states in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. In 2016, while a Donald Trump victory was one of 21 scenarios forecast by the site, its \\"neutral\\" analysis gave Hillary Clinton a 99.2% chance to win on the morning of election day. BracketOdds provides an analytics perspective on March Madness, with appearances in national media coverage including the Chicago Tribune, NBCNews.com, Bleacher Report, and Men's Health. Driving Obesity provides a tool for individuals to compare their BMI to national averages based on their driving habits. Jacobson has written op-eds on issues related to airport security and screening that have appeared in The Washington Post, CNN Opinion, and Quartz. Awards and honors Jacobson is a Fellow of INFORMS, the IISE and American Association for the Advancement of Science. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2003. He is a two-time winner of the IISE Award for Technical Innovation in Industrial Engineering, in 2010 and again in 2013. His research video, \\"Aviation Security: Researching the Risk,\\" garnered WILL-TV an Award of Excellence for the \\"College or University\\" and \\"Video News Release\\" categories in the 2006 Communicator Awards. In 2013, Jacobson received the Media Relations Award for Communications & Marketing Excellence from the University of Illinois Office of Public Affairs for \\"showcasing how computer science and data analysis can be put to practical use in a way that the news media and general public understand.\\" In 2017, he was awarded the IISE David F. Baker Distinguished Research Award for his lifetime research contributions in the field of Industrial Engineering. In 2018, Jacobson was part of a team that was awarded the INFORMS Impact Prize for their research contributions to risk-based security in aviation security and its influence on TSA PreCheck.

The mission was led by Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, then-Governor of East Pakistan and commander of the East-Pakistani military, to work out a peace initiative to end the political crises in the East Pakistan to avoid international humiliation of Pakistan. The mission came in the wake of increasingly strained and difficult foreign relations between Pakistan and East Pakistan since the civil unrest had gripped East Pakistan as Awami League's demonstrations and demands for the provincial autonomy against Pakistan's central administration after the general elections held in 1970. Following the violent raids in Dhaka University by the East-Pakistani police supported by the military stationed in East, and ultimatum issued by India to intervene in the conflict, Pakistan had authorized Admiral Ahsan to carry out the investigations into a possible Indian intervention through a cable communication to work out a possible peace solution to end violence in East. The recommendations based on the studies were roughly based on six-point movement proposed by the Awami League in 1969 and called for: * Center would control the defence, military, foreign, national security, and the currency. * Province(s) would have the authority to raise revenue and would fund the subject of the federation. * Repatriation of Western Pakistanis citizens and bureaucrats to Pakistan with Eastern Pakistanis stationed back to East. * Equal divisions of national assets between Pakistan and East Pakistan based on population census. The Mission also called for Pakistan becoming a co- federation with Yahya Khan as President with Mujib being the Prime Minister of East while Bhutto being Prime Minister of Pakistan. Civil servants from Pakistan stationed in East would repatriated to Pakistan and the national assets would equally be divided between East and West Pakistan. The proposal was met with strong support from the international community and India fell in line though reluctant. The formula was supported by the political leaders of West Pakistan, with the exception of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and by the international community, including, reluctantly, India. However, the Mission was not supported by the military elements in the Yahya administration who debated acrimoniously over the scope of the mission's recommendations among the advisors in Yahya administration. By the fall of 1971, the mission's recommendations were bypassed with Admiral Ahsan submitting his resignation and posted back to Pakistan, followed by the resignation of Lieutenant-General Yaqub Ali Khan.

Founded in 1945 as the North Korea Democratic Women's League, it is the oldest and one of the most important mass organizations in the country. The Union has committees on every level of administrative divisions of North Korea, from ri (village) all the way up to provinces. Membership has been restricted to those women who are not members of any other mass organization. As a result, Union members are effectively composed of women who do not work outside of home. The Union nominally represents these women, but in reality it is used for the implementation of government policies. The Union has had an important role in achieving gender equality and increasing political participation of women in North Korea. In its early days after its foundation in 1945, the Union had well more than a million members, compared to its current membership of about 200,000 to 250,000. Its influence has been reduced since the economic reforms of the early 2000s. The post of the chairperson is usually conferred to the most powerful woman in North Korea. Previous chairpersons include Kim Sung-ae, the wife of the country's former leader Kim Il-sung. The current chair is Jang Chun-sil. The Union runs a publishing house that publishes a monthly magazine called Korean Woman. History The North Korean branch of the Union, the North Korea Democratic Women's League, was established on 18 November 1945 as part of an effort by the North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea to enroll as many people as possible as members of communist-controlled mass organizations in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. It was the first mass organization founded with a particular segment of the society in mind. Its initial task was to gather spontaneously formed regional women's organizations under its control. The Union held its first congress on 10 May 1946. At that time, it had 800,000 members in branches in 12 cities, 89 counties, and 616 townships. By the end of 1946, almost one in five women of the country were Union members as membership had rose to 1,030,000. At its inception, the Union worked to enact laws regarding equality of the sexes as well as to bring women into politics. When the North Korean local elections of 1946, first democratic elections in the country, approached, many men opposed women running for People's Committee. In response, Kim Il-sung enhanced the role of the Union. Some of the political goals of the Union had to do with supporting the communists rather than specifically focusing on women's issues. The Union platform consisted of supporting the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea and Kim Il-sung for leadership of the country, as well as opposing \\"fascism\\", \\"traitors\\", feudal customs and superstition. Nominally, the Union represented the whole Peninsula but in reality it had little connections with women in the south. By 1947, the Union had 1.5 million members. The vast majority of them, some 73 percent, were peasants while 5.3 percent were workers, 0.97 percent were intellectuals, and the remaining 20 percent included all others, such as housewives. The North and South branches became merged on 20 April 1951. Official North Korean histories date the origins of the present organization to either December 1926 or January 1951, although both of these accounts are disputed. More recently, the Union has succeeded in increasing the number of women in manufacturing jobs. The early 2000s economic reforms, which allowed people to pursue profits, weakened the ideological reach of the Union, whose membership of housewives were now busy in the marketplace. Despite this, it remains one of the most important mass organizations in the country. At the Union's Sixth Congress on 17–18 November 2016, the name was changed to the Socialist Women's Union of Korea. Organization Membership is reserved for those who are not members of the Workers' Party of Korea or any other mass organization, which is the case for women who do not work outside their home. This feature of the Union makes it unique worldwide. This practice was adopted in the 1960s. Early on, membership was reserved to women between the ages of 18 and 61. Nowadays, women between the ages of 31 and 60 are eligible for membership, although if a woman marries and becomes a housewife, she is eligible regardless of age. Lately, even retirees have been forced to participate in its activities. Officially, the Union represents women who are not members in any other mass organizations, but in reality it is used to pass on decisions made by the government of North Korea and for political mobilization. There is a committee affiliated with the Union for every administrative division of North Korea, all the way from ri (village) to province level. The Union has some 200,000–250,000 members. Under the Taean work system, there is a Union representative under the workplace Chief Secretary, who in turn is responsible to the workplace Party Committee. The Central Committee of the Union holds plenary sessions twice a year. The Union is a member of the popular front Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland. The Union runs a publishing house, Chosǒn Yǒsǒngsa, which, since September 1946, has published its organ Korean Woman. It started appearing regularly in 1947 and was published monthly until 1982 when publication became bimonthly. =Chairpersons= Pak Chong-ae, the first chairperson of the North Korean Central Committee of the Union The post of the chairperson of the Union has traditionally been conferred to the most powerful woman in North Korea. The first chairperson of the North Korean Central Committee of the Union was Pak Chong-ae. Its vice chairperson was Ahn Sin-ho. Under Pak, who served until 1965, the Union was not unlike women's organizations elsewhere in the world. It was only later that it attained totalitarian features. Pak was followed by Kim Ok-sun, wife of the former guerrilla Choe Kwang. When her husband was purged in 1969, Kim was also deposed. She was followed by Kim Sung-ae, the second wife of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung and former vice chairperson of the Union, in 1972. She gave the Union its current, totalitarian form. It is possible that she used her position to promote her sons Kim Pyong-il and Kim Yong-il to succeed Kim Il- sung, as opposed to Kim Jong-il from Kim Il-sung's first marriage. The Union lost much of its importance after Kim Jong-il managed to succeed his father, and Kim Sung-ae resigned her post on 25 April 1998. It was thought that Kim Jong-il would appoint his own wife, Ko Yong-hui, following the precedent of his father, but this did not happen. Kim Sung-ae was followed by Chon Yon-ok. The current chairperson is Jang Chun-sil. Jang's predecessor since October 2000, was Pak Sun-hui (who is the daughter of Pak Chong-ae). The current vice chairpersons are Hong Son-ok, Jong Myong-hui, and Wang Ok-hwan. The vice director is Pak Chang-suk.

As director of the Brazilian National Malaria Service, Maio Pinotti pioneered chloroquinized salt in Brazil during the early 1950s in order to eradicate malaria.  Biography  Mario Pinotti was born in Brotas, São Paulo state, in 1894 to Rafael Vitório Pinotti and Precilda Bossel Pinotti. Mario attended the pharmacy school at Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, and graduated in 1918 at the National College of Medicine (Faculdade Nacional de Medicina), at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. After graduation, Mario Pinotti was appointed as rural sanitary inspector of the National Department of Public Health in 1919. In 1922 he assumed as mayor of Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro. Back to the National Health Department, Pinotti worked in the campaign against yellow fever from 1928 to 1931. Mario Pinotti married Margarida Pinotti, and they had two children.  Pinotti's method  During the 1940s, there were four to six million malaria cases a year among 45 million Brazilians, with over half of cases occurring outside of the Amazon basin. The São Paulo State Antimalarial Service, the Special Public Health Service in the Amazon (SESP) and the National Malaria Service (SNM) were the three Brazilian organizations involved in malaria control. The SNM was created in 1941 and was run by Mario Pinotti starting in 1942. In 1956, Pinotti became the director of the newly created National Department for Rural Endemic Diseases, a department in the Ministry of Health that centralized public health activities against many endemic diseases including malaria, yellow fever and Chagas disease. In response to the 1955 WHO establishment of the Global Malaria Eradication Program, in 1957 Pinotti changed the National Malaria Service into the Malaria Eradication Campaign (CEM). Pinotti introduced the strategy of putting chloroquine into common cooking salt as a way of distributing the drug as a prophylactic on a wide scale. Using either chloroquine or pyrimethamine, Pinotti's medicated salt program proved effective, and became known as \\"Pinotti's method\\". After early 1950s trials, Pinotti's salt was widely distributed in Brazil, subsequently, it was employed in South America as well as parts of Africa and Asia. In the 1960s, the use of chloroquinized salt became to fade due to concern that targeted populations were unevenly protected. In Amazonas State, chloroquinized salt distribution was no longer required, but it was distributed until supplies ran out. Still, chloroquinized salt continued to be used in French Guiana (1967-1971), Guyana (1961-1965) and Suriname (1966-1972). Mario Pinotti died in Rio de Janeiro, on March 3, 1972, at the age of 78.

The plant also occurs in Russia, Mongolia, Korea and Japan.Quattrocchi, Umberto (2012). CRC World dictionary of medicinal and poisonous plants: common names, scientific names, eponyms, synonyms and etymology. Volume 5 R-Z. CRC Press Taylor and Francis Group, page 155. Harvesting Most of the plants harvested are collected in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Hebei. The tuberous rootstocks are harvested in early spring or late autumn (when the plants have yet to flower or have finished flowering) washed, trimmed of basal leaves and fibrous roots, sun-dried until they contain 20% moisture, shredded and then sun-dried again until completely desiccated and ready for storage. Phytochemistry The roots and seeds of Saposhnikovia divaricata contain a variety of phytochemicals under basic research, including furocoumarins, furanochromones, polyacetylenes, hyperosides and terpenes. The major components of the essential oil from roots of S. divaricata are caryophyllene oxide, sabinene, α- and β-pinene, myrtenal, myrtenol, α-terpineol, p-cymene and nonanoic acid.

The second library effort was a reading room that was organized in 1888. In 1892 voters in Mason City approved a tax levy to establish a free public library. It was housed at various locations on both South Federal Avenue and on East State Street. Through the efforts of U.S. Senator William B. Allison, local attorney James E. Blythe made a personal appeal to Andrew Carnegie and his secretary to build a new library building in Mason City. Because of his appeal the city was awarded a grant of $20,000 on April 11, 1902, which was $7,000 more than it would have normally received. with The Chicago architectural firm of Patton & Miller designed the two-story Neoclassical building. Construction was delayed because of a debate in the local community over the use of Bedford stone over local limestone. The architects wanted the Bedford stone because it could be worked to a smooth finish, while the native limestone could not. Other delays contributed the building being completed in December 1904 with a stone veneer of Bedford stone. Dedicated on January 10, 1905, it is considered the finest example of Neoclassical architecture in Mason City. By the late 1930s the Carnegie library had become too small. The city received a grant from the Public Works Administration (PWA) to expand the building. The MacNider family offered at Second and Pennsylvania for a new library. The city renegotiated with the PWA to use the grant for a new building. The Chicago architectural firm of Holabird & Root designed the new building, which was dedicated in January 1940. The Denison Room, which overlooks the garden and Willow Creek, and an adjacent patio was completed in 1961. The west wing was added for the Iowa State Library Extension Service in 1966.

Trained and supplied by Sweden, the brigade was created to help liberate Denmark. Ultimately it was only deployed on the day of the German surrender in the country and was involved in very little fighting.  Background  On 9 April 1940 Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and quickly surrendered. Most of the Danish Army followed the order to capitulate. Colonel Helge Bennike, the commander of the 4th Regiment based at Roskilde, believed that the order to surrender had been forced on the government by the Germans and that Sweden had also been attacked. Instead of surrendering, Bennike and his unit boarded the ferry in Elsinore to Sweden and went into exile. After the misunderstanding was later cleared up, most Danish soldiers stayed in Sweden while others returned to Denmark. Following the transit of German troops through Sweden, Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson pushed for the training and equipping of 7,500 Danish \\"police troops.\\" This was met with opposition in his cabinet, but a plan was eventually agreed upon in December 1943.  History  HDMS Havkatten of the Danish Flotilla in Copenhagen, May 1945 The Swedish government loaned 25 million kroner to the Danish legation to fund the training and arming of the Brigade. Enrollment was on a voluntary basis. The Danish soldiers from Roskilde formed the nucleus of the new force. Around 750 Jews who had escaped occupied Denmark enlisted. The Danish soldiers were equipped with Swedish Mauser m/96 long rifles and bayonets. The Danish Brigade arrives in Helsingør, 5 May 1945 In the fall of 1944 the Swedish Air Force oversaw the training of Danish pilots at Såtenäs, who were subsequently organized into a squadron equipped with Saab 17 bomber-reconnaissance aircraft. = The Danish Flotilla = The Danish Flotilla (Danish: Den Danske Flotille) was formed with ships of the Danish Royal Navy that had escaped to Sweden. = Liberation of Denmark = The Swedish government delayed the deployment of the Brigade to Denmark so as to not complicate the surrender of German forces there. Most of the German occupation force surrendered without incident to Allied troops on 5 May. However, three Danish soldiers were killed by snipers as they marched into Copenhagen.  Legacy  Most of the officers of the Brigade were influenced by the Swedish military doctrine (which was based on German strategy) they learned during their exile and carried their knowledge over into the restructured Danish Army following the war. On the anniversary of Operation Safari in 1947, veterans of the Brigade erected a monument to the three soldiers killed during liberation near the Provincial Archive of Zealand in Copenhagen.

He was boss of the Papalia crime family, one of three major crime families in Hamilton, the other two being the Musitano crime family and the Luppino crime family. Papalia was born in Hamilton, to Italian immigrants. At a young age, he was involved in petty crimes. By the 1950s, he moved his way up to drug trafficking, and formed a powerful alliance with the Buffalo crime family. Papalia also operated various gambling bars and vending machine businesses. By the 1960s and 1970s, he played a role in the French Connection smuggling operation. On May 31, 1997, Papalia was shot to death outside his vending machine business by Kenneth Murdock, a hit man hired by Angelo and Pat Musitano of the Musitano family. Early life and criminal activities Papalia was born on March 18, 1924 in Hamilton.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 291 His father, Antonio \\"Tony\\" Papalia, who had early Picciotteria values, was a bootlegger who immigrated to Canada from Delianuova, Calabria, Italy, in 1912, through New York City before moving on to Montreal, Quebec then New Brunswick in the coal mines, before finally settling on Railway Street in Hamilton, Ontario in 1917. His father became associated with Calabrian compatriot and notorious bootlegger Rocco Perri, and later Guelph mobster Tony Sylvestro, working as a bootlegger who operated speakeasies. He was suspected in playing a role in the murder of Perri's wife Bessie Starkman in 1930. Papalia's mother, Maria Rosa Italiano, also came from a Mafia family, the Italiano clan, who also participated in Perri's gang. Maria Rosa initially married Antonio's younger brother Giuseppe Papalia Jr., giving birth to two sons in Italy, however when Giuseppe died, she immigrated to Canada with her two sons in 1923 to marry Antonio. Johnny, the oldest brother to Frank, Rocco and Dominic Papalia, half-brothers Joseph and Angelo Papalia, brother-in-law Tony Pugliese, and associates, all worked in running his clubs and gambling operations. It is also believed Antonio and his son Johnny Papalia, along with Stefano Magaddino of the Buffalo crime family, played a role in Perri's disappearance in 1944 after Perri left members of his Mafia crew \\"slighted\\", though both cases remain unsolved. Papalia was involved in petty crimes from a young age. He was arrested in 1949, and sentenced to two years in prison at the Guelph Reformatory for possession of narcotics, down from conspiracy to distribute narcotics. When he was released in 1951, he moved to Montreal for a stint, where he worked with Luigi Greco and New York Bonanno crime family representative Carmine Galante in heroin trafficking. He later shifted to Toronto extorting brokers and running gambling clubs. By the mid-1950s, Papalia was called back to Ontario by Magaddino and inducted into the Canadian arm of the powerful Cosa Nostra family of Buffalo. In 1955, with assistance from Sylvestro, Papalia started opening charter gambling clubs in Hamilton and Toronto. Sylvestro's son-in-law Danny Gasbarrini, Papalia's brothers Frank, Rocco and Dominic, half-brothers Joseph and Angelo, brother-in-law Tony Pugliese, and associates Red LeBarre, Freddie Gabourie, Frank Marchildon and Jackie Weaver, all worked in running Papalia's clubs. After police raids, Papalia started working with James McDermott and Vincent Feeley in several clubs throughout southern Ontario. Extradition and sentencing By the late 1950s, Papalia was a made man in the Buffalo family, and boss of the Papalia family Ontario faction.Schneider p.292 The illegal gambling business in Toronto was very lucrative, dominated by Maxie Bluestein who kept the Mafia out of his pocket. Bluestein's Lakeview Club did more than $13 million a year, but on March 21, 1961, at the Town Tavern, Bluestein met with Papalia in Toronto. Bluestein refused to \\"merge\\" his operations with Papalia's and was beaten with brass knuckles, iron bars and fists as a result. The 100 some witnesses to the beating were reluctant to come forward, but Papalia was sentenced in June of that year to 18 months, while Bluestein kept hold to the Toronto gambling market; though Bluestein had paranoia and was committed to a mental institution in 1973 after he had killed a friend, before later dying of a heart attack in 1984.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 302 Later in 1961, Papalia demolished the family home and built a warehouse for his vending machine business, an all-cash business, to serve as the front for his criminal operations. By the early 1960s, he earned reputation from the French Connection, a smuggling operation that supplied over 80 percent of America's heroin market between the 1960s and 1970s—having strong connections with the Buffalo family. He worked in this operation with the Sicilian Agueci brothers Alberto and Vito, along with the vending machine businesses with Alberto, until he was brutally murdered by the Buffalo crime family in late 1961, and Vito jailed.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada On May 22, 1961, several people were indicted related to the French Connection from informants Salvatore Rinaldo and Matteo Palmeri; Papalia was extradited to the United States for trial on March 15, 1962 for his role in the smuggling ring; he was coughing up blood due to the tuberculosis he contracted as a child. On March 11, 1963, he was found guilty, and sentenced to 10 years despite his condition. Due to the indictment, Magaddino promoted Santo Scibetta to leader of the Buffalo family's Ontario branch, replacing Papalia. Schneider, 2017 p.173-178Edwards, p.137 Post-release On January 25, 1968, after serving less than half the sentence, he was released from a United States penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and sent back to Canada. While he was in jail, his father died on May 14, 1964, with his mother dying on July 27, 1970. Giacomo Luppino and Santo Scibetta also answered to Magaddino while Papalia was imprisoned. In 1974, Montreal mobsters Vincenzo Cotroni and Paolo Violi were over-heard on a police wiretap threatening to kill Papalia and demanding $150,000 after he used their names in the $300,000 extortion of Toronto business man Stanley Bader without notifying or cutting them in on the score. Bader testified against them, and the three were convicted of extortion in 1975 and sentenced to six years in prison. Violi and Cotroni got their sentences appealed to just six months, but Papalia's was rejected; he served four of the years.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 326 In 1982, after Bader had moved south to Miami, he was sprayed with bullets when answering his front door. Papalia has been linked with his death, as well as the 1983 death of Toronto mobster Paul Volpe, but no charges were laid.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 537 In January 1981, Papalia married Janetta Hayes in a private ceremony; they would separate in 1983. In July 1983, Réal Simard moved to Ontario from Montreal where he met with Papalia in Hamilton on behalf of Frank Cotroni. Simard seized the Ontario market, bringing Quebec strippers to Toronto clubs, where he allowed Papalia to put his pinball machines in his clubs. Papalia was known for his hatred of outlaw bikers and in the 1980s-1990s made it very clear that he did not want a Hells Angels chapter set up in Hamilton.Langton, Jerry Showdown: How the Outlaws, Hells Angels and Cops Fought for Control of the Streets. pp.82 Walter Stadnick, a Hamilton native and Hells Angels in charge of expanding the Angels into Ontario, was forced to keep a low profile in his hometown as long as Papalia lived.Langton, Jerry Showdown: How the Outlaws, Hells Angels and Cops Fought for Control of the Streets. pp.82 In the 1990s, Papalia lieutenant Enio \\"Pegleg\\" Mora borrowed $7.2 million from Montreal mob boss Vito Rizzuto, and gave the bulk of the money to Papalia to open an upscale restaurant and nightclub in Toronto. After the Rizzuto crime family were not re-paid, in September 1996, Mora was shot in the head four times at a Vaughan farm; Giacinto Arcuri was arrested and charged with Mora's murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Papalia's brother Frank, the former underboss of the family, died of natural causes in 2014 at the age of 83. Death Papalia was fatally shot in the head on May 31, 1997, at the age of 73 in the parking lot of 20 Railway Street outside his vending machine business, Galaxy Vending, in Hamilton. The hitman Kenneth Murdock claimed that he had been ordered to kill \\"Pops\\" by Angelo and Pat Musitano of the Musitano crime family who owed $250,000 to cover bookmaking debts to Papalia. Murdock also killed Papalia's right-hand man Carmen Barillaro two months later. In November 1998, Murdock pleaded guilty to three counts of second degree murder, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and named Pat and Angelo as the men who had ordered the murders; he was released on parole after serving 13 years. In February 2000, the brothers were sentenced to 10 years for conspiracy in the murder of Barillaro in a plea bargain arrangement. No conviction was obtained in relation to the murder of Papalia. In October 2006, the Musitano brothers were both released from prison. Amid controversy, Papalia was not given a full funeral mass by the Catholic Church due to his criminal history. He was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery, in a family plot, in Burlington, Ontario. Legacy Crime expert Jerry Langton called Papalia the most important Mafiosi in Ontario of his generation. Langton noted Papalia had a marked distaste for outlaw bikers, and in a sign of his power, Walter Stadnick, the former president of Hells Angels Canada, had trouble establishing the Angels in Ontario while Papalia was alive. Langton stated, \\"It’s hard for people to understand now just how powerful Johnny Pops was. He was basically the only Canadian Mafia figure who could sit at the table with the top guys in New York. He was part of the French connection; he ruled a big swath of Canada, particularly Southern Ontario, for a very long time. After the Mafia imploded in less than a year, there was no one to oppose the bikers and they came rushing in.\\" One police officer, Shawn Clarkson, of the Niagara Falls Police Department, stated: \\"There was nobody to stand up to the Hells Angels the way Barillaro or Papalia would have. Papalia, even though he was 73 when he died, he wouldn't have put up with that\\". Notes Further reading *Humphreys, Adrian. The Enforcer:Johnny Pops Papalia, A Life and Death in the Mafia.

The intent was to assemble a group of young dancers with appeal to a teen audience. Louis DaPron was the group's choreographer. The Jivin' Jacks and Jills first appeared in the 1942 musical What's Cookin'? and appeared in 14 movies altogether. Their high-energy style may be contrasted with the more precision-oriented approach of rival musical-film studio MGM. There were originally fourteen members in the group, all teenagers, among them future stars Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan. Other members included Roland Dupree, Bobby Scheerer, Dottie Babb, Dolores Mitchell, Jack McGee, Grace MacDonald, Jean McNab, Jane McNab, David Holt, and Corky Geil. Membership was fluid: at the time of Chip Off the Old Block (1944) there were twenty members: Scheerer and Harold Bell, Jerry Antes, Jack Coffey, Dante DiPaolo, Lowell McPeek, Lou Payetta, Pat Phelan, George Rowland, Jerry Singer, Ronald Stanton, Jean Davis, Dorothy Web, Shirley Mills, Peggy Brant, Elaine Campbell, Arlyne Gladden, Verda Jenkins, Irma Jeter, Lu Anne Jones, Iris Kirksey, Connie Roberts, and Barbara Strong (O'Connor and Ryan were by this time separately billed stars). Helene Stanley, then going under the name Dolores Diane, was at one time a member. Tommy Rall was at one time a member. In Private Buckaroo, the Jivin' Jacks and Jills performed a dance number to \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me)\\", which became one of the Andrews Sisters' biggest hits. In Mister Big the group performed \\"Rude, Crude, and Unattractive\\". This was the breakout film for group members Donald O'Conner and Peggy Ryan. Because of the rising popularity of O'Connor and Ryan, the movie was re-shot to include more dance scenes for the pair, was retitled (from School For Jive), and was distributed as an A movie. Although O'Connor was probably the group's weakest dancer at first, he went on to become a star. The group gave its name to the \\"Jivin' Jacks and Jills Hollywood Reunion\\", a reunion originally of Universal players (not just the dance team) later expanded to all Hollywood personalities, which was hosted for many years by Michael G. Fitzgerald in Studio City. Filmography The Jivin' Jacks and Jills' appeared in 14 films: *What's Cookin'?

History  The Night of the Bottle Fight involved a riot that occurred in opposition to Pedro I(then emperor of Brazil). In 1830, prior to the Night of the Bottle Fight, Líbero Badaró, a journalist was assassinated in Sao Paulo for denouncing Dom Pedro I's politics. The perpetrators were allied with the emperor's politicians. The assassination unleashed a wave of protests against Dom Pedro I's government. Opposition continued in February 1831, when Dom Pedro I travelled to Minas Gerais and was received with hostility by the locals. The conflict reached its climax on the night of February 13, when, during a party for the emperor’s reception organized by his Portuguese supporters, Brazilians attacked with stones and bottles. This involved a dispute between allies from the Portuguese party that favored the emperor, and liberals from the Brazilian party who opposed him.

She completed two postdoctoral fellowships, one at Carnegie Mellon University, under Brian MacWhinney, from 1993-1995, where she began research on spoken word production in children with and without language impairments and another at Emory University, under Michael Tomasello, from 1995-1997 where she focused on early syntactic development and overgeneralization in children’s sentence production. Career In 1997, Brooks joined the faculty of the College of Staten Island and in 1998 she joined the faculty at the Graduate Center, CUNY. Brooks serves as the Deputy Executive Officer of the PhD Program in Psychology (Area: Pedagogy), and she is Faculty Advisor of the Graduate Student Teaching Association of the American Psychological Association. Brooks maintains an active line of research where she publishes on language learning in typical and atypical child development and autism spectrum disorders. Research Brooks's dissertation work demonstrated that children between 5–10 years of age struggle to correctly apply universal quantifiers such as \\"all\\" and \\"each\\". Her research interests center around two broad areas (1) examining individual differences in language development and learning, and (2) research on pedagogy and effective learning. Brooks conducts research in first and second language learning. She uses a variety of methodologies including experiments, parent- child conversational analysis, and meta-analysis to explore developmental processes throughout the lifespan in language acquisition and pedagogy. Her contributions to the field of language development include studies on the acquisition of inflectional morphology, quantifiers and verb frames. Brooks has co-authored over 90 scientific papers and book chapters. She has also co- authored a textbook on Language Development, and co-edited the Encyclopedia of Language Development.

He is best known for creating a successful franchise restaurant in South Los Angeles in 2011, the first full-service restaurant in the area since the 1992 Los Angeles riots. His business model includes training in management, business and life skills for workers and youth in the local community. Webb won Black Enterprise Magazine's 2014 Annual Small Business Award for Franchise Company of the Year. Early life Karim grew up in Rowland Heights, California. Webb's father, Reggie Webb, was an executive at McDonald's. When Karim was 11, his father became a McDonald's franchisee in the Inland Empire of Southern California. The family business grew to 16 restaurants, where Karim worked with his two siblings. By the time Karim Webb was 28, he had been working in the restaurant business for 17 years. Webb attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. For a time, he did business in real estate. Karim is the father of 3. His daughter, Amira \\"Skye\\" Webb plays softball for Georgia Tech. Career Webb re-entered the restaurant business when he formed PCF Management (PCF stands for \\"positive cash flow\\"), along with his childhood friend and financial expert Edward Barnett. He decided to open a Buffalo Wild Wings franchise in California, where the brand was not well known yet. Because of the recession, bank financing was unavailable, but he was able to attract individuals to help invest what would eventually amount to $6 million for two restaurants. The first restaurant opened in Del Amo Fashion Plaza in the Torrance Mall in late 2009. When it proved to be successful, he started looking for another location in Los Angeles. Webb opened the second restaurant in South Los Angeles, in Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, which was hard hit by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 2011, when he opened the restaurant, the area was known for gang activity. Webb's Crenshaw Plaza restaurant became the first casual-dining franchise restaurant to open in South Los Angeles in 25 years. It won awards from Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW) corporate headquarters for year- over-year sales increases, and became the approved training store for other BWW locations to train their employees. It also outperformed all other BWWs, for year over year sale increases, in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, Webb acquired a third restaurant in Carson, California. Business model When opening the Crenshaw Plaza restaurant, Webb introduced original elements to adapt his business to the area with a strong gang presence. The hosts at the door, which are well connected to gang culture, check bags as guests enter and turn away people wearing the colors of the Crips and Bloods or gang signs. Patio windows facing the parking lot are blacked out to prevent anyone driving by seeing who is dining inside. When a local gang member hosted an after-wake party at the restaurant, Webb and his security called competing gangs in the neighborhood to tell them not to visit the restaurant that night. Webb provides opportunities for neighborhood youth in the guise of jobs, training and fresh starts. He hired most of the staff from the Los Angeles Urban League, which helps young minority Angelenos find education and employment. Community work Webb takes part in non-profit community programs such as the California Community Foundation's BLOOM (Building a Lifetime of Options and Opportunities for Men) program, which mentors 14-to-18-year-old African American males who are or have been on probation for nonviolent crimes. Webb gives Bloomers jobs, but also mentors those who get jobs with his business. It is a five-year initiative launched in 2012. In 2014, Webb announced a partnership between his restaurant and Dorsey High School's School of Business and Entrepreneurship (SBE). His 16-week program taught 29 Senior SBE students how to effectively run a restaurant from beginning to end. The final test was a fully functional pop-up restaurant, developed and operated by the students. Awards and recognition Webb won Black Enterprise magazine's 2014 Annual Small Business Award for Franchise Company of the Year. He was voted as the Vice-Chair/Board of Directors for the Greater Los Angeles African American Chamber of Commerce, was presented the Mentor of The Year Award by the Brotherhood Crusade for his work with BLOOM, and became the Chairman of the Los Angeles Southwest College Foundation.

She was the first female judge in the Republic of Ireland when she was appointed to the District Court in 1964. Background Kennedy was born in Dublin, to a notable legal family. She was the fourth child of solicitor Patrick J. Kennedy and his wife Delia. Her two brothers, John P. Kennedy and James Kennedy, were both solicitors, while John was also a District Justice and former Coroner for south Monaghan. Her father was a brother of the famous Wexford gaelic football duo, Sean and Gus O'Kennedy. Kennedy was brought up in Carrickmacross from 1918 and was educated in St Louis Convent. She trained as a nurse at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and practiced for 8 years from 1935, including service as an Army Nurse during the Emergency. Legal career Kennedy qualified as a solicitor in 1947, and practiced in her father's firm in Carrickmacross. In 1960, she was appointed Coroner for south Monaghan. She served as Coroner until she was appointed as the first female Justice to the District Court in 1964, when she was also appointed as Justice of the Metropolitan Children's Court. Her appearance in court was seen as something of a novelty at the time, and not just because she was female. She was also the first Justice to appear with their head uncovered and her court was crowded for days with people just attending to witness this. In 1967 she was appointed by the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley to chair a committee to carry out a survey and report on the reformatory and industrial school systems. The report, which was published in 1970, was considered ground-breaking in many areas and came to be known as the Kennedy Report. The Report made recommendations about a number of matters, including the Magdalene laundries, in relation to which they were not acted upon. The report recommended the closure of a number of reformatories, including the latterly infamous reformatory at Daingean, County Offaly. In April 1970, Kennedy was appointed by Taoiseach Jack Lynch as a member the Commission on the Status of Women.

The film features Sidharth Malhotra in a dual role opposite Jacqueline Fernandez, while Suniel Shetty plays the antagonist. A Gentleman was theatrically released in India on 25 August 2017. It received moderate reviews from critics, and failed to recoup its investment, grossing . Plot Gaurav Kapoor (Sidharth Malhotra), based in suburban Miami, plans to marry his colleague Kavya (Jacqueline Fernandez), who happens to be the woman of his dreams, but she prefers a man who is more adventurous and risk-loving. Running parallel to Gaurav's life, is the story of clandestine spy Rishi Purohit (Sidharth Malhotra), who is seen to have been trying to extract some crucial substance from the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. However, when a co-spy, Yakub (Darshan Kumaar), shoots down an innocent civilian, the dishonest move enrages Rishi. Nonetheless, he returns to Mumbai, where it is revealed that he works for Unit X, a spy organisation headed by Colonel Vijay Kumar Saxena (Suniel Shetty). Rishi explains to Col. Vijay that he can't continue with such routines, and that he wants to start life afresh. Col. Vijay asks him to perform one last job for him, and this involves spying on a minister who Col. Vijay claims to be corrupt and wants to blackmail, and copying data from his cellphone into a hard drive which is wanted by Col. Vijay. Rishi does save contents into the hard drive, but Col. Vijay, having decided that Rishi is useless, instructs Yakub through a text message to kill him. Rishi senses the suspicion, and fights off Yakub and the other spies. Yakub manages to shoot Rishi, destroying the hard drive, but Rishi escapes. Gaurav tries to hang out with Kavya on a date, and also meets her parents, who consider getting him married to Kavya. Meanwhile, he is ordered by his boss to visit Mumbai to close a business deal. Rewinding to Rishi's life, he is shown meeting a man named Gaurav Kapoor, who works in a cyber firm in Miami, and has important data about the minister's connections. When Gaurav is murdered by Yakub on account of being a liability, Rishi decides to adopt Gaurav's identity to successfully escape from Yakub after his last mission. This leads to his present-day life in 2017 as Gaurav in a Miami software company, thus implying that Gaurav is in fact Rishi himself, and that the events leading up to his new life took place five years earlier in 2012. After being unintentionally recorded in a viral video and recognised by the members of Unit X, Gaurav is soon attacked by Koko, an associate of Unit X's local contact Jignesh. He is forced to abduct and hide Koko in his car, which is noticed by his friend Dixit (Hussain Dalal), who tries to help him and unintentionally kills Koko in the struggle. Yakub and other Unit X agents track Gaurav down, and confront him, where he finally confesses, as Rishi, that he needed a life. He is knocked down unconscious, and soon finds himself handcuffed with Kavya who had stopped by his house. Gaurav uses his skills to escape with Kavya from the trouble, and ends up confessing to her that he is a retired covert operations specialist. Kavya berates him, but takes pity on him when she notices his bloody stab wound. The two make love. Later that night, the two find themselves under fire after Unit X agents, headed by Yakub, raid the motel they are hiding in. Rishi hatches a quick scheme to retrieve the data, since the hard drive is damaged, and convinces Yakub to work with him on their final mission. Rishi executes the heist with success, but security guards take notice and begin chasing Rishi. Yakub aborts the operation and abandons him. They meet at Rishi's house, where Rishi kills most of Yakub's henchmen with the help of Kavya. However, Rishi spares Yakub and two of his thugs and orders him to leave his house. Driving away in Rishi's car, Yakub realises that the hard drive Rishi gave is blank, and the car's trunk contains Koko's corpse. Dixit, working with Rishi, crashes into their car in a side collision, and police arriving on the scene discover the body. Yakub and his thugs are killed by the cops as they open fire. Col. Vijay visits Rishi's house to confront him, but is killed in an explosion planned by Rishi. This neutralises Unit X, and Rishi and Kavya soon leave the city with new identities of Hemant and Pooja Khanna. A mid-credits scene shows Dixit buying machine guns from a local gun store in Miami before putting on a hoodie and walking away.

He uses silent spaces, open tunings, natural reverb, and double picking. Buxton is a self-taught musician who began playing the guitar at age 21 and developed his trademark fingerpicking style. He currently lives in Seattle, Washington, with his wife, the artist and author L.A. Smith.  Early life and education  Buxton was born in 1958 in La Mesa California. His father was a businessman who negotiated the manufacture of aircraft components in Naples, Italy, and played the Hammond organ and accordion. His mother was a homemaker and church singer. The two provided a musical foundation and example of music as underpinning to a satisfying life. A 1969 family trip to Italy cemented an interest in the classical arts with a global perspective. Buxton attended Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. In 2004, his work for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was recognized with a Sappi Ideas That Matter award.  Career  = Composing & Performing Style = Buxton employs a tempo and volume dynamic in his compositions preferring to let the sound of notes and chords ring out in a contemplative space to achieve a greater dynamic range. Zone Music Reporter reviewer Bill Binkelman places Buxton at the top tier of guitarists, calling him \\"A rare, unique visionary on the acoustic guitar.\\" Damon Buxton is a Hannabach strings artist and has used their strings exclusively since 2006. = Forgiving Dreams and collaboration with William Ackerman = After initial success with a demo release, \\"Sketchbook One,\\" Buxton established a recording collaboration with William Ackerman, Grammy award-winning founder of Windham Hill Records, who produced his 2007 release, \\"Forgiving Dreams.\\" Of this recording, RJ Lannan of Zone Music Reporter wrote, \\"Like a writer who speaks volumes with a few words, Buxton's sparse style shouts to the rooftops that the musical voice you hear is one to be reckoned with.\\" Lannon later compared Buxton's talents to his mentor's, saying, \\"His talent is equal to Ackerman's on many levels.\\" = Recordings with Corin Nelsen = In 2010, Buxton began a separate collaboration with Corin Nelsen, house engineer and builder of the studio at Ackerman's Imaginary Road Studios. Nelsen designed an individual space to let Buxton record instruments with microphones placed close to the artist to deliver an experience much like the performer sitting in the room next to the listener as possible. Nelson continues to mix and master Buxton's releases. This collaboration produced six additional recordings that leverage this technique. = Many Miles Music = Buxton founded the record label Many Miles Music to distribute his own releases and produce compilation works of similar artists in the New Age genre.

The battle was fought by the Rautu railway station, taken by the Reds in late February and soon sieged by the Whites. After weeks of trench warfare, the Whites launched their decisive attack and finally smashed the Red defense on 5 April. The last two days of the Rautu battle were the one of the most fierce of all the Finnish Civil War battles. The battle is known of the massacre in the \\"Death Valley\\", where more than 400 fleeing Reds were killed by machine gun fire. Unlike any other Finnish Civil War battle, the number of Russian Bolshevik troops was remarkable. The Russian interest is explained by Rautu's location only 60 kilometers north of Saint Petersburg. The Bolsheviks were concerned that the Finnish Whites and their ally Germany would launch an attack against the city along the Rautu railway. The Whites in turn, were protecting their front on the western side of the Karelian Isthmus.  The units  = Whites = As the Reds took the Rautu station, it was held by only less than one hundred paramilitary White Guard members, led by the engineer Kyösti Kehvola. In few days, they were reinforced by a unit of 300 men and in early March the Rautu station was sieged by 500 Whites. They were now commanded by the Jäger captain Evert Ekman and since 8 March, as the Karelian Army arrived, by the rittmeister Georg Elfvengren. Before the final battle, the Whites were reinforced with a Jäger battalion commanded by the major Lennart Oesch. The final operation was completed with 2,000 Whites. Most of the reinforcements were composed of conscriptions. Some of them were very unreliable, as many proved to be Red supporters. These men were disarmed and moved to construction forces. = Reds = The Russian troops were under the command of the Bolshevik revolutionary M. V. Prigorovski, but the war plans were mostly made by the general K. M. Yeremeyev, head of the Saint Petersburg Military District. The Finnish Reds were first commanded by Johan A. Palmu from Vyborg, since 27 February by the infamous Red Guard leader Heikki Kaljunen, after his resignation in March by Oskar Rantala and for the last three weeks by Arvid Leinonen. Their units were composed of the railroad workers who had come to Rautu from other parts of Finland and the members of the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard. The total number of Russians was about 3,000 but only 1,500 were present in Rautu at the same time. Russian troops included Red Army soldiers and paramilitary volunteers. As the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed between the Soviet Russia and the German Empire, most of the Russian troops withdrew on 12 March. Only two weeks later, the Bolshevik strengthened the units against the treaty. Finally, there was about 1,200 Russias and 700 Finnish Reds, as well as hundreds of their family members who were supporting the combat forces. Fallen Reds in the \\"Death Valley\\"  The battles  The Reds launched their campaign against the Rautu Station on 21 February as a part of their nationwide offensive. The final goal in Karelia was to reach the major railroad junction of Antrea (now Kamennogorsk, Vyborgsky District). The Rautu offensive was stopped after just two days and the force of 1,000 Reds decided to pull back to the railway station. In few days, they were surrounded by the Whites from three directions. Only the way to Saint Petersburg was now open. Both sides still completed some minor attacks, but since the early days of March, the battle turned into a trench warfare. The Saint Petersburg – Hiitola railroad as well as the Rautu Station were still uncompleted, so the Reds had a plenty of material, such as logs and bricks, to build a strong defensive line around the station. The strengthened Whites started their offensive against Rautu on 25 March, but were hit back as well as on 30–31 March. Two days later, the Whites cut the railroad towards Saint Petersburg and derailed an armoured train with a cargo of ammunition, machine guns and artillery pieces. The decisive attack was launched in 4 April, now with 2,000 men. The Reds were soon running out of ammunition and food supplies. In the morning of 5 April at 7:30 am, the Reds broke through the siege line on the southwest side of the station. The Red column headed south towards the Russian border, but was soon caught in a crossfire of White machine guns in the nearby valley. Some of the Reds managed to escape but the machine gun fire killed more than 400 Reds including a large number of women and children. The Bolshevik commander Prigorovski, as well as several wounded Reds, killed themselves in order to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy. 800–900 Finnish Reds and Russian Bolsheviks were still taken as prisoners, including more than one hundred children. The valley was soon nicknamed the ″Death Valley″ (Kuolemanlaakso) and in few years the name was even put on the map. After the victory in Rautu, the Whites were now able to concentrate their troops against Vyborg, the Red capital of Eastern Finland.  Casualties and aftermath  The Whites lost overall 270 men in Rautu, most of them were killed in the last two days of the battle. According to some sources, the White lost 400 men. The number of Red casualties is not known exactly. 860 were buried in a mass grave in the Death Valley, but according to the White commander Lennart Oesch they buried up to 1,200 Reds. Their bodies were picked from the nearby woods for several days. Some sources also claim that even hundreds of captured Russians were executed. Likewise, a few weeks later in Vyborg, the Whites conducted an ethnic cleansing in Rautu as they executed at least 13 Russian civilians of the Rautu Greek-Catholic parish. The executed held a Finnish citizenship and they were not affiliated with the Bolsheviks. 169 foreign citizens, most of them Russian and Polish military personnel, were captured and transported to a prison camp in Joensuu. 99 of them were executed on 14 April.

The park situated within the Clark Special Economic Zone. The leisure complex hosted the first meetings of the year-long 2016 APEC Summit from January to February 2016. By early December 2016, Fontana Casino was shut down due to lack of permit from PAGCOR, following the detaining of 1,316 Chinese nationals suspected to be working illegally at the site in November 24, 2015. Jack Lam, the chairman of the operating firm, Jimei Group reportedly fled to Hong Kong four days later. In December 8, 2016 President Rodrigo Duterte, lifted the arrest order he imposed on Lam after the latter expressed that he would settle his obligations to PAGCOR. Duterte said that \\"he takes pity of 6,000 plus Filipinos\\" who had jobs. Among the obligations reported is that Lam's firm is to pay 10% gaming revenue to PAGCOR. Previously Lam paid to the government-owned gaming firm only 1% gaming revenue under an \\"original contract\\". The resort ceased operations when the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic was imposed in March 2020. The whole complex was closed in May 2020 and placed under lockdown amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure came after authorities raided a makeshift COVID-19 hospital for Chinese nationals operating inside the site without the appropriate permits.

They had four of their children in England before boarding the ship, Elizabeth on route to Australia and New Zealand upon the glowing recommendation of Rev. John Tucker who also journeyed to New Zealand with the Edmonds family. Their fifth child was born in Hobart, Tasmania and the remainder of their children were born in the Northland Region of New Zealand. Edmonds would work as a catechist for the Church Missionary Society. He was a stone mason by trade, and helped build the wharf at Kerikeri in the late 1830s. He owned land at Kerikeri, where he built a stone house for his family, now known as the Edmonds Ruins. After Mary Anne's death, Edmonds would marry widow, Ellen Davies (née Hunter) with whom he had two children together. Children John Samuel's children were: =With Mary Ann= *Samuel John Edmonds, born 18 November 1823 in Yorkshire, England, died 1888 in Auckland, New Zealand. He married Louisa Makepeace in 1853 and had 11 children. He was involved in the publication of the first newspaper in New Zealand to be printed completely in Te Reo Maori, The Korimako. Samuel line currently are in possession of the family bible handed down to the eldest son as was tradition at the time. *Arthur Edmonds (also known as Aata Edmonds), born 21 September 1825 in Kent, England, died 1914 in Haruru Falls, Bay of Islands. He would first marry Erana Kaire in 1845, and then Ani Ngarepe. He had 8 children by his first wife and 6 by his second. He was disowned by his father for having married Maori women. *William Edmonds, born 7 February 1829 in Kent, England and died 1897 in Auckland, New Zealand. He married Emmeline Shearer in Auckland in 1856. *Henry Edmonds, born 4 December 1831 in Southborough, Kent, England and died in 1906 in Kerikeri, New Zealand. He married Anne Catherine Wilson Kemp in 1866 and had 9 children. *Alfred Samuel Edmonds, born 7 December 1833 in Hobart, Tasmania, and died 1898 in Tairua, Coromandel. He married Erana Te Onerere, by whom he had three children. He later married Sarah Anne Makepeace, a sister of his eldest brother Samuel's wife, Louisa, and had 3 more children. *John Tucker Edmonds, born 1835 and died in 1918 at Haruru Falls. He was named after the Rev. John Tucker. He married Raiha Pekama in 1857 and together they had 13 children. He did have a first marriage and had children to this wife but no information is known about her or those children. Like his older brother, Arthur, John was disowned by his father but for a different reason. When John Samuel listed his children in the family bible he omitted John Tucker Edmonds and would refer to him as \\"Edmonds by name but not by blood\\". It is speculated that Mary Ann and the Rev. John Tucker had an affair and as to not cause controversy within the Missionary community, John Samuel claimed John Tucker Edmonds as his own but only by name. *Rueben Edmonds, born 1836 in Kerikeri, New Zealand. *Joseph Edmonds born 1836 in Kerikeri, New Zealand and died in 1882. He married Felicia Tremain and then Annie Coyle. He had 3 children by Coyle. *Jane Elizabeth Edmonds, born 1837 in Kerikeri, New Zealand and died in Rhode Island. She married George Edward Budlong, an American whaler who had settled in the Bay of Islands in 1857. They had 6 children together. In 1870 she and two of her children travelled to New Bedford on board the Alice Cameron. *Sarah Gammon Edmonds, born 1839 in Kerikeri, New Zealand. She married Louis Goffe in 1857 and then Samuel Francis Prockter. She had 5 children by Louis Goffe. *Matilda Edmonds, born 1843, she married John Wright Hingston in 1864. They had 8 children. =With Ellen= *John George Petingale Edmonds *Mary Anne Edmonds =Errors in genealogy= Amateur genealogists tend to mix up many aspects of John Samuel's family tree from changing his mother's maiden name from Edmonds to Edmunds (his parents have a mutual ancestor), to mixing up his first wife Marianne's surname with Strickland (she is a Stickland) and with her niece's date of birth making her much younger than her husband, to added children that did not exist including Lucy, Rebecca and Robert George (to his second wife Ellen). These three individuals may have existed but may have been Ellen's children from her first marriage. Cookbook Edmonds It has been established that the descendants of John Samuel Edmonds and the descendants of Thomas Edmonds (creator of the Edmonds Cook Book) are not related.

Spurred by user-created hacked content on their previous games and the company's desire to encourage the hacker ethic, Id included dedicated modification tools into Quake, including the QuakeC programming language and a level editor. As a game that popularized online first-person shooter multiplayer, early games were team- and strategy-based and led to prominent mods like Team Fortress, whose developers were later hired by Valve to create a dedicated version for the company. Id's openness and modding tools led to a \\"Quake movie\\" community, which altered gameplay data to add camera angles in post-production, a practice that became known as machinima.  Background  Player modifications, or mods, change a game's art or gameplay to create alternative or entirely new games. From the age of Atari through the 1990s, video game developers were known vigilantly protect their intellectual property through copyrights, patents, and general secrecy. Id Software founders John Carmack and John Romero were instead excited when their Wolfenstein 3D was hacked to swap content into the game, and decided to help rather than hinder the hacker ethic of those who would modify their later games, including Doom and Quake. Doom added new graphical detail to its first- person shooter predecessors (wall textures, varied environments) and local, networked multiplayer, but in 1996, Quake too added better graphics in a fully 3D world but became known for its Internet-based, long-distance multiplayer. It popularized consumer graphics cards with its implementation of 3D rendering under OpenGL technology, and its dedicated developer tools encouraged users to create their own modifications, spawning a \\"healthy mod scene\\".http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/igns-top-10-fps-games-of-all- time Around the time of Quake release, these user modifications became known as just \\"mods\\".  Quake  Modding was made easy for Quake players, who could download level editors and the QuakeC programming language to make their own mods and content. The accessibility of QuakeC led to a new paradigm of mod creations.https://www.bluesnews.com/guide/mods.htm Most player creations were team-based games, as players appreciated their strategic and cooperative elements. Among the first successful mods were Capture the Flag and Team Fortress. The mod community and their websites, such as PlanetQuake Featured Mods, became a place for aspiring game programmers and artists to train. Valve recruited its first employees from the Quake modding community, as the Team Fortress team was invited to create its sequel for Valve's first game, Half- Life—itself built on modifications of the Quake II game engine. In 1997, a \\"total conversion\\" Quake mod named \\"Alien Quake\\" replaced characters, levels, and sounds with replacements from the Alien film franchise. Its developers received a takedown notice from 20th Century Fox, which they posted on their website. The producer's forceful response to a fan effort coined the term \\"Foxed\\". Id's choice to create and share an editor and scripting language with Quake spurred its modding community and led to unforeseen innovations, such as animated movies performed by players during gameplay. Rock, Paper, Shotgun referred to this time as the \\"Silver Age of FPS modding\\" for the modder attention to hyper-realistic and polished detail in creating game assets that bordered the production quality of AAA developers.https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/20/a-peoples-history- part-2-the-mod/ = Machinima = The art of using video games to create narrative videos rather than gameplay rose from the \\"Quake movie\\" community and became known as machinima. Players of Quake and Quake II created programs to alter the game's demo files, which contained records of the game's user input and events. The actors would control their characters live—creating the demo file—and editors would \\"re-cam\\" by revisiting the scene from a new point of view or swapping between pre-selected camera angles. The Quake tools created for these purposes led to dedicated machinima post-production utilities, such as David \\"CRT\\" Wright's Keygrip and Keygrip2. The rise of machinima was enabled by the choice of developers such as Id to release easily accessible code and tools to alter it. Even as more advanced tools were produced, players opted to their own homegrown tools and retain the \\"Quake movie\\"-style production as their own user-generated process.  Quake II  Among the most popular Quake II mods was Chaos Deathmatch by Chaotic Dream Group.http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/history-of-pc-game-mods Multiple shareware level editors were created for the game. A programmer frustrated with the game's QuakeEd level editor released his own version for free and was later offered a job by Id's John Carmack. Robert Duffy modified the game's editing tool into a package called QeRadiant.https://www.bluesnews.com/s/21022/on-gtkradiant Another example is Qoole. = Qoole = Qoole, short for Quake Object Oriented Level Editor, is a level editor for video games based on the Quake engine, and was developed by Lithium Software.

Since the Massachusetts Institute of Technology first published research on them in 1989, there have been more than 400 articles published about robot fish. According to these reports, approximately 40 different types of robot fish have been built, with 30 designs having only the capability to flip and drift in water. Most robot fish are designed to emulate living fish which use Body-caudal fin (BCF) propulsion. BCF robot fish can be divided into three categories: Single Joint (SJ), Multi-Joint (MJ), and smart material-based design. The most important parts of researching and developing robot fish are advancing their control and navigation, enabling them to 'communicate' with their environment, making it possible for them to travel along a particular path, and to respond to commands to make their 'fins' flap.  Design  The basic biomimetic robotic fish is made up of three parts: a streamlined head, a body, and a tail. * The head is often made of a rigid plastic material (i.e. fiberglass) and contains all control units including a wireless communication module, batteries, and a signal processor. * The body may be made of multiple jointed segments, which are connected by servomotors. Servomotors control the rotation angle of the joint. Some designs have pectoral fins fixed on both sides of the body to ensure stability in the water * An oscillating caudal (tail) fin connected with joints and driven by a motor provides motive power. =Design inspiration= Eel and fish locomotion Engineers often focus on functional design. For example, designers attempt to create robots with flexible bodies (like real fish) that can exhibit undulatory motion. This kind of body enables the robot fish to swim similar to the way live fish swim, which can adapt and process a complicated environment. The first robot fish (MIT's RoboTuna) was designed to mimic the structure and dynamic properties of a Tuna. In an attempt to gain thrust and maneuvering forces, robot fish control systems are capable of controlling the body and caudal fin, giving them a wave-like motion. In order to control and analyze robotic fish movement, researchers study the shape, dynamic model and lateral movements of the robotic tail. One of the many tail shapes found on robot fish is lunate, or crescent shaped. Some studies show this kind of tail shape increases swimming speeds and creates a high-efficiency robot fish. The posterior tail creates thrust force, making it one of the most important parts of the robot fish. Living fish have powerful muscles that can generate lateral movements for locomotion while the head remains in a relatively motionless state. Thus, researchers have focused on tail kinematics when developing robot fish motion. Slender-body theory is often used when studying robot fish locomotion. The mean rate of work of the lateral movements is equal to the sum of the mean rate of work available for producing the mean thrust and the rate of shedding of kinetic energy of lateral fluid motions. The mean thrust can be calculated entirely from the displacement and swimming speed at the trailing edge of the caudal fin. This simple formula is used when calculating the locomotion of both robot and living fish. Realistic Propulsion Systems can help improve autonomous maneuvering and exhibit a higher level of locomotion performance. A diverse option of fins can be used in the creation of robot fish to achieve this goal. By including pectoral fins, robot fish can perform force vectoring and perform complex swimming behaviors instead of forward swimming only. =Control= Multi-joint robotic fish The shapes and sizes of fins vary drastically in living fish, but they all help to accomplish a high level of propulsion through the water. In order for robot fish to achieve the same type of rapid and maneuverable propulsion, robot fish need multiple control surfaces. The propulsive performance is related to the position, mobility, and hydrodynamic characteristics of the control surfaces. The key to controlling a multi-joint robotic fish is creating a simplified mechanism that is able to generate a reasonable amount of control. Designers should consider some important factors, including lateral body motions, kinematic data and anatomical data. When designers mimic a BCF-type robot fish, the link-based body wave of the robot fish must provide motions similar to that of a living fish. This kind of body wave-based swimming control should be discrete and parameterized for a specific swimming gait. Ensuring swimming stability gait can be difficult, and transitioning smoothly between two different gaits can be tricky in robot fish. A central neural system known as a \\"Central Pattern Generator\\" (CPGs) can govern multilink robotic fish locomotion. The CPG is located in every segment, and can connect and stimulate contracting or stretching muscles. The cerebrum, the most anterior part of the brain in vertebrates, can control signal inputs to startup, stop and turn. After the systems form a steady locomotion, the signal from the cerebrum stops and the CPGs can produce and modulate locomotion patterns. Similar to their role in living fish, neural networks are used to control robot fish. There are several key points in the design of bionic neural networks. First, the bionic propeller adopts one servomotor to drive a joint while the fish has two group muscles in each joint. Designers can implement one CPG in each segment to control the corresponding joint. Second, a discrete computational model stimulates the continuous biological tissues. Finally, the connection lag time between neurons determines the intersegmental phase lag. The lag time function in the computational model is necessary.  Uses  =Studying fish behavior= Achieving a consistent response is a challenge in animal behavioral studies when live stimuli are used as independent variables. To overcome this challenge, robots can be used as consistent stimuli for testing hypotheses while avoiding large animal training and use. The controllable machines can be made to \\"look, sound, or even smell\\" like animals. We can obtain a better perception of animal behavior by turning to robot use in place of live animals because robots can produce a steady response in a set of repeatable actions. Moreover, with various field deployments and a greater degree of independence, robots hold the promise of assisting behavioral studies in the wild. =Toys= A simple robot fish consisting of a flexible visco-elastic body Toy robot fish are the most common robot toys on the market. they are most commonly used for entertainment, although some are used for research. The design of these toys are simple and inexpensive. They are usually divided into two categories: automatic cruise robot fish and controlled movement robot fish. The simplest ones consist of a soft body (MJ), motor (tail) and head (basic electric control element). They use a battery to provide energy for the motor to produce movement and use the remote control systems to achieve the power of steering. In contrast, the complexity of toys and robot fish, with the purpose of research, is almost the same. They are not only fully automated, but can simulate fish behavior. For example, if you put a foreign object in the water with the robot fish, it will produced a movement similar to that of a real fish. It will move away from the foreign object and the speed of swimming will increase. It exhibits a state of shock and confusion to the foreign object much like a real fish would. Robot fish record this type of behavior in advance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31E8ywyUCrw =Application on AUV= Military defense and marine protection are of rising concern in the research field. As missions become more complicated, high- performance Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) become necessary. AUVs require fast propulsion and multidirectional maneuverability. Robotic fish are more competent than current AUVs propelled by motion because the fish is a paradigm of bio-inspired AUV. Like living fish, robot fish can operate in complex environments. They can not only perform underwater exploration and discover new species, but they can also salvage and set up underwater facilities. When operating in dangerous environments, robot fish display a heightened performance when compared to other machines. For example, in the coral zone, soft robotic fish can better cope with the environment. Unlike existing AUVs which are non-flexible, robot fish can access narrow caves and tunnels. =Education= Besides their vast potentials for research, robotic fish also show many opportunities to engage students and the general public. Bio-inspired robots are valuable and effective, and can attract students to various areas of science, technology, engineering and math. Robotic fish have been used as auxiliary educational tools all over the world. For example, thousands of youth were attracted to the carp-like robots during a recent exhibit at London Aquarium. Scientists and other researchers have presented various kinds of robotic fish at many outreach programs, including the first and second USA Science and Engineering Festivals, in 2010 and 2012, respectively. At these events, visitors were given the opportunity not only to see the robotic fish in action, but also interacted with the lab members to understand the technology and its applications.  Examples  \\"Charlie\\", a robotic catfish built by the CIA * In the 1990s, the CIA's Office of Advanced Technologies built a robotic catfish named \\"Charlie\\" as part of a study of the feasibility of unmanned underwater vehicles. The robot was designed to collect underwater intelligence and water samples while remaining undetected, and was controlled by a line-of-sight wireless radio handset. * The RoboTuna is a robotic fish with the shape and function of the real tuna fish, which was designed and built by a team of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It has a complicated system of stainless-steel cables and pulleys which act as muscles and tendons. The outer body is composed of a flexible layer of foam covered with Lycra, an elastic polyurethane fiber, to emulate the flexibility and smoothness of tuna skin. It is controlled by six powerful servomotors at two horse-power each. It can adjust its motions in real-time because of force sensors positioned on the side of the ribs which provide continuous feedback to the robot.http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N49/robotuna.49n.html * Robot Pike is the world's first free-swimming robot fish designed and built by a team of scientists at MIT. It is controlled by human intervention. The complex computer system interprets the commands and returns the signals to each engine in the robot fish. It has a skin composed of silicone rubber and a spring- wound fiberglass exoskeleton which makes the robot fish flexible. It can accelerate at a rate of eight to twelve m/s in the water, but it cannot avoid obstructions because it is not equipped with sensors.http://www.robotic- fish.net/index.php?lang=en&id;=robots#top * The Essex Robotic Fish was built by scientists at Essex University. It can swim autonomously like a real fish, and achieve different types of displacement. It has four computers, five motors, and over ten sensors placed in various places on the body. It can swim around a tank and avoid objects, and can also adapt to uncertain and unpredictable stimuli in its environment. It is intended to have a broad range of uses, including seabed exploration, detection of leaks in oil pipelines, sea life exploration, and spying.http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240086124/University-of-Essex- robotic-fish-enter-IET-awards * The Jessiko is an underwater robot created by French start-up company Robotswim. It is only 22 cm long, making it one of the smallest robotic fish in the world. It is very easy to control, can travel backward, shift colors, and imitate living fish performance. Because of these functions, it can share emotions and even interact with people. It exhibits artificial intelligence and potential communication uses, giving it the ability to swim with more than ten fish to create exciting choreography and light effects, using fins to navigate throughout the water. It has demonstrated that a small robot fish can swim autonomously for hours.http://www.robotswim.com/index.php?id=jessiko&id2;=projet&lan;=en * The Robotic Fish SPC-03 was designed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). It can swim 1,23-meters away from the controlling source in the water. It is steady, particle in its design, and is controlled remotely by technicians. It can work 2 to 3 hours immersed at the maximum speed of 4 km/h. The fish can capture and transfer photos, perform cartography of the underwater funds, and transport small objects. * The Robotic Koi was designed and developed by Ryomei Engineering of Hiroshima, Japan. It is 80 centimeters and weighs 12 kg, and is remote controlled. The Robotic Koi can be used to study the oxygen concentration in the water through the sensors located on its mouth. It can gather information about the other species in its environment by swimming among them and reporting on the health of fish. Equipped with a camera, it can record the resources present in depths of the water. It could also be used to survey damage to bridges and oil platforms underwater.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3345303/Robot-koi-carp- designed-to-get-up-close-and-friendly-with-real-fish.html Robotic Fish: iSplash-II * In 2014, iSplash-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof. Huosheng Hu at Essex University. It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish, a fish that moves its head slightly but builds considerable amplitude of motion towards the tail, in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance. iSplash-II attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7 m/s). The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion, which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.

Early life Joanna Crookston was born in Old Kirk in Gladsmuir, East Lothian the daughter of Agnes Hogg and James Crookston.  Massacre of Tranent  The Scottish Militia Act of 1797 conscripted able bodied Scottish men between the ages of nineteen and twenty-three into military service. Aberdeen, Dalry, Galston, Strathaven, Freuchie, and Kirkintilloch all saw rioting as a result, and the government responded by sending in troops. In records compiled in 1844, a local historian noted the women of Scotland were outraged at the thought of their men being conscripted to fight in the army just as they had reached a manhood and acquired a profession. It fell to schoolmasters to make up the conscription lists, and as a result they were met with protests from local residents. When the army rode into Tranent on 28 August 1797 to pick up the conscriptees, they found the roads to be lined with women and children. One woman is said to have approached the entourage and said, \\"John, beware of your head!\\". This was taken to be a direct threat and to indicate there may be trouble in Tranent. Once in the village itself, the brigade tried to proceed to the assigned meeting point, but there was a crowd gathering with sticks and a drum. Crookston is recorded to have approached the leader and advised them to leave. Another source gives Crookstone a larger role in the events, saying she organised a protest march on the 28 August 1797 with other women from nearby villages, and used a drum beat to call out the slogan \\"no militia\\" in an attempt to intimidate local landowners and justices on the ballot committee. The ballot went ahead on the 29 August 1797. There was a protest, and soldiers who had been confined to the John Glens public house in Tranent broke out of the back door and adopted a \\"shoot to kill\\" policy against the populace, who were allegedly armed with sharp sticks and stones. The dragoons rampaged through the streets driving the protesters into the fields where the cavalry would be more effective. At least eleven people were killed, including Crookston. Her body lay in undiscovered in a field of corn for several weeks. However, the number of deaths in the massacre is disputed. The Lord Advocate of the time, Robert Dundas, decided not to indict the soldiers for shooting unarmed civilians because \\"such a dangerous mob as deserved more properly the name of an insurrection.\\"  Memorial  Crookston's role in the massacre of Tranent is commemorated by a statue in the civic square in Tranent.

It is sometimes known as Lighea, the name of the title character, which was the title chosen by the writer's widow. Background The novella was the last work the author completed before his death. Lampedusa, who conceived the story while staying with his cousins Casimiro and Lucio Piccolo di Calanovella, penned the work during the winter of 1956-1957. The novella is a result of the brief and late creative period of the author who, in a very short span (1956-1957), wrote a small number of stories and works of various kinds, including essays and the novel Il Gattopardo. The Professor and the Siren, just as the remainder of Lampedusa's work, was only published posthumously in 1961 by Feltrinelli, the same publishing house that, three years earlier, had had the intuition leading to the posthumous publication of the novel The Leopard, a choice crowned with success from the critics and the public that would internationally consecrate the author. The manuscript was delivered by Elena Croce (daughter of the philosopher Benedetto Croce) to Giorgio Bassani, who oversaw the publication and wrote the accompanying preface. Plot The narrative begins in 1938 in Turin and misty winter, where the encounter between two personalities different from each other, both Sicilians: the distinguished classicist Rosario La Ciura, an eminent retired professor of Ancient Greek and member of the Italian Senate, and the young Paolo Corbera di Salina, a Sicilian of noble birth who works as a journalist and chases skirts. Despite the cultural and generational gap, and the harshness of character of the professor, the meeting, which took place in a bar on Via Po, the young man can earn, without even knowing how, the professor's sympathy. The result is a mutual interest and a familiar partnership that leads gradually to open up the professor confidently to that young man and tell him of an episode far, during the preparation for the competition for the chair of greek at the University of Pavia. In those days, the risk of mad crazy after months of study, he was invited by a friend to move to a deserted huts on the coast of Sicily , at Augusta, where the magical encounter with a mermaid Lighea, the daughter of Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. Publication in English In 1962, translated by Archibald Colquhoun, it was published in Two Stories and a Memory, a collection of short works by Tomasi with a preface by E. M. Forster.

While conducting preliminary research to restore Film, filmmaker and restorationist Ross Lipman visited Grove Press founder and Film producer Barney Rosset at his apartment, where Lipman discovered reels of film and audio. This material contained outtakes from Beckett's 1965 production, including a prologue long-thought lost. Notfilm reconstructs this prologue and integrates rare audio of Beckett's voice, surreptitiously recorded by Rosset, in a self-described \\"Kino Essay\\" that analyzes the philosophical foundation of Film, arguing it was an expression of Samuel Beckett's own distaste for the public eye. Synopsis Both a traditional making-of documentary and an essayistic exploration into the philosophical implications of Samuel Beckett's Film, Notfilm outlines the circumstances leading to its production, the production process and its critical reception. Director Ross Lipman's narration outlines the philosophical foundation of Film as a rebuttal of the Irish philosopher George Berkeley’s premise that “to be is to be perceived.” Audio secretly recorded by Rosset at a production meeting leads into an examination of Beckett's own distaste for being filmed and photographed.

The site is known locally as Burgstall Schlüsselstein. The burgstall is freely accessible and is used as a viewing point.  Location  North side of the burgstall View of the outer section of ditch guarding the outer ward The spur castle is located in the western part of the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park on a rocky, southwest-facing hill spur of the Kreuzberg, jutting out into the Wiesent valley at a height of . It is about 1300 metres southeast of the parish church of Saint Nicholas in EbermannstadtTopographic map, 1:25,000 series, Sheet 6233 Ebermannstadt and about 12 kilometres northeast of the town of Forchheim. Near the site of Schlüsselstein Castle are several other castles: Dietrichstein to the south, the former Wolkenstein Castle to the southeast, a possible castle site to the north near the hamlet of Rothenbühl,Kunstmann 1990, pp. 88 ff a burgstall near the cemetery in Niederfellendorf,The burgstall on the website of the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection an element of a fortification from the early medieval period on the Hummerstein over GasseldorfFührer zu archäologischen Denkmälern in Deutschland, Vol. 20: Fränkische Schweiz, pp. 149 ff. and motte castles in the area of the sports field in EbermannstadtKunstmann 1990, pp. 94 ff and in Rüssenbach.Kunstmann 1990, pp. 99 ff Within line of sight of the levelled castle of Schlüsselstein lay Reifenberg Castle, on the site of which is the Vexier Chapel, the unresearched burgstall above Ebermannstadt on the opposite side of the valley;Kunstmann 1990, pp. 96 ff Feuerstein Castle and Schloss Greifenstein.  History  No documentary evidence exists about the former castle on the Schlüsselstein; archaeological investigations have yet to be undertaken. The hill now called the Kreuzberg was named after the cross on the summit of the spur, but was originally called the Schlüsselstein. In 1487, Bishop Henry III Groß of Trockau donated the Ebermannstadt forests around the Slusselstein which belonged to the Bishopric (the Ebermannstädtern Stiftshölzer). The castle is still called the Schlüsselstein in the land records or cadastre. Because of its name, Schlüsselstein, it may be assumed that the castle was founded by the noble family of Schlüsselberg, who named several of their foundations using the prefix Schlüssel, for example Schlüsselau Abbey, the town of Schlüsselfeld and the castle of Schlüsselburg at Markgröningen in Baden-Württemberg. However, the castle of Schlüsselstein was not mentioned in any Schlüsselberg family deeds or in the 1349 treaty of Iphofen, with which its possessions were divided among their victors after their violent extinction in 1347. The castle had probably been abandoned earlier, perhaps in favour of Neideck Castle. A further clue to a link with the lords of Schlüsselberg is the great similarity of the castle of Schlüsselstein with their main family seat of Schlüsselberg.Kunstmann 1990, pp. 98ff. According to its design, that is to say its division into a main ward and outer ward, it was probably built during the second half of the 12th century.Information panel at the burgstall The castle site is densely wooded up to the summit of the hill spur and, in places, heavily overgrown with bushes. It is accessible via a hiking trail and is used as a rest stop and viewing point above Ebermannstadt and the lower Wiesent valley. The remains of the walls of the old castle have only survived in the area of the outer neck ditch where they have been made as dry stone walls. An information board has been erected in the area of the inner ward. The historic monument is registered as a \\"medieval burgstall and probably prehistoric hill settlement\\", and bears monument number D-4-6233-0026.Burgstall Schlüsselberg on the website of the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection.  Description  Plan of the castle The former castle lay about 200 metres above the valley of the Wiesent on a 150-metre-long, southwest-oriented hill spur, which protrudes from plateau to the east. On its south side the spur falls steeply into a small side valley, the north side is protected by a steep descent into the Wiesent valley. The tip of the spur drops vertically for a few metres to the top of a steep slope. The east side, on the other hand, transitions almost on the level into the plateau, requiring a ditch to be built there. This section of dry moat was about 35 metres long and 13.5 metres wide. Its outer edge facing the plateau is 1.9 to 2.3 metres above the bottom of the ditch, its inner is considerably higher, about 2.7 to 3.8 metres above the bottom. The ditch, for which no spoil heap can be identified, runs in a shallow arc around the outer ward and ends on both sides at the edge of the plateau, the ends being slightly refused. In the northern part of the moat a 1.5-metre-long section of dry stone wall has survived. The area of the inner ward is approximately rectangular and is 48 metres long. The side along the moat is 35 metres long, but the opposite side is only about 28 metres long. On its northern side, it drops vertically for a few metres down a face that is rocky in places. A section of the old outer wall is still visible at the ditch, rising to a height of 0.6 metres. Access to the castle was probably where the trail to the summit of the spur is today; it crosses the outer section of ditch just before its southern end. There are no traces of former buildings on the flat terrain of the outer ward. A low wall is also recognisable by the inner ditch. The inner ward is separated from the outer by a curved transverse moat the ends of which are refused. It has a length of about 25 metres and a width of 7 metres and is still 1.7 metres deep. The plan of the main castle was in the shape of an elongated triangle with a length of about 50 metres. It was 20 metres wide at the base, but only 7 metres wide at the tip. Along the whole of the north side, the hillside drops vertically for a few metres; the southern side has a vertical rocky drop only near the tip of the spur. The site of the main castle is relatively flat, climbing gently to the highest point. There are no signs of any buildings.

He named his character the Unipiper when he moved to Portland. The Unipiper is an American performance artist whose work regularly combines unicycling with playing the (sometimes flaming) bagpipes. The Unipiper first found Internet fame in 2011 when a video of him performing The Imperial March went viral. The video featured The Unipiper wearing a Darth Vader mask, while riding a unicycle and playing the bagpipes, and was subsequently featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. His other mainstream media appearances have included America's Got Talent and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He has since branched out into performances referencing non-Star Wars fictional elements, including Game of Thrones, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Pokémon. His antics as Uncle Sam have attracted international attention.

He studied church music from 1952 at the Kirchenmusikschule in Hannover, percussion at the Musikhochschule Hannover, and composition with Heinrich Spitta. He continued his studies, conducting with Dean Dixon and Herbert von Karajan in Salzburg, composition with Bernd Alois Zimmermann in Cologne, Krzysztof Penderecki at the Folkwang-Hochschule in Essen, and Milko Kelemen and at the Robert Schumann Hochschule. He was the church musician of the Neanderkirche in Düsseldorf from 1961 to 1999. He also lectured there at both the Katechetisches Seminar and the Robert Schumann Hochschule from 1984. Blarr composed four oratorios about the life of Jesus, four symphonies, chamber music and works for organ.

In 2011, the Women's Global Network for Reproductive Rights (WGNRR) declared 28 September as an international day. The date was chosen to commemorate the passing of the Law of Free Birth passed by the Brazilian parliament in September 28, 1871. This law was a key legal reform intended to provide freedom for the children of enslaved people in Brazil at the time. The day's name was changed to International Safe Abortion Day in 2015; that year 83 activities were organised in 47 countries by national, regional and international NGOs and activists. 2016 was the biggest International Safe Abortion Day ever celebrated. In 2018, September 28 marked a mobilisation in Argentina against the cuts made to the Ministry of Health by the conservative government. These cuts had substantial impacts on women's welfare and access to abortions in the country.

Li Portenlaenger studied 3 D design (printmaking and painting) in 1974-1978 at the Bremen Art Academy (Hochschule fur Kunste Bremen). Subsequently, she has studied modern dance under Gerd Leon at the Fachschule Freier Moderner Tanz.She also studied lithographic printmaking at the RhoK Flemish Art Academy in Brussels under R. Broulim. In addition, she studied historical dance and Chinese body-focused art on her own and with private (for instance Chinese) teachers. The main body of her artistic work consists of lithographic art works. Since 1998 she is in charge of the Lithographic Workshop Eichstaett that is supported by the city. She regularly invites international artists as artists in residence, and has taken part as a speaker and guest artist in international congresses on lithography in Britain, Belgium, China, the Netherlands and other countries. Her work was particularly admired by colleagues in the P.R. China when she was in Tianjin. Li Portenlaenger has curated several art projects that were reviewed favorably by art critics in the press, for instance the project Hortus-Wunder- Wanderkammer. She also participated in a collective art project with a Canadian artist, a Belgium artist, and a poet that took up the artistic impulse of Alois Wuensche-Mitterecker, a sculptor and early creator of land art who had created the large Figurenfeld ensemble of sculptures placed in the lonely landscape of the Frankonian Jura Mountains near Eichstaett. This land art ensemble reminds people of the terrible Second World War unleashed by Nazi Germany. It is a warning against all wars. The project of the three artists and the poet, their art works and poems inspired by the Figurenfeld, were discussed in the South German press. Li Portenlaenger took part in lithographic projects and had group exhibitions and single exhibitions in many countries, including Austria, Italy, Belgium, the U.S., the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, China, Scotland; and of course Germany. In addition she has realized several art projects in public space, for instance in Eichstaett and in Bremen, Germany, and was invited to do performances in art museums, art galleries, and churches.

He played in a variety of bands during the 1960s, including Pretty Things. He was noted for his wild and eccentric behaviour, which garnered a lot of publicity for the group and influenced Keith Moon.  Biography  Viv Prince was born in Loughborough. His father, Harry Prince, played in a local jazz band. Viv's first instrument was guitar, but then he switched to drums. After leaving school, he worked briefly as a tax officer, playing with local jazz bands, including his father's, as a hobby. Viv Pince's first professional work as a musician was with the traditional jazz band Lennie Baldwin's Dauphin Street Six in 1961, with whom he toured in Denmark and made his first recordings in 1962. He left them during a tour in Germany to join the Jazz Cardinals. Without a work permit, he soon had to return to London, to make a name for himself as a session musician, contributing to many pop records of the era. He joined Carter-Lewis and the Southerners in June 1963, with whom he recorded three singles, including the hit \\"Your Momma's Out of Town\\", alongside Jimmy Page. Around this time he became the first British rock musician against whom a drug-related charge was brought up in the court. As a skilled professional with an extrovert, unorthodox drumming style and considerable entertainment value, Viv Prince was repeatedly approached by the young British rock bands - such as the Kinks - to become their drummer. In 1964 he was persuaded by Pretty Things management to join the band, thus completing its first most iconic and legendary lineup, and played the drums on their first two albums, The Pretty Things and Get the Picture?, both released in 1965. The Pretty Things often made the headlines for their wild antics, which were due in no small part to Prince. Often inebriated or high on amphetamines, he would leave his drum stool to roam around the stage, and generally cause havoc wherever he went. A young Keith Moon attended several Pretty Things concerts to study Prince's style* (according to Jimmy Page, Prince was also the one to coin the nickname \\"Moon the Loon\\" for Keith - with whom, as well as with Brian Jones, Dave Davies, John Entwistle, P.J. Proby and the Beatles he was on friendly terms). The mayhem culminated in a tour of New Zealand in August 1965, during which he paraded around in a leopard-skin pillbox hat, carrying around a dead crayfish on a string,Stax, Neil & Baker, pp. 39–40 plotting pranks and setting fires onstage, which resulted in big amount of bad publicity. Following an altercation with the crew, he was thrown off the plane that was taking the band home after the tour and had to make his own way back to England. Over time, he would miss recording sessions more and more often, and the band had to call upon other drummers to replace him, including Bobby Graham, Mitch Mitchell and Twink. His tenure with the Pretty Things ended in mid-November 1965, when the band sacked him due to his growing unreliability. He was replaced by Skip Alan.Stax, Neill & Baker, pp. 94–97 After leaving the Pretty Things, Prince played with the Bunch of Fives and the Denny Laine String Band. He also deputised on drums during concerts for the Honeycombs, the Who, and Hawkwind, and was considered to become a drummer for the Jeff Beck Group. For some time he ran the Knuckles club in Soho, London, that, as he claimed, served as the first rehearsal base for Jimi Hendrix in England; Prince also claimed to suggest the musicians to complete the lineup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. During the second half of the 1960s, he contributed to LPs by Chris Barber (at the session led by Paul McCartney), Twink and McGough & McGear (also joined by Jimi Hendrix), as well as released a few singles as a member of the bands such as VAMP (with Pete Sears and members of Hutchinson Clark), Kate, and a solo single, Light of the Charge Brigade. Viv Prince was also reported to be involved in the election campaign activity for Screaming Lord Sutch's Monster Raving Looney Party, as well as to be expelled from the members of Hell's Angels for bad behaviour. He also underwent a few trial cases and a survived a fire in his house. During the 1980s, Prince returned to Loughborough for a while, playing with local soul band Sugar Shack. As of 2005, he was living near Faro, Portugal.Stax, Neill & Baker, pp. 110–112 The Pretty Things wrote and recorded \\"Vivian Prince,\\" a song in hommage to him, on their album ...

After a few years he recovered up to a point, and lived for another ten years, actively involved in the business. Nevertheless, from 1874 it was the son who was taking the lead role in running the business. During the final decades of the nineteenth century Duncker & Humblot, like many German publishing firms, grew strongly, focusing in subjects such as law and social sciences, and becoming one of the empire's leading academic publishers. In 1872 Carl Geibel was a founder member of the \\"Social Policy Society\\" (\\" Verein für Sozialpolitik\\").

Early life and career Marjory was born in London, to Walter Richard Warren (a barrister) and his wife, Annie (born Dixon). She was the eldest of five daughters. Her younger sister, Enid, became a notable social worker. When she was a child the family from Finchley to Highgate in London Marjory attended the North London Collegiate School, like all of her sisters, before studying medicine at the Royal Free Hospital, London. She initially trained in surgery, qualifying with an LRCP MRCS in 1923. After her residency at the Isleworth Infirmary from 1926–1935, she took over the workhouse next door and formed the West Middlesex County Hospital. The following year she conducted an audit of the hundreds of patients in the wards, finding a cohort of delirious and demented patients who required beds with cot sides, severely incontinent patients, another cohort of were elderly and sick but eminently treatable, incontinent patients, and patients who were mobile throughout the day. During this time she developed a system of classification for these patients, including those who were suitable for rehabilitation and thus able to go home, and those who would require residential care (what we now refer to as nursing homes), and had particular success in rehabilitating stroke patients. Geriatric medicine as a new specialty In 1943 and 1946, Warren published two papers in the British Medical Journal. Warren argued for the creation of the specialty of geriatric medicine, specialist units in general hospitals, and medical education focusing on the care of elderly people by doctors with experience in the field. On the basis of these seminal papers, the Ministry of Health became involved in this emerging field, and in the 1950s, geriatric medicine was recognised as a medical speciality by the National Health Service (NHS). In 1947, she co-founded the Medical Society for the Care of the Elderly with others including Joseph Harold Sheldon, Trevor Howell in Croydon and Oxford's Lionel Cosin. In time, this would become the British Geriatrics Society. Warren as founding chair, worked with committee president Basil Mackenzie, 2nd Baron Amulree. Mackenzie was then employed by the Ministry of Health. Warren promoted the importance of multidisciplinary team care, early mobilisation and active engagement of the older person in their daily activities, and the whole-person approach which included a patient's social and functional issues in addition to their medical issues. Warren and her colleagues were the first to suggest that all admissions to nursing homes and care facilities be approved following assessment on geriatric units (now standard) and advocated for the need to deal with the complex needs of the chronically ill or infirm older person with an integrated system. While this did not occur in her lifetime (approvals for residential homes were assigned to local government instead), it is now standard of care in the UK and Australia. Warren herself said . . . the needs of the elderly frequently fall between the two bodies – the individual being not sick enough to justify admission to hospital and yet too disabled or frail for a vacancy in a home.St. John, Philip D. and Hogan, David B., The Relevance of Marjory Warren’s Writings Today, The Gerontologist. 2014 Feb;54(1):21-9 Warren published goals for the healthcare of the elderly patient, which form the foundation of the principles of geriatric medicine; '* To prevent disease whenever possible; * To reduce medical disability to a minimum; * To obtain and maintain maximum independence; * To teach the patient to adjust himself intelligently to his residual disability'Warren M. W. (1951a). Geriatrics. In Tidy Sir Henry, Short A. Rendle (Eds.), The medical annual (pp. 108–112). Bristol: John Wright & Sons. Her commitment to patient care was not without conflict. Many of her colleagues did not understand the value of providing care for the largely neglected group of patients, and as a woman, with no further medical qualifications, she often struggled to get her views across. Geriatricians were referred to as members of “a second-rate specialty, looking after third rate patients in fourth-rate facilities” and were met with resistance from general physicians. However, as the ageing population increased, and the prospect that the current model of care would overwhelm government resources, the care of the elderly patient and subsequently those who had developed knowledge in their care, became of increasing interest at the NHS. This was a paradigm shift in the management of these patients who had previously been left to languish.John Grimley Evans, ‘Warren, Marjory Winsome (1897–1960)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2010 accessed 9/12/2016 As a result, Warren garnered an international reputation and received invitations around the world to lecture in the field. She served as the International Secretary of the International Association of Gerontology. Warren was remembered as an energetic and enthusiastic doctor who held her colleagues to high standards. She was highly active in many fields including nursing and nursing education, and worked as an examiner for the General Nursing Council, and was a member of the London Association of the Medical Women's Federation, becoming its president before her death. Death Plaque in West Middlesex University Hospital Warren died in hospital (Maizières-lès-Metz), France on 5 September 1960 following a car accident. She was on her way to a conference in Germany at the time. A memorial service held on 1 October 1960 at St Pancras Church, London after being cremated in Strasbourg.

Bombings  On 21 May 2000, a Christian congregation at Machilipatnam was bombed. On 28 May 2000, bombs exploded in churches at Medak and Vikarabad. On 8 June 2000, two bombs exploded at the St Annes Church in Wadi. The church was damaged and two persons were injured. On 9 June 2000, a bomb exploded in the St. Andrews church in Vasco, Goa. On 8 July 2000, two churches bombed in Andhra Pradesh, Gewett Memorial Baptist Church in Ongole and the Mother Vannini Catholic Church in Tadepalligudem town. The blast in the Ongole church injured three persons. On 8 July 2000, a blast took place at the St Johns Lutheran Church in Hubbali. On 9 July 2000, an bomb exploded at the St Peter Paul Church in Bengaluru. On 9 July 2000, a bomb went off accidentally while the terrorists were transporting them in a Maruti van.  Aftermath  Deendar Anjuman was banned in May 2001 for engineering the serial bomb blasts, and carrying out a hate campaign against the Christian community. The group's founder Siddique is reported to have hated Christians after the British colonial government in 1934 jailed Siddiqui and 18 of his followers for indulging in inflammatory speeches and writings. In October 2007 the ban was extended and the group declared an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for \\"indulging in activities which are pre-judicial to the security of the country having the potential to disturb peace and communal harmony and to disrupt the secular fabric of the country\\". In 2008, Capital punishment was awarded to 11 people and life sentence to 12 others by a local court. The prime accused in the case, Zia-ul-Hassan was the son of Syed Siddique Hussain, the founder of Deendar Anjuman. Zia-ul-Hassan had migrated to Pakistan and used to visit Hyderabad during his father's death anniversary. The accused believed that \\"blasts at churches in India would trigger a civil war between Hindus and Christians, and a religious leader from Afghanistan would invade and conquer India, which would be converted into an Islamic country\\". The serial blasts were carried out by activists of Deendar Channabasaveshwara Anjuman, founded in the 1920s. The conspiracy was hatched in October 1999 in Hyderabad, during the death anniversary of its founder Hajrath Moulana Siddiqui.

Later, it was adopted by the teams of other sports.  Origin  Gianluigi Buffon in 2016, wearing the scudetto won with Juventus F.C. the season prior.

In his youth, D'Annunzio was a keen follower of football and in 1887 he bought in London a leather ball from the same manufacturer that supplied the Football League and would play football with his friends on the beach of his native Pescara. In 1920, the former Austro-Hungarian city of Fiume (now the Croatian Rijeka) was annexed to Italy, D'Annunzio proposed that the local football team acknowledge supporting the Italian sovereignty over the city with a tricolored shield on its jerseys of green, white and red. In 1924, the Italian Football Federation approved the decision to honour the defending champion allowing them to wear the scudetto on their jerseys. Since then, the scudetto has become the symbol of the defending champions of every sports league in Italy.
