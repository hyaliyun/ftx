Based on John Jay Osborn Jr.'s 1971 novel The Paper Chase, it tells the story of James Hart, a first-year law student at Harvard Law School, his experiences with Professor Charles Kingsfield, a brilliant and demanding contract law instructor, and Hart's relationship with Kingsfield's daughter. Houseman earned an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the professor. Houseman later reprised the role in a TV series of the same name that lasted four seasons (following Hart, played by James Stephens, through his three years of law school). Plot James Hart (Timothy Bottoms) starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. (John Houseman), Hart is unaware that he was to read an assigned case for the first class. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students: * Franklin Ford (Graham Beckel), the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School * Kevin Brooks (James Naughton), a married man with a photographic memory, but lacking in analytical skills * Thomas Anderson (Edward Herrmann) * Willis Bell (Craig Richard Nelson), an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law * O'Connor (Robert Lydiard) While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields (Lindsay Wagner), to walk her home, as she says she feels uncomfortable about a man who has been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a complicated relationship: she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times. Hart categorizes his classmates into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \\"upper echelon\\". As time goes on, he moves from the second classification to the third. Late one night, Hart and another student break into a secured room of the library and read personal notes Kingsfield had written as a law student. The mounting pressure, as the course nears its end, gets to everyone. When Hart gives Kingsfield a flippant answer, the professor gives him a dime and tells him, \\"Call your mother. Tell her there is serious doubt about your becoming a lawyer.\\" Hart calls Kingsfield a \\"son of a bitch\\" and starts to walk out. Surprisingly, Kingsfield agrees with his assessment and invites him to sit back down, which he does. Brooks attempts suicide and drops out of school. The study group is torn apart by personal bickering. With final exams looming, Hart and Ford hole up in a hotel room for three days and prepare feverishly. The film is a faithful adaptation of the novel, although it adds two elements not in the book: Hart's first name and middle initial (James T.), and his grade in contract law (93, an A). In both the novel and the film, Hart makes a paper airplane out of the unopened letter containing his grades and sends it sailing into the ocean. Cast and characters =Main cast= * Timothy Bottoms as James T. Hart * Lindsay Wagner as Susan Fields * John Houseman as Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. * Graham Beckel as Franklin Ford III * James Naughton as Kevin Brooks * Edward Herrmann as Thomas Craig Anderson * Craig Richard Nelson as Willis 'Liberty' Bell * Bob Lydiard as O'Connor * Lenny Baker as William Moss, Tutor * David Clennon as Toombs * Regina Baff as Asheley Brooks * Blair Brown as Miss Farranti =Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr.= There are several possible inspirations for the character. Retired Harvard Law professor Clark Byse is said to have been the inspiration for the character's position at Harvard Law School, though not the character's personality. According to John Houseman,TV Guide, August 9, 1986 the inspiration for Kingsfield was crusty professor Edward \\"Bull\\" Warren, also reflected in The Boston Globe in 2004. Houseman had noted that Kingsfield's behavior is actually a toned-down version of Warren's famous classroom rudeness, as enshrined in classroom lore, and recounted several examples of the professor's putdowns. James Bridges originally earmarked James Mason for the Kingsfield role, but he was unavailable. After attempts to cast Melvyn Douglas, Edward G. Robinson, John Gielgud, Paul Scofield, and other famous actors in the role, Bridges offered it to Houseman, who agreed to fly to Toronto (where the film's interior sequences were to be shot) for a screen test. Bridges called it \\"fabulous\\", and Houseman accepted the part, thus launching his acting career. He had seldom acted before, but knew Bridges from the time he was a stage manager in Houseman's UCLA Professional Theater Group. Houseman then recommended Bridges as a writer for the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, for which Bridges wrote 18 teleplays before establishing himself as a motion picture writer- director.Houseman, John, Unfinished Business: Memoirs 1902-1988, New York, Applause Theatre Books, 1989, p. 459-460. Production The exterior shots of the Harvard Law School buildings were filmed on the Harvard Law School campus, and the library shots were filmed in the Harvard Andover library at the Harvard Divinity School. All interiors were shot on stages in Toronto. In a 1999 interview, Gordon Willis said production designer George Jenkins \\"reproduced the Harvard Law School in The Paper Chase beautifully.\\" The hotel scene was filmed at the Windsor Arms Hotel. The scene of Hart and Ford entering a building to take their final exam near the film's end was shot in front of the Law School's oldest building, iconic Austin Hall. Most of the extras for the Harvard Law School venue scenes were then current Harvard Law students, paid a $25 per diem by 20th Century Fox. Willis shot The Paper Chase in anamorphic format due to the \\"schoolroom and the graphics in the film.\\" He also commented on the cinematography, noting that the composition of the scenes with Houseman and Bottoms \\"related to who had command of the situation. We used huge close-ups of John, and demeaning shots of Timothy. Then as the movie goes along and Timothy begins to get on top of it, you'll notice the shot sizes begin to diminish on John and begin to get a little bit bigger on Timothy--until finally they are equal partners shooting back and forth.\\" Reception Vincent Canby wrote the film \\"goes slowly soft like a waxwork on a hot day, losing the shape and substance that at the beginning have rightfully engaged our attention;\\" he concludes \\"it takes a long while for The Paper Chase to disintegrate, and there are some funny, intelligent sequences along the way, but by the end it has melted into a blob of clichés.\\" Jay Cocks called it a movie of \\"some incidental pleasures and insights and a great deal of silliness:\\" > What [writer/director] Bridges catches best is the peculiar tension of the > classroom, the cool terror that can be instilled by an academic skilled in > psychological warfare. His Ivy League Olympian is Kingsfield, a professor of > contract law who passes along scholarship with finely tempered disdain. In > an original bit of casting, Kingsfield is played by veteran theater and film > producer John Houseman. It is a forbidding, superb performance, catching not > only the coldness of such a man but the patrician crustiness that conceals > deep and raging contempt. The University of Chicago Law School called Houseman's rendition of the Socratic method \\"over-the-top\\", telling prospective students: > John Houseman may have won an Oscar for his impressive performance, but if > anyone ever did teach a law school class like his Professor Kingsfield, no > one at Chicago does today. Instead, our students discover quickly that the > Socratic Method is a tool and a good one that is used to engage a large > group of students in a discussion, while using probing questions to get at > the heart of the subject matter. The Socratic Method is not used at Chicago > to intimidate, nor to \\"break down\\" new law students, but instead for the > very reason Socrates developed it: to develop critical thinking skills in > students and enable them to approach the law as intellectuals. Others disagreed; another reviewer found it accurate: > This is really the only serious flick about law school life. It's brooding > and intense, perfectly capturing the dynamic between law professor and > student. The movie is worth watching just for actor John Houseman's academy > award-winning performance as Professor Kingsfield.

Awards and nominations Houseman was awarded Best Supporting Actor at the 46th Academy Awards and the same award from the National Board of Review. Bridges was nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. Donald O. Mitchell and Larry Jost received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound. The American Film Institute has placed the film at #91 on its 100 Years...100 Cheers list. Television series The film was followed by a television series that ran for one season on CBS (1978–79) and three seasons on Showtime (1983–1986).

It was also the parish church of Combe Down until the 1850s when the communities separated. It is a Grade II listed building. Background The structure is mostly mid-Victorian. Predominantly an example of Early English Gothic Revival, the structure has a steep pitched polychrome Welsh Slate roof and other aspects that clearly mark it from a distance as being a mid 19th Century construction. The main tower is surmounted by a gilded weather cock. Norman Church The village was owned by the Bath Abbey monks, hence the name Monkton Combe, and the first structure was considered to be an “ancient Norman” one. The parish minutes of 1757 give a glimpse of the small church structure having a chancel with at least two pews. “The church is a small structure, 50 feet in length and 16 feet in breadth, covered with tiles; at the west end in a little stone turret hangs two small bells. It is dedicated to St. Michael.” Regency Church “About the beginning of the 19th century, when this little old church, after long neglect, needed extensive repairs, the inhabitant instead of repairing it, pulled it down and out of its materials build a new church of about the same size, seating only 95 persons, but to their minds no doubt more comfortable. It was erected in 1814 and did not last long. The Rev. Francis Pocock, being appointed vicar of Monkton Combe in 1863, found this church in a dilapidated state, and … for the needs for the parish, and had the courage to undertake the entire rebuilding of the sacred edifice.” Revd Pocock went on to found Monkton Combe School in 1868. Victorian Church The tower contains an 8-bell carillon which was installed in the 1920s. Organ The church contains a two manual pipe organ by Henry Jones and Sons. Churchyard The churchyard contains the grave of Harry Patch, known as the \\"Last Fighting Tommy\\" and the last surviving British Army soldier to have fought in World War I. He died aged 111 and was buried there in July 2009, near the graves of several members of his family.

After a period of study in the École des Beaux-Arts at Lyon, France, Mauzan divided his life between Milan, Paris and Buenos Aires. Between the years 1920 and 1940, the period between the wars, he used forms and materials under the influence of the avant-garde cubists. He was also an illustrator of posters and postcards. During his career as a poster printer and designer, Mauzan designed over 2,000 posters, using a style marked by humor and brilliant colors for advertisement and events and over 1,000 postcard images. He made several important posters for the Italian film industry in Turin, and then went to work at Ricordi music publishing from 1912 to 1917. Later, from 1919 to 1923 he works in the Magical press (Giovanni Magagnoli). In 1924 in Milan he establishes with Morzenti his own publishing house, the Mauzan-Morzenti Agency. In 1926 he travels to Argentina and sets up the \\"Affiches Mauzan\\" (Mauzan Posters) publishing house where many of his greatest works were created and where he worked until 1932. Within those years, Gino Boccasile, one of his students in Milan, travels to Argentina at his insistence and sets up studio.

Avocet was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, on 17 September 1918, as a minesweeper with Lieutenant Christian Crone in command. Recommissioned on 8 September 1925 as a small seaplane tender, USS Avocet (AVP-4) was present during the Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December 1941. The ship survived the war, and was sold as a hulk on 6 December 1946.  Avocets role in the Attack on Pearl Harbor  At about 07:45 on Sunday, 7 December 1941, Avocet's security watch reported Japanese planes bombing the seaplane hangars at the south end of Ford Island and sounded general quarters. Her crew promptly brought up ammunition to her guns and the ship opened fire. The first shot from Avocets starboard 3 in (76.2 mm) gun scored a direct hit on a Nakajima B5N2 (\\"Kate\\") carrier attack plane that had just scored a torpedo hit on the battleship , moored nearby. The \\"Kate\\", from the aircraft carrier 's air group, caught fire, slanted down from the sky, and crashed on the grounds of the naval hospital, one of five such planes lost by Kaga that morning. Initially firing at torpedo planes, Avocets gunners shifted their fire to dive bombers attacking ships in the drydock area at the start of the forenoon watch. Then, sighting high altitude bombers overhead, they shifted their fire again. Soon afterwards five bombs splashed in a nearby berth, but none exploded. From her veritable ringside seat, Avocet then witnessed the sortie of the battleship , the only ship of her type to get underway during the attack. Seeing the dreadnought underway, after clearing her berth astern of the burning battleship , dive-bomber pilots from Kaga singled her out for destruction, 21 planes attacking her from all points of the compass. Avocets captain, Lieutenant William C. Jonson, Jr., marveled at the Japanese precision, writing later that he had never seen \\"a more perfectly executed attack.\\" Avocets gunners added to the barrage to cover the battleship's passage down the harbor. Although the ship ceased fire at 10:00, much work remained in the wake of the devastating surprise attack. She had expended 144 rounds of 3 in (76.2 mm) and 1,750 of .30 in (7.62 mm) ammunition in the battle against the attacking planes, and had suffered only two casualties: a box of ammunition coming up from the magazines had fallen on the foot of one man, and a piece of flying shrapnel had wounded another. Also during the course of the action, a sailor from the small seaplane tender , unable to return to his own ship, had reported on board for duty, and was immediately assigned a station on a .30 in (7.62 mm) machine gun. Oil from ruptured battleship fuel tanks had been set afire by fires on those ships, and the wind, from the northeast, was slowly pushing it toward Avocet's berth. Accordingly, the seaplane tender got underway at 10:45, and moored temporarily to the magazine island dock at 11:10, awaiting further orders which were not long in coming. At 11:15, she was ordered to help quell the fires still blazing on board California. She spent 20 minutes fighting fires on board the battleship with the submarine rescue ship , and was then directed to proceed elsewhere. Leaving California at 12:15, she reached the side of Nevada 25 minutes later, ordered to assist in beaching the battleship and fighting her fires. Mooring to Nevadas port bow at 12:40, Avocet went slowly ahead, pushing her aground at channel buoy no. 19, with fire hoses led out to her forward spaces and her signal bridge. For two hours, Avocet fought Nevadas fires, and succeeded in putting them out.

Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned MEZ by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned MEZ to Messina, South Africa). The airport's ICAO identifier is KMEZ.  Facilities and aircraft  Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport covers an area of 667 acres (270 ha) at an elevation of 1,080 feet (329 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 9/27 is 6,001 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m) and 17/35 is 5,000 by 75 feet (1,524 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending August 31, 2009, the airport had 31,000 aircraft operations, an average of 84 per day: 93% general aviation, 5% air taxi, and 2% military. At that time there were 43 aircraft based at this airport: 63% single-engine, 28% multi-engine, 7% jet, and 2% helicopter.  Allegations of CIA drug trafficking  A number of allegations have been made about the use of Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport as a CIA drop point in large scale cocaine trafficking, beginning in the latter part of the 1980s. Several local, state, and federal investigations have taken place in relation to these allegations. The topic has received some press coverage that has included allegations of awareness, participation and/or coverup involving prominent figures such as Bill Clinton and Saline County prosecutor Dan Harmon (who was convicted of numerous felonies including drug and racketeering charges in 1997). An investigation by the CIA's inspector general concluded that the CIA had no involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activities that may have occurred in Mena. The report said that the agency had conducted a training exercise at the airport in partnership with another Federal agency and that companies located at the airport had performed \\"routine aviation-related services on equipment owned by the CIA\\".

The word Ikkeri in Kannada means \\"Two Streets\\". Nayakas of Ikkeri Nandi mantap It was, from about 1560 to 1640 AD, the capital of the Nayakas of Keladi chiefs, afterwards removed to Bednur Nagara. Ikkeri continued, however to be the nominal capital, the Rajas were called by its name, and the coins were called Ikkeri Pagodas and Fanams, although, if fact, the mint was removed. Its walls were of great extent, forming three concentric enclosures. In the citadel was the palace, of mud and timber, adorned with carving and false gilding. The only vestige of its former greatness is the temple of Aghoreshvara a large and well proportioned stone-building. On the floor in front of the shrine are the effigies of three of the Keladi chiefs, doing obeisance, with the name inscribed above each. One of them, Huchcha (Supreme) Somasekhara, is represented as manacled and fettered. The distance between the central pillars was adopted as the standard measure for garden land. A rod of this length, equal to 18 feet 6 inches, was the space called daya allowed for one tree, and the shist was fixed on 1,000 such daya at various rates constructed in a mixed style with a unique conception. Aghoresvara temple The Aghoresvara temple above mentioned is a large structure, built of granite, in a uniquely mixed style that incorporates elements from Vijayanagara architecture, the Karnata Dravida style of the Later Chalukya dynasty and Hoysala Empire. The temple faces north and has lofty roof and ornamental doorways on the west, north and east, the north doorway being the best with two elephants at the sides. The Garbhagriha, which is built of huge stones, contains a gigantic pedestal occupying nearly three-fourths of the whole space and sculptured all round with 32 seated female figures called Shakti Peetha. In the Sukhanasi is a small translucent Nandi (bull) carved out of white spar. The temple has no navaranga doorway there are two niches, those to the right containing the figures of Ganesha and Subramanya and those to the left figures of Mahishasuramardini and Bhairava. There are intricate carvings on the stone walls of the temple. There are carvings & sculptures such as Temple Relief (sculpture consisting of shapes carved on a surface so as to stand out from the surrounding background), Erotica, Fingurine, Old Kannada Manuscript, Sculpted Elephant etc. At present it is maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. interior of aghoreshvara temple , ikkeri Gallery Aghoreshwara_temple_at_Ikkeri.jpgAghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri Yali_pillars1_in_Aghoreshwara_Temple_in_Ikkeri.jpgYali pillars in Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri File:Ikkeri temple Karnataka.jpgIkkeri temple Karnataka File:Aghoreshwara Temple at Ikkeri, Shimoga, Karnataka.jpgThe wide and beautiful Aghoreshwara Temple File:Profile of Aghoreshwara Temple in Ikkeri.jpgProfile of Aghoreshwara Temple References C.Hayavadana Rao, B.A., B.L., Fellow, University of Mysore, Editor, Mysore Gazetteer, 1930 Edition, Government Press, Bangalore.

Timeless mRNA and protein oscillate rhythmically with time as part of a transcription-translation negative feedback loop involving the period (per) gene and its protein. Discovery In 1994, timeless was discovered through forward genetic screening performed by Jeffery L. Price while working in the lab of Michael W. Young. This gene was found when they noticed an arrhythmic tim01 mutant via a P element screen. The tim01 mutation caused arrhythmic behavior, defined by the lack of ability to establish proper circadian rhythms. In 1995, the timeless gene was cloned by Amita Sehgal and partners in the lab of Michael W. Young. Unlike the Drosophila timeless gene, homologs have been discovered in other species that are non-essential for circadian rhythm. The discovery of timeless followed the discovery of the period mutants in 1971 through forward genetic screening, the cloning of per in 1984, and an experiment determining that per is circadian in 1990. This occurred during a period of rapid expansion in the field of chronobiology in the 1990s. Structure The length of the coding region of the Drosophila timeless gene is 4029 base pairs, from which a 1398 amino acid protein is transcribed. The gene starts at a consensus cap site upstream of a methionine codon. It contains 11 exons and 10 introns. In various Drosophila species, the timeless protein TIM contains more highly conserved functional domains and amino acid sequence than its counterpart, PER (protein encoded by per). CLD was the least conserved of these regions between D. virilis and D. melanogaster. These conserved parts include: the PER interaction domain, the nuclear localization signal (NLS), cytoplasmic localization domain (CLD), N-terminal end (non- functional), and C-terminal end. TIM is also known to have a basic region, which interacts with the PAS domain of the PER protein, and a central acidic region. There is also a region of unknown function near the N-terminus of the TIM protein that contains a 32 amino acid sequence that, when deleted, causes arrhythmic behavior in the fly. In various species of Drosophila, such as D. virilis and D. melanogaster, the initiating methionine for translation of the timeless gene into TIM is in different places, with the D. virilis start site downstream of the start site in D. melanogaster. Timeless homologs =Drosophila homolog= The timeless gene is an essential component of the molecular circadian clock in Drosophila. It acts as part of an autoregulatory feedback loop in conjunction with the period (per) gene product as noted in collaborative studies performed by the labs of Michael W. Young and Amita Sehgal. Further studies by the labs of Young, Sehgal, Charles Weitz, and Michael Rosbash indicated that timeless protein (TIM) and period protein (PER) form a heterodimer that exhibits circadian rhythms in wild type Drosophila. Researchers in Rosbash's lab also showed that tim mRNA levels and TIM protein levels have circadian rhythms that are similar to those of the period (per) mRNA and its product. Experiments done jointly by the Weitz, Young, and Sehgal labs using yeast 2-hybrid proved that TIM directly binds with PER. During the early evening, PER and TIM dimerize and accumulate. Late at night, the dimer travels into the nucleus to inhibit per and tim transcription. In 1996, the teams of Sehgal, Edery, and Young found that exposure to light leads to the degradation of TIM and subsequently PER. The PER/TIM heterodimer negatively regulates transcription of period (per) and timeless (tim) genes. Within this negative feedback loop, first the PER/TIM heterodimers form in the cytoplasm, accumulate, and then translocate to the nucleus. The complex then blocks the positive transcription factors clock (CLK) and cycle (CYC), thereby repressing the transcription of per. As part of the circadian clock, timeless is essential for entrainment to light-dark (LD) cycles. The typical period length of free-running Drosophila is 23.9 hours, requiring adaptations to the 24-hour environmental cycle. Adaptation first begins with exposure to light. This process leads to the rapid degradation of the TIM protein, allowing organisms to entrain at dawn to environmental cycles. Circadian clock of drosophila In light-dark cycles, TIM protein level decreases rapidly in late night/early morning, followed by the similar but more gradual changes in PER protein level. TIM degradation is independent of per and its protein, and releases PER from the PER/TIM complex. In some cell types, the photoreceptor protein cryptochrome (CRY) physically associates with TIM and helps regulate light- dependent degradation. CRY is activated by blue light, which binds to TIM and tags it for degradation. This ends the PER/TIM repression of the CLK/CYC- mediated transcription of per and tim genes, allowing per and tim mRNA to be produced to restart the cycle. This mechanism allows entrainment of flies to environmental light cues. When Drosophila receive light inputs in the early subjective night, light-induced TIM degradation causes a delay in TIM accumulation, which creates a phase delay. When light inputs are received in the late subjective night, a light pulse causes TIM degradation to occur earlier than under normal conditions, leading to a phase advance. In Drosophila, the negative regulator PER, from the PER/TIM complex, is eventually degraded by a casein kinase-mediated phosphorylation cycle, allowing fluctuations in gene expression according to environmental cues. These proteins mediate the oscillating expression of the transcription factor VRILLE (VRI), which is required for behavioral rhythmicity, per and tim expression, and accumulation of PDF (pigment-dispersing factor). =Gryllus bimaculatus (two-spotted cricket) homolog= Timeless does not appear to be essential for oscillation of the circadian clock for all insects. In wild type Gryllus bimaculatus, tim mRNA shows rhythmic expression in both LD and DD (dark-dark cycles) similar to that of per, peaking during the subjective night. When injected with tim double-stranded RNA (dstim), tim mRNA levels were significantly reduced and its circadian expression rhythm was eliminated. After the dstim treatment, however, adult crickets showed a clear locomotor rhythm in constant darkness, with a free-running period significantly shorter than that of control crickets injected with Discosoma sp. Red2 (DsRed2) dsRNA. These results suggest that in the cricket, tim plays some role in fine-tuning of the free-running period but may not be essential for oscillation of the circadian clock. = Mammalian homolog = In 1998, researchers identified a mouse homolog and a human homolog of the Drosophila timeless gene. The exact role of TIM in mammals is still unclear,. Recent work on the mammalian timeless (mTim) in mice has suggested that the gene may not play the same essential role in mammals as in Drosophila as an necessary function of the circadian clock. While Tim is expressed in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) which is thought to be the primary oscillator in humans, its transcription does not oscillate rhythmically in constant conditions, and the TIM protein remains in the nucleus. Circadian clock of mammals However, mTim is shown to be necessary for embryonic development in mice, indicating a different gene function than in Drosophila. This suggests a divergence between mammalian clocks and the Drosophila clock. Moreover, mammalian tim is more orthologous to the Tim-2 (Timeout) paralog of the Drosophila Timeless gene than the actual gene itself. Like tim-2, the mamallian orthologs has a C-terminal PARP1-binding (PAB) domain. The complex they from promotes homologous recombination DNA repair. The timeless protein is thought to directly connect the cell cycle with the circadian rhythm in mammals. In this model. referred to as a “direct coupling,” the two cycles share a key protein whose expression exhibits a circadian pattern.The essential role of Tim in Drosophila in creating circadian rhythm is accomplished by Cry in mammals. In mammals, Cry and Per transcription is activated by the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex, and repressed by the PER/CRY complex.  Humans  The human timeless protein (hTIM) has been shown to be required for the production of electrical oscillations output by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the major clock governing all tissue- specific circadian rhythms of the body. This protein also interacts with the products of major clock genes CLOCK, BMAL, PER1, PER2 and PER3. Sancar and colleagues investigated whether hTIM played a similar role to orthologs in C. elegans and other types of yeast, which are known to play important roles in the cell cycle. Their experiments suggested that hTIM plays an integral role in the G2/M and intra-S cell cycle checkpoints. With respect to the G2/M checkpoint, hTIM binds to the ATRIP subunit on ATR – a protein kinase sensitive to DNA damage. This binding between hTIM and ATR then leads to the phosphorylation of Chk1, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This process serves as an important control to stop the proliferation of cells with DNA damage prior to mitotic division. The role of hTIM in the intra-S checkpoint is less clear at the molecular level; however, down-regulation of hTIM leads to an increase in the rate of generation of replication forks – even in the presence of DNA damage and other regulatory responses.  Current research  The Timeless gene has also been found to influence the development of disease in humans. Downregulation of the timeless gene in human carcinoma cells leads to shortened telomeres, indicating its role in telomere length maintenance. Telomere-associated DNA damage also increases in timeless depleted cells, along with the delay of telomere replication. Swi1 is a timeless-related protein that is required for DNA replication in the telomere region. This association between timeless and telomeres is indicative of the gene's possible association with cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism substitution that results in the transformation of glutamine to arginine in the amino acid sequence in the human timeless gene shows no association with either morningness or eveningness tendencies in humans. This is consistent with other research, suggesting that htim is not important in the circadian rhythm of humans. Timeless is now frequently found to be overexpressed in many different tumor types. In a study that used Timeless-targeting siRNA oligos, followed by a whole-genome expression microarray as well as network analysis. Further testing of Timeless down-regulation on cell proliferation rates of a cervical and breast cancer cell line. It was found that elevated expression of Timeless was significantly associated with more advanced tumor stage and poorer breast cancer prognosis. Similarity in gene expression signatures has allowed for TIMELESS to be identified as Kinase Suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1)-like and a potential target required for cancer cell survival. TIMELESS overexpression represents a vulnerability in Ras-driven tumors that offers potential insight into novel and selective targets found in Ras-driven cancers, which can be leveraged to develop selective and more effective therapeutics.

He also had many other interests including astronomy, poetry and philosophy. Early life He was born to Parsi Zarathushtrian parents in Cambay, Gujarat, India, and was brought up in the Zarathushtrian religion. His interest since early boyhood in all the major religions of the world was not confined to a theoretical study. Deeply concerned with discovering through personal experience the Truth which is the Heart of Religion, he practised both the outer and the inner disciplines of several great religions. Education After his schooling at Royal College, Colombo, he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge where he read Natural Sciences and History. The scholarship was not allowed due to his lack of a birth certificate. Despite being taken as far as the House of Lords, no grant was given. Private sponsorship was eventually secured and he was able to commence his studies. During his final year at Cambridge he fell ill and was unable to complete his studies. Twenty six years later, after studying intensively for only ten weeks, he took the finals exam in history and was awarded his master's degree. Pianist From 1924 until 1932 he studied the piano with the world-renowned pianist Solomon, giving recitals in India and Britain. Again illness struck and he was unable to follow his chosen career as a concert pianist and piano teacher. The conductor Zubin Mehta was one of his early piano pupils. Philosophy He now devised his own system of physical education to promote health and self-expression through rhythmic movement and breathing and taught this method for fifteen years. People as diverse as C.B. Fry, the England cricket captain, and Douglas Kennedy, English Folk Dance and Song Society president, came to him for lessons. From early childhood Phiroz Mehta had a burning interest in religion and philosophy and he was closely involved with the Theosophical Society for many years. At the age of 16 he was running the Colombo branch. In 1956 his first major book, Early Indian Religious Thought, was published. It was not however until 1976, after extensive study, research and travel in India that he completed The Heart of Religion, a profound study of the essence common to all religious experience. During these years a frequent visitor to his south London home, Dilkusha, for advice on Eastern religions was Fritjof Capra, author of The Tao of Physics et alia. He subsequently published three more books, Zarathushtra (1985), Buddhahood (1988) and Holistic Consciousness (1989). Through his knowledge of current scientific thinking and his lifelong study of all the major religions (notably Christianity, Buddhism, Zarathushtrianism, Hinduism, and Qabalah) together with life experience in both India and Great Britain, Phiroz Mehta not only bridged the fields of science and religion but also linked the cultural heritage of the East and the West. During his lifetime he gave over three thousand lectures on religion and Indian culture to learned societies, university students, schools and conference centres in England, the Netherlands, Germany, India and at his London home, Dilkusha.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is a worldwide humanitarian aid organization that reaches 160 million people each year through its 192 member National Societies. It acts before, during and after disasters and health emergencies to meet the needs and improve the lives of vulnerable people. It does so with impartiality as to nationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, class and political opinions. The IFRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement along with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and 192 National Societies. The IFRC's strength lies in its volunteer network, community-based expertise and independence and neutrality. It works to improve humanitarian standards, as partners in development and in response to disasters. It persuades decision makers to act in the interests of vulnerable people. It works to enable healthy and safe communities, reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience and foster a culture of peace around the world. History =Founding= On 5 May 1919, following the First World War, representatives from the National Red Cross Societies of the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US) came together in Paris to establish the League of Red Cross Societies (LORCS) whose stated goal was \\"to strengthen and unite, for health activities, already-existing Red Cross Societies and to promote the creation of new Societies\\". The initiative was taken by Henry P. Davison, then chairman of the American Red Cross' “War Committee”, with the support of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States of America. Davison was assisted by the British general Sir David Henderson who became the first Director-General. This newly created federation of National Societies expanded the international mandate of the Red Cross Movement beyond the strict mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to include relief assistance in response to emergencies which were not caused by armed conflict. In addition to the coordination of relief operations caused by natural disasters and health emergencies, the league's mission was to assist National Societies in their founding and development, especially in peacetime. In addition to providing assistance to victims of epidemics, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods and hurricanes) and famines, two other activities were developed during the first years of the league. One main activity was to promote health by preventing illnesses and developing the training of nurses and volunteers. The other activity was to create the Junior Red Cross within the National Societies, which introduced children and students to the Red Cross with various educational courses and involved them in practical relief activities. The formation of the league, as an additional international Red Cross organization alongside the ICRC, was not without controversy. The ICRC had, to some extent, valid concerns about a possible rivalry between the two organizations. The foundation of the league was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the ICRC within the Movement and to gradually transfer tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution. As well, Davison did not want to include National Societies of the defeated powers, namely Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, which was contrary to the ICRC's principle of universality. Moreover, the league's beginnings were expeditious as it took 154 days between the approval of President Wilson and its incorporation. This hasty formation forced Davison to cut corners and leave unresolved issues such as a clear framework of the league's mandate, duties and funding. The coexistence concerns between the league and the ICRC were discussed during three consecutive International Conferences of the Red Cross (1921, 1923, 1926). The statutes adopted in 1928 at the XIIIth International Conference of the Red Cross in The Hague clarified and confirmed the roles of each entity.Haug, Hans (1993). Humanity for all: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. p. 57. In that same year, the \\"International Council\\" was founded to coordinate cooperation between the ICRC and the league, a task which was later taken over by the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. In 1920, the league's “General Council, originally composed of representatives of the victorious Allies”,Reid, Daphne & Gilbo, Patrick (1997). Beyond Conflict: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 1919–1994. p. 53. welcomed additional National Societies; 27 out of the 31 member societies were represented in 1920. In the following decade, the league admitted over 25 National Societies, including the Egyptian Red Crescent and the Red Lion and Sun of Iran.Haug, op. cit., pp. 633–644 Following the adoption of the Statutes of the International Red Cross in 1928 (revised in 1952 and 1986, amended in 1995 and 2006), the National Societies of the Nordic Red Cross (Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway) returned to the league after resigning three years earlier because of the discords within the Red Cross movement.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p.86 The Alliance of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union joined the league during the XVth International Conference in 1934. By the mid-1930s, the league became truly universal, with 58 registered National Societies.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., pp. 83–92 =Secretariat on the move= The league's headquarters, named the secretariat, was originally based in Geneva. The league moved its secretariat from Geneva to Paris in 1922 with a restrained budget and reduced staff. The need to move away from the ICRC to further develop the league's own identity was part of the decision-making. On September 5, 1939, days following the German troops invasion of Poland, the league personnel in Paris were moved to Geneva. The league believed it could ensure the continuity of its work from a neutral country such as Switzerland. To this day, the secretariat's offices have remained in Geneva, but it was only in 1959 that the secretariat moved into its current headquarters in Petit-Saconnex.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p. 194 =Missions begin= During the first years of the league, the work was essentially reactive and consisted mostly of recording information and statistics to be shared with the National Societies.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p.66 The league's first operational mission was to perform onsite observations of the conditions of the victims of a typhus epidemic in Poland,Haug, op. cit., p.353 and to develop and circulate information material to the surrounding countries to prevent the spread of similar epidemics diseases. The first large-scale relief action of the league came after the 1923 earthquake in Japan which killed about 200,000 people and left countless more injured and without shelter. For the first time, 35 National Red Cross Societies participated in a joint action of the ICRC and the league, for which the record sum of 277 million Swiss francs was donated.Haug, op. cit., p. 353 The league began issuing appeals in 1925 but appeals were not consistently issued for all disasters. During the 1920s and 1930s disaster relief remained a minor activity, behind public health, nursing and youth activities. The National Societies, with the league's assistance in the 1920s, were better prepared to deal with disaster relief and consequently less in need of external assistance.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p. 92 Additionally, the Great Depression caused economic insecurity worldwide, urging the league to dedicate more coverage to poverty programs. A stamp from Turkey to support the Red Crescent, 1938. The 1930s saw the growing use of the automobile, the development of road infrastructure and consequently the increase of traffic and casualties. The league became a leader in first aid prevention for road accidents, by establishing in 1932 a Permanent Committee on First Aid on Roads, with the collaboration of various motoring associations.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p. 102 As the world headed closer to another war, the activities of the league reduced considerably. Nonetheless, the collaboration between the league and the ICRC continued to grow. The league provided support to the ICRC in the late 1930s, notably during the Spanish Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese war, by issuing appeals and establishing distribution points of food and medical supplies for the civilians. The Joint Relief Commission, initiated by the ICRC in 1941, established the mandates of the league and the ICRC, ensuring their continuous support to the National Societies amid the intensifying war. This agreement also increased the National Societies' independence and allowed them to pursue their civilian relief activities without causing friction with the belligerent, occupied and neutral states. The Federation is honored at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 1963. From left to right: King Olav of Norway, ICRC President , and League Chairman John MacAulay. After a six-year hiatus, the board of governors held its first meeting in October 1945. The post-war period provided a new driving force to the league as it resumed its relations with the National Societies and provided relief to war-affected regions. Following disastrous weather conditions that afflicted parts the world between 1951 and 1954,Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., pp. 140, 166–167 the league's relief activities became more operational and were no longer entirely informational. During those years, the league issued numerous appeals and showed great efficiency in disaster relief operations. In the late 1950s, there was a marked increase in the number of recognized Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies due to decolonisation.Reid & Gilbo, op. cit., p.179 By the end of the 1960s, there were more than 100 societies around the world.Haug, op. cit., p.633-645 On December 10, 1963, the league and the ICRC jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1983, the League of Red Cross Societies was renamed to the \\"League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\\" to reflect the growing number of National Societies operating under the Red Crescent symbol. Three years later, the seven fundamental principles of the Movement, as adopted at the XXth International Conference of the Red Cross in 1965, were incorporated into the league's statutes. The name of the league was changed again during the General Assembly of 1991 to its current official designation the \\"International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\\" (IFRC). In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the Seville Agreement which further defined the responsibilities of both organisations within the Movement. Until the beginning of the 1990s all disaster relief operations were responded as one Federation in a multilateral form. Donor red cross national societies were used to provide support through the Federation Secretariat, with money and human resources to support the Federation in the response to disasters under the coordination and leadership of the Federation Secretariat. The focus at that time was of one team, with a common mission, common goals in support of a sister red cross or red crescent society affected by a disaster. Hurricane Mitch affected few countries in Central America in 1998. The disaster relief efforts could be considered one of the disaster response operations that change the course of multilateralism within the membership of the International Federation. Since then, bilateralism become the new norm, and the reduce number of red cross from wealthy countries responding to disasters and expanding to development work continuously grow during the 2000s, including the growing number of red crescent societies operating internationally. In 2004, the IFRC began its largest mission to date after the tsunami disaster in South Asia. More than 40 National Societies worked with more than 22,000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics. Guided by Strategy 2020 – the IFRC's collective plan of action to tackle the major humanitarian and development challenges of this decade – the IFRC is committed to saving lives and changing minds. Activities and responsibilities The IFRC coordinates between National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies throughout the world. The IFRC along with ICRC supports the foundation of new National Societies in countries where no official society exists. A National Society is admitted as a member to the IFRC only after it is recognized by the ICRC. The IFRC cooperates with the National Societies of the affected countries – called the Host National Society (HNS) – as well as the National Societies of other countries willing to offer assistance – called Partner National Societies (PNS). Among the 190 National Societies admitted to the General Assembly of the IFRC as full members or observers, about 25–30 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active are the American Red Cross, the British Red Cross, the German Red Cross, and the Red Cross Societies of Sweden and Norway. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of land mines and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines. The stated tasks of the IFRC can be summarized as follows: * to promote humanitarian principles and values * to support National Societies * to support projects where funds are available The Red Cross Red Crescent is the world's largest humanitarian network with: * Nearly 11.6 million volunteers * More than 473,000 paid staff * More than 165,000 local Red Cross and Red Crescent units/ branches * 19.4 million people having donated blood to National Society blood services worldwide * More than 11 million people trained in First Aid by National Societies * More than 106.5 million people reached by Long Term Services and Programme Development * More than 49.5 million reached in 2016 by disaster response and early recovering programming * A total income of more than 23.4 billion Swiss francs in 2016, with total expenditures being just over 23.1 billion Swiss francs Organization The IFRC has its secretariat in Geneva. It also has five regional offices and numerous country and multi-country cluster offices around the world. The secretary general is Jagan Chapagain (Nepal).IFRC: Who We Are: The Secretary General. The IFRC is governed by a governing board consisting of a president, four vice-presidents, the chairman of the finance commission and 20 National Society representatives. The highest body of the IFRC is the General Assembly which convenes every two years with delegates from all National Societies. Among other tasks, the General Assembly elects the president. The current president of the IFRC is Francesco Rocca, who also fulfills the role of president of the Italian Red Cross. =Presidents of the Federation= , the president of the IFRC is Francesco Rocca (Italian Red Cross). The vice presidents are Annemarie Huber-Hotz (Swiss Red Cross), Miguel Villarroel (Venezuela Red Cross), Abdoul Azize Diallo (Senegalese Red Cross Society), Kerem Kinik (Turkish Red Crescent), Chen Zhu (Red Cross Society of China). Former presidents (until 1977 titled \\"Chairman\\") have been: * 1919–1922: Henry Davison (American Red Cross) * 1922–1935: John Barton Payne (American Red Cross) * 1935–1938: Cary Travers Grayson (American Red Cross) * 1938–1944: Norman Davis (American Red Cross) * 1944–1945: Jean de Muralt (Swiss Red Cross) * 1945–1950: Basil O'Connor (American Red Cross) * 1950–1959: Emil Sandström (Swedish Red Cross) * 1959–1965: John MacAulay (Canadian Red Cross) * 1965–1977: José Barroso Chávez (Mexican Red Cross) * 1977–1981: Adetunji Adefarasin (Nigerian Red Cross Society) * 1981–1987: Enrique de la Mata (Spanish Red Cross) * 1987–1997: Mario Enrique Villarroel Lander (Venezuela Red Cross) * 1997–2001: Astrid Nøklebye Heiberg (Norwegian Red Cross) * 2001–2009: Don Juan Manuel Suárez Del Toro Rivero (Spanish Red Cross) * 2009–2017: Tadateru Konoe (Japanese Red Cross Society) * 2017–present: Francesco Rocca (Italian Red Cross) =Funding and financial matters= The IFRC is funded by statutory contributions from National Societies, the delivery of field services to programme partners, and voluntary contributions from donors such as governments, corporations and individuals. The criteria for the statutory contributions of each National Society are established by the Finance Commission and approved by the General Assembly. Additional funding, especially for unforeseen relief assistance missions, is raised by emergency appeals. From 2005 to 2015, the Chairman of the Finance Commission was Mr. Chrystold Chetty (Seychelles) and the Vice- Chair was Ms Kathryn Forbes (United States). From 2016, the Chairman is Mr. Abdulkader Husrieh. Ms Kathryn Forbes has been nominated the Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee whilst Mr. Chrystold Chetty has been elected as a member of the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Emblem, mottos, and mission statement The emblem of the IFRC is the combination of a red cross and a red crescent on a white background, surrounded by a red rectangular frame without any additional text. The red cross, the original symbol of the Movement, is on the left while the red crescent appears to the right. Per Humanitatem ad Pacem is the primary motto of the IFRC (Article 1 of the Constitution of the Federation). The mission statement of the IFRC, as formulated in its \\"Strategy 2010\\" document is to improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity. From 1999 to 2004, the common slogan for all activities of the International Movement was The Power of Humanity. In December 2003, the 28th International Conference in Geneva adopted the conference motto Protecting Human Dignity as the new slogan for the entire Movement. The official logo for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement published in April 2016 was described as the red cross and red crescent emblems placed together side by side, encircled by the words \\"INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT\\" in one or other of their official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish). It was described as for use when the ICRC, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies operate together for the purposes of a humanitarian emergency, or a theme or campaign of global concern. The seven Fundamental Principles that guide the work of the IFRC and its members are: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. Relationships within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement The International Red Cross Memorial in Solferino, Italy The IFRC has come into conflict with the ICRC at various times, first and foremost when the American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the league as \\"a real international Red Cross\\" after the First World War.Andre Durand, History of the International Committee of the Red Cross: From Sarajevo to Hiroshima, Geneva: ICRC, 1984, p. 147. Several agreements about the respective roles of the organizations helped to smooth relations, beginning with the agreement of 1928, the 1997 Seville Agreement and most recently the Supplementary Measures of 2005. The Seville Agreement gives the IFRC the lead in any emergency which does not take place as part of armed conflict (in which case the ICRC takes charge). Organizational discord has now largely subsided.David P. Forsythe: The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005, p. 37.

It was first published in the Summer 1946 edition of Gangrel. The editors of this magazine, J.B.Pick and Charles Neil, had asked a selection of writers to explain why they write.Smothered Under Journalism, p.320 The essay offers a type of mini-autobiography in which he writes of having first completed poems and tried his hand at short-stories, and carried on a continuous \\"story\\" about himself in his head, before finally becoming a full-fledged writer. It goes on to set out some important motives for writing.  Four motives for writing  Orwell lists \\"four great motives for writing\\" which he feels exist in every writer. He explains that all are present, but in different proportions, and also that these proportions vary from time to time. They are as follows; # Sheer egoism- Orwell argues that a writer writes from a \\"desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc.\\" He says that this is a motive the writer shares with scientists, artists, lawyers - \\"the whole top crust of humanity\\" - and that the great mass of humanity, not acutely selfish, after the age of about thirty abandons individual ambition. A minority remains however, determined 'to live their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class.' Serious writers are vainer than journalists, though \\"less interested in money\\". # Aesthetic enthusiasm- Orwell explains that the present in writing is the desire to make one's writing look and sound good, having \\"pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story.\\" He says that this motive is \\"very feeble in a lot of writers\\" but still present in all works of writing. # Historical impulse- He sums this up stating this motive is the \\"desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.\\" # Political purpose- Orwell writes that \\"no book is genuinely free from political bias\\", and further explains that this motive is used very commonly in all forms of writing in the broadest sense, citing a \\"desire to push the world in a certain direction\\" in every person. He concludes by saying that \\"the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.\\" In the essay, Orwell charts his own development towards a political writer. He cites the Spanish Civil War as the defining event that shaped the political slant of his writing: Orwell, who is considered to be a very political writer, says that by nature, he is \\"a person in whom the first three motives would outweigh the fourth\\", and that he \\"might have remained almost unaware of [his] political loyalties\\", - but that he had been \\"forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer\\" because his era was not a peaceful one. In the decade since 1936-37 his desire had been to \\"make political writing into an art\\". He concludes the essay explaining that \\"it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives and humbug generally.\\"  See also  *Bibliography of George Orwell References External links * *Full text at Project Gutenberg Australia *Full text at Orwell.ru 1946 essays Essays by George Orwell Works originally published in Gangrel (magazine) ","title":"Why I Write"},{"id":"9720636","text":"El Gran camarada is a 1938 Argentine film directed by Yago Blass.

Life Bertha of Savoy was a daughter of Count Otto I of Savoy (also called Eudes or Odo; c. 1023 – c. 1057/1060) and his wife Adelaide of Susa (c. 1014/1020 – 1091) from the Arduinici noble family. She thereby was the sister of Count Peter I of Savoy (d. 1078), Count Amadeus II of Savoy (d. 1080), and Adelaide (d. 1079), consort of the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden. =Marriage= Still during the lifetime of Emperor Henry III, Bertha at the age of four was betrothed to Henry III's son, Henry IV (aged five) on 25 December 1055 in Zürich.Robinson, Henry IV, p. 25 Bertha was raised in Germany thereafter. When she was fifteen, Bertha was crowned queen in Würzburg in June 1066 and married Henry on 13 July 1066 at the Königspfalz of Trebur.Robinson, Henry IV, pp. 60f. Although they had grown up together and Bertha was apparently a pretty young woman, the Saxon chronicler Bruno of Merseburg, an avowed opponent of Henry IV, reported on Henry's continual unfaithfulness: \\"He had two or three concubines at the same time, in addition [to his wife], yet he was not content. If he heard that someone had a young and pretty daughter or wife, he instructed that she be supplied to him by force. (...) His beautiful and noble wife Bertha (...) was in such a manner hated by him that he never saw her after the wedding any more than necessary, since he had not celebrated the wedding out of free will.\\"'Bruno of Merseburg, Brunonis Saxonicum bellum, p. 16Bertha of Turin and her husband Henry IV =Attempted repudiation= Despite the insults and humiliations to which she was subjected by her husband, Bertha remained true to him. Nevertheless, in 1069, Henry attempted to repudiate her. At an assembly at Worms, he \\"explained publicly (before the princes), that his relationship with his wife was not good; for a long time he had deceived others, but now he did not want to do so any longer. He could not accuse her of anything that justified a divorce, but he was not capable of carrying out conjugal relations with her any longer. He asked them for the sake of God to remove him from the bonds of a marriage closed under bad signs ... so that the way to a luckier marriage might be opened. And nobody knowing any objection to raise, and his wife being an obstacle to a second marriage ceremony, he then swore that she was as he received her, unstained and her virginity intact.\\"Lampert of Hersfeld, Annales, p. 106 The German episcopacy dared not submit to the king's demands, and no conclusion was reached at the Worms assembly. Instead, the German bishops called on Pope Alexander II for assistance and a synod was convened at Frankfurt for later in the year. During this time, Bertha retired to Lorsch Abbey. The papal legate Peter Damian presided at the Frankfurt synod; he opposed Henry's repudiation of Bertha on the grounds of canon law, but many of the German princes were more concerned about the response of Bertha's mother Adelaide.Robinson, Henry IV, pp. 110f. Henry IV reluctantly reconciled with his consort. Their first daughter was born in the following year (1070). On 12 February 1074 their son Conrad was born at Hersfeld Abbey, where Bertha stayed while Henry was fighting against the Saxon Rebellion,Robinson, Henry IV, p. 295 and was baptised in the abbey three days later. After Henry's victory against the Saxons, he arranged for an Imperial Diet at Goslar on Christmas Day 1075 to swear an oath recognising Conrad as his successor.Robinson, Henry IV, p. 104 =Canossa= Henry and Bertha with their son, waiting at the gate of Canossa, Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1563)Bertha of Turin in penance During the fierce Investiture Controversy, Bertha's husband was excommunicated by Pope Gregory VII at the Lenten synod in Rome in 1076. In October, the German princes took the occasion and swore an oath at Trebur that they would no longer recognise Henry as king unless this excommunication was lifted. Henry thus had to cross the Alps and travel to Italy in order to meet with Gregory during the winter of 1076/77. Bertha and their young son, Conrad, accompanied Henry on his dangerous journey. Creber, ‘Women at Canossa'. While the South German princes supporting his rival Rudolf of Rheinfelden blocked his path, Henry hoped to travel through one of the Alpine passes controlled by his mother-in-law, but Adelaide extracted a high price before allowing him to do this.Robinson, Henry IV, pp. 159ff. Adelaide then accompanied Henry and Bertha on the long and dangerous Walk to Canossa, where from 25 January 1077, Henry and Bertha underwent penance barefoot for three days outside in the cold and begged Gregory VII's forgiveness. Adelaide was among those who acted as an oath-helper to secure Henry’s absolution from excommunication.Creber, ‘Women at Canossa'; Robinson, Henry IV, pp. 161ff. After the forces of Henry IV had besieged and occupied Rome, he and Bertha were crowned emperor and empress on 31 March 1084 by Antipope Clement III.Robinson, Henry IV, pp. 229ff. =Death= Bertha was thirty-six years old when she died in Mainz on 27 December 1087. She was buried in the Salian crypt at Speyer Cathedral.Robinson, Henry IV, p. 266 In 1089 Emperor Henry married Eupraxia of Kiev but the marriage failed in 1095. Children From her marriage with Henry, Bertha eventually had five children, two of whom died while still young:Robinson, Henry IV, p. 266 * Adelheid (1070 – bef. 4 June 1079).The chronicles of Jan Długosz and Archdiacon Sulger reported that she married Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland at Bamberg in 1110 as her second wife.

It is the only film from this director that exists up to this day, since all his other productions (including the first two animated feature films, El Apóstol (1917) and Sin dejar rastros (1918), as well as the first animated film with sound, Peludópolis (1931)) were lost in a series of fires at the facilities where the negatives and copies were stored; Sin dejar rastros was confiscated on the day of its premiere, and is believed to have been immediately destroyed. El mono relojero was saved from the fires because, by chance, the author of its script Constancio C. Vigil had a copy of his own. The film premiered in Buenos Aires. It was intended to be the first of a series of animated adaptations of the children's books written by Vigil, but differences between him and Quirino Cristiani, who possessed a willful streak, prevented the production of subsequent installments. El mono relojero was not especially representative of the filmography of Quirino Cristiani. The film's themes and style were clearly Vigil's, and it was one of the few directed by Cristiani to lack the element of political satire.

The musical tradition of the church dates back to the late 1800s when the Oxford Movement's influence caused the establishment of a robed choir. For many years the reputation of the church choir rode high but during the 1970s and 1980s it proved difficult to maintain the numbers of boy trebles, prompting the formation of an all-adult choir. In the 1990s and into the new millennium the standards once again rose, and the choir of St. Mary's came to be held in high regard, making several recital tours within the UK and abroad, and broadcasting on radio and television.

Early in his career, Sisler was a starter, then later was used as a middle reliever and occasionally as a closer. He reached the majors in with the Boston Red Sox after he completed a two-year obligation in the active military. After three-and-a-half seasons with the Red Sox, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in and served the team through the season. Before the season, he was selected by the Washington Senators in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft, for whom he played the season. He was then traded to the Cincinnati Reds in , playing one season at the major league level, and one in their minor league system. His most productive years came with Boston, where he won 24 games from 1956 to 1958, averaging 138 innings each season. After that, he appeared strictly as a reliever and saved a career-high 11 games for the Senators. In a seven-season career, Sisler posted a 38–44 record with a 4.33 ERA in 247 appearances, including 29 saves, 12 complete games, one shutout and 656⅓ innings. Sisler retired from baseball after the 1963 season to become an investment firm executive, a career that lasted for over 30 years, retiring as a vice-chairman for A. G. Edwards. His father, Hall of Famer George Sisler; and one of his brothers, Dick Sisler, also played baseball at the major league level; while another brother, George Sisler, Jr., was a general manager for several minor league baseball teams, and later became president of the International League from 1966 to 1976. Early life Sisler was born on October 16, 1931, in St. Louis, Missouri, to George Sisler, a Baseball Hall of Fame player, and Kathleen. He played baseball and two other sports at John Burroughs School. When he was 16, he went to work for his father, a coach in the Brooklyn Dodgers organization, who allowed him to keep statistics and occasionally to pitch. The Dodgers did not pursue a contract with him, due in part to his commitment to Princeton University and future military obligation. He played baseball and basketball at Princeton, where in 1951, his earned-run average was 0.99. After Sisler graduated, magna cum laude, he was signed by the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL), and began his professional baseball career at the age of 21 in 1953 for the Albany Senators in the class-A Eastern League. He pitched in 21 games that season, 20 as their starting pitcher; he had a 12–7 win–loss record and an ERA of 2.60 in 135 innings pitched. He was the last pitcher from Princeton to start a major league game until Chris Young in 2004. In 1954 and 1955, he served on active duty with the U.S. military and did not play professional baseball. Major League career =Boston Red Sox= After his military commitment, he re- joined the organization, and began the season with the Red Sox. He made his major league debut on April 26, 1956, a one-inning relief appearance against the New York Yankees. His first MLB victory came seven days later, a three- inning relief appearance against the Yankees in Boston. On August 5, in his sixth start, he pitched a seven-inning complete game 2-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians and their pitching star, future Hall of Famer Bob Lemon. In total, he appeared in 39 games his first season, 14 as their starting pitcher, had a 9–8 win–loss record with three saves, 98 strikeouts, and a 4.66 ERA in 142⅓ inning pitched. He tied for the AL league with a 1.000 fielding percentage by not committing a single error, although he had the sixth highest total of hit batsmen with seven. Following the season, Sisler was praised for his performance; he was selected by Boston area sportswriters as the \\"Harry Agganis Award\\" winner, given annually to whom they voted as the top Boston Red Sox rookie, and was named to the 1956 \\"Rookie All-Star Team\\". On January 17, 1957, Sisler was re-signed by the Red Sox. The Red Sox expected Sisler to be a candidate for a pitching rotation slot. He impressed his coaching staff during early spring practices, manager Mike \\"Pinky\\" Higgins commented that Sisler \\"looks good; he's more mature and shows more confidence\\". When the regular season began, he was initially effective, winning three games against one defeat in his first four starts, including two complete game victories against the Yankees. At this point, he was 4–0 against the Yankees, earning him the moniker \\"Yankee Killer\\" from sportswriter Chester L. Smith of the Pittsburgh Press. Although his ERA of 4.88 was considered high, it was due in large part to his loss against the Kansas City Athletics who scored six earned runs in just two innings. On July 4, he defeated the Yankees once again, making him 5–0 against them in his career, and 7–4 overall for the 1957 season, and had lowered his ERA to 4.02. That was his last victory of the season, however, which he followed with two consecutive losses, pitching a total of four innings; he did not appear in another game until September 2. He recorded a save against the Baltimore Orioles on September 7, but closed the season with two consecutive losses against the Yankees, though he pitched well in the second game, giving up just three hits and two earned runs in eight innings. His season totals include a 7–8 record, and a 4.72 ERA in 122⅓ inning pitched. Sisler began the 1958 spring training in spectacular form, pitching a total of nine hitless innings and allowed just one baserunner in 28 batters faced; the last 27 in order. However, he finished the spring with two consecutive losses, including one to the Pittsburgh Pirates, with whom his father was a special assistant to their manager. He opened the regular season with a complete game victory against the Yankees on April 16. On May 2, he pitched his only career complete game shutout, a 6–0 victory against the Detroit Tigers and future Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, improving his record to 3–1 for the season. Over the next two months, his average innings pitched declined during his starts, and on several occasions he entered the game in relief. He went winless from June 12 to August 9, when he defeated the Yankees. He recorded just one more victory in 1958, and completed the season with an 8–9 record, a 4.94 ERA, and 71 strikeouts in a career-high 149⅓ innings pitched. On February 8, 1959, the Red Sox announced that they had Sisler signed for the 1959 season. After what was considered a \\"disappointing\\" season, he did not impress with his first outing in spring training, giving up two hits and five bases on balls in just two innings of work. Lack of pitching depth was a noted weakness for the Red Sox entering the season, with unpredictable youth and with hopes that Sisler could regain his previous level of success. Sisler opened the season slated as a relief pitcher with the idea that he would start in certain cases. In three relief appearances through April, he had a 6.75 ERA in 6⅔ inning pitched. Management decided that his performance along with a pitching staff that they considered inexperienced, Sisler and Ted Lepcio were traded to the Detroit Tigers on May 2 for starting pitcher Billy Hoeft. =Detroit Tigers= Hoeft, who won 20 games for the Tigers in 1956, had continually under-performed since, and was noted for being in the manager's \\"doghouse\\"; however, TimesDaily sportswriter Hap Halbrooks commented, \\"I can't see where they (Tigers) gained a thing in this transaction.\\" The Tigers had lost 15 of their first 17 games of the season before the trade and decided that changes were needed. In addition to the Sisler trade they fired manager Bill Norman and replaced him with Jimmy Dykes. These moves initially proved effective, sparking a winning game streak, which began by defeating the Yankees in both games of a doubleheader on May 3. Continuing their rebound, the Tigers faced the Red Sox next, winning two of three, and Sisler pitched a scoreless one- inning relief appearance against his former team on May 6. Used exclusively in relief, Sisler pitched in 32 games for the Tigers, winning one game against three losses and collected seven saves, which was seventh most in the AL, and he did not record an error. Sisler returned to the Tigers for the 1960 season, and manager Dykes noted that he was not confident that his bullpen could help when needed, pointing to the previous season as a reference. The Tigers bullpen had won just nine games in 1959, but began 1960 with three straight victories, with Sisler pitching a scoreless two-inning appearance on April 22. His performance was considered a surprise, due to having a poor spring training. Although he pitched well in his first game of the season, he quickly lost his form, and by May 18, his ERA had risen to 5.06 and had a 1–2 record. It was at this point in the season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness, and by August 12 he had lowered his ERA to 1.90. His season totals included a 2.47 ERA and a 7-5 win-loss record, both career bests, and added six saves in 80 innings pitched. =Washington Senators= After the 1960 season, it was announced that the AL were going to create two new teams, one in Los Angeles and one in Washington, D. C. Although he was thought of as the Tigers' best reliever during the season, Sisler was listed by the Tigers as eligible for the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft. The draft occurred on December 14, 1960 and Sisler was selected by the Washington Senators with the fourth overall pick. The Senators received communication from several teams that were interested in Sisler, namely the Milwaukee Braves of the National League (NL) and the Athletics, but decided to trade their first pick in the expansion draft, Bobby Shantz, instead. New manager Mickey Vernon defined Sisler's role with the team before the season began, designating him as their top relief pitcher. Sisler felt slighted by the Tigers, having been left unprotected by the team, and had considered retiring from baseball, but ultimately decided to sign with the Senators. Sisler was solid for much of the first half of the season, not allowing an earned run until May 19, and by June 5 he had an ERA of 0.74, a 1–0 record with seven saves. It was at the point that his effectiveness declined rapidly, allowing runs to score in four of his next five appearances. In a game against the Red Sox on June 18, he relieved starter Carl Mathias, and immediately gave up bases on balls to the first two batters he faced, which forced in two runs, then gave up a grand slam to Jim Pagliaroni. He followed with another base on balls, and was relieved without having recording an out. Over the course of the next couple months, with his ERA steadily rising, his playing time was lessened, making just six appearances in the month of July, and five in August. He made his last major league start on August 31 against the Tigers, giving up seven hits and six earned runs for the loss. In 45 total appearances in 1961, he had a 2–8 win-loss record and finished sixth in AL with 11 saves. On September 16, the Senators agreed to send $75,000 ($ current dollar adjustment) and a player to be named later to the Cincinnati Reds of the NL for pitcher Claude Osteen. To complete the transaction, Washington sent Sisler to the Reds as that player named on November 28. =Cincinnati Reds= The Reds were the NL champions in 1961, and with the addition of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected to be used as a relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June 19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September 23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3 record, a 3.92 ERA, and one save in 43⅔ innings pitched. For the coming 1963 season, manager Fred Hutchinson envisioned the same the role for Sisler, coming out of the bullpen with the idea that he would occasionally start. The Reds announced on February 9 that Sisler had signed for the 1963 season, although he did not make the Reds' NL club and was optioned to their class-AAA team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 35 games pitched for the Padres, he started six, had a 6–9 record and a 3.40 ERA in 90 innings. On March 18, 1964, it was announced that Sisler retired from baseball to join an Investment company. Later life After his baseball career, Sisler was an executive with the investment firm A. G. Edwards for more than 30 years, reaching the level of vice-chairman. A. G. Edwards was a sponsor of a semi-professional baseball tea in St. Petersburg, Florida; when the \\"Stockbrokers\\" were invited to play in season-ending tournament to decide a champion, Sisler, a senior executive for the firm, denied the funding for the team, forcing them to decline if no other monies were raised. It was an unexpected decision considering that Sisler was former baseball player, but he did not feel that A. G. Edwards was benefitting, with the costs of running the team becoming more than originally agreed to by contract. In 2004, the possibility arose of his father's record of 257 hits in a season being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was being talked about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154 games, there would be an asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262 hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation. Sisler died on January 9, 2011 of prostate cancer at the age of 79 in St. Louis, Missouri. He was survived by his wife Janet, son, and three grandchildren.

The documentary followed the lives of six students who studied at St Hilda's College, Oxford, the last remaining single-sex college at the University of Oxford, between 1998 and 2001. Background Series producer Anna Hall and director Kevin Sim, both former students at the university, developed the idea for the series. They felt a documentary should be made that would show the reality of life as a student at Oxford rather than the clichéd image seen in shows such as Brideshead Revisited. It was felt that choosing St Hilda's would be of additional interest as it would allow \\"an examination of women at the beginning of the 21st century\\". The college was in the news due to controversial votes by the fellows as to whether it should retain its single-sex status. The college were concerned for the welfare of students involved in the project, and also feared that they may not be treated fairly by media coverage without any editorial control, but with the support of college fellow Sally Mapstone, permission was granted. The Channel 4 documentary team were allowed access to the college for up to 40 days per year.\\"The belles of St Hilda's reveal all.\\" The Daily Telegraph. 7 October 2002. Accessed 25 February 2007. The students The students featured in the series included: Lucy Aitkens--Student who was ambitious to progress through the ranks of the Oxford Union. Was the primary focus of the second episode, which saw her elected as librarian, only to be stripped of the position through breaking the union's policies on electioneering. Later elected union president and went on to become a Fulbright Scholar at Harvard University. Natasha (\\"Tash\\") Etherington-- Languages student from Crystal Palace, London. Admitted she didn't set out to study at Oxford originally and rarely appeared at ease while studying at the college. She said her life felt \\"so much better in every way\\" whilst studying in Paris in her third year. Was the college's LGBT representative. Afshan Ghani--Medicine student from south Wales, of Pakistani origin. Appeared shy when in Oxford. The series saw her visit the poor village where her mother grew up in the Punjab. Took to wearing the hijab. Ruth Hunt--The college's JCR president. Came out as a lesbian during an interview in the college garden. Laura Paskell-Brown--A socialist from the Manchester area, who studied Politics. First appears whilst selling the Socialist Worker magazine with her parents. Became embroiled in a storm of controversy surrounding her refusal to pay means-tested tuition fees, which were compulsory for the first time at English universities in 1998. Fell in love with a Conservative and got married in the final episode. Reaction The series was filmed at a cost of £1m and was heavily promoted in the national press when first transmitted,\\" No men please, we're studying.\\" The Guardian. 5 September 2002. Accessed 25 February 2007. as Channel 4's flagship documentary series for the autumn season, and initially received strong praise. The Daily Telegraph commented that \\"a Hollywood scriptwriter would find it hard to improve on the unfolding storylines\\", and A. A. Gill rated the series as \\"one of the best documentaries of this type for years\\" in The Sunday Times.\\" Oxford girls in Channel 4 series angered by cuts.\\" The Daily Telegraph. 7 October 2002. Accessed 25 February 2007. However viewing figures were not as high as hoped and, despite the production team being delighted with the project at first, Channel 4 changed their attitude to the show once broadcasts were underway. Tim Gardam, head of programmes at Channel 4, told one of the students involved that the films \\"lacked life and were too mannered to do justice to the strength of character and interest (the production team) had been allowed to document\\". The channel shortened the series' run by skipping the fifth episode and instead transmitted the season finale on 6 October 2002.\\"The howl of the Beast .\\" The Oxford Student. 10 October 2002. Accessed 25 February 2007. =Missing episode= Channel 4 were heavily criticised for their decision not to transmit the fifth episode, which discussed with the students' sexualities and the latest poll on whether to admit male students and academics. Peter Dale, head of documentaries, denied that the decision was ratings-related, he said the episode was dropped because it was \\"a little bit pretentious\\" and felt the series may not have been delivering what the audience wanted. College principal Lady English said that the college was not informed of the decision prior to the series' end and felt the broadcaster owed the college and the film's participants \\"an explanation and an apology\\". She also suggested that the channel should have voiced their complaints about the fifth episode during editing, and not once the broadcast of the series was underway. Ruth Hunt discussed her sexuality on camera in the untransmitted episode and wrote to Channel 4 expressing her \\"hurt and disappointment\\" over the handling of the episode. Sally Mapstone felt that the episode that was skipped was key to the story, commenting \\"the irony is that, by censoring the one film where the girls talk most frankly about themselves, Channel 4 has skewed the whole emphasis of the series\\". The decision not to edit the final episode left some plot elements confused- Laura was shown marrying her Conservative partner but their engagement was skipped in the fifth episode. =Perceptions of the university, Channel 4's attitude= Sally Mapstone also said she feared the series's cancellation was a response to the public perception of Oxford as elitist. Kevin Sim added that he felt that critics of the series were using the show as an excuse to \\"express their long-cherished hatred of Oxford as an elitist institution\\". He said it was brave of the network to invest in the series in 1998 but should have publicised it more. The series was criticised by students in Oxford for appearing to depict an overly intense atmosphere throughout, and for being pre-occupied with scandals, rather than providing a balanced portrayal of life at the university, as it set out to do. Sim added that the channel's behaviour illustrated a shift from their previously highbrow aspirations and was now very risk-averse in reality: \\"The programmes were commissioned four years ago, before Channel 4's culture was stood on its head by Big Brother\\". He asked for his name to be removed from the credits of the final episode.

It was established in 1929 as a private observatory by father and son Francis Charles McMath and Robert Raynolds McMath and their friend, Judge Henry Hulbert. In 1932 the observatory was deeded to the University of Michigan which operated it until 1981, at which time it was sold into private ownership again. In 1932 a reflector telescope was added to the observatory as well as a spectroheliokinematograph {spectro-helio-kine-mato-graph}. This instrument was designed to take motion pictures of the Sun. The McMath-Hulbert Solar Observatory is primarily known for the motion pictures that the McMaths made of various celestial phenomena, including the first movies of solar prominences in motion. Later work involved solar spectroscopy in the near infrared and participation in a solar flare patrol program in the 1950s. Robert McMath and one of the resident astronomers, Keith Pierce, established the McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory near Tucson, Arizona in 1962.

The context of this event took place during an era of escalation of the U.S./Russian Cold War. Its purpose was to promote a redirection of international government efforts away from nuclear arms and toward feeding the poor. A poster for the event urged supportive participation in two events: a one-day fast on August 6 or 27, 1983 and a week-long fast beginning September 10, 1983.Fast For Life advertisement in The Ecologist, magazine Vol. 13, No. 4, 1983 archived in the online The Ecologist issue archive The core peace action culminated in August 1983 when participants in five countries began a fast on August 6, the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and refused to end their fast until \\"only when negotiations at Geneva indicate that a halt will be called to the spread of nuclear weapons.\\" While the participants abstained from food, the protest event garnered major media coverage, commentaries, and open letters of both support and criticism, as well as inspired thousands of people around the world to fast and hold supportive demonstrations. In objectives, the International Fast For Live movement is related to the Plowshares Movement. Each would rather the powers-that-be feed the world's inhabitants rather than harm them and they each hope to bring about the better world in which that occurs by inspiring others to care and polarize on the contrasting issues of nuclear disarmament vs. world hunger. Given the response around the world and recognition by several world leaders, it's apparent the IFFL's 1983 efforts were effective, to a degree. Before they even began their fast, one commentator, Arthur Hoppe of the San Francisco Chronicle said after hearing about it, that he'd already been inspired by the IFFL to join the one-day fast on August 6. \\"Admittedly, this is a minuscule accomplishment for them (having won over another ally) -- a tiny drop of oil on the storm-tossed ocean of world affairs. But if it were to be multiplied by a hundred, a thousand, a... Who knows? Our leaders might renounce their deadly geo-political games, beat their missiles into plowshares and war no more. Anyway, isn't it pretty to think so?\\"\\"The Fasters\\" by Arthur Hoppe, San Francisco Chronicle, July 19, 1983, p27 For eight of the core participants, the fast ended after 40 days. Their decision to end there was made two days after Californian faster, Dorothy Granada had lost forty pounds and partial eyesight.Spokane Chronicle, September 14, 1983, pA9\\"The Decision to End\\" by Dorothy Granada, The Date is Set – final issue, Number 4 – November 1983, p3 Didier Mainguy ended his fast early, on the 30th day, after experiencing blood pressure problems. In Canada, however, participant Karen Harrison ended her fast on October 5th after a full 61 days, only when Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau conceded to meet with her to discuss nuclear disarmament. Former chancellor Willy Brandt also visited with the fasters in Bonn, where he pledged to seek immediate support from his Social Democratic Party to postpone deployment of missiles in Germany. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote the fasters, stating his appreciation of their goals. Kohl would later be prominently instrumental in the reunification of Germany and also, in cooperation with French President Mitterrand, with the later formation of the European Union. Given their shared peace agenda, it's no surprise that in France, two of President Mitterrand's ministers visited with the fasters in Paris on the 35th day of the fast with a letter from the President who agreed to meet with them after the fast ended. Unfortunately, the IFFL open-ended fast failed to elicit a supportive public response from either U.S. President Reagan or Russian Secretary Yuri Andropov. However, within less than a decade the world would see the Malta Summit and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and in 1991, the official end of the Cold War that had lasted for almost half a century, as well as the US and Soviet Union signing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I, which set a framework for the reduction of U.S./Russian nuclear stockpiles. In recognition of the widespread attention the fast brought to the issue of nuclear weapons disarmament, International Fast For Life was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The direct result of the protests is not certain, but their legacy was a reinvigoration of the nuclear disarmament movement. Since then, unrelated protest actions have also referenced this event, such as Cesar Chavez' hunger strike that he called a \\"Fast For Life\\" in 1988, intended to draw attention to the harmful effects of pesticides on farm workers. The 1986 Veterans' Fast For Life protested U.S. President Ronald Reagan's pro-Contra policies in Central America. A more recent, similarly-titled event was the 2011 Darfur Fast For Life that called for a re-invigoration of international intervention against genocide in Darfur.On July 22, Darfur is Against Genocide's 24-hour global hunger strike to re-invigorate international engagement in Darfur.

During the campaign, a fast moved many members of the British Columbia Parliament to support a resolution opposing Trident. Testimony to the power of fasting indicated to Charles Gray, one of the first three participants that would announce the 1983 fast, the power of fasting after he recognized the frustration that resulted following civil disobedience actions that were unproductive, since it allowed police to stop life-affirming action. The objective was to overcome the inability to put morality and sense above a death-promoting legal system, that being an escalating stockpile of nuclear weapons by governments around the world. Shortly afterwards, Gray, meditating in the Friends' Meeting House in Eugene, Oregon, imagined a fast that he thought might have a chance of stopping the nuclear arms race – an international open-ended fast. The idea was so fraught with risk to life that he did nothing publicly for almost a year. Finally, Gray concluded that the nuclear crisis of that time was so grave that people of peace may have to offer up their lives in an effort to prevent the continuation of the silent holocaust of world hunger and the impending holocaust of nuclear fire. These are the origins of the Fast For Life. With the help of colleagues a letter was circulated to about a hundred people in the peace movement. After a favorable response, a small group was formed in Eugene - the Nonviolent Tactics Development Project (NTDP). A pamphlet titled \\"First Step\\" was published so that others could gain experience for a major fast in the event that the nuclear arms race was not stopped by Hiroshima Day, August 6, 1983.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p7 In the fall of 1980, Solange Fernex, President of Women for Peace in France, and a founding member of France's Green Party, adopted NTDP methods in Western Europe.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p8 A 24-page guide to political fasting was produced in 1980 giving a brief history of political fasting, how fasts should be conducted, and how to organize for a political fast. There followed in June 1982 a Fast for Disarmament originating in Washington DC and aimed at the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear Disarmament in New York. At this time Gray and Granada met for the first time with Fernex.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p9 On June 19, 1982 the three announced that if the development, testing, production and deployment of nuclear weapons had not been stopped by the symbolic date of August 6, 1983, then they would begin an open-ended fast. Throughout this fast, designed to appeal to conscience, fasters would be guided by Gandhi's principles of non- violence. In introducing the Fast, it was noted that the struggle for peace and justice requires that non-violent actions be commensurate with the evil faced, fasting being such an action. As with all non-violent methods, suffering is taken upon oneself and not imposed on the opponent. The Fast For Life is seen as an experiment in truth, seeking change through moral suasion.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p6 Developments through August 6, 1983 Preparations began in earnest following the June 1982 fast. The months through to the beginning of the Fast saw preparation among groups in many countries commencing one-day-a-week fasts or longer fasts while communicating as widely as possible to organizations, church leaders and individuals the approaching Fast's commencement.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p9,p10 For many, there was the important task of connecting the link between world hunger and the arms race. Besides support being established in the U.S., Solange Fernex traveled to Japan to attend the Conference Against A and H Bombs before visits to European countries and then to India for the Non-Aligned Nations Conference in March 1983 where disarmament, survival and co-existence in the age of nuclear weapons was a chief issue on the agenda. Endorsements came from many groups, including Clergy and Laity Concerned and the War Resisters League, but the American Friends Service Committee and Fellowship of Reconciliation would not endorse. In November 1982 Gray joined an international hunger strike in Comiso, Italy, the U.S. base for Pershing and Cruise missiles. Gray later traveled to Japan and New Zealand, countries that would become involved in the Fast For Life. In January 1983, Fast headquarters in the U.S. moved from Eugene, Oregon to San Francisco.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p10 From April 12–24 an international meeting was held at the Community of the Ark near Rodez, France. The tasks were to establish goals for the Fast and consider application from fasters. The international meeting adopted an \\"Appeal to people, institutions and governments to take action to stop the nuclear arms race\\".IFFL Announcement of a Fast To Begin August 6, 1983 By June 1983, Oakland and Paris had been chosen as the sites for the fasting centers. It was agreed that fasters, with advisers, would make their own decisions concerning continuation and termination to end his or her fast at any time, and would receive the full support of the Fast For Life.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p11 (In France the fast was called Jeûne pour la Vie.) August 6, 1983 Thousands of people had pledged to participate in support fasts from all over the world. While many fasted one day a week, others took upon themselves longer fasts, often three to 10 day fasts. While records are incomplete, to the best knowledge of organizers, there were more than 150 fasts in 24 countries around the world, mostly in North America and Europe, but also Japan and New Zealand. Communications were not possible to establish with East Germany, but reports from individuals in the Fast movement suggest that as many as 21 people were fasting there. In Italy alone, 44 support groups came into being to boost that country's small peace movement. 86 groups were formed in France and a Fast For Life banner was hung at the Arc de Triomphe where 328 people were arrested – France's largest civil disobedience action against nuclear weapons.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p12 Over 100 groups were born in West Germany. Former chancellor Willy Brandt visited with the fasters in Bonn and pledged to seek immediate support from his Social Democratic Party to postpone deployment of missiles in Germany. Chancellor Kohl wrote the fasters stating his appreciation of their goals.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p57 In France, two of President Mitterrand's ministers visited with the fasters in Paris on the 35th day of the fast with a letter from the President who agreed to meet with them after the fast ended.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p17 Didier Mainguy ended his fast on the 30th day after experiencing blood pressure problems.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p16 On September 13 - the 38th day of the Fast - Karen Harrison met with Pierre Trudeau in Ottawa. Trudeau received a list of proposals from the IFFL and stressed that he sincerely wanted a halt to the arms race.The Date is Set – final issue Number 4 – November 1983, p1 With supporters, Harrison also met with other administration officials as well as with embassy representatives of both the Soviet Union and the United States.The Date is Set – final issue Number 4 – November 1983, p7 On October 6, the 61st day, Harrison broke her fast recognizing that the Fast For Life could continue in other positive ways. In Scotland, an Open Letter was published urging a policy of international aid and bringing an end to the escalating arms race. The letter was signed by leaders of all the major churches in Scotland and handed in to the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, and Prime Minister Thatcher in London, as well as being sent to all members of parliament.The Date is Set – final issue Number 4 – November 1983, p8Open letter from the Churches of Scotland regarding H.M. Government's attitude toward the arms race and world hunger, distributed by SEAD The end of the Fast By September, it was the opinion of many supporters that the Fast had made a significant contribution to the peace movement.We Hunger for Disarmament: International Fast For Life, p16 By the 6th week, the presidents of the World Council of Churches and the U.S. National Council of Churches cabled and urged an end to the Fast, as did some congressmen. A message was sent to fasters from Rev. Philip Potter, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, commending the life-affirming action having heard the testimonies of thousands from around the world. Part of the message read, \\"Your fasting has fed the solidarity of all who hunger for disarmament. In your weakness you have made us strong.\\" The message called on the fasters to end their fast, having \\"encouraged the representatives of the member churches of the World Council to commit themselves further in this way\\".Open letter to IFFL hunger strikers from Rev. Dr. Philip Potter, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, in custody of recipient, Alan Burns With doctors increasingly fearful, fasters at the three centers (Oakland, Bonn and Paris) decided on September 13 to end their fast September 15.Spokane Chronicle - September 14, 1983, pA9IFFL statement ending the Fast, September 14, 1983\\"The Decision to End\\" by Dorothy Granada, The Date is Set – final issue, Number 4 – November 1983, p3 Andrea Elukovich continued three more days. In early October, the French fasters were granted a two-hour audience with President Mitterrand where they affirmed their opposition to nuclear buildup and testing in Polynesia. The final edition of \\"The Date Is Set\\" (November 1983) chronicled that French priest Joseph Pyronnet fasted for 15 days until October 18 when he held a press conference as bishops assembled for the Synod of Reconciliation. On October 30, Tom Siemer reported a letter he presented to the World Catholic Bishops' Synod was read aloud by Cardinal Loerschreider of Brazil. The Synod adopted the terms of Tom's letter by issuing a summary which condemned nuclear weapons, and signed by 15 Catholic communities around Rome. On October 24 in Stockholm, Sweden, significant blockades were held at the British, West German and Italian embassies following a day on non-violence training. Further actions also occurred throughout Europe in the months following the end of the fast. An international meeting was held in Lyon, France on September 24–25 1983, where two hundred people assembled. Acknowledging the power that fasting had shown, the gathering undertook to pursue the same aims; the moral pressure on governments to respond to the Fast's appeals for greater justice in this shared world would be maintained until a reversal in the escalation of nuclear weapons occurs, and real attempts to confront the plight of the world's hungry are made.The Date is Set – final issue Number 4 – November 1983, p9 Alan Burns, from the Scottish support group, agreed to act as international coordinator to maintain communications between participating countries.

In later years, Botkin became a lifelong advocate of Anna Anderson, who claimed to be the surviving Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. DNA results later proved that she was an impostor called Franziska Schanzkowska. In 1938 he founded his own neopagan church, The Church of Aphrodite, which was one of the earliest churches in the neopagan movement in the United States. Early life He was the youngest son of Yevgeny Botkin and his wife, Olga. His parents divorced in 1910, when Botkin was 10, due to his father’s demanding position at court and his mother’s affair with his German tutor, Friedrich Lichinger, whom she later married. Yevgeny Botkin retained custody of the children following the divorce.Zeepvat, Charlotte, Romanov Autumn, Sutton Publishing, 2000, His older brother Dmitry was killed in action during World War I.Kinrimitg, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons Inc., 2003, p. 66 As a child, he and his sister Tatiana played with the children of Nicholas II during holidays. He used to amuse the grand duchesses on holidays and when they were all in exile at Tobolsk with caricatures of pigs dressed in human clothing acting like stuffy dignitaries at court.Peter Kurth, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson, Back Bay Books, 1983, p. 200 Botkin was described by one historian as \\"articulate, sensitive, with pallid skin and soulful green eyes\\" and as \\"a talented artist, a wicked satirist, and a born crusader.\\"Kurth, p. 200 Exile Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the murder of his father, Botkin fled Tobolsk. He later spent a summer at a Russian Orthodox monastery and briefly considered becoming a priest, but decided against the religious life. He married Nadezhda Mandrazhi-Konshina, widow of Ensign of the Dragoons regiment, nobleman Mikhail Nikolaevich Mandrazhi, who was the chevalier of the Order of Saint George and was killed in battle in June 1915 at Grodno in Belarus. Two months after his death, Nadezhda (sometimes anglicised Nadine) gave birth to their daughter, Kira Mikhailovna Mandrazhi (1915-2009). Nadezhda's father, nobleman Alexei Vladimirovich Konshin, was the president of the Russian Bank of State from 1910-1914 and the president of the Russian Industry and Commerce Bank from 1914-1917. The Botkins immigrated to the United States via Japan, arriving in San Francisco from Yokohama on 8 October 1922.Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, 1893-1953. Records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1787–2004, Record Group 85. The National Archives at Washington, D.C.Lovell, James Blair, Anastasia: The Lost Princess, Regnery Gateway, 1991, , pp. 125-126 Botkin worked as a photo engraver and attended art classes at the Pratt Institute in New York City. Later, he earned his living as a novelist and illustrator.Kurth, p. 199Lovell, p. 126 Association with Anna Anderson Botkin first visited Anna Anderson in May 1927 at Seeon Abbey, where Anderson was a guest. Anderson had asked Botkin to bring along \\"his funny animals.\\" Botkin wrote later that he immediately recognized Anderson as Anastasia because she shared memories of their childhood play. Historian Peter Kurth wrote that Botkin tended to overlook some of the more unattractive aspects of Anderson's personality, such as her stubbornness and rapid changes in mood, or to view them as manifestations of her royal heritage. \\"She was, to Gleb's way of thinking, an almost magically noble tragic princess, and he saw it as his mission to restore her to her rightful position by any means necessary,\\" wrote Kurth in Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson.Kurth, p. 201 Botkin penned letters in support of Anderson to various Romanov family members, wrote books about her and the Romanovs, including The Woman Who Rose Again, The Real Romanovs, and Lost Tales: Stories for the Tsar's Children, and arranged for Anderson's financial support throughout his life. He was Anderson's friend even when other supporters abandoned her. Religious views Botkin, following his father’s murder, had considered becoming a priest, but he eventually turned away from the Russian Orthodox Church. Botkin eventually turned his interest in religion towards his own nature-based religion, which he started first in Long Island, New York and later in Charlottesville, Virginia. His church was called the Church of Aphrodite.Kurth, p. 287 Botkin was of the opinion that patriarchal society had caused many of the problems plaguing humankind. \\"Men!\\" he once said. \\"Just look at the mess we've made!\\" His church drew from ancient pagan rituals and from some of the tenets of the Old Believers, a rebel branch of the Russian Orthodox Church who had separated after 1666 -1667 from the hierarchy of the church as a protest against liturgical reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon. Anderson never joined his church but did not object when Botkin finished his letters to her with this prayer: \\"May the Goddess bestow Her tender caress on Your Imperial Highness's head.\\" Botkin had argued his case before the New York State Supreme Court in 1938 and won the right to an official charter for the religion. The judge told him, \\"I guess it’s better than worshipping Mary Baker Eddy.\\" His wife, whom he doted on, converted to his church in later life. Botkin held regular church services in front of a statue of Aphrodite, the ancient Greek goddess of love, and presided over them dressed in the regalia of an archbishop. The female symbol, a cross inside of a circle representing Aphrodite, was embroidered on his headdress. He later published a book, at his own expense, arguing that Aphrodite was the supreme deity and creation had been much like a woman giving birth to the universe. Botkin told a reporter for The Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, that his religion pre-dated Christianity. With Christianity, he said, \\"you have the dilemma of either following the straight and narrow path and going to Heaven or having fun on earth and going to Hell.\\" On the other hand, he said that his \\"Aphrodisian religion\\" was based on \\"truth and reality. Anything true will survive. Life itself is the blossoming of love, and love is the basis of goodness and happiness.\\" He thought his church would expand in coming years. The student newspaper reporter commented on Botkin's \\"unorthodox\\" beliefs regarding sexual relations between men and women. Botkin believed that it was inappropriate for a man to react to his wife's affair with the rage that was expected by society: \\"A woman falls in love with another man. All that is necessary is to let her have her fling. After that she is often a better wife and mother. It is like a person who loves to play Bach and suddenly wants to play Beethoven.\\" One historian commented that Botkin's church \\"was a curious faith, to be sure,\\" but \\"the Church of Aphrodite was not nearly so wanton as it sounds.\\" The church did not continue long after Botkin's death from a heart attack in December 1969, but some of his followers went on to join neopagan movements with beliefs drawing from the Church of Aphrodite. DNA used to identify father’s remains Botkin and his wife had four children, daughter Marina and sons Nikita, Peter, and Yevgeny. He also had a stepdaughter, Kira.Klier, John, and Mingay, Helen, The Quest for Anastasia: Solving the Mystery of the Last Romanovs, Birch Lane Press, 1995, , p. 203. His daughter Marina Botkina Schweitzer's DNA was later used to help identify the remains of her grandfather, Yevgeny Botkin, after they were exhumed along with other Romanovs in 1991 from a mass grave discovered in Ganina Yama near Yekaterinburg. Schweitzer's DNA was compared against the DNA of her maternal half-sister Kira, who also gave a blood sample, to help scientists isolate the DNA Schweitzer shared in common with her grandfather. This enabled scientists to create a \\"Botkin DNA profile\\" and use it to positively identify Dr. Botkin. Scientists in the early 1990s were unable to identify Dr. Botkin using mitochondrial DNA, or DNA that is passed down from mother to child, as they used it to identify the Romanovs. Schweitzer was descended from Dr. Botkin in the paternal line and didn't share mitochondrial DNA with her father and grandfather.Klier and Mingay, p. 203 Schweitzer later expressed scepticism about the DNA results proving that Anna Anderson could not have been the Grand Duchess Anastasia.Massie, Robert K., The Romanovs: The Final Chapter, 1995, p. 198 References External links * 1900 births 1969 deaths American memoirists American neopagans Converts to new religious movements from Eastern Orthodoxy Converts to pagan religions from Christianity Former Russian Orthodox Christians Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States Writers from Charlottesville, Virginia People from Long Island Russian neopagans Founders of neopagan movements 20th-century memoirists ","title":"Gleb Botkin"},{"id":"9720870","text":"The Best of Yolanda Adams is an album by gospel singer Yolanda Adams.

The sole character—the Librarian—embarks on a quest to find out who anonymously returned a library book that is 113 years overdue. A clue scribbled in the margin of the book and an unclaimed dry-cleaning ticket then take him on a mysterious adventure that spans the globe and the ages. Plot synopsis The play begins with the Librarian appearing on stage, which is sparsely furnished with a whiteboard and marker pens, a magnetic bulletin board, and a table. The Librarian carries with him a battered suitcase. He informs the audience that he is giving a lecture for only one day about a discovery he has made. The Librarian then opens his suitcase and begins to show the audience what he calls his \\"scraps\\": pieces of evidence each marked with numbered tags that provide evidence of a person whose identity is gradually revealed over the course of the play. He starts with a copy of a Baedeker travel guide that was anonymously returned 113 years overdue to the library in the small Dutch town where he used to work. Tracking down the loan records of the book, he finds that the book was borrowed by one \\"A.\\" who provided a post office box as his address. Inside the book, he finds a 73-year-old dry-cleaning ticket for an unclaimed piece of clothing in a London laundry shop. Intrigued, he takes leave from work to visit London. He finds that the laundry shop is still in business and, using the ticket, redeems a pair of trousers that has not been cleaned because of its poor condition. Eventually, the audience learns that the person to whom all of the Librarian's items relate may be Ahasuerus the Wandering Jew, a mythical figure from medieval Christian folklore.

Designed by C. Reed Knight and Eugene Stoner, it was hoped by Colt that this pistol would recapture their stake in the police market as departments across the United States switched from double-action revolvers to semiautomatic pistols. However, the pistol was plagued with reports of inaccuracy and unreliability, and is regarded as an embarrassing failure. History The Colt All American 2000 was introduced at the 1990 Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show). It had been a joint venture between Reed Knight and Eugene Stoner of Knight's Armament over a period of several years. Once the design was handed off to Colt, the two designers had little input regarding the final design. C. Reed Knight specified that the pistol should have a 6-pound trigger pull. Colt increased this to 12 pounds and extended the barrel and length of the grip frame. The Colt 2000 was made from parts produced by an outside vendor and assembled in the company's West Hartford facility. Despite the innovations and bearing the Colt name, the pistol was plagued with reports of inaccuracy and unreliability, and suffered from the poor publicity of having to be recalled in 1993 due to a safety recall. The massive product launch failed and production of the All American 2000 ended in 1994. Colt's President Ron Whitaker stated that sales volume was not sufficient for production to remain economical. Colt historian, Rick Sapp, has called the pistol \\"one of the most embarrassing failures in the company's history.\\" Massad Ayoob was particularly critical of the design calling it \\"sad and ugly with pathetic accuracy\\". Design The Colt 2000's internal workings were based on older firearms designs from the early twentieth century. The rotating barrel, for example, was based on that of the Steyr 1912 and the roller-locking mechanism was based on a design used by the French Manufacture d'Armes et des Cycles de Saint- Etienne since 1914. These features allow the barrel and slide to work as a unit moving to the rear until the barrel lug rotates into the cam-block and stops. The barrel lugs then align to allow the slide to continue its travel to the rear and extraction and ejection of the spent round occurs. The pistol breaks down into seven major parts for disassembly. Unlike most other polymer- framed handguns, the All-American 2000 had removable grip panels. An aluminum framed version of the pistol with wooden grips was made in addition to the polymer framed version and both are sought after by collectors of Colt Firearms because of the low numbers produced during their short production run.

Biography Garzone is a member of the Fringe, a jazz trio founded in 1972 that includes bassist John Lockwood and drummer Bob Gullotti. The group has released several albums. Garzone has appeared on over 20 recordings. He began on tenor saxophone when he was six, played in a family band, and attended music school in Boston. He toured Europe with Jamaaladeen Tacuma and performed with Jack DeJohnette, Joe Lovano, John Patitucci, Danilo Pérez, Rachel Z, and Bob Weir and Ratdog. Garzone is also a jazz educator, teaching at the Berklee College of Music, New England Conservatory, Longy School of Music, New York University, and the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. He pioneered the triadic chromatic approach. His students include Mindi Abair Branford Marsalis, Donny McCaslin, Danilo Pérez, Joshua Redman, Luciana Souza, and Mark Turner. In 1995 he recorded a tribute to Stan Getz on NYC Records called Alone: Four's and Two's followed a year later with Joe Lovano, and in 1999 Garzone returned with Moodiology. Fringe in New York was released in summer 2000. With the Joe Lovano Nonet he recorded at the Village Vanguard in September 2002. He has also performed with Don Alias, Kenny Barron, Dennis Chambers, Stanley Cowell, Anton Fig, Dan Gottlieb, Tom Harrell, Dave Holland, Dave Liebman, Cecil McBee, Bob Moses, Gary Peacock, Marvin Smith, Bill Stewart, Harvie Swartz, and Lenny White. Triadic Chromatic Approach The triadic chromatic approach is an improvisatory approach created by George Garzone while teaching at colleges in Boston and New York City. The approach was developed to allow the improviser to be able to improvise freely without having to concern themselves with what is going on harmonically. This approach is applied by selecting one the four standard triads (major, minor, augmented, and diminished) and moving by a half step into another inversion of the same type of triad. This is a broad definition and there are many ways to be able to manipulate and change this approach.http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2009/DB0509/default.html Discography =As a leader= * Alone, (NYC, 1995); with Luciana Souza, voice; Chuck Loeb, guitar; David Kikoski, piano; Eddie Gómez, bass; Lenny White, drums * Four's and Two's, (NYC, 1996); with Joe Lovano, saxophones; Joey Calderazzo, piano; John Lockwood, bass; Bill Stewart, drums. * Demetrio's Dream, Music by Gianni Pezzano, (NL Records, 1997) * Moodiology, (NYC, 1999); with Kenny Werner, piano; John Lockwood, bass; Bob Gullotti, drums; Claire Daly, baritone saxophone; Douglas Yates, alto saxophone, bass clarinet; Mike Mainieri, vibraphone. * The Fringe in New York, (NYC, 2000); with the Fringe and Mike Mainieri, vibraphone. * One Two Three Four, (Stunt, 2007); with Chris Crocco, guitar; Dennis Irwin, bass; Pete Zimmer, drums * Audacity (Challenge, 2012) with Frank Tiberi, Jakob Hoyer, Jonas Westergard, Rasmus Ehlers * 3 Nights in L.A.

Prince Mirko predeceased his father and his elder brother Crown Prince Danilo. Marriage On 25 July 1902, in Cetinje, Prince Mirko married Natalija Konstantinović (10 October 1882 in Trieste – 21 August 1950 in Paris), daughter of Alexander Konstantinović and wife Milena Opuić, paternal granddaughter of Aleksandar Konstantinović and (m. 1842) Princess Anka Obrenović (1 April 1821 – murdered, 10 June 1868 in Belgrade), daughter of Jevrem Obrenović (1790 – 20 September 1856), younger brother of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia, and wife (m. 1816) Tomanija Bogicević (1796 – 13 June 1881). The couple had five sons before divorcing in 1917: * Prince Šćepac (Stephan) (27 August 1903 in Cetinje – 15 March 1908 in Cannes) * Prince Stanislaw (30 January 1905 in Cetinje – 4 January 1908 in Kotor) * Prince Michael (14 September 1908 in Podgorica – 24 March 1986 in Paris) * Prince Pavle (Paul) (16 May 1910 in Podgorica – June 1933) * Prince Emmanuel (10 June 1912 in Cetinje – 26 March 1928 in Biarritz). Their eldest surviving son Prince Michael of Montenegro, succeeded Mirko in the Montenegrin royal succession and would become head of the House of Petrović-Njegoš and pretender to the Montenegrin throne. Serbian throne Prince Mirko with this tutor Charles Piguet (ca. 1900) As Prince Mirko's wife was the granddaughter of Anka (Anna) Obrenovic, a member of the Serbian House of Obrenović, it was agreed with the Serbian Government that Prince Mirko would be proclaimed Crown Prince of Serbia in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Draga Mašin was childless.BIOGRAPHY OF PRINCE MICHEL PETROVIC NJEGOS Mirko lost his chance to succeed to the Serbian throne in 1903, due to the assassination of Alexander and Draga and the resulting conferral of the crown upon Peter Karađorđević, his brother-in-law. However, in 1911 he joined the Black Hand \\"Unity or Death\\" secret society which sought the unification of all Serbs in the Balkans, especially those under Austria-Hungary, and was determined to become the society's unified leader. Death Mirko divorced his wife in 1917 and moved from Paris to Vienna, where he died in 1918. Following his death, his ten- year-old son Prince Michael of Montenegro was raised in Paris by his mother and the residual members of the exiled Montenegrin Royal Family. In 1921 following the death of Mirko's father and shortly afterwards by the renouncement of the defunct throne by former Crown Prince Danilo, the thirteen-year-old Prince Michael of Montenegro became the head of the Petrović-Njegoš house, albeit initially under a pretense regency.

One of the environmental movement's pioneers in Europe, she helped found the French Green Party and was a member of the European Parliament for five years. She advocated for a wide range of issues, including nonviolence, world peace, nuclear disarmament, alternative energy, and feminism. In 2019, a school in her hometown of Strasbourg, France, was named after Fernex. Early years Fernex was born in Strasbourg, France. When she was only six, her father died as a French soldier fighting in World War II. She later said that sparked her commitment to nonviolence. While studying biology in college, she met Swiss physician Michel Fernex, who specializes in tropical diseases. The couple married and moved to Africa, where two of their four children were born. Upon returning, they lived in an old farmhouse in Biederthal near the Swiss border, where they installed a solar energy system and raised their family. Green activism Upon returning to France, Fernex founded a chapter of the third world relief group, Terre des hommes. She worked to preserve historic homes and assisted with the \\"squatting\\" movement to successfully protest a proposed lead factory on the Rhine River and a nearby chemical plant. She also joined activists in opposing nuclear power plants, including one planned in Wyhl in southwestern Germany, where she camped in a protest community near the site. In 1977, Fernex was elected to her town council and remained active on it for 24 years. In 1979, she led the Europe-Ecologie political movement for the environmental group's first European elections, which obtained 4.39 percent for a total of 888,134 votes in France. That same year, she founded the women-led peace organization, Femmes pour la Paix, which she headed until 1996. In 1983, she participated in the Fast for Life movement, fasting 38 days in Paris for nuclear disarmament. The following year, she co-founded Green Party with Antoine Waechter. She was the lead organizer in Europe of the Walk of the People – A Pilgrimage for Life, a transcontinental peace walk from the United States to Russia that covered 7,000 miles in 1984 and 1985. Chernobyl, European Parliament, later years After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, Fernex stepped up her efforts to help the radiation victims. She and her husband later founded Children of Chernobyl, focusing on youthful victims. She often said that the number of victims was grossly underestimated by authorities. In 1989, Fernex won election to the European Parliament, representing the Green Party in France through 1994. As head of the Agriculture Committee and member of the Fishery Sub-Commission, she lobbied for organic farming regulations to outline how to obtain an organic certification for food. Between 1995 and 2003, Fernex chaired the French chapter of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. She was also vice president of the International Peace Bureau in Geneva for four years in the 1990s. In 2001, she received the Nuclear-Free Future Award from the German-based foundation for her lifetime work against nuclear weapons. Death and legacy By 2003, Fernex had acquired cancer, causing her to have to reduce her activities. She died on Sept. 11, 2006, in Biederthal. She wrote a book on her work, A Life for a Life ((La Vie pour la Vie). The French film production company Dora Films did a documentary on her in 2014 called The Little Spark.

The organization sets the Congressionally-authorized standards and qualifications for real estate appraisers, and provides voluntary guidance on recognized valuation methods and techniques for all valuation professionals. The aim is to ensuring appraisals are independent, consistent, and objective. The Appraisal Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 1987 by the largest valuation organizations in North America. The Foundation is overseen by the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC), a subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC), a USA governmental agencyFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), a USA governmental agency The ASC is charged with filing a report to Congress each year, on the activities of TAF. Real Estate Appraisal practice in the US is regulated by the various states. TAF's Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) promulgates and updates best practices as codified in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), and TAF's Appraisal Qualifications Board (AQB) promulgates minimum standards for appraiser certification and licensing. The federal government does not regulate appraisers directly. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC), with members from the major Federal Lending Regulators, oversees TAF and the state licensing agencies. If ASC finds that a particular state's appraiser regulation and certification program is inadequate (i.e., it doesn't meet ASB and AQB standards), it can impose penalties including prohibition of a state's licensed appraisers from performing appraisals for federally related lending transactions. Banks make widespread use of appraisals in their real estate lending activity mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, Appraisal procurement would be much more difficult without in-state availability of ASC compliant, licensed appraisers.  History  In the mid 1980s, the crisis in the savings and loan industry highlighted the need to improve appraisal practices throughout the United States. The difficulties and losses experienced by many lending institutions illustrated the importance of ensuring that appraisals are based upon established, recognized standards, free from outside pressures. In 1986, nine leading professional appraisal organizations in the United States and Canada to form the Ad Hoc Committee on the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. These nine groups were: *Appraisal Institute of Canada *American Institute of Real estate Appraisers (AIREA) *American Society of Appraisers *American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers *International Association of Assessing Officers *International Right of Way Association *National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers *National Society of Real Estate Appraisers *Society of Real Estate Appraisers (In 1991, AIREA and the Society of Real Estate Appraisers merged under the new name Appraisal Institute.) Agreeing upon a generally accepted set of standards, the eight United States committee members adopted those standards and thereafter established The Appraisal Foundation in 1987 to implement the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The Appraiser Qualifications Board was included in the Foundation structure to develop and promote meaningful criteria by which the competence of appraisers could be measured. The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice was adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Foundation on January 30, 1989 and is recognized throughout the United States as the generally accepted standards of professional appraisal practice. The work of the Foundation is important to all disciplines of the appraisal profession as well as to the consumer public. The work of the Foundation benefits the appraisal profession by functioning to increase the quality of appraisals and by addressing issues critical to the advancement professional valuation. Users of appraisal services and consumers can feel confident that the Foundation is working to serve their needs and help protect their financial well-being. The Appraisal Foundation is composed of other organizations. There are no individual members of the Foundation. Today, through Sponsoring Organizations and Advisory Councils, over one hundred organizations, corporations and government agencies are affiliated with The Appraisal Foundation.

The Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB) establishes the Real Property Appraiser Qualification Criteria for state licensing, certification and recertification of appraisers. FIRREA mandates that all state certified appraisers must meet the minimum education, experience and examination requirements promulgated by the AQB. The AQB has also developed voluntary criteria for personal property appraisers. The Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) establishes the rules for developing an appraisal and reporting its results. In addition, it promotes the use, understanding and enforcement of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) as required by FIRREA. The Appraisal Practices Board (APB) was formed by Board of Trustees in 2010. The APB is charged with the responsibility of identifying and issuing opinions on recognized valuation methods and techniques, which may apply to all disciplines within the appraisal profession.

J. A. Feuchtmayer was born in Linz, a member of the famous Feuchtmayer family of the Wessobrunner School. He was the son of Franz Joseph Feuchtmayer (1660-1718); the nephew of Johann Michael Feuchtmayer (the Elder) and Michael Feuchtmayer (b. 1667); the first cousin of Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer (the Elder) (1705-1764) and Johann Michael Feuchtmayer (the Younger) (1709-1772); and the first cousin once removed of Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer (the Younger) (b. 1735). Joseph Anton began studying sculpture in Augsburg in 1715 and did work in Weingarten starting in 1718. After the death of his father Franz Joseph, he took over his father's workshop in Mimmenhausen. At the same time, he became the \\"house sculptor\\" of the monastery in Salem, delivering for them his first commission, the organ case for the Salemer Münster. Feuchtmayer was influenced by (among others) the Italian stuccoist Diego Francesco Carlone, with whom he worked in Weingarten. From him, he learned the production techniques for creating the stucco figures with highly polished surfaces that would make Feuchtmayer famous. Alongside such notable artists as Johann Joseph Christian and Franz Joseph Spiegler, Feuchtmayer worked for the most part on the Baroque monastic churches along the Upper Swabian Baroque Route. His most well-known work is the putto on the Bernhardsaltar in Birnau called the \\"Honigschlecker\\" (\\"honey eater\\"), a reference St. Bernard's rhetorical gift.Germany: A Phaidon Cultural Guide.

It was developed from the famous Zastava M70 assault rifle, the modified copy of the Soviet AKM assault rifle, but with a Western type flash eliminator added on the barrel end, chambered in also Western, 5.56×45mm NATO caliber, and with that a different magazine design, similar to Western STANAG magazine The M90 was intended to replace the M70 in the Yugoslav army, but the breakup of Yugoslavia disrupted the production and the weapon today remains rare and was never formally used, probably due to lack of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. Overview The Zastava M90 is the modified version of Zastava M80, itself a version of the Zastava M70 (chambered in the Western 5.56×45mm NATO round), also comes with a flash eliminator and different magazine design, which means that like its predecessor, the M90 is a modified Soviet AKM. It is gas-operated, air-cooled and magazine-fed, shoulder fired weapon with selective fire capability, and like M70, can launch rifle grenades and has a rifle grenade sight added on the gas tube, instead of under barrel grenade launcher like on most other AK variants. It also incorporates the adjustable gas system from its M76, M77 and B1 cousins, with the third gas position being the gas cutoff for grenades. Like all Zastava produces AK variants, the M90 can be identified from the originals by its longer lower wooden handguard design, which has three cooling vents, no bulge and like the stock, is made out of different wood type. Also, due to using Western round, this particular model also has different magazine design, similar to Western STANAG and a Western type flash eliminator, similar to one used on American M16 assault rifle.

The only other notice of it is found in the Itineraries, from which we learn that it was situated on the high-road from Capua to Rhegium (modern Reggio di Calabria), at the point of junction with another line of road which led from Venusia by Potentia (modern Potenza) and Grumentum towards the frontiers of Bruttium (Itin. Ant. pp. 105, 110; Tab. Peut.). The names and distances in this part of the Tabula are too corrupt and confused to be of any service: the Itinerary of Antoninus places it 14 miles (or according to another passage 16 miles) north of Muranum, the site of which is clearly ascertained at Morano Calabro. If the former distance be adopted as correct, it must have been situated at, or in the neighbourhood of, Rotonda, near the sources of the river Lao (Holsten. Not. ad Cluv. p. 293; Romanelli, vol. i. p. 389). The editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World place Nerulum at Castelluccio (in the Province of Potenza, Basilicata, Italy).

It is the fourth of five animated adaptations of the X-Men characters, the other four being Pryde of the X-Men, X-Men: The Animated Series, X-Men: Evolution, and an anime adaptation known simply as X-Men. Plot The story begins with Wolverine and Rogue having an argument about him leaving. When Wolverine goes to Charles and Jean Grey, they get headaches. An explosion occurs, and Charles and Jean disappear. The resulting trauma caused the X-Men team to disband and go their separate ways, leaving Xavier's once highly revered league of mutant peace preservers out of commission. Due to the loss of the Professor, Jean, and severe damage to the mansion, many of the X-Men have withered in their faith towards the stability of their former team and have since detached themselves from their former community. Some examples include Cyclops' subsequent isolation resulting from Jean's disappearance, Storm's relocation back to her home continent of Africa, and Iceman's move back into his parents' home in the quiet suburbs. One year later, the MRD (short for the Mutant Response Division), a government-supported organization created for the detainment and subsequent registration of existing mutants, begins capturing mutants from all over the country in response to the countless human protesters determined to protect the safety of humankind. This course of action causes Wolverine and Beast to ally and resolve to bring the once defunct X-Men team back together again. Meanwhile, Rogue is in the street and attacked by the Brotherhood of Mutants. They trick her into joining them, and she later smiles devilishly as she enters their base, appearing to have switched allegiance to become an evil mutant. Thanks to the generosity, wealth, and resourcefulness of Angel, the slowly reforming X-Men team begins to see a promising return to its former glory with the rejoining of junior members Iceman, Shadowcat and Forge along with the reconstruction of the previously demolished Xavier Institute. Unfortunately, without the necessary capabilities of a competent telepath to operate Cerebro, the possibility of locating some of the more globally scattered X-Men members along with the missing Charles Xavier and Jean seems all but a pipe dream. Fortunately, this problem does not last for very long when Emma Frost, the beautiful former Headmistress of a now inactive mutant school of her own in Massachusetts, makes a surprising appearance on the doorstep of the Mansion with an interesting proposal: membership with the X-Men in exchange for utilizing her telepathy to pinpoint the missing Xavier's whereabouts. Upon the team's – and particularly Wolverine's – reluctant acceptance of the offer, Emma's efforts prove successful as she is able to locate a comatose Charles on the shores of Genosha in the care of Magneto. After their arrival on Genosha and a short confrontation with the Master of Magnetism himself, Magneto eventually permits the X-Men to take his old friend's body back to the sanctity of the Mansion where he is certain that Xavier will be placed in proper care. Upon their return, Xavier telepathically contacts the X-Men twenty years from the present in an alternate dystopian future and informs Wolverine that he is to lead and reunite the X-Men if they wish to successfully prevent the inevitable war that will cause the world to fall under the domination of Master Mold and the Sentinels. Throughout the course of the entire season, Emma's role as the X-Men's primary acting telepath enables the team to relocate the rest of the other members in the hopes of reforming once again and assisting in Xavier's cause. While some were met with initial hesitancy such as with Nightcrawler, others such as Storm were more than willing to accept the offer once Xavier's vision had been put into perspective. The X-Men overcome many hardships and obstacles along the way, eventually achieving their ultimate goal of locating Jean and finally discovering the truth surrounding the mystery of what caused the Mansion's explosion, along with Xavier and Jean's subsequent disappearances. Meanwhile, Magneto welcomes new mutants to Genosha, one of whom is Nightcrawler. Magneto claims that Genosha is a safe and secure area for mutants, rather than a threat. At first Nightcrawler believes this, but upon closer inspection, Genosha is exposed as a method to use mutants' powers by Magneto. Nightcrawler eventually escapes, but is captured by Mystique when he arrives back at the mansion. Elsewhere, Wolverine begins to have some visions from the past, and Emma offers to sort out his visions telepathically. In his visions, Wolverine meets a lone mutant girl, figure from the past Sabretooth, and finally discovers many mysteries about his past. Cyclops has constant memories about Jean and is depressed. He believes she is still alive, so, with the help of Emma, he seeks out Mister Sinister. The X-Men and Mister Sinister have a confrontation that does not result in them finding out any new info about Jean's whereabouts. Wolverine has Cyclops swear an oath to be in the X-Men again and promise not to go off searching for Jean. Somewhere across town, Jean is shown waking up in a random hospital after months of being in a coma. It is later revealed in the three-part first-season finale \\"Foresight\\" that the previously assumed attack on the Mansion was not from the efforts of a third party, but rather from the result of Jean who unwittingly releases the immense and highly destructive strength and power of the Phoenix Force, that originally lay dormant deep within her subconscious, in an attempt to halt an oncoming telepathic attack led by Emma (who was secretly working as a double agent for the Inner Circle and the Stepford Cuckoos). Along with Sebastian Shaw, Selene, Harry Leland, and Donald Pierce, it was the Inner Circle's utmost duty to not only obtain the power of the Phoenix Force by abducting Jean from the protection of Xavier and the Mansion, but to also obliterate the ancient being's existence before it could fully mature and consequently bring forth unparalleled destruction onto the world as it had done numerous times in the past throughout Earth's history. However, in a move that was completely unknown to Emma at the time, the rest of the Inner Circle members all shared an entirely different and more sinister vision than Frost had initially believed: to control and manipulate the power of the Phoenix Force and have it cater to their own hidden agenda. Upon realizing the error of her ways, Emma betrays the Inner Circle and attempts to redeem herself in the eyes of the X-Men by not only rescuing Jean but, by also following through with her original plan of destroying the cosmic entity before it could mature. Unfortunately, her actions result in her apparent death. Rogue apologizes to Wolverine, and finally rejoins the X-Men for good. The now fully reformed X-Men are praised for their actions by Professor Xavier, but are warned of a new danger approaching: the Age of Apocalypse. Characters The overall situations and the look of the series and character designs were inspired by the Astonishing X-Men comic series. =X-Men= Present X-Men *Wolverine / Logan Howlett (Leader) *Cyclops / Scott Summers *White Queen / Emma Frost *Beast / Hank McCoy *Storm / Ororo Munroe *Nightcrawler / Kurt Wagner *Angel / Warren Worthington III *Shadowcat / Kitty Pryde *Iceman / Bobby Drake *Rogue / Anna-Marie D'Ancanto *Forge / Jonathon Silvercloud *Dark Phoenix / Jean Grey Future X-Men * Professor X / Charles Xavier\\"Hindsight (Part 1)\\" * Bishop / Lucas Bishop * Berzerker / Ray Carter * Domino / Neena Thurman\\"Hindsight (Part 2)\\" * Hellion / Julian Keller * Kamal * Marrow / Sarah Rushman * Polaris / Lorna Dane (Daughter of Magneto, younger sister to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch) * Rover (a Sentinel who has befriended the future X-Men) * Vanisher / Telford Porter * Wolverine / Logan Howlett * X-23 / Laura Kinney (Wolverine's female clone) =Brotherhood of Mutants= * Quicksilver / Pietro Maximoff (Son of Magneto, twin brother of Scarlet Witch, older brother of Polaris) * Avalanche / Dominikos Petrakis * Blob / Fred Dukes * Toad / Mortimer Toynbee * Domino / Neena Thurman * Rogue / Anna-Marie D'Ancanto =Acolytes= * Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr\\"Hindsight (Part 3)\\" * Mystique / Raven Darkholme\\"Greetings From Genosha\\" * Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff (Daughter of Magneto, twin sister of Quicksilver, older sister of Polaris) * Polaris / Lorna Dane\\"Battle Lines\\" (Daughter of Magneto) * Scanner / Sarah Ryall * Pyro / John Allerdyce * Blink / Clarice Ferguson * Juggernaut / Cain Marko * Mercury / Cessily Kincaid * Mellencamp / Seamus Mellencamp * Senyaka / Suvik Senyaka * Kleinstock Brothers =Marauders= * Mister Sinister / Nathaniel Essex\\"eXcessive Force\\" * Arclight / Phillippa Sontag * Blockbuster / Michael Baer * Harpoon / Kodiak Noatak * Multiple Man / Jamie Madrox * Vertigo * Archangel / Warren Worthington III\\"Guardian Angel\\" =Inner Circle= * Sebastian Shaw\\"Shades of Grey\\" * Donald Pierce * Harry Leland * Selene Gallio * Emma Frost * Stepford Cuckoos\\"Foresight, Part I\\" =MRD/Project: Wideawake= * Sen.

Joshua Fine also revealed that Holocaust, Sunfire, and Unus The Untouchable would have made appearances in season 2. =Cancellation= On April 13, 2010, Comics Continuum reported that (according to an inside source) a second season seemed very unlikely. On April 15, 2010, Marvel Animation Age confirmed the recent report that Wolverine and the X-Men would not be returning for a second season. The reason for this was due to financial problems with their financing partner due to Disney purchasing Marvel while Fox owned the movie rights to the X-Men. =Later allusions in other Marvel media= * Steven Blum, Tom Kane, and Fred Tatasciore reprise their respective roles as Wolverine, Professor Thornton, and Hulk in Hulk Vs.

The Goldbach function is studied in relation to Goldbach's conjecture. The function g(E) is defined for all even integers E > 2 to be the number of different ways in which E can be expressed as the sum of two primes. For example, g(22) = 3 since 22 can be expressed as the sum of two primes in three different ways (22 = 11+11 = 5+17 = 3+19). Image:goldbachs comet.gif The coloring of points in the above image is based on the value of E/2 modulo 3 with red points corresponding to 0 mod 3, blue points corresponding to 1 mod 3 and green points corresponding to 2 mod 3. In other words, the red points are multiples of 6; the blue points are of the form \\"a multiple of 6, plus 2\\"; and the green points are multiples of 6 plus 4.  Anatomy of the Goldbach Comet  An illuminating way of presenting the comet data is as a histogram. The function g(E) can be normalized by dividing by the locally averaged value of g, gav, taken over perhaps 1000 neighboring values of the even number E. The histogram can then be accumulated over a range of up to about 10% either side of a central E. right Such a histogram appears on the right. A series of well-defined peaks is evident. Each of these peaks can be identified as being formed by a set of values of E/2 which have certain smallest factors. The major peaks correspond to lowest factors of 3, 5, 7 ... as labeled. As the lowest factors become higher the peaks move left and eventually merge to give the lowest value primary peak. There is in fact a hierarchy of peaks; the main peaks are composed of subsidiary peaks, with a succession of second smallest factors of E/2. This hierarchy continues until all factors are exhausted. right The magnified section shows the succession of subsidiary peaks in more detail. The relative location of the peaks follows from the form developed by Hardy and Littlewood:G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood, \\"Some problems of 'partitio numerorum'; III: on the expression of a number as a sum of primes\\", Acta Mathematica, vol. 44, pp. 1-70, 1922. :\\\\frac{g(E)}{g_{av}} = \\\\Pi_{2}\\\\prod\\\\frac{(p-1)}{(p-2)}\\\\,,\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad(1) where the product is taken over all primes p that are factors of E/2. The factor on the right is Hardy–Littlewood's twin prime constant :\\\\Pi_{2} = \\\\prod_{p>2}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{(p-1)^{2}}\\\\right) = 0.6601618... Here the product is taken over all primes greater than 2. right Of particular interest is the peak formed by selecting only values of E/2 that are prime. The product factor in equation (1) is then very close to 1. The peak is very close to a Gaussian form (shown in gray). For this range of E values, the peak location is within 0.03% of the ideal \\\\Pi_{2}. When histograms are formed for different average values of E, the width of this (primes only) peak is found to be proportional to 1/\\\\sqrt{g_{pav}(E)}. However, it is a factor of about 1.85 less than the value \\\\sqrt{2/g_{pav}(E)} that would be expected from a hypothesis of totally random occurrence of prime-pair matching. This may be expected, since there are correlations that give rise to the separated peaks in the total histogram. right Returning to the full range of E/2 rather than just primes, it is seen that other peaks associated with specified lowest factors of E/2 can also be fitted by a Gaussian, but only on their lower shoulder. The upper shoulder, being formed by an aggregate of subsidiary peaks, lies above the simple Gaussian form. The relative heights of the peaks in the total histogram are representative of the populations of various types of E/2 having differing factors. The heights are approximately inversely proportional to \\\\Pi\\\\,p, the products of the lowest factors. Thus the height of the peak marked (3,5) in the overall histogram is about 1/15 of the main peak. Heights may vary from this by about 20%; their exact value is a complex function of the way in which the peaks are constituted from their components and of their varying width. It is interesting to speculate on the possibility of any number E having zero prime pairs, taking these Gaussian forms as probabilities, and assuming it is legitimate to extrapolate to the zero-pair point. If this is done, the probability of zero pairs for any one E, in the range considered here, is of order 10−3700. The integrated probability over all E to infinity, taking into account the narrowing of the peak width, is not much larger. Any search for violation of the Goldbach conjecture may reasonably be expected to have these odds to contend with.

Like its predecessor, the Zastava M76, the M91 is internally based upon an elongated version of the AK-47 design, but the M91 shares more external similarities with the Dragunov sniper rifle than the M76. The rifle is in service with the Serbian army, where it replaced the M76, which was chambered for the 7.92×57mm cartridge. History Zastava's website claims that the M91 rifle was designed after a long and careful study of combat tactics and experience of military and police special forces worldwide; and that its development has been carried out under supervision and in close cooperation with some of the most experienced and capable special and anti- terrorist units. Current modernisation of Serbian forces is proceeding on the basis of a plan designed during the late 1990s known as Model-21. It envisages upgrading personal equipment in 26 different categories, of which only five will be imported from abroad. One of the important new developments is the introduction of a series of domestically developed systems such as M91 7.62×54mmR sniper rifle (a requirement resulting from the decision to withdraw the 8×57mm IS chambering used in the Zastava M76 sniper rifle and SARAC M53 \\"šarac\\" machine gun).Conflict Studies Research Centre Balkans Series 04/05 Design details The M91 is a semi-automatic rifle fed from detachable 10-round box magazines. In concept, it is similar to the Soviet Dragunov sniper/designated marksman rifle. While the design of the M91 is based upon an elongated version of the AK-47 design just like its predecessor, the Zastava M76, the M91 features several modifications, bringing it closer to the Dragunov rifle. The separate stock and pistol grip used on the M76 have been replaced with a thumbhole stock made of synthetic polymer material resembling that used on the Russian rifle. The 7.62×54mmR chambering of the Zastava M91 is the same as used in the Dragunov. The 7.62×54mmR is suited for long-range use, and replaced the 8×57mm IS round in Serbian service. The barrel profile is relatively thin to save weight and is ended with a slotted flash suppressor. The barrel’s bore is chrome-lined for increased corrosion resistance, and features 4 right-hand grooves with a twist rate of 240 mm (1:9.4 in). Overall, the design of the flash suppressor, the detachable box magazine, the simplified PSO-type rangefinder reticle used in earlier Zrak telescopic sights, the thumbhole stock and modified bolt carrier as well as a milled receiver strongly point at the Dragunov as the M91's design template. A side-rail on the left wall of the receiver accepts various telescopic sights and night optics. The standard daylight telescopic sight for the M91 is the ZRAK ON 6 × 42. For low light conditions the rifle can also be equipped with PN 5 × 80 passive sights of the first and second generation of Night vision devices. The optical sight can be removed from the rail and reinstalled without loss of zero. The rifle features adjustable backup iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 1 to . These can be employed when the primary optical sight is damaged.

The story is by Darryl F. Zanuck. The film was released by the Warner Bros. studio. It is representative of the transition from silent movies to \\"talkies\\", although it is essentially a hybrid film known as a part-talkie, which used the new Vitaphone sound-on-disc system.Noah's Ark at the silentera.com database Most scenes are silent with a synchronized music score and sound effects, in particular the biblical ones, while some scenes have dialogue.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993: Noah's Ark Plot The film opens after the great flood, with Noah and his family outside of the Ark praising the Lord. Then comes depictions of the building of the Tower of Babel and the worshipping of the golden calf. Then it switches to the eve of World War I. The theme of the gold calf is carried forward by a scene in which a bankrupted trader (Otto Hoffman) shoots his uncaring stockbroker. In 1914, American playboy Travis (George O'Brien) and his New York taxi driver buddy Al (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) are traveling aboard the \\"Oriental Express\\" train. Travis helps a pious minister (Paul McAllister) reclaim his seat from a rude fellow passenger. A washed-out bridge causes a deadly derailment. Travis and Al rescue Marie (Dolores Costello), a German member of a small theatrical troupe, from underneath the wreckage with the help of a prisoner (Malcolm Waite) who had just unhandcuffed himself from a now-dead escort. At the nearby lodge where they take shelter, fellow survivor Nickoloff (Noah Beery), an officer in the Russian Secret Service, tries to sneak into Marie's room. When Travis objects, a fight breaks out, during which Nickoloff is cut on the hand by a bottle he was wielding. They are interrupted by French soldiers, who announce that war has broken out. Travis, Al and Marie sneak away in the confusion and head to Paris together. Travis and Marie fall in love. When America enters the war, Al enlists as soon as he can. Travis tells him he cannot, as he has married Marie. However, when he later sees Al marching with his unit down the streets of Paris, he impulsively joins up as well. He loses touch with his wife. Travis and Al meet by chance in the trenches. They are each assigned a squad to attack a machine gun nest holding up the American offensive. Tragically, Travis tosses a hand grenade into the position, not knowing that Al had captured it moments before. Al is fatally wounded, but lives long enough to bid his friend adieu. Later, Nickoloff spots Marie in a group of dancers entertaining the troops. He threatens to have her arrested as a German spy unless she meets him later. When she tries to sneak away, he carries through his threat, and she is sentenced to face a firing squad. She is comforted by the minister from the train. Travis, who by chance is part of the squad, recognizes her in the nick of time. Then the couple and others are trapped below a demolished building by a German artillery barrage. The minister compares the war and its flood of blood to the biblical story of Noah's Ark. The film reverts to that time, with the actors playing second roles. King Nephilim (Beery) has converted his subjects into worshippers of the god Jaghuth. Only Noah (McAllister) and his family remain faithful to Jehovah. Following Jehovah's command, Noah and his three sons (O'Brien, Williams and Waite) begin building the Ark on a mountainside. Nephilim orders the sacrifice of the most beautiful virgin in his realm to his god in a month. His soldiers choose Miriam (Costello), a handmaiden of Noah's. When Noah's son Japheth (O'Brien) tries to save her, he is blinded and set to labor turning a stone-mill with other prisoners. Just as Miriam is about to be slain, Jehovah unleashes his wrath, with the great flood destroying and drowning everything in its path. Among the chaos, Japheth, freed from his chains, finds and carries Miriam back to the Ark, where Jehovah restores his sight. Nephilim tries to climb aboard the Ark, only to have the door slam on his hand, inflicting the same injuries Nickoloff suffered. Returning to World War I, the trapped group is freed. Soon after they emerge, they learn that the Armistice has been signed and the war is over.

Dolores Costello caught a severe case of pneumonia. Thirty-five ambulances attended the wounded. Portions of the movie were filmed at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, and the location was incorporated into an iconic special effects shot that opens the film. The shot depicts the massive ark \\"beached\\" on the giant boulders of the movie ranch's Garden of the Gods, which later would become famous for appearances in hundreds of movies including John Ford's Stagecoach (1939). Release and re-release Czech movie poster for the 1930 release in Prague of the sound version The film premiered in Hollywood in late 1928, with a running time of 135 minutes. Originally, it had been planned as a silent film in 1926 for potential release in 1927, but a number of talking sequences were added. (These were directed not by Michael Curtiz but by Roy Del Ruth.) After the premiere, Warner Bros. withdrew the film for extensive revision, which included removing about a half-hour of footage, including all the talking scenes featuring Paul McAllister, who played both a minister and Noah. The film then opened around the country in reserved-seat engagements, after which it concluded its successful run at popular prices, even though by that time \\"part-talking\\" films like this one were considered nearly obsolete. Although it had cost far more than any Warner Bros. film to date—over $1 million—it ultimately grossed more than twice its cost.

Oxford University Press 2009 or strap). This makes the artifact more useful by allowing it to be shot (arrow), thrown (spear), or used with more effective leverage (axe). When constructed properly, hafting can tremendously improve a weapon's damage and range. It is estimated that hafted weapons were most common during the Upper Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic. It was one of the first tools where hominins took separate elements and united them into a single tool. The development of hafting was considered a significant milestone by archaeologists. It was not only an improvement in the technology at the time; it also showed the progression of the human mind toward a world of complex tool-making. Hafting weapons is perhaps best known for its use by humans in prehistory, but it is still practiced by enthusiasts today and the handle of a tool such as an ax is still known as a haft. Many people still practice the hafting techniques by using old-fashioned methods to figure out the best way to attach a handle onto tools, while improving the overall structure and function. Hafting has evolved through the past and the idea can still be seen in the structure of modern-day tools such as hammers and axes. The evolution of hand tools would be greatly altered had the people of our past failed to invent the idea of hafting. The methods and processes of hafting have also varied and evolved over time. The hafting process Flint (tool) There must be some way to attach the artifact to the strap or shaft, and to this end, flanges are often created on one end (the end opposite the cutting edge). Flanges are produced by a process of knapping or grinding the excess stone away, resulting in indentations in the piece. If a shaft or handle is to be used, it must also be prepared in some way. Wood is frequently used (in the US, commonly Bigleaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum) due to its soft structure that eases chipping away at the end of the shaft to which the tool is to be affixed. A good piece of wood has a diameter large enough to provide adequate strength yet small enough to hold comfortably for long periods of time. A common practice of hafting is to remove the outer layer of bark where the handhold would be to prevent cuts and the painful imperfections found in the bark. Attaching the tool to the shaft can be difficult which is why there are two main methods used to soften the wooden shaft including burning the end, and/or soaking it in water. These soften the material to easily allow the slits to be cut vertically into the center of the shaft. This provides a place for the \\"head\\" of the tool or weapon to fit. Alternatively, the shaft may be split down the center which allows the artifact to fully sit within the shaft, and once fully wrapped up, can be much stronger. The artifact can then be inserted into the slit and fixed to the shaft by tying around the flanges with a suitable material. Materials such as the Australian Sea Grass Cordage and split deer intestine can be used due to its high strength and durability once installed. Some people will wrap the material around the handle as well to add grip. The main disadvantage of wrapping the tool onto the shaft arises after usage when the fibers lose their tension and become loose. High humidity is also a contributing factor to the fibers losing tension. On occasion, glue is added for extra support. When glue or any other resin is used, the hafting is said to be mastic. Mastic hafts are also very strong and reliable since there is little to no movement of the tool. Glue also has the advantage of absorbing shock when hardened, which helps with cushioning. Before industrial glue was readily available, people would use a variety of plant or animal materials to make glue. Many prehistoric types of glue were a combination of materials, such as animal feces, tree bark, and charcoal. The main downside of mastic hafts is the time consuming and difficult construction process. Alternatively, the head may simply be forced into the shaft, if the shaft is soft enough, eliminating the need for a slit (and perhaps improving durability). If a strap is used, it is tied directly to the flanges of the artifact. Generally, it takes a much longer time to create the actual haft binding than it does the tool used in the half. The tool, such as a projectile point, typically takes up to twenty minutes whereas the haft binding takes several hours. Often many times throughout a haft's life cycle, the tool will be replaced or sharpened and reattached to the shaft to keep the haft as effective and precise as possible. Hafting in prehistory More than 125,000 years ago, early Archaic humans such as Homo heidelbergensis developed the extensive use of hafted stone tools. Over time, hafting evolved and tools became deadlier with more control. Evolution has brought hafts with small shafts and dull stone tools to longer stronger shafts with sharper, narrower tools that were better suited for piercing and cutting. In much more recent times, hafted axes and weapons have benefited from tapering. By offsetting the diameters of a tool with a cylindrical base, and a hole in the shaft, a much more secure fit can be made, assuring the ax head stays in place. Hafting stone points, in particular, was an important advancement in the weapons of early humans. These hafted stone points increased the force and effectiveness of these tools, therefore, allowing people to hunt and kill animals more efficiently. The increased efficiency of hunting and killing animals is believed to have allowed for people of this time to have regular access to meat and other high-quality foods. The increase in the consumption of meat around this time could be directly linked to increases in brain size that are reported in the archaeology record of this time. The invention of hafting by people more than hundreds of thousands of years ago has directly contributed to the health and lives of people in the past and also people in the future. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that ~500,000-year-old stone points from the archaeological site of Kathu Pan 1 (KP1), South Africa, functioned as spear tips. This has led teams of researchers to come to the conclusion that common ancestors of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals started hafting almost 500,000 years ago.

Structure Viruses in the genus Totivirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral symmetry, and T=2 architecture. The diameter is around 40 nm. Genome Genome of genus totivirus Totiviruses have a genome of 4700–6700 nucleotides in length and only a single copy of the genome is present in the particle. The nucleic acid content of a totivirus capsid is usually of one segment but can also contain three or four segments of linear double stranded RNA. The genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). These open reading frames (ORFs) code for a capsid protein (CP) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The 5' end of the positive strand of the dsRNA genome has no cap and is very structured. Totiviruses contain a long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) which functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Totiviruses can have satellite RNAs encoding a toxin. Life cycle S. cerevisiae virus L-A Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by virus remains intracellular. Replication follows the double-stranded RNA virus replication model. Double-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. The virus exits the host cell by cell-to-cell movement. Fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae and smut serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted during cell division, sporogenesis, and cell fusion.

Hugó Scheiber (born 29 September 1873 in Budapest - died there 7 March 1950) was a Hungarian modernist painter.Hugo Scheiber artist and art...the-artists.org Life Hugó Scheiber was brought from Budapest to Vienna at the age of eight where his father worked as a sign painter for the Prater Theater. At fifteen, he returned with his family to Budapest and began working during the day to help support them and attending painting classes at the School of Design in the evening, where Henrik Papp was one of his teachers. He completed his studies in 1900. His work was at first in a post-Impressionistic style but from 1910 onward showed his increasing interest in German Expressionism and Futurism. This made it of little interest to the conservative Hungarian art establishment. However, in 1915 he met the great Italian avant-gardist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and the two painters became close friends. Marinetti invited him to join the Futurist Movement. The uniquely modernist style that he developed was, however, closer to German Expressionism than to Futurism and eventually drifted toward an international art deco manner similar to Erté's. In 1919, he and his friend Béla Kádar held an exhibition at the Hevesy Salon in Vienna. It was a great success and at last caused the Budapest Art Museum to acquire some of Scheiber's drawings. Encouraged, Scheiber came back to live in Vienna in 1920. A turning point in Scheiber's career came a year later, when Herwarth Walden, founder of Germany's leading avant-garde periodical, Der Sturm, and of the Sturm Gallery in Berlin, became interested in Scheiber's work. Scheiber moved to Berlin in 1922, and his paintings soon appeared regularly in Walden's magazine and elsewhere. Exhibitions of his work followed in London, Rome, La Paz, and New York. Scheiber's move to Germany coincided with a significant exodus of Hungarian artists to Berlin, including Lászlo Moholy-Nagy and Sándor Bortnyik. There had been a major split in ideology among the Hungarian avant-garde. The Constructivist and leader of the Hungarian avantgarde, Lajos Kassák (painted by Hugó Scheiber in 1930) believed that art should relate to all the needs of contemporary humankind. Thus he refused to compromise the purity of his style to reflect the demands of either the ruling class or socialists and communists. The other camp believed that an artist should be a figurehead for social and political change. The fall out and factions that resulted from this politicisation resulted in most of the Hungarian avantgardists leaving Vienna for Berlin. Hungarian émigrés made up one of the largest minority groups in the German capital and the influx of their painters had a significant effect on Hungarian and international art. Apart from the political activists, there were independent Modernists such as Scheiber and Kádár, who hoped to find fertile ground for their aesthetic and social idealism. Hugó Scheiber, among others, suddenly found himself in the upper echelons of the dynamic Berlin art world. Another turning point of Scheiber's career came in 1926, with the New York exhibition of the Société Anonyme, organized by Katherine Dreier. Scheiber and other important avantgarde artists from more than twenty-three countries were represented. In 1933, Scheiber was invited by Marinetti to participate in the great meeting of the Futurists held in Rome in late April 1933, Mostra Nazionale d’Arte Futurista where he was received with great enthusiasm. Gradually, the Hungarian artists began to return home, particularly with the rise of Nazism in Germany. Kádar went back from Berlin in about 1932 and Scheiber followed in 1934. He was then at the peak of his powers and had a special flair in depicting café and cabaret life in vivid colors, sturdily abstracted forms and spontaneous brush strokes. Scheiber depicted cosmopolitan modern life using stylized shapes and expressive colors. His preferred subjects were cabaret and street scenes, jazz musicians, flappers, and a series of self-portraits (usually with a cigar). A highly prolific workman, he produced well over 1500 works (nearly 1300 are still listed on www.artnet.com), his principal media being gouache and oil. He was a member of the prestigious New Society of Artists (KUT—Képzőművészek Új Társasága) and seems to have weathered Hungary's post–World War II transition to state-communism without difficulty. He continued to be well regarded, eventually even receiving the posthumous honor of having one of his images used for a Soviet postage stamp (see image above). Hugó Scheiber died in Budapest in 1950. Museums and Exhibits Paintings by Hugó Scheiber form part of permanent museum collections in Budapest (Hungarian National Museum), Pecs (Jannus Pannonius Museum), Vienna, New York, Bern and elsewhere.

Ziegler (March 1, 1911, Munich, Germany - December 11, 1999 Colts Neck Township, New Jersey, United States) was a pioneer in the field of communication satellites and the use of photovoltaic solar cells as a power source for satellites. Life Hans Ziegler was born in Munich, Germany. There, he studied at the Technische Hochschule, which is today the Technische Universität München (TUM), and began his career as Wissenschaftlicher Assistant (Scientific Assistant). Following that, he was a researcher in German industry for ten years. During the Second World War, he worked for the company Rosental Selb in Bavaria on high tension porcelain. In 1947, he came to the US with Wernher von Braun under Operation Paperclip, by means of which the USA gained German engineers and scientists. He went to the US Army Signal Corps' Laboratories in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and became a US citizen in 1954. Ziegler's work in the US was very influential in the development of military electronics, especially in the electronics for the early phases of the US space program. During the thirty years he worked as an engineer in the field of electronics and electrical engineering in the research and development department of the U.S. Army in Fort Monmouth, N.J. (from 1947 to 1976), he held the top position of Chief Scientist for 12 years.IEEE Archival Collection In Fort Monmouth, he worked as a Scientific Consultant, Assistant Director of Research, Director of the Astro-Electronics Division and Chief Scientist (1959). After the Army was restructured, he became Deputy for Science and Chief Scientist of the US Army Electronics Command in 1963 and Director of the US Army Electronics Technology & Devices Laboratory from 1971 until his retirement. In May 1954, after examining the solar cells of Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson at Bell Laboratories, Ziegler wrote, \\"Future development [of the silicon solar cell] may well render it into an important source of electrical power [as] the roofs of all our buildings in cities and towns equipped with solar [cells] would be sufficient to produce this country's entire demand for electrical power.\\"John Perlin, From Space to Earth; The Story of Solar Electricity, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1999, Referring to silicon solar cells, he said to the head of the U. S. Signal Corps, General James O'Connell, at a meeting in September 1955, \\"In fact, in the long run, mankind has no choice but to turn to the sun if it wants to survive.\\" He and his team produced a report on the prospects for application of this technique in the field of communication and they named the supply of energy for artificial satellites as the most important application. He knew that he was not the first to suggest this application. For example, the science fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke had already made this suggestion in 1945, but without having a concrete technology for it at that time. Ziegler participated in the development of the first planned satellites. The first satellite, Explorer 1, still went into space without solar cells, since it was a quick, less-than-ideal solution after the start of the Sputnik to show the American public that America's scientists could also start a satellite. The actual scheduled satellite project, Project Vanguard, successfully put a satellite named Vanguard I in orbit around Earth on March 17, 1958. Over the objections of the Navy, which still thought that solar cells were not a mature technology, this satellite had four solar cells on its outer hull, due to the persistent work of Ziegler, which powered the instruments and performed their duties reliably for more than seven years. After this success, solar cells were established as the energy supply for satellites. He was also involved with the development of the first communication satellite in the world, SCORE, which was started in 1958. He was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the US Department of Defense in 1963 as a \\" world pioneer in communications satellites and solar energy systems to power satellites\\". When he retired in 1977, he was decorated with the highest award of the Army for \\"exceptional civilian service\\". Ziegler was the author of many technical papers, a member of the IEEE, and represented the US, in military and civilian matters, in many national and international committees. In 1958, he was a member of the US delegation to the International Geophysical Year in Moscow, USSR, and in 1964, he gave advice on the scientific activities in Antarctica and at the South Pole, under the direction of the US National Science Foundation. Ziegler's wife Friederike died in 1996. He last lived in Colts Neck Township, New Jersey and died at the age of 88 on December 11, 1999. He was survived by his daughters, Christine Griffith and Friederike Meindl, and his son, Hans.

She was an authority on biological weapons and published four books on the topic. Biography Born (March 6, 1943) Jean Elizabeth Garrigan in Brooklyn, New York City, she was raised in Rutherford, New Jersey and received a bachelor's degree (1968) in social psychology from Harvard University. In 1973, she completed a PhD in sociology and anthropology at Brandeis University. She taught at Boston College from 1972 until 2005. While at Boston College, Guillemin did extensive research on hospital technology and medical ethics, receiving fellowships to work on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee staff and at the Hastings Center for the Study of Ethics. She was also co-head of the National Library of Medicine's HealthAware Project, a joint project with Harvard Medical School to test how the internet could be used to educate people about preventive health measures. She married Robert Guillemin and had two sons, Robert and John. She divorced her first husband and in 1986, married Matthew Meselson. In the 1980s, Guillemin became interested in the misuse of biomedical science by government weapons programs. She involved herself in two of her husband's investigations of alleged violations of international arms control agreements by the Soviet Union which involved germ weapons. The first was the \\"yellow rain\\" accusation by the United States against the USSR, to the effect that the Soviets enabled the Laotian army to use deadly mycotoxins to attack Hmong refugees allied with the US during the Vietnam War. This accusation had been disputed by Meselson in 1983 when he argued that the yellow material was actually bee feces mistaken for a biological weapon by those under attack and by certain US government scientists. (The issue remains disputed and the US government has not withdrawn the allegations, arguing that the controversy has not been fully resolved.) In 1992, Guillemin became part of Meselson's investigation into another Cold War controversy, the 1979 outbreak of anthrax in Sverdlovsk, a closed Soviet city in the Ural Mountains. The Soviet government claimed the cause was infected meat. Guillemin's interviews with the families of victims (64 people were recorded as dying) resulted in an epidemiological map showing the source to be an air-borne release of anthrax spores from a military facility where, in violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the testing of anthrax weapons had been in process. In 1994, the results of this research were published in Science and in 1999 her book on this research was published (Anthrax: The Investigation of a Deadly Outbreak, U of California Press). After 9/11, with the advent of the anthrax letter attacks, Guillemin was frequently asked by the media to explain the disease, based on her experience in Russia. In 2005 she published Biological Weapons: From State-sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterorism, Columbia U Press) which offers a concise, comprehensive history of how anthrax and other microbes were developed as weapons over the course of the 20th century, resulting in potential bioterrorism. She turned her attention to the 2001 anthrax letter attacks after the 2008 suicide of the FBI's prime suspect, an anthrax scientist who worked for the U.S. Army at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Her third book on biological weapons is about the letters and their impact on victims and government organizations. It is called American Anthrax: Fear, Crime, and the Investigation of the Nation's Deadliest Bioterror Attack, (Macmillan/Holt/Times, 2011). Guillemin joined the MIT Center for International Studies in 2006 as a research associate and senior advisor.

She devoted herself entirely to the art of painting in watercolors which she studied under English, French and German masters. Hale traveled extensively, sketching and visiting the galleries of the world. She was associated with her brother, the Rev. Edward Everett Hale, in the publication of The Family Flight series, which included the several countries she had visited. She also exhibited her pictures of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, of North Carolina scenery and of foreign scenes, in New York City and Boston. She edited Life and Letters of Thomas Gold Appleton (1885), and contributed numerous articles to periodicals. Early life and education She was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Nathan Hale and Sarah Preston Everett who had a total of eleven children. Susan's father, Nathan Hale, nephew and namesake of the patriot hero, was a lawyer and editor/owner of the Boston Daily Advertiser while her mother, also an author, was a sister of Edward Everett, a Unitarian minister and politician. Growing up, Susan was mostly the companion of her older sister Lucretia. She was educated privately by tutors until she was 16, and then entered the school of George Barrell Emerson. Without any particular teaching, she learned to draw and to paint early in life. Career For many years, she was a successful teacher in Boston. She started on this occupation when her father became ill and the family income needed to be supplemented. In 1860, she moved to Brookline with her family. Her father died there in 1862 and her mother in 1865. When the family situation broke up in 1867, Susan and her sister Lucretia went abroad to stay with their brother Charles who was consul general of the United States in Egypt. On returning from abroad, Susan took rooms at 91 Boylston Street in Boston and continued her teaching. In 1872, she decided she wanted to get the best training in watercolor she could, and went abroad again and studied art in Paris, France, and Weimar, Germany, for nearly a year. When she returned in 1873, she began giving lessons in watercolors. She lived and maintained a studio in the Art Club at 64 Boylston Street. Later, she began holding meetings where she read or talked to people. Susan and brother, Edward Everett Hale (l-r) In 1885, she began to keep house at the summer home of her brother, Edward, in Matunuck, Rhode Island, which she called home until her death in 1910. Her brother and his wife had gone abroad to look after their sick daughter. Susan eventually moved most of her things to Matunuck, and began to spend time there regularly during summers. During winters, she traveled. In earlier years, she had spent winters working in Boston and traveled in the summer, sometimes accompanying well-known friends such as Thomas Gold Appleton and Frederic Edwin Church. She continued visiting Boston between her travels abroad and her stays at Matunuck. Her watercolors were mostly landscapes done during her travels; she also described her travels in vivid detail in letters to her sister, Lucretia. Hale died at her summer home in Matunuck, in 1910.

Bilateral descent is a system of family lineage in which the relatives on the mother's side and father's side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of property or wealth. It is a family arrangement where descent and inheritance are passed equally through both parents. Families who use this system trace descent through both parents simultaneously and recognize multiple ancestors, but unlike with cognatic descent it is not used to form descent groups. While bilateral descent is increasingly the norm in Western culture, traditionally it is only found among relatively few groups in West Africa, India, Australia, Indonesia, Melanesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Polynesia. Anthropologists believe that a tribal structure based on bilateral descent helps members live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of families dispersed over a wide area. Under bilateral descent, every tribe member belongs to two clans, one through the father (a patriclan) and another through the mother (a matriclan). For example, among the Himba, clans are led by the eldest male in the clan. Sons live with their father's clan and when daughters marry they go to live with the clan of their husband. However inheritance of wealth does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan i.e. a son does not inherit his father's cattle but his maternal uncle's instead. Javanese people, the largest ethnic group in Indonesia, also adopt a bilateral kinship system. The Dimasa Kachari people of Northeast India has a system of dual family clan. The Urapmin people, a small tribe in Papua New Guinea, have a system of kinship classes known as tanum miit. The classes are inherited bilaterally from both parents. Since they also practice strict endogamy, most Urapmin belong to all of the major classes, creating great fluidity and doing little to differentiate individuals.

Located at the border of the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Minnesota, the path is a relatively easy crossing of the Laurentian Divide separating the watersheds of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The portage was used for centuries by indigenous peoples for canoe travel, teaching it to European voyageurs and coureurs des bois who used it to access the fur trading posts in Rupert's Land. For many years the portage was part of an important route from Lower Canada to the interior of the North American continent. It became part of the boundary between British North America and the United States following the American Revolution and treaties delineating the border. In recognition of this history, the portage is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, and is a Minnesota State Historic Site. Located in La Verendrye Provincial Park and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the unspoiled country along the international boundary, the portage retains its traditional use, but for recreational canoe trips rather than commerce.  Geography  The portage, long, crosses a low saddle between North Lake and South Lake. It adjoins the boundary vista, a cleared strip which marks the Canada–United States border between those lakes.. Photographs of boundary vista and illegal snowmobile use of adjacent portage trail, from report prepared for Izaak Walton League of America, Sierra Club North Star Chapter, Northeastern Minnesotans for Wilderness, and Wilderness Watch. South Lake is the source of the Arrow River, tributary to the Pigeon River, which flows east to Lake Superior, other Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean. North Lake is in the watershed of the Rainy River, which drains by way of the Winnipeg and Nelson Rivers to Hudson Bay. According to the Canada/US International Boundary Commission, Ontario's boundary with the United States runs 2700 kilometers on water and only about one kilometer on land. The 80-rod Height of Land Portage is a significant part of the land border; the remainder is along two other portages, Watap Portage () a short distance to its east, and Swamp (or Monument) Portage () to the west in the BWCA and Quetico Provincial Park.  History  The Height of Land Portage may have had its origin as a route for foraging or migrating animals. Historians believe that many portages started as animal tracks, and were later used by the early inhabitants of the area. Prior to the Contact Period (when peoples of the First Nations first encountered European explorers), those natives had long used birchbark canoes as the principal means of travel in the thick boreal forest of the Quetico- Superior area. The Height of Land Portage likely was used by those peoples. The search for the Northwest Passage, the fur trade, and missionary activity brought European travelers to the area. used native routes in 1732 to reach Rainy Lake. In the latter part of the eighteenth century it was used by ' of the French-Canadian fur brigades as their main route from Grand Portage on Lake Superior to the ', the \\"upper country\\" beyond the height of land separating the Great Lakes from the fur country in the Northwest; see Canadian canoe routes. At one time there was a refitting station on the west end of the portage where canoes were repaired.Delafield, Joseph (1943). The Unfortified Boundary: A Diary of the first survey of the Canadian Boundary Line from St. Regis to the Lake of the Woods, p. 408. Voyageurs coming for the first time to the ' were initiated after crossing the portage. Each newcomer would be sprinkled with a cedar bough dipped in water, and be made to swear that he would not allow another novice to pass that way without undergoing similar rites and that he would never kiss another voyageur's wife without her consent. Concluding the ceremony with a gunfire salute and drinks of \\"high wine\\" (a type of rum), the new ' or Nor'wester and his company would resume their journey. Inclusion in international border Following the American Revolution the Treaty of Paris set the international boundary between British North America and the United States along the line of water communication between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. During the era of exploration there were three principal routes used by canoe brigades to connect these two lakes, all of which crossed the divide separating western Lake Superior from the Hudson Bay watershed: * the Grand Portage route to Rainy Lake, which used the portage described in this article; * to the east, the Kam–Dog–Maligne route used by early French explorer Jacques de Noyon in 1688, which headed north from the lake at the site of Fort William, Ontario up the Kaministiquia and Dog Rivers to Cold Water Lake, crossed the divide by Prairie Portage to Height of Land Lake, then went west by way of the Savanne, Pickerel, and Maligne Rivers to Lake La Croix where it joined the Grand Portage route; and * to the west, the St. Louis–Vermilion route, which went from Lake Superior at Fond du Lac (the \\"end of the lake\\") near modern Duluth, Minnesota, up the St. Louis and Embarrass Rivers, across the height of land (by a portage which also bears the name Height of Land Portage) to Pike River and Lake Vermilion, then down the Vermilion River to the Grand Portage route. Britain asserted that the westernmost St. Louis-Vermilion route was the usual line of water communications, while the United States advocated the easternmost Kam–Dog–Maligne Route. Following surveys in the early nineteenth century, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 fixed the route along the Pigeon River and the Height of Land Portage between North and South Lakes. Since then the portage has been recognized as part of the border. \\"Free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both countries\\", it continues in its historic use as a footpath for the overland transport of canoes across the divide separating the Great Lakes Basin from the Canadian northwest.

She signed to Millie Lewis Modeling Agency at the age of five and for two years she starred in various department store commercials and advertisements. In elementary school, Skky developed a passion for writing poetry and short stories. When she moved to Carrollton, GA in the third grade, a childhood friend, who played the guitar, convinced Skky to add melody to her poems. This is when Skky realized how much she enjoyed the art of songwriting. Career Nicknamed \\"Skky\\" by affiliates in the urban market who knew her as a songwriter/vocal arranger, she debut her vocal abilities on Trick Daddy's December 2006 album release Back By Thug Demand. Rumors quickly spread in the Fall of 2007 that Skky had signed with Dunk Ryder Records, teaming up with Trick Daddy, Iceburg, Fella, and Soup for what would have been an unstoppable combination for the South. The rumors came to a stop when DunkRyder's (the group) signed with Cash Money/Universal and Skky was not part of the deal. In an interview Skky said, \\"At the time, I wasn't pursuing a singing career, I was more focused on my writing and Trick knew that. In fact, I was actually writing and developing a friend who wasn't the strongest writer, but had an amazing vocal talent. I really wanted to see her be successful. In 2008, Skky was commissioned to write for an independent pop/rock artist that was signed to A1 Records. The demo provided by Skky included her own vocals, which captured the attention of the label's CEO, James Goosby. In March of 2009, after hearing more of Skky's catalog, Goosby convinced Skky to enter a recording contract to release the song \\"Catch 22\\", featuring Brisco with Poe Boy Entertainment and produced by GoldRush with Dunk Ryder Records. The song collaboration took place 6 months prior to Skky meeting Goosby, so it was quickly mastered and set for a May release date. The song was rumored to have leaked two weeks early, but the response was so positive, it sparked the decision to proceed with the music video.

Facade of San Nicola da Tolentino San Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani (Italian: Saint Nicholas of Tolentino in the Gardens of Sallust) is a church in Rome. It is referred to in both Melchiori's and Venuti's guides as San Niccolò di Tolentino, and in the latter it adds the suffix a Capo le Case.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 365.Accurata e succinta descrizione topografica e istorica di Roma moderna; by Rodulphinus Venuti; Rome (1766); page 88. It is one of the two Roman national churches of Armenia. The church was built for the Discalced Augustinians in 1599, and originally dedicated to the 13th century Augustinian monk, St. Nicholas of Tolentino (also called San Niccolò or Nicolò da Tolentino). History The interior was refurbished during 1614-1620 by Carlo Buti and Martino Longhi, supported by patronage by the Pamphilj family. The Milanese architect Francesco Buzio was also involved in the redesign. Starting in 1654, again with Pamphilj patronage, the church was rebuilt with designs by Giovanni Maria Baratta, one of the main pupils of Alessandro Algardi. In 1883, the church was given to the Pontifical Armenian College by Pope Leo XIII. The Armenian Catholic Church is in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church.San Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani Interior The main altarpiece of San Giovanni Battista is by Baciccio. The sculpture of the Madonna with Child offering the Miraculous Bread to St Nicholas, St Augustine and St Monica over the main altar was completed by Domenico Guidi with Angels by Baratta, with surrounding stucco-work by Ercole Ferrata. The high altar was based on a design by Algardi. The first chapel on the right has a depiction of Miracle by St Nicholas of Bari (1710) by Filippo Laurenzi. The Annunciation is by Pughelli, and lateral canvases by Giovanni Ventura Borghesi. In the second chapel on the right is an altarpiece by Lazzaro Baldi.Melchiorri, page 365. In the third chapel on the right side is the sepulchral monument of Cardinal Federico Lante delle Rovere, with paintings by Pietro Paolo Baldini. The third chapel on the left, the Gavotti chapel, was designed in 1668 by Pietro da Cortona who began the ceiling fresco work, although after his death, it was finished by Ciro Ferri. The chapel was dedicated to the Madonna of Savona.Melchiorri, page 365. The sculptural relief at the altar of the Apparition of the Blessed Virgin of Savona to Blessed Anthony Botta was completed by Cosimo Fancelli, and statues of St Joseph by Ercole Ferrata and St John the Baptist by Antonio Raggi. The second chapel on the left, the Buratti chapel, was designed by Giovanni Battista Mola, the father of Pier Francesco Mola. THe first chapel on the right has a St Phillip Neri painted by Cristofaro Creo.Melchiorri, page 365. The dome is octagonal, with eight windows. The cupola is frescoed (1643) by Pietro Paolo Baldini and depicts four female angels symbolizing the four fundamental virtues of the Augustinian Order: Chastity, Humility, Poverty and Obedience. There is also a fresco depicting Glory of St Nicholas of Tolentino by Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi.

It is the largest river of Calabria and the third largest river of southern Italy after the Volturno and the Sele. In classical antiquity it was known as the Crathis or Crater (Greek: ). Geography The Crati rises in the central Sila Mountains in the comune Aprigliano. It starts at as the Craticello at an elevation of 1,742 meters. It descends very steeply northward towards Cosenza where it is joined on the left by the Busento river, doubling in size. From here on it flows through a large plain, the Vallo del Crati. Here it is joined by several tributaries from the right: the Arente, Mucone (its main tributary on the right) and Duglia rivers. Several smaller streams also join it on the right: the Finita, Turbolo, Cucchiato, Campagnano, Mavigliano and Settimo. The river is also joined by several left tributaries including the Annea. It has a drainage basin of .Caratteristiche bacino e sottobacini. Crati With a discharge of 20 m/s it continues to Tarsia where a dam forms an artificial lake of the same name. From here it changes course to the northeast and meets with the Coscile river approximately five kilometers from the Gulf of Taranto. The Coscile is its main tributary on the left which again doubles the river in size. It continues eastwards, passing immediately south of the archaeological site of Sybaris and Thurii. Its mouth is near the marina of the comune Corigliano-Rossano. Hydrology The Crati is the largest river in the region in terms of discharge, both as an annual average (about 36 m/s), minimum (about 10 m/s) and maximum (more than 3,000 m/s). The river is very seasonal and can sometimes bring disastrous winter floods, which happened most recently in December 2008. History Because of its close proximity to the famous ancient city of Sybaris the Crati was noticed by many ancient writers. Lycophron and Theocritus mention the river in their poetry. Euripides praises the river and alleges that it would change the color of the hair to auburn. Others mention different colors and Pliny the Elder writes that it would make sheep white. According to Strabo the river received its name because it was a mixture, just like the Krathis river in Achaea. Pausanias and Herodotus also mention it, but state that the river was named after the Krathis river. Strabo also claims that the Croton diverted the course of the Crathis to submerge Sybaris. Research has not confirmed this. The Crati transports coarse sand and pebbles in its channel. If Strabo's claim is true, that material would have been deposited as sediment above the city when the river submerged it. An analysis of core samples taken from the site of Sybaris by Stanley and Bernasconi did not find such river deposits directly above the former city.

Females grow to 25 mm in mantle length, while males are not known to exceed 15.8 mm in mantle length. This species occurs in beds of seagrass in bays and inlets where it feeds during the night on small crustaceans such as shrimp. In the daytime they remain hidden within the seagrass, adhering to the leaves of the seagrass using a glue excreted by a gland on the dorsal surface of the body. The females attach the eggs onto seagrass blades, most typically species of the genera Heterozostera and Zostera. There is thought to be a pelagic stage during this species' development.

Route description CR 105 passes through the rural farmland of northern Iowa Iowa 105 began in Winnebago County at the intersection of Lake Street and Main Street in Lake Mills. Northbound U.S. Route 69 (US 69) traffic approached the intersection on Main Street and turned north at Lake Street; Iowa 105 began eastbound on Main Street. At the intersection today, Interstate 35 (I-35) is signed using CR 105 as a connector route. Just outside Lake Mills, Iowa 105 entered Worth County. It met I-35 at exit 214, the northernmost exit in Iowa. Now located at this exit is the Top of Iowa welcome center. east of the I-35 interchange, Iowa 105 entered Northwood along Central Avenue.

The Church of Aphrodite is a Neopagan religious group founded in 1938 by Gleb Botkin (1900–1969), a Russian émigré to the United States. Monotheistic in structure, the Church believes in a singular female goddess, who is named after the ancient Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. Having grown up in the Russian Imperial court, Botkin fought in the Russian civil war on the side of the counter-revolutionary forces after his father, a physician to the royal Romanov monarchy, was executed by the Bolshevik government. Fleeing to Long Island in the United States, he began writing novels and non-fiction books, mostly set in his Russian homeland, before coming to believe in a female divinity and founding the Church of Aphrodite. He won the right to register it as a religious charter in the New York State Supreme Court. Beliefs and practices The only known printed source concerning the doctrine of the Church of Aphrodite is the treatise In Search of Reality written and published by Gleb Botkin in the 1960s. The treatise opens with the opinion that \\"prevalent religious beliefs and standards of morality . . . are based chiefly on . . . fantasies . . . of primitive people of an ancient past”, and he “to develop morally and intellectually, as well as enable us to lead happier lives.” The central concept in Botkin's metaphysics is Love, which he defines not as an emotion but \\"energy\\", which engenders all being. The only “inexhaustible Generator of Love—its Prime Source and Ultimate Object—is the Supreme Deity and Creator.” According to Botkin, the Deity is Creator by the very reason it radiates love, which creates the cosmos. The process of this emanation is “an organic one,” and therefore “the cosmos must be regarded as a fruit of the Divine Organism—not an arbitrarily created artifact.” This is why the Supreme Deity should be visualized “not as a Father God, but the Mother Goddess,” since “it is only the feminine organism which is capable of bearing fruit.” Since Botkin considered love an eternal flow, he based the hopes for the immortality of human beings with the fact that they were consciously capable of love towards each other and the Deity. \\"The Beyond\\" or \\"Paradise\\" is a place where evil – the antithesis of Love and its concomitants Beauty and Harmony – is absent. The relationship between the Goddess Aphrodite and the visible world may be illustrated by that between a mother and her child. Having given birth to a child organically, a mother proceeds to take care of it with both her body and her mind. So the Goddess in Her relation with our world is both the Universal Cause and the Universal Mind.Botkin 1967. p. As it espouses a monotheistic, syncretic faith, its beliefs were not consistent with the modern reconstructionist Hellenic religion of Hellenism but closer to those of [Dianic] Wicca. As Neopagan scholar Chas S. Clifton noted, \\"Botkin's own writings anticipated by a generation the sort of Goddess religion found later in the pages of Green Egg and elsewhere,\\" and which were propagated by Neopagan groups such as Dianic Wicca in the 1960s onward during the Second Wave feminist movement.Clifton 2006. p. 139.  History  = Gleb Botkin and the Church's founding = Gleb Botkin was born in 1900, the son of Eugene Botkin, who was the physician to the Romanovs, the Russian royal family of the time, and as such Gleb grew up in a wealthy background within the imperial household. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, when the Bolshevik Party, a group of Marxists who wished to implement socialist reforms, took power, the monarchy was entirely abolished. A subsequent civil war broke out between those forces that supported the revolutionary government, the \\"Reds\\", and those that opposed them, the \\"Whites.\\" The Bolsheviks subsequently ordered the execution of the Romanovs, fearing that the Whites would reinstate them, and so, in July 1918, the family, along with several of their closest aides, including Evgeny Botkin, were shot dead in the basement of the Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg. His son, Gleb Botkin, retreated eastwards with the Whites, but following their defeat, fled via Japan to the United States.Clifton 2006. p. 139. Subsequently gaining employment as a commercial illustrator, Botkin began writing a series of books, both fiction and non-fiction, including an account of his memories of the Romanovs entitled The Real Romanovs, as Revealed by the Late Czar's Physician and His Son (1931).Botkin 1931. Many of his fictional stories also drew from his experience and involvement with the Russian aristocracy: Her Wanton Majesty (1934) was a fictionalised biography of Catherine I, the wife of Tsar Peter the Great, which portrayed her as a particularly lustful figure,Botkin 1934. whilst Immortal Woman (1933) dealt with the story of fictional Russian composer Nikolai Dirin, who after being persecuted by the Bolsheviks flees to the United States where he settles in Long Island, the very place that Botkin himself had settled into.Botkin 1933. Immortal Woman shows that Botkin was beginning to have ideas about a monotheistic goddess, for instance containing a quote in which the Russian Orthodox priest Father Aristarch states that \\"the Supreme Deity must be a woman\\" whilst at another point Dirin enters a church and began \\"to pray fervently to Aphrodite – his beautiful and kind Goddess whom the Christian Church decried as the White She-Devil, whose worshipers the heads of the Christian Church have repeatedly anathematized.\\"Botkin 1933. p.197. =Later years= Botkin later moved the church to Charlottesville, Virginia. He self- published a book arguing that Aphrodite was the supreme deity and the creation of the world was like a woman giving birth. The church was one of the earliest of its kind in the neopaganism movement in the United States. Botkin's church is mentioned in Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America, by Chas S. Clifton.

This district has recently been dissolved and the units are now part of the other districts. Council Properties The Mid Iowa Council also manages several properties including Camp Mitigwa, Grinnell Scoutland, and Strother's Lodge. Formerly the council managed Camp Wapello in southeast Iowa. The council now longer uses the property, but it is still used by Scouts and Scouters for various events. Website: https://campiowa.org =Camp Mitigwa= Camp Mitigwa is located northeast of Woodward, Iowa, United States, north of the state capital in, Des Moines. The camp is approximately and is situated along the Des Moines River valley. In 1923, Anselm Frankel chaired the committee that, along with Scout Executive Fred G. Davie, found a site of 123 acres located seven miles north of Woodward; just an hour’s ride by train or automobile from the city. The purchase price: $25,000.00. Highlights The camp includes Eagle Pond and Lake Fisher. Fisher is a small man made lake which provides opportunities for canoeing, rowing, and fishing. The camp has multiple year-round wood heated cabins available for weekend rentals. The camp also includes a thirty-foot, five-sided Rappelling Tower, as well as a C.O.P.E. (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience), which includes a 400' zipline, and a triangle event that includes a Gap Step, Balance Beam and Skywalk events. Both the tower and the C.O.P.E. course can be reserved by a troop or crew. Within the past 10 years the camp has reopened the Frankel Ridge Pool and Trading Post facilities. The camp has also built a new dining facility known as Bear Creek Lodge, a multi-purpose facility used year-round for events and meetings. Each summer Camp Mitigwa offers five one- week residence camping experiences for Boy Scouts. At the present time Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts camp at the same time. Camp staff and maintenance Summer camp staff is hired only for the summer season and usually consists of 30-60 high school and college students. Positions range from instructing Scouts, managing a trading post, serving as a health officer and life guarding. Camp Mitigwa has one full-time, year-round camp ranger. He is provided a residence on the camp property. In the past the council has also employed a year-round assistant ranger and a summer seasonal assistant ranger. ORFs (Old Retired Fellows) is a highly skilled group of volunteers. The men have experience in many trades including plumbing, woodworking, or electrical work and provide maintenance throughout the year. Their work can be seen all over camp and is usually branded with a logo denoting their work. The Mitigwa Lodge also provides several workdays each year to help maintain the property and has regularly had trail crews present at camp during summer months to improve existing trails and build new ones. Geography Camp Mitigwa has three main ridges, each developed for camping. They are: *Blank Ridge- Raymond A. Blank Ridge is currently used for Boy Scout Camping and is the central ridge of the camp. The majority of camp activities take place in and around the facilities on this ridge. *Frankel Ridge- When the camp opened in 1923 Frankel Ridge was opened for Boy Scout camping and was the main ridge for the camp. Since 2007 Frankel Ridge has been utilized primarily for Cub Scout Camping. *Casady Ridge- Currently used for Boy Scout Camping. This Ridge was originally known as Buffalo Ridge, and still appears on maps this way. The ridge also contains a fort and four adirondacks which can be used by Scouts in camp. Trails *The Lake Front Trail- This trail offers an excellent views of the woodland of Mitigwa between Blank and Frankel Ridges. It goes between the Raymond Blank Memorial Dining Hall and the Frankel Ridge parking lot. The trail also passes by Lake Fisher. This trail was constructed by the Mitigwa Lodge. *The Dan Beard Trail- The Mitigwa Lodge is currently constructing a trail that will eventually surround the entire camp. Named after Dan Beard, the trail offers an excellent view of the Mitigwa backwoods and the Des Moines River valley. The trail offers access to both outpost campsites on the south end of the property. Hidden treasures such as the Hidden Lake and Sulfur springs are visible from the trail. The trail follows portions of older trails that once went through the camp, old signs can still be found throughout the backwoods of the camp property marking these old trails. The rest of Camp Mitigwa's are undeveloped. Campsites Camp Mitigwa utilizes 20 campsites and has at least 4 that are no longer used. Located on Frankel Ridge: Wakan, Chanotedah, Hopi, and Zuni. Frankel Ridge still has an open space where Cherokee campsite was located near Bear Creek Lodge. Located on Blank Ridge: Chippewa, Pawnee, Fox, Osage, Piegon, and Sioux. Blank Ridge no longer uses Ottawa, Sac or East Sioux campsites. Ottawa is used for Boy Scout ecology merit badges. Sac was located too close to the water tower and considered unsafe for usage and East Sioux is now part of the enlarged Piegon campsite. Located on Casady Ridge: Kick-a-poo, Mohawk, Crow, Onondaga, Onieda, Kiowa, Seneca, Iroquois, Cayuga and Navajo. Navajo is now just used for wilderness survival. There is an existing inactive campsite on the east end of the ridge and the Kiowa campsite was renamed Kiowa in the 1990s. Facilities The camp features two dining facilities, two staff housing areas, two staff lounges, two pools and two trading posts. There are currently three forts on the property. The first Fort Pella is located on Frankel Ridge. The second Fort Clatsop is located on Casady Ridge. The third is Old Fort Madison located on the far end of Frankel Ridge. A fort known as Fort JC used to exist near the present day Raymond Blank Dining Hall. All buildings at Camp Mitigwa are painted \\"Brewer Brown\\" which is more commonly known as Zanzibar Brown.

Camp Wapello is located six miles west of Drakesville, Iowa, on the southern end of Wapello State Park. Camp Wapello was founded in 1932 by George Foster, President of the John Morrell Packing company in Ottumwa, IA. Foster donated 88 acres of land to the Southern Iowa Boy Scout Council, then headquartered in Ottumwa. Through the efforts of Foster, the George Foster Fund, the Exchange Bank of Bloomfield, the Union Bank of Ottumwa, and many others, Camp Wapello grew and expanded. In 1965, 80 acres of land was donated from the historic Steckel Ranch, founded during the Civil War. During the early 1970s the Southern Iowa Council merged with the Tall Corn Council, and formed the Mid-Iowa Council. In 1982, the Mid-Iowa Council sold Camp Wapello to the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation who in turn sold it to the Department of Natural Resources in 1984. Both purchases were subject to a sublease agreement with the Mid-Iowa Council, BSA to continue usage of the camp as a year-round facility for Scouting programs. In 1992 the property became sole property of the Iowa DNR. The Camp Wapello Preservation Group was formed in 1992. This group purchased Camp Wapello from the Iowa DNR in 1995. Mitigwa Lodge The Order of the Arrow Scouting's national honor society is represented in the Mid-Iowa Council by the Mitigwa Lodge. The lodge is administratively divided into chapters corresponding to the council's districts. The Mitigwa Lodge is part of Section C-5B, in the Central Region. =History= Camp Mitigwa was founded in 1923. The council's first honor society was the Old Guard, founded in 1931.

Its long-time leader has been Maurizio Martin. Other leading members include Rudi Marguerettaz (member of the Chamber of Deputies in 2013–2018) and Pierluigi Marquis (President of Aosta Valley in 2017). History =Early years= SA was founded in 2001 by the merger of the Autonomists and the Autonomist Federation. The Autonomists were basically the Valdostan section of the Italian People's Party, one of the successors of Christian Democracy, while the Autonomist Federation was formed by former Progressive Democratic Autonomists, along with former Socialists and Republicans. In the 2003 regional election, SA scored 19.8% and got elected seven regional councillors. In the 2003–2008 term, the party controlled five seats in the Regional Council. Of the five regional councillors, four were former members of Christian Democracy and one was a former Republican. In 2004 the Autonomist Federation re-gained its independence from SA. From 2001 to 2006 SA was represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Ivo Collé, elected on the Aosta Valley coalition (VdA) ticket, formed also by the Valdostan Union (UV) and the Autonomist Federation (FA). In the 2006 general election SA's Marco Viérin ran for the Chamber, but the VdA was soundly defeated by the centre-left Autonomy Liberty Democracy (ALD) list. =The regionalist coalition= In the 2008 regional election SA, which included four candidates of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) in its list, won 11.4% of the vote and four regional councillors (out of 35), while the three-party regionalist coalition won 62.0% and a large majority, composed of 22 regional councillors. No candidate of UDC was elected. In the 2013 general election Rudi Marguerettaz, secretary of SA since 2001, was elected to the Chamber. Soon after the election, Marguerettaz chose to team up with Lega Nord (LN) and became vice president of the \\"Lega Nord and Autonomies\\" parliamentary group. Consequently, Marguerettaz stepped down from secretary and the party was led by a provisional executive. In March 2015 Marguerettaz would break ranks with LN and join the \\"Linguistic Minorities\\" sub-group within the Mixed Group, formed by the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP) and the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT). For the 2013 regional election the party confirmed its alliance with the UV and SA, and formed a joint list with Lega Nord Valle d'Aosta (LNVdA). In an election in which the UV lost a quarter of its votes and FA its entire representation in the Regional Council, SA increased its share of vote to 12.2% and its number of regional councillors to five. Thanks to SA's result, the regionalist coalition retained its absolute majority in the Council. In July 2015 the regional government, led by UV's Augusto Rollandin, was enlarged to the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and in June 2016 by the Progressive Valdostan Union (UVP). =Recent events= In May 2016 Carlo Marzi was elected secretary of the party, three years after Marguerettaz's resignation from the office. In March 2017, SA left the government and, along with the UVP, Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology (ALPE) and For Our Valley (PNV), formed a new government without the UV, under President Pierluigi Marquis (SA), including another SA member, Stefano Borrello, as minister of Public Works. This led two regional councillors, Mauro Baccega and André Lanièce, to quit the party and launch the Valdostan Autonomist Popular Edelweiss (EPAV). Marquis' government lasted only until October 2017, when a new government led by Laurent Viérin (UVP), composed of the UV, the UVP, the EPAV and the PD, was formed. In the 2018 general election SA took part within the For All alliance, along with ALPE and PNV, but the list was defeated in both races (Chamber and Senate). In the 2018 regional election SA formed a joint list with PNV; the list obtained 10.7% and four seats (two for SA and two for PNV). After the election, the Regional Council elected Nicoletta Spelgatti of LNVdA as President, at the head of a broad left-right coalition, comprising SA–PNV, ALPE, Mouv' and one defector from UV's ranks. In the new government Borrello was confirmed as minister of Public Works, along with PNV's Claudio Restano at Tourism, Sports, Commerce and Transports. However, in December the government fell down and was replaced by a new one led by Antonio Fosson (PNV), at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, ALPE, SA and PNV. Under Fosson, Borrello was again appointed minister of Public Works.

Career  After graduating, Ng took up acting full-time, working as a waiter and cook in various restaurants until he started gaining roles in West End and Off West End plays. However, he became dissatisfied with the work he was getting, saying: \\"I was seen as neither Asian nor Caucasian. Either that or I'm cast in stereotyped roles.\\" In 2002, Ng took a six-month break from acting, working as a scuba diving instructor in Thailand. He then moved back to Hong Kong, where he again waited on tables before landing a number of prominent modelling jobs, featuring in advertisements for Motorola and Sony MiniDisc. Since 2000 he has appeared in a number of films, including Heat Team, Yesterday Once More, Colour Blossoms, and Half Twin. Regarding his choice in film roles, Ng has said: \\"I do gravitate towards darker roles, roles that other people hesitate to touch. I find them intriguing and an opportunity to try something different.\\" He has appeared alongside his father in several productions, including the 2008 TV film Pulau Hantu. Ng became well known in Singapore for his role as DSP Glenn in MediaCorp Channel 5's Point of Entry. From Season 4 onwards, he was replaced in the part by Jack Yang.

England took the British title after a final match at Wembley in which they put nine goals past Scotland, who returned with three of their own. Teams in this period frequently fielded as many as five strikers, hoping to outscore opponents rather than rely on heavy defence. This tactic paid dividends, particularly for England, whose haul of 19 included seven for Jimmy Greaves, whilst both Bobby Charlton and Bobby Smith each scored in each of England's three games. England had begun the tournament well, winning 5–2 against Ireland in Belfast, whilst the Welsh beat a tough Scottish side at home. Welsh hopes of tournament success were disabused in their second match, where England took them apart 5–1, whilst the Irish were again on the reverse of a heavy defeat, losing 5–2 in Glasgow against Scotland. In the tournament's final games, Wales beat Ireland 5–1 to claim second spot, leading to England and Scotland's dramatic finale. Players at the tournament included a medley of stars from the 1950s, and young players who would take the 1960s by storm. This line-up included Danny Blanchflower and Peter McParland for Ireland, Ivor Allchurch and John Charles for Wales, Denis Law and Dave Mackay for Scotland and an England team including Bobby Charlton, Johnny Haynes, Jimmy Greaves and Bobby Robson, some of whom would later win the 1966 FIFA World Cup.

In New Zealand, the term Black Budget refers to the government budget of 26 June 1958, in which Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer increased taxes on beer, tobacco, cars and petrol. Background The second Labour government took office in 1957, the 32nd Parliament. Within a year, the government was confronted with a balance of payments crisis caused by the collapse of the price of butter in Britain (New Zealand's largest export market at the time). Nordmeyer's colleagues were reluctant to cut government spending or break expensive election promises, so Nordmeyer was left with little option but to raise taxes, which was recommended by both the Treasury and Prime Minister Walter Nash (himself a former Minister of Finance). The budget increased social security benefits but was very unpopular, not least with Labour's traditional working-class supporters. The term 'black budget' is believed to have been coined by union leader Fintan Patrick Walsh, but was taken up by the National Party opposition, and became the commonly used term for the budget. Rises in income tax levels hurt single earners and childless families the most. The budget was prepared by the cabinet finance committee of Walter Nash, Arnold Nordmeyer, Phil Holloway and Tom Skinner. Member of Parliament Warren Freer was told by Holloway that it was Nash rather than Nordmeyer who fought for the \\"draconian measures\\" finally adopted. While export prices had \\"had a real bashing\\" with butter at half its normal level and wool and meat also down, Holloway and Skinner felt that prices of both wool and meat were likely to rise and drastic measures were not fully justified. In caucus the measures were criticised by Michael Moohan, Frank Kitts and Bill Fox and, despite his cabinet position, Moohan continued to agitate against the beer price rise in private. Philip Connolly said of Nash, who had said that there was no alternative, that he was \\"telling a bloody big lie\\" as Nash was rubbing the gold cross on his watch chain when he said it. Freer saw some saving grace in the tightening of import controls and emphasis on local manufacture which boosted employment. The government's popularity never recovered from the budget, which is generally believed to have cost it the 1960 election. Nordmeyer was forever tainted by the 'black budget', which gave him a reputation as a puritanical 'wowser' who was opposed to simple working class pleasures such as automobiles, beer and cigarettes. Despite this, he became the leader of the Labour Party in 1963, but was replaced by the more popular Norman Kirk only two years later. Popular culture In 2010, DB Breweries ran an advertising campaign attributing the creation of one of its brands, DB Export Gold to the increased taxes on beer introduced by the 'black budget'. However, the brewery was forced to pull the campaign from television and internet in February 2011 (though newspaper ads were unaffected) after the New Zealand Advertising Standards Authority partially upheld a complaint laid by Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton that the campaign was \\"unethical, inaccurate and distorted history\\" as little beer was then imported to New Zealand and the budget raised the excise only to the same as local beers.

Built to handle 180 students, already by the 1940s it struggled to hold 450; the County, whose all-white board refused to appropriate funds for properly expanding the school facilities, built long temporary buildings to house the overflow. Covered with roofing material, they were called the \\"tar-paper shacks.\\" and Civil rights history Robert Russa Moton High School was a segregated public high school in Farmville, Prince Edward County, Virginia. It was constructed in 1939 at the instigation of the Council of Colored Women, led by Martha E. Forrester. In 1951 a group of students, led by 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns, staged a walkout in protest of the conditions. The NAACP took up their case after students agreed to seek an integrated school rather than improved conditions at their black school. Howard University-trained attorneys Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill filed suit on May 23, 1951. In Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, a state court rejected the suit, agreeing with defense attorney T. Justin Moore that Virginia was vigorously equalizing black and white schools. The verdict was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and was subsequently incorporated into Brown v. Board of Education, in which the court ruled against the principle of \\"separate but equal\\" facilities and mandated the integration of public school systems. In 1953-54, as part of an argument that it was active in seeking to improve separate but equal conditions, the county built a new high school for African-Americans, and this building became an elementary school. The struggle to integrate the county's schools was one of the longest in the country. The county eventually refused to fund any public schools rather than integrate, as part of a statewide anti-integration effort known as Massive Resistance, and there were no public schools for five years, between 1959-64.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review- social-science-research-on-race/article/div-classtitlewhite-justifications- for-school-closings-in-prince-edward-county- virginia-19591964div/0F41A61C7D68A3BADAA661847F4265B6http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo12120834.html The Prince Edward School Foundation created a series of private schools to educate the county's white children. These schools were supported by tuition grants from the state and tax credits from the county. Prince Edward Academy was one of the first such schools in Virginia which came to be called segregation academies. Many families and students emigrated elsewhere or were forced to forgo formal education. Some received schooling with relatives outside of the County or in \\"training centers\\" and \\"grassroots schools\\" held in African-American churches, businesses and civic halls. Others were sent across the state and country to live with host families recruited by local NAACP leaders, the American Friends Service Committee and the all-black Virginia Teachers Association. In 1963–64, at the urging of local organizers, the Kennedy Administration-supported Prince Edward Free Schools opened in four County schools leased by the Prince Edward Free Schools Association. The 1964 Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County Supreme Court decision ordered the reopening of Prince Edward County Public Schools with full integration. Museum Today the Moton School stands as a reminder of the struggle for Civil Rights in Education. A 1994 New York Newsday report commended Prince Edward County as the only area involved in the Brown decision to desegregate its schools successfully and peacefully. The museum houses exhibits containing Moton High School memorabilia, artifacts of the Civil Rights Movement, and oral histories of former teachers and students who recall their experiences of the student walkout and the school closings. Docents are available to give guided tours of the museum. In 2013, Moton completed a $5.5 million renovation and open its first permanent exhibition, The Moton School Story: Children of Courage. The museum also serves as a Center for the Study of Civil Rights in Education, providing programs to explore the history of desegregation in education and to promote dialogue about community relations. It is also an anchor site of the Civil Rights in Education Heritage Trail. The trail contains 41 sites across southside Virginia which depict the broadening of educational opportunities. The building served as a primary school in the county school system until 1993. At the time of the school's final closure, the Martha E. Forrester Council of Women launched a movement to preserve it as a memorial to the struggle for civil rights in education. In 1998, R. R. Moton School was declared a National Historic Landmark.

History  In the early 1900s, the French company Schneider began a collaboration with the Russian company Putilov. For this collaboration, it had developed a gun using the Russian 107 mm round, which was ordered by the Russian Army to be produced in Russia (though the initial batch of guns was made in France). Schneider then decided to modify the design for the French 105 mm (4.134 inches) round and offer it to France as well. Initially, the French army was not interested in this weapon as they already had plenty of 75 mm field guns. However, in 1913, the French army purchased a small number under the designation Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider; it was also known by the service designation L 13 S. The lighter 75 mm guns were of limited use against trenches; so, once the western front in World War I had settled down to trench warfare, the French army ordered large numbers of the L 13 S, which, with its larger 15.74 kg (34.7 lb) shell, was more effective against fortified positions and had a range of . After the end of World War I, France sold or gave many Schneider 105 mm guns to various other countries, including Belgium, Italy, Poland, and Yugoslavia. In Italy, the 105 mm was re-designated the Cannone da 105/28 and saw service until 1943. Guns were also produced under license in Italy, starting from September 1914, by Ansaldo.105mm_mle1913- Retrieved 2012-03-01 Poland also used new model of Schneider's gun with a longer barrel and split trail, called the wz. 29, which was in fact a completely different weapon; both were in service at the beginning of WW II in 1939. In 1939 Poland had 118 of wz. 13 guns and 124 of wz. 29 guns, used in Heavy Artillery Detachments.Konstankiewicz, Andrzej (2003). Broń strzelecka i sprzęt artyleryjski formacji polskich i Wojska Polskiego w latach 1914-1939, Lublin. pp. 250-266. . The German conquests of Poland, Belgium, France, and Yugoslavia during World War II gave them large numbers of captured 105 mm Schneider guns. 854 L 13 S's were in service in France and a large number were captured. Many of these were installed in the Atlantic Wall system of coastal defenses. Finland was able to buy 12 of these guns from France during the Winter War; they also rebarreled six Russian 107mm Schnieders (four 1910 and two 1913 models) to 105mm. In addition, they were able to purchase 54 captured Polish Armata 105 mm wz. 29 Schneider guns from Germany.

Influences  The Riffs are heavily influenced by early punk bands, most notably the Sex Pistols, whose influence can be heard most prominently in the guitars, Sham 69 and the Dead Boys (they paid tribute to the Dead Boys on the cover of \\"Dead end Dream\\"). Like other bands that played the first wave of punk music, they were also fans of Protopunk like Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Velvet Underground, as displayed by their cover of \\"Waiting for my Man\\" on \\"Underground Kicks\\".  Song Content  Throughout the first two LPs, Underground Kicks and Dead End Dream, the songs and lyrics (written by all members of the band) told a bleak story of growing up in the Portland punk scene, presumably in poverty, afflicted with drug addiction, the repercussions of drug abuse, regret about past violent criminal activity, and a \\"No Way Out\\" feeling when it came to creating a fulfilling (if any) future. The band matured for their latest release, \\"Death or Glory\\", as evident by lead singer Mengis' improved vocal abilities—also, he achieved a greater vocal range, such as in \\"Death or Glory\\"--smoother production, and implementation of experimental instruments (such as the keyboard in \\"Poison Boys\\").

History  Initial construction lasted between 1505 to 1681, finished by Carlo Bottiron. Since then the building has undergone numerous renovations. Between 1634 to 1654, the building was lengthened and raised, as well as the side windows being pointed downwards to better illuminate the paintings. When construction of the facade finished in 1678, the public managed to view the oratory, marked by four pilasters in Corinthian order. The end of the 18th century saw a complete redesign of the facade from priest Giuseppe Medici. The oratory remained in good condition until World War II. It was restored in 1946, and saw further renovations in the 2000s. = Art = The committee managing the construction of the Oratory commissioned the art over time, all about the life of San Nicola. For example, the glorious Altarpiece depicting The Holy Trinity was sculpted by Francesco Maffei.  Features  Construction of a home for the venerable confraternity of the saint began in 1505 and was completed by 1681, when the facade was finished (attributed to Carlo Bottiron).

The novel was also collected in the omnibus volume All Aces (Viking 1958). Plot introduction A malcontent at the Naylor-Kerr corporation charges that one of its employees, thought to have been killed in a hit-and-run accident, was actually murdered. The president of the giant New York firm hires Archie to look for proof one way or another, in the guise of a personnel consultant in the corporation's executive offices — where 500 beautiful women are employed. Plot summary When a major engineering corporation conducts a survey into high employee turnover, a report is returned claiming that Waldo Moore, an employee recently killed in what was believed to be a hit-and-run accident, was murdered. The company president, Jasper Pine, approaches Nero Wolfe and hires him to find out whether this claim is true. Archie Goodwin is sent undercover as an outside consultant and assigned to investigate the stock department, where Moore worked, and is amazed to discover 500 beautiful women employed as secretaries and assistants. Archie discovers that Moore was notorious among the employees as a lothario but had become engaged to Hester Livsey, a stenographer. He quickly identifies numerous possible suspects for Moore's murder — in addition to Livsey, these include Rosa Bendini, who had enjoyed a dalliance with Moore; Bendini's jealous estranged husband Harold Anthony; Gwynne Ferris, who had tried to seduce Moore but was rebuffed; Benjamin Frenkel, a supervisor who had developed feelings for Ferris and had been rebuffed; and Sumner Hoff, a hot- headed technical advisor who had gotten into a physical fight with Moore, which was believed to be over Livsey. As gossip begins to spread among the employees about Archie's true mission, he begins to clash with Kerr Naylor, the eccentric and unpleasant department supervisor who lodged the initial report claiming that Moore was murdered. During one confrontation, Naylor reveals that he knows Archie's true identity, and that Moore had been given his job due to the intervention of Naylor's sister Cecily, who is also married to Jasper Pine. Naylor and Cecily are the children of one of the founders of the company, and Naylor resents Pine being promoted over him. Naylor also claims that he knows the identity of Moore's murderer, but when Archie reveals this in a report to the company directors he changes his story and claims Archie was lying. Cecily Pine meets with Wolfe, asking him to drop the investigation. When an article about Wolfe's investigation appears in the newspapers, Inspector Cramer confronts Wolfe in his office about what he knows. The increasingly heated and childish argument is interrupted by a phone call for Cramer; Kerr Naylor has been found dead, killed in a seeming hit-and- run accident in exactly the same manner and location that Waldo Moore had been found. The similarity of the deaths and the location remove any doubt that both men have been the victim of homicide. Wolfe had previously assigned Saul Panzer to shadow Naylor and, while Saul had lost the tail before Naylor's murder, Saul managed to witness Naylor arguing with Hester Livsey hours before his death, with Sumner Hoff also present at the scene. The company directors hire Wolfe to solve the murder of Kerr Naylor in addition to Waldo Moore. Archie hints to Livsey that he is aware of her meeting with Naylor prior to his death, and her suspicious reaction convinces him that she knows even more of the matter than she has let on. Archie persuades her to come to Wolfe's office for an interview, but Sumner Hoff tags along, suspicious and confrontational towards both Archie and Wolfe. When Wolfe challenges them regarding her meeting with Naylor, both claim that they were with each other at the time, concocting an overly detailed story as corroboration. While the lie is obvious, it is also sufficiently unbreakable to completely stall the investigation. Insulted by the transparency of Livsey's lie, Wolfe concocts a plan to expose the truth. Archie stages a meeting with Livsey which, with Archie's prodding, quickly results in the rumour spreading that Livsey knows the identity of the murderer. Livsey eventually cracks under the pressure and insists that she will reveal the truth to anyone other than Jasper Pine. Archie convinces her to accompany him to the brownstone for her protection, where Wolfe summons Cecily Pine by informing her that he knows who the murderer is. When she arrives, Cecily Pine confirms Wolfe's suspicions—the murderer was her husband, Jasper Pine. Pine and Livsey had begun a clandestine affair, but Pine had become increasingly obsessed with her. Although unbothered by the actual affair, Cecily had begun to worry that her husband's obsession was threatening their comfortable lifestyle, and so persuaded Moore to seduce Livsey away from her husband. When Moore and Livsey ended up falling in love, Pine was driven to a jealous rage and murdered Moore. Cecily confided in her brother, and Naylor used the information to try and force Pine out of the company presidency and seize it for himself, but Pine murdered him. Before the authorities can be notified, Wolfe receives news that Jasper Pine has committed suicide. Wolfe and Archie realise that Cecily contacted her husband before meeting Wolfe, and manipulated him into taking his own life. The investigation is closed, and Archie ends the novel by arranging a simultaneous date with Hester Livsey, Rosa Bendini and Gwynne Ferris. Extraordinary events The resolution to this Nero Wolfe case is made significantly more difficult by two events that border on impossibility within the Nero Wolfe universe: 1) Saul Panzer loses a tail, and 2) Fritz forgets to give Archie a message. All of the principal characters in the novel are aghast at how astronomically unlikely each of these events is by itself, never mind both of them occurring in a short period of time. Inspector Cramer, who always assumes Wolfe is keeping vital information from him, is perhaps most convinced of that in this Nero Wolfe story than in any other, since to take what Wolfe and Archie are telling him at face value, he must believe that these two \\"impossible\\" events took place (even though they actually did). Reviews and commentary * Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (October 19, 1947) — Archie Goodwin, Nero Wolfe's right-hand man, takes an assumed name and enters the employ of the engineering firm of Naylor-Kerr, Inc., in order to investigate the death of a former employee of that firm. In no time at all everybody in the Naylor-Kerr organization knows who Archie is and what he is doing. Naturally that makes it a bit difficult for him to carry on. Another difficulty is that there are so many liars about the place. Nero Wolfe advises Archie to counter-attack by capping their lies with others of his own, which Archie does with excellent results. Most of the women in the case—all very attractive—are employees of Naylor-Kerr, and one of them is even more closely connected with the firm. Nero and Archie win out despite the obstructive tactics of almost everyone concerned. But why does Rex Stout call these books Nero Wolfe novels? Surely Archie Goodwin deserves equal billing with his obese employer. * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime — Archie is the center of a seraglio of designing creatures, who want to bribe or seduce him as he helps Nero discover who killed (the victim in a firm) that employs 500 women. Longer than the later tales, this one has a great many lively turns and a good surprise ending.Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. * David Lehman, \\"Escape Into New York\\",\\"Escape Into New York\\" The New York Times (November 25, 2001) — Of Stout's 72 Nero Wolfe novels, the mystery aficionado Jacques Barzun prefers Too Many Cooks (1938). I vote for Too Many Women (1947). But you can't go wrong with And Be a Villain (1948) and The Silent Speaker (1946) if the place you'd like to escape to is New York in the late 1940s. *Terry Teachout, About Last Night, \\"Forty years with Nero Wolfe\\" \\"Forty years with Nero Wolfe\\" (January 12, 2009) — Rex Stout's witty, fast-moving prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe himself is one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels. * J. Kenneth Van Dover, At Wolfe's Door — Too Many Women is one of the last novels of the series to animate the established conventions without going beyond them (e.g. by introducing a master criminal or by implicating one of the members of the repertory cast). Wolfe's role is subordinate to that of Archie, who engages in a number of entertaining encounters with the women of Naylor-Kerr.Van Dover, J.

After four days of harassment that threatened her safety, her parents withdrew her from the school, but the images of Dorothy humiliated and ridiculed by white classmates were seen around the world. History Dorothy Counts was born as one of ten children of Herman Counts, a Presbyterian preacher who later became a professor of philosophy at Johnson C. Smith University.Gaillard xii. In 1956, forty black students from North Carolina applied for transfers to a white school was after the passing of the Pearsall Plan in North Carolina, which amended the Compulsory School Attendance Law so that students may be excused from attending an integrated public school. At 15 years of age, on September 4, 1957, Dorothy Counts was one of four black students enrolled at various all-white schools in the district; she was enrolled at Harry Harding High School in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Emergence Of Diversity: African Americans The three other students—Gus Roberts, his sister Girvaud and Delois Huntley—attended schools including Central High, Piedmont Junior High and Alexander Graham Junior High. Dorothy Counts, whose nickname was Dot, was dropped off on her first day of school by her father Herman Counts, along with their family friend Edwin Thompkins. As their car was blocked from going closer to the front entrance, Edwin offered to escort Counts to the front of the school while her father parked the car. As Counts got out of the car to head down the hill, her father told her, \\"Hold your head high.\\" The harassment started when the wife of John Z. Warlick, an officer of the White Citizens Council, urged the boys to \\"keep her out\\" and at the same time, implored the girls to spit on her, saying: \\"Spit on her, girls, spit on her.\\" Counts walked by without reacting, but told the press later that many people threw rocks at her—most of which landed in front of her feet—and that students formed walls but parted ways at the last instant to allow her to walk past. Photographer Douglas Martin won the 1957 World Press Photo of the Year with an image of Counts being mocked by a crowd on her first day of school. Counts fell ill the following day. With a fever and aching throat, she stayed home from school for the next two days, but had hoped to start the next week better. On her first day, she had befriended two white female students and hoped their friendship would lessen the stress of starting a new school. As she arrived the following week on Monday, the girls told her they could not be friends with her anymore due to them enduring their own harassment while she was absent, including eggs being thrown at them. A few days later on Wednesday, Counts requested to go home for lunch after a group of boys spit in her food the previous day. When she returned that afternoon with her brother, a bystander threw something at their car and shattered the back window. The following day, a week after her first arrival, her parents pulled her from Harding High. At a press conference, her father said: > It is with compassion for our native land and love for our daughter Dorothy > that we withdraw her as a student at Harding High School. As long as we felt > she could be protected from bodily injury and insults within the school's > walls and upon the school premises, we were willing to grant her desire to > study at Harding. Her father sent her to Philadelphia to finish high school and, after earning her diploma, she returned to Charlotte to earn her degree from Johnson C. Smith University in 1965. After attending Harding High for only four days, she was inspired to work in the childcare services and later worked her way to the Vice President position at Child Care Resources Inc.  Recognition  In 2008, Dorothy Counts-Scoggins along with seven other people were honored for helping integrate North Carolina's public schools. Each honoree received the Old North State Award from Governor Mike Easley. In 2006, Counts-Scoggins received an email from a white man named Woody Cooper. He had admitted to being one of the boys in the famous picture and wanted to apologize. They met up for lunch where Cooper asked her to forgive him and she responded by saying, \\"I forgave you a long time ago, this is opportunity to do something for our children and grandchildren.\\" They agreed to share their story and from there, did many interviews and speaking engagements together. In 2010, Harding High School renamed its library in honor of Counts-Scoggins, an honor rarely bestowed upon living persons.

The refuge is located on Maryland's Eastern Shore, just south of Cambridge, Maryland in Dorchester County, and consists of over 28,000 acres (110 km2) of freshwater impoundments, brackish tidal wetlands, open fields, and mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. Blackwater NWR is one of over 540 units in the National Wildlife Refuge System, which is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Blackwater Refuge is fed by the Blackwater River and the Little Blackwater River. The name \\"blackwater\\" comes from the tea- colored waters of the local rivers, which are darkened by the tannin that is picked up as the water drains through peat soil in the marshes. Wildlife In addition to a wealth of wetlands and forests, Blackwater Refuge is also host to over 250 bird species, 35 species of reptiles and amphibians, 165 species of threatened and endangered plants, and numerous mammals that can be spotted throughout the year in Blackwater's marshes, forests, meadows, and fields. During winter migration, Blackwater Refuge is also home to upwards of 15,000 geese and 10,000 ducks. The refuge is currently host to three recovered species: the formerly endangered Delmarva fox squirrel, the delisted migrant peregrine falcon, and the recently delisted American bald eagle. =Mammals= Blackwater Refuge is home to a variety of mammals, which until recently included the South American nutria. Introduced to the refuge in the 1930s, intensive trapping efforts starting in 2002 helped nearly eliminate the animal from the area. Among the mammals is also the Delmarva fox squirrel, considered an formerly endangered species. Blackwater forest management programs are working to protect this squirrel. Mammals found at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge include: {  * Gray squirrel – common * Delmarva fox squirrel – common * Southern flying squirrel – uncommon * Rice rat – common * White- footed mouse – common * Meadow vole – common * Woodland vole – common * Muskrat – common * Nutria – uncommon * Opossum – common * Least shrew – common * Masked shrew – uncommon * Short-tailed shrew – common * Starnose mole – common * Eastern mole – common * Little brown bat – common * Big brown bat – uncommon  * Eastern red bat – common * Evening bat – uncommon * Eastern cottontail rabbit – common * Black rat – uncommon * Norway rat – common * House mouse – common * Woodchuck – common * Red fox – very common * Gray fox – uncommon * River otter – uncommon * Beaver – common * Longtail weasel – uncommon * Mink – uncommon * Striped skunk – common * Raccoon – very common * White-tailed deer – very common * Sika deer – very common } =Reptiles and amphibians= The marshes and swamps of Blackwater provide an ideal living environment for a number of reptiles and amphibians. Blackwater Refuge's reptiles include: {  * northern red-bellied turtle – common * Eastern painted turtle – common * Eastern box turtle – common * Eastern mud turtle – common * Common musk turtle – common * Northern diamondback terrapin – common * Snapping turtle – common * Spotted turtle – common * Northern fence lizard – common * Ground skink – uncommon * Five-lined skink – common  * Broadhead skink – common * Black rat snake – common * Northern black racer – common * Rough green snake – uncommon * Eastern garter snake – common * Eastern hognose snake – uncommon * Eastern kingsnake – common * Redbelly water snake – common * Northern water snake – common * Northern copperhead – uncommon } Blackwater Refuge's amphibians include: {  * Marbled salamander – common * Red back salamander – common * Red-spotted newt – uncommon * Eastern spadefoot – common * Fowler's toad – common * Northern cricket frog – common * Northern spring peeper – common  * Chorus frog – common * Green treefrog – common * Gray treefrog – common * Bullfrog – common * Southern leopard frog – common * Pickerel frog – common * Green frog } =Birds= Blackwater Refuge is a major feeding ground for migrating birds, most abundant being the Canada goose. Swans, cranes, and more than 20 species of duck can be found in its waters. Also of note is the bald eagle, another of the refuge's protected species. The refuge is home to one of the highest concentrations of nesting bald eagles on the Atlantic coast. In all, the refuge is a resting ground for over 200 varieties of bird. Some of the more common birds to be spotted in Blackwater Refuge are: {  * Canada goose * Wood duck * American black duck * Mallard * Blue-winged teal * Various scoters * Northern bobwhite * Great blue heron * Various egrets * Green heron * Turkey vulture * Osprey * Bald eagle * Northern harrier * Red-tailed hawk * Virginia rail * Killdeer * Various sandpipers * Various gulls * Forster's tern * Mourning dove  * Yellow-billed cuckoo * Eastern screech owl * Great horned owl * Red-bellied woodpecker * Eastern wood pewee * Blue jay * American crow * Tree swallow * Carolina chickadee * Tufted titmouse * Carolina wren * Eastern bluebird * American robin * Northern mockingbird * European starling * Various warblers * Northern cardinal * Red-winged blackbird * American goldfinch * House sparrow } =Bald eagles= The most famous wildlife resident in the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge is the bald eagle. The refuge hosts the largest breeding population of bald eagles on the East Coast north of Florida, and during the winter, many eagles migrate to Blackwater Refuge from northern states and from Canada. The Friends of Blackwater website offers a live Eagle Cam that monitors an eagle nest on the refuge. In addition, the Friends of Blackwater also offer a live Osprey Cam that follows the adventures of a nesting pair of ospreys through the spring and summer. Visitor opportunities Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge also offers a wealth of recreational and visitor opportunities for all age groups. Although much of Blackwater Refuge is composed of wetlands, there are still many ways to get close to the wildlife and to enjoy the scenery. The refuge features a Visitor Center on Key Wallace Drive where visitors will find wildlife exhibits, an authentic eagle's nest, Eagle Cam and Osprey Cam TV monitors, the Eagle's Nest Book and Gift Shop, a butterfly garden, restrooms, and maps and brochures that will help visitors make the most of their visit. On the second floor of the Visitor Center is the \\"Wild Birds Unlimited Pathways to Nature Observatory,\\" which features bird exhibits and spotting scopes for viewing the Blackwater River, the marsh, and the Osprey Cam platform. (The second floor is accessible via a staircase or a handicap-accessible elevator). The staff at the Visitor Center also offer educational programs for children, as well as frequent organized bird walks and an annual Eagle Festival. The center is open from 8am – 4pm, seven days a week except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Access to the refuge is from dawn till dusk. The heart of Blackwater Refuge can be accessed via the Wildlife Drive, which is a paved road—approximately 3 1/2 miles in length (or a 6 1/2 mile loop) —that takes visitors along the Blackwater River and offers excellent views of the local wildlife. Visitors can drive, bike, or walk the length of the Drive. There is a daily permit fee of $3.00 for private vehicles (not including commercial vans or buses) and of $1.00 for pedestrians and bicyclists wishing to access the Wildlife Drive. There are also longer permits and passes available, including a variety of annual passes and a senior citizen pass. In addition to the Visitor Center and Wildlife Drive, Blackwater Refuge offers three paddling trails, four hiking trails, and hunting, fishing, and crabbing opportunities. There are also other entrances to Blackwater Refuge, making it possible to drive through the refuge without having to take the Wildlife Drive. About half of the refuge is designated the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument. A portion of the area was transferred to the National Park Service in 2014 as the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park. Staff and volunteers The Blackwater Refuge staff is supported by the Friends of Blackwater, which is a non-profit citizen support group that puts in many volunteer hours at the refuge and sponsors various programs and projects throughout the year. In 2003, the Friends of Blackwater were named the \\"Friends Group of the Year.\\"  References  External links * Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge – USFWS * Friends of Blackwater Brochures – 1933 establishments in Maryland Marshes of Maryland National Wildlife Refuges in Maryland Protected areas established in 1933 Protected areas of Dorchester County, Maryland Swamps of Maryland Wetlands of Maryland Landforms of Dorchester County, Maryland Cambridge, Maryland ","title":"Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"9722485","text":"Schapira may refer to: *Pierre Schapira *Pierre Schapira (mathematician) *David Schapira Jewish surnames Yiddish-language surnames ","title":"Schapira"},{"id":"9722490","text":"Mount Antoine is a 630 Vertical Feet high hill north of the town of Mattawa, Ontario, Canada.

It was formerly a town within Nakakoma District. As of 2003 it has a population of 11,671. The Japanese kanji can be translated as \\"Young\\" - \\"Grass\\". Geography Wakakusa is located approximately 12 kilometers from Kofu. It covers an area of 10.29 square kilometers and lies on latitude 35° north and longitude 138° east. Wakakusa is a relatively flat area with many rice fields and orchards. The Kamanashi River (釜無川）forms its Eastern boundary. History Long ago there were many independent hamlets between the Kamanashi River and the Japan Alps. At the beginning of the Meiji Restoration three hamlets—Tōkaichiba (十日市場), Kagami (加賀美), and Terabe (寺部) merged to form a new village called Mitsue (三枝). After World War II, Mitsue merged with Tōda (籐田), Asabara, and Kagaminakajō (鏡中條) to form the village of Wakakusa. Wakakusa was independent until 2003 when the city leaders decided to merge with the towns of Kōsai, Kushigata and Shirane, and the villages of Ashiyasu and Hatta (all from Nakakoma District) to create the city of Minami-Alps. Devil's Head Tile =Devil's Head tile= Wakakusa has a long tradition of tilemaking. In the past, the Devil's Head tile adorned the cornices of many houses in the village. It is believed that the face keeps evil spirits away. Education Wakakusa contains four schools: * Wakakusa Elementary School (若草小学校） * South Wakakusa Elementary School (若草南小学校） * Wakakusa Junior High School (若草中学校) * Pitagoras International School (Brazilian) Temples Hōzen-ji- Founded in 806 A.D., this temple follows the Nichiren sect of Japanese Buddhism. Anyoji- This temple follows the Shingon sect of Buddhism. It was founded in 1234 A.D. Sister cities *- Kitamura, a village in Hokkaidō, Japan Hot Springs Yu-Yu Furei Park is located in east-central Wakakusa. In addition to a large municipal park the area also contains a Hot Spring. Tōkaichi Festival The Tōkaichi festival (十日市) is the most famous festival in Wakakusa. It occurs every year on 10 February. During the Kamakura period, a distinguished priest, Saint Kakuou, was living in this area. Before he was invited to live here, he had belonged to the famous Koyasan temple in Kii region. On January 10, according to the lunar calendar, he heard an oracle that suggested he carve a statue. He made the statue, and it was deified. People prayed to it day and night. One day, during the rice-planting season in the same year, a rampaging horse was causing great trouble to the farmers. From nowhere, a boy of 15 or 16 suddenly appeared and grabbed the bit of the horse. Miraculously, the horse was calmed down, and then the farmers could plant their rice peacefully. A little after this incident, some people noticed that the statue had some mud attached to its feet. People believed that the statue had transformed into the boy and helped the farmers; the guardian deity got the mud when he was dealing with the horse. Since then, people have called it the \\"Hana-tori Statue\\" which means, \\"A statue that leads horses and cows by their noses\\". They also held an annual festival on January 10, the day when the priest received the oracle. It is said that people from all over Yamanashi came to visit the festival en masse as the rumor of the mythic statue in Tokaichi spread. Geologically speaking, located at the end of the Midai river alluvial fan, this region around Tokaichi is suitable for both rice cultivation and dry field farming. In addition to this, the region is close to key agricultural and forestry places: Takata, a paddy region in former Tatomi and Kosai towns; Genkata, a dry field farming region in former Shirane town; and Nekata, a forestry region in Masuho town. All of these geological conditions of Tokaichi made it become a big market place where farm products and agricultural machines were exchanged or sold. They say that the history of the market dates back to the Edo era. More sundry items are now at the Tokaichi market: Daruma dolls, good luck charms, household tools, garden plants, and prepared food.

Biography Cooper was born in Henley-on-Thames, the third son of Thomas Cooper, under- sheriff of Oxfordshire. Charles entered the Inner Temple in 1822 and was called to the bar in February 1827. He practised on the Oxford circuit until 1838, and was then appointed judge at Adelaide. He and his sister Sarah Ann Cooper landed there in March 1839 in the Katherine Stewart Forbes, and was for many years the sole judge, then senior judge, and in June 1856 was appointed the first South Australian chief justice. In September 1860 he was sworn in as a member of the Executive Council. Cooper retired from the bench in November 1861 and from the Executive Council in August 1862 owing to ill-health and was given a pension of £1000 a year. He returned to England in 1862, resided at Bath, Somerset, and improving much in his health lived to be 92 years of age. He died at London on 24 May 1887. He married in 1853 Emily Grace Newenham, daughter of Charles Burton Newenham (Sheriff of South Australia 1839-1856). He was knighted in 1857. Cooper's Creek, (now Cooper Creek), in central Australia was named after him by his friend, Captain Sturt. Cooper was a thoroughly capable judge who earned the esteem of the colonists. He held courts at first in his own house, which had the advantage that he was constantly on the premises. He was a sound lawyer and framed the first insolvency legislation of the colony. Though not robust looking, he was hospitable and interested in the social and intellectual life of the colony. While in South Australia he had a seaside residence adjacent \\"The Grange\\", Charles Sturt's property for which Grange Beach was named. It is likely that Henley Beach was named for Cooper's hometown after Cooper rejected Sturt's proposed name \\"Cooper's Beach\\". His city home, at south-east corner of Whitmore Square, was in May 1870 re-opened as the Bushmen's Club, a facility for members visiting the city. Family On 7 July 1853, Charles Cooper married Emily Grace Newenham, eldest daughter of Charles Burton Newenham, Sheriff of the Province. They had no children, and she outlived him. His sister Sarah Ann Cooper (c. 1804 – 31 May 1895) married William Bartley (1801–1885), Senior Solicitor to the Lands Titles Office on 23 September 1852.

In the late 1990s, Buckley purchased a townhouse on E 73rd Street to house the Walsh building, its main school. The 74th Street Hubball building continues to be a part of the school and houses Beginners classrooms and athletic facilities. In 2014 two townhouses were purchased on E 73rd Street to serve as the school's Arts and Sciences building. Five headmasters have succeeded B. Lord Buckley: Evelyn Adams (1932-1940), James Hubball (1940-1972), C. Brett Boocock (1972-1982), Brian Walsh (1982-2001) and its current headmaster, Gregory O’Melia (2001–present).

Under his management, the business grew to become a major steel fabrication business, the Glazer Steel Corporation with production facilities in Knoxville and New Orleans. Glazer Steel fabricated bridges and other structures for Kaiser Aluminum, the government of France, and other customers around the world. While still the Chairman of Glazer Steel Corporation, Guilford entered the real estate development business in Knoxville. The first building that Glazer developed was Shelbourne Towers near the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville, described as Knoxville's \\"first high-rise apartment building\\". His entry into the real estate development business occurred in 1951, when the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected a company headed by Glazer to build a shopping center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Located on the northern side of Western Bank, it is the main administrative centre for the university and also houses the Departments of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and Biomedical Science. The main entrance to Firth Court is on floor C, from this point up there are four complete floors (up to F floor which houses the first of the Molecular Biology and Biotechnology lecture theatres (F2) and research labs) and then G floor which is divided into several sections (housing the second lecture theatre (G2) and seminar rooms). This gives the five floors sometimes quoted, however the department's nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) facility extends downwards from floor C and is housed on B (which is ground level at the back of the building), A and a further floor below this which has no official designation. In places the building extends above G floor, these towers do not have official floor letters but extend to what would be I floor. Counted from the bottom of the NMR pit to the highest research laboratory (that of Milton Wainwright) Firth court is 10 floors. The Main Block of Firth Court is linked, via the Addison Building, to the Alfred Denny Building. The Edwardian Block also links the North Block to the Perak Laboratories.  History  in 1904, the people of Sheffield including steelworkers, coal miners and factory workers donated over £50,000 (now equivalent to over £15 million) to help found the University of Sheffield. Firth Court is the first purpose-built building for the university, which was designed by Sheffield-born architect Edward Mitchel Gibbs (1847-1935) and was built between 1903 and 1905. The building, then known as the Western Bank Building, was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in July 1905, two months after the University of Sheffield was granted its Royal Charter on 31 May 1905 and officially came into being. The building originally housed the university's Arts, Science and Medicine departments. It is named after Sheffield steel manufacturer Mark Firth who played a key role in the university's early development.  The Rotunda  The Rotunda was opened as the Edgar Allen Library in 1909 Located to the left of Firth Court, the Rotunda is a neo-Gothic style octagonal chapter house building beside the Weston Park. It was also designed by Gibbs and was constructed of mellow red-brick and sandstone. Opened as the Edgar Allen Building on 26 April 1909 by Prince and Princess of Wales, the building was constructed as a donation from William Edgar Allen, a member of the University Council, to provide a purpose-built library to the university. It housed the Edgar Allen Library that had 100 seats in its reading room and shelves for 20,000 books. The Edgar Allen Library was replaced by a new main library (now Western Bank Library) in the late 1950s, and the Rotunda is currently used as the Registrar and Secretary's Office. The Rotunda has a partly glazed pyramidal roof and a crenellated parapet. It is a 2-storey building with a basement. There is a circular arcade inside the Rotunda with compound piers and transoms containing portraits of university benefactors. The building is linked to the main block of Firth Court via a glazed corridor. The Rotunda (formerly Edgar Allen Building) should not be confused with the university's Edgar Allen House at 241 Glossop Road.  Firth Court Quadrangle  The North Block of Firth Court with the quadrangle in the foreground The Firth Court quadrangle is composed of Firth Hall, North Block and West Block of Firth Court, and the adjoining Florey and Addison buildings. Firth Hall is the original Firth Court block (known formerly as the Western Bank Building) opened in 1905. The North Block and the West Block was completed in 1914 also by Gibbs, forming three sides of a quadrangle. Gibbs planned to build a double quadrangle within the complex, but this was never happened. The forth and the final side of the formal quadrangle was completed with the addition of the Florey and Addison buildings in the late 1940s. During the Second World War, the quadrangle was converted into an air raid shelter. The Firth Court main block, the rotunda and the quadrangle are listed Grade II, yet the Florey and Addison buildings are unlisted.

The lawn and pond are located on the site of a former reservoir for the Croton Aqueduct system which was infilled during the early 20th century. The pond, originally known as Belvedere Lake, abuts Belvedere Castle as well as the Delacorte Theater, and contains a variety of turtles and fish. The lawn is composed of of oval-shaped land, which is used not only for sports but also for concerts. Description Great Lawn The lawn and pond occupy the almost flat site of the rectangular, Lower Reservoir, which was incorporated into the Greensward Plan for Central Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The King Jagiello Monument stands at Turtle Pond's east end, the Delacorte Theater on its west end. The Great Lawn proper, surrounded by an oval-shaped path, covers , while the Turtle Pond and the adjacent Arthur Rice Pinetum occupy another . The Great Lawn and Turtle Pond take up about in total. = Lawn = The Great Lawn is mainly a recreational field, surrounded by an oval walkway. There are eight baseball fields on the Great Lawn (six within the oval walkway and two directly to the north), as well as a soccer field and four basketball courts. = Pond = The Turtle Pond is located south of the Lawn. Most of the park's turtles live in Turtle Pond, and many of these are former pets that were released into the park. = Arthur Ross Pinetum = The Arthur Ross Pinetum, named after philanthropist Arthur Ross, contains 17 species of pine trees across a area on the northwestern side of the oval. History = Site = The Yorkville Reservoir of the Croton Aqueduct system (also known as the Lower Reservoir or the receiving reservoir) was built in 1842 to store the city's drinking water. The community of York Hill was displaced for the creation of the reservoir, and the population moved to Seneca Village to the northwest, which itself was demolished when Central Park was constructed in the 1850s. The reservoir was filled to a depth of starting on June 27, 1842. The reservoir occupied the space between the 79th Street and 86th Street transverse roads, measuring with a capacity of at least . The reservoir was surrounded by a stone retaining wall, a portion of which is still visible near the 86th Street transverse. In Egbert Viele's plan for Central Park, whose rejection prompted the design competition of 1857-1858, the civil engineer \\"considered the reservoir worthy of attention as a major engineering feat, and his plan emphasized it by adding a terrace to the walls, from which spectators could observe military drills\\". Proponents of the naturalistic plans in the competition proposed \\"'planting out' the park boundaries and the 'ugly', 'artificial', 'uncouth', 'horrid', and 'discordant' distraction of the reservoirs in order to reinforce the sense of natural expanse\\". The southwestern corner of the reservoir was overlooked by Vista Rock, atop which Belvedere Castle was built in 1869. When Central Park was completed, the Lower Reservoir served as a complement to the Upper Reservoir, now the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. =Design= Reflections in the water at Turtle Pond As the Croton-Catskill Reservoir system was completed in the first decade of the 20th century, the Lower Reservoir came to be redundant. As early as 1903, there were plans to cover the reservoir to create additional recreational space, and in 1910, park commissioner Charles Bunstein Stover started advocating for the removal of the reservoir. However, in spite of years of prodding, the commissioners of the Catskill Aqueduct were loath to make over their real estate to the city. A number of projects in the City Beautiful manner were suggested for the site. This was epitomized by the Catskill Aqueduct Celebration Committee's commission of a design from the prominent Beaux-Arts \\"society\\" architect Thomas Hastings. Henry Fairfield Osborn lobbied instead for a formal carriage drive that would link his American Museum of Natural History with the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other plans for the site called for airplane landing pads, an opera house, a radio tower, sports arenas, underground parking. and a film-storage mausoleum. These plans were decried as intrusions by park preservationists protecting the Olmstedian rustic plan on the one hand, and as elitist by populist champions of organized recreation facilities, who envisaged playing fields and bath houses for the city's urban poor. The city approved Hastings's plan in 1917. However, with the growing intensity of World War I, Central Park cycled through five parks commissioners between November 1917 and February 1918, and Hastings's plan was dropped by the administration of mayor John Francis Hylan. leftIn 1922, Hastings recast his plan as a recreational center and memorial to the soldiers of World War I, which fulfilled both the City Beautiful and recreational demands for the reservoir site. By the mid-1920s, populist groups and newspapers were publicly calling for expansion of recreational space. Notably, the New York Daily News published a series of articles advocating for different reuses of the receiving reservoir. Nevertheless, the issue became politicized. Hastings's World War I monument proposal, increasingly tied to Hylan's policies, was criticized by many of Hylan's opponents, and lost even more support when Hylan proposed a performing arts center on the site. Hastings stated that the space would be wasted if the memorial plan were to be dropped, and in 1925 the city's Board of Estimate gave preliminary approval to the memorial. The Central Park Association, one of several groups to advocate for the improvement of Central Park, was created in December 1925. They opposed the memorial and subsequently succeeded in reversing the city's endorsement of the memorial. Simultaneously, during the land boom that filled Fifth Avenue and Central Park West with luxury apartment towers for the rich. the Fifth Avenue Association was created. That association also opposed a reservoir memorial because it was seen as contributory to the decline of Central Park. A third group, the Citizens Union. endorsed the city's proposal to fill in the receiving reservoir. In the meantime, Frederick Law Olmsted's son Frederick Olmsted Jr. worked with Harvard librarian Theodora Kimball Hubbard to compile Frederick Sr.'s papers. The resulting publication invigorated preservationists who wanted to see the reservoir redeveloped as a more natural area. This, combined with mayor Jimmy Walker's increases to park budgets, resulted in a small general cleanup of Central Park, but also saw the cancellation of the memorial. = Construction and opening = The reservoir began to be drained in January 1930. The project required the dumping of of dirt into the decommissioned reservoir, which was set to be completed within a year. That April the American Society of Landscape Architects, New York Chapter (ASLA) proposed a sunken meadow and lake within the former reservoir site. In June 1930 the city adopted a plan presented by the ASLA for a great oval of turf, its edges softened by trees planted in clumps within and outside the encircling pedestrian walkway. Two fenced playgrounds at the northern endThe northwestern playground was replanned as the Arthur Ross Pinetum in 1971; the northeastern playground is reconfigured for handball and basketball. were to be screened by shrubs and trees. The drainage was collected in a small receiving reservoir at the south end, the predecessor of the present Turtle Pond, which revealed its essentially rectangular shape, in spite of mild waggles in its concrete curbing. Along its southern shore, the steep gradient that had impounded the reservoir was regraded and planted with trees and shrubs to mask its regularity. The former receiving reservoir was filled in with dirt from the construction of Rockefeller Center.Island in Turtle PondIn the meantime, however, the city teetered on the edge of insolvency during the Great Depression. A \\"Hooverville\\" of improvised shacks developed in the dry bed of the reservoir, as the city began dumping fill. The homeless were initially evicted when they tried to move into the site in late 1930, but public sentiment gradually turned to sympathy. The few dozen shacks on the site were allowed to stay through April 1933, when they were evicted. Following the destruction of the Hoovertown, parks commissioner John E. Sheehy proposed building running tracks and ball fields on the site of the reservoir. The plan was controversial. It was strongly opposed by preservationists and advocacy groups, who argued that these would ruin the rural character of Central Park as originally envisioned by Olmsted and Vaux. The Daily News, on the other hand, supported Sheehy's plan and denounced the objections as classist discrimination, since the opponents of the Sheehy plan were mainly wealthy residents of nearby areas. Sheehy's successor Robert Moses, who would see the ASLA Great Lawn to completion, took office with mayor Fiorello La Guardia in January 1934. Moses subsequently replaced Sheehy's plan with his own, which placed large playgrounds and children's recreational facilities on the perimeter of a proposed meadow. The Great Lawn was essentially completed in 1937. It was planted with pine oaks and European lindens, in the reduced range of trees in the current repertory. With the installation of children's play structures, the Great Lawn became a children's play area, contrasting with the adults' play area in North Woods and North Meadow. =Degradation and restoration= The Great Lawn received its baseball diamonds in the 1950s. Heavy use followed, and by the 1970s, the Great Lawn had badly compacted soil. Advocates argue this compaction was aggravated by its use for outdoor concerts once the Sheep Meadow had been restored in 1979. Eroded topsoil that washed into Belvedere Lake resulted in eutrophication that turned it to algal soup each summer. After Belvedere Castle was renovated in the 1980s, marshes were placed on the northern bank of Belvedere Lake, and turtles were introduced there. In 1987, the Central Park Conservancy proposed renovating Belvedere Lake. However, this was stymied by the presence of dragonflies in the lake, and the project was later postponed. Belvedere Lake was officially renamed Turtle Pond the same year. In October 1995, the Conservancy took up the joint project of rehabilitating fifty-five acres of the lawn and its surroundings. The resodding of the Great Lawn commenced in October 1996, at which point officials replaced a ovoid patch of the Lawn, and nearby areas, with new sod for $18 million. The project was completed the following year. The renovation included the installation of 250 automatic water sprinklers and 2,000 new trees, as well as a nature blind to observe the area's wildlife. The Conservancy also completely drained, re-excavated, and reconfigured Turtle Pond. The project, completed in 1997, was designed so that at no position can a viewer take in all its perimeter. Shoreline plants such as lizard's tail, bulrushes, turtlehead (Chelone glabra), and blueflag iris were planted in submerged concrete shelving designed to offer each group of wetland plants their ideal water coverage. A small island provides sunning spots and secure egg-laying sites for the turtles. Sightings of numerous species of dragon fly not previously noted in Central Park have been made. Use Recreational usage of the Great Lawn In 1996, Great Lawn was used by 12,100 softball games per year, with 250,000 combined players. The following year, it was estimated that 15 million people crossed the Great Lawn every year. = Concerts = Annual concerts by the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic started in the 1960s. Several past concerts have supposedly drawn hundreds of thousands of spectators each. The 1980 Elton John concert drew 300,000 attendees, the 1981 Simon and Garfunkel reunion concert more than 500,000, and the 1982 Anti-Nuclear Rally nearly 750,000. Other large concerts include Paul Simon's 1991 concert, which drew 600,000 fans to the Great Lawn, In September 2003, Dave Matthews Band recorded the live album Central Park Concert at the Lawn, and drew more than 120,000 fans, and Bon Jovi's concert during the 2008 MLB All-Star Weekend, which drew about 50,000 people. Other events held in the Great Lawn included the New York opening of the Disney movie Pocahontas in June 1995, and Pope John Paul II's open-air mass for 125,000 that October. Until the later-canceled OZY Fest in July 2019, most of the Great Lawn's concerts were free to attend. OZY Fest's plans to charge admission on half of the 40,000 tickets was controversial, even though the remaining tickets would be free, because it would require closing off the Great Lawn for nine days in the middle of the summer. Park officials have been skeptical of the claim that hundreds of thousands of people could fit in the Great Lawn, since Bon Jovi's concert in 2008 which filled the lawn. Only about of the lawn are estimated to be usable during concerts, and about 6,000 to 8,000 people could fit in an average acre if each person had of personal space. During the 2004 Republican National Convention, NYC Parks denied protesters the right to organize in either the Great Lawn or North Meadow, citing concerns over possible damage to the turf. In 2005, NYC Parks proposed setting a capacity limit on the Great Lawn to 50,000 people. Many groups and people objected to the proposed regulation, saying that it violated their right to congregate under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The proposal was withdrawn in 2008. However, an independent report the following year recommended a 55,000-person capacity for the Great Lawn, implicitly supporting NYC Parks' initial proposal.

LFA Cup winners enter the Confederation Cup at the Qualifiers Stage. The LFA Cup winners also qualify for the single-match LFA Super Cup against the Liberian Premier League Champions. Venues Matches in the LFA Cup are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The team who plays at home is decided when the matches are drawn. There is no seeding system in place within rounds other than when teams enter the competition, therefore the home team is simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. The LFA Cup Final is usually held at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium Sponsorship The LFA Cup doesn't have sponsors at this moment. LFA Cup winners Five clubs have won consecutive LFA Cups on more than one occasion: Cedar United (1976, 1977), Mighty Barrolle (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986), LPRC Oilers (1988, 1989 and 1999, 2000), Invincible Eleven (1997, 1998)and LISCR FC (2003, 2004). Seven clubs have won the LFA Cup as part of a League and Cup double, namely Mighty Barrolle (1974, 1986, 1995), Invincible Eleven (1987, 1997, 1998), NPA Anchors (1994), Junior Professionals (1996), LPRCOilers (1999, 2005), Monrovia Black Stars (2008) and Barrack Young Controllers (2013). Mighty Barrolle and Invincible Eleven share the record of three doubles. Mighty Barrolle have won a double in each of three separate decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s). Invincible Eleven's three doubles between 1987-1998 highlights their dominance of Liberian football at the time.

Wellness policy Blue Mountain School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246.Blue Mountain School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. According to the policy, the Superintendent shall annually report to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education — Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Blue Mountain High School offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Blue Mountain High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. The District participated in Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools which enabled mobile data collection of health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. Extracurriculars Blue Mountain School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full- credit subjects to participate in sports. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students who reside within the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics provided by Blue Mountain. The students must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home- Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks.

Historically, patents could only cover the technological aspects of a new insurance invention.Chartrand, Sabra \\"Protecting Ideas in the Insurance Business\\" New York Times June 30, 2003 This is still the case in most countries. In the United States, however, recent court decisions have encouraged more inventors to file patent applications on methods of doing business. These patents may be used to get more comprehensive coverage of improvements in basic insurance processes, such as the methods of calculating premiums, reserves, underwriting, etc. This is causing controversy in the insurance industry as some see it as a positive development and others see it as a negative development. History Early example of an insurance patentAn early example of an insurance patent is Means for Securing Travelers Against Loss by Accident. This patent was issued in 1892. It discloses a means for selling travelers' insurance by combining coupons with a newspaper. A more recent example of an insurance patent is , granted as \\"Individual evaluation system for motorcar risk\\". This patent issued by the European Patent Office in 1996 to Salvador Minguijon Perez. It discloses a means for auto insurance risk selection whereby a driver’s mileage and driving behavior are monitored and insurance premiums are charged accordingly. The United Kingdom part of this European patent has been sold to Norwich Union insurance company. Growth Historically, only about one or two patents per year issued in the US on inventions specifically related to insurance policies.Google patent search on “insurance policy” This changed dramatically, however, with the 1998 State Street Bank Decision. The State Street Bank Decision was a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that confirmed that there was no “business method exception” under United States patent law. The number of patent applications filed per year after this decision was handed down jumped to about 150. The number of patents issuing per year jumped to about 30.Insurance IP Bulletin, February 2007, “Statistics” This changed dramatically again in 2014 after the Alice Corp. v.

Portrait of William Henry Bundey from 1880. Sir William Henry Bundey (30 January 1838 – 6 December 1909) was an Australian politician and judge, Attorney-General of South Australia from 27 September 1878 to 10 March 1881. Early life Bundey was born in Exbury, Hampshire, England, the second son of James Bundey and his wife Harriett née Lockyer. The family emigrated to South Australia in 1848 after losing money in England. William's father died about a few weeks after his arrival, and the boy, though only 10 years of age, went to work in a solicitor's office. In 1856 he was appointed clerk of the City of Onkaparinga local court, but gave this position up about six years later to become articled to a solicitor. Bundey was practically self-educated but he was a good law student, and he was admitted to the bar in 1865. He became a most effective advocate, especially in criminal cases; he declined to defend prisoners unless he believed in their innocence. In 1878 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel. Political career On 14 December 1871, Bundey was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Onkaparinga, and from July 1874 to March 1875 was minister for Justice and Education in the third Arthur Blyth ministry. He was responsible for the bill to establish the University of Adelaide. He did not seek re-election in 1875 because of his health, but entered parliament again in 1878 and was Attorney- General in the William Morgan ministry from September 1878 to March 1881. A trip through Europe and the east improved his health. Bundey returned to Adelaide at the end of April 1882. In 1884, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia, a position he held for 19 years. He was appointed president of the board of conciliation in 1894, but resigned some 15 months later.  Late life and legacy  Bundey retired on a pension in 1903, was knighted in 1904, and died on 6 December 1909 at his home at Mount Lofty in South Australia. In 1865 he married Ellen Wardlaw, daughter of Sir William Milne, who survived him with a daughter, Ellen Milne Bundey. Miss Bundey wrote under the name of \\"Lyell Dunne\\" and published several volumes of verse. As a young man Bundey was a captain in the Volunteer Military Movement and later became an expert yachtsman; he was also a cricket enthusiast. He was vice- commodore of the South Australian Yacht Squadron in 1870–74 and commodore in 1874–84. He published his Reminiscences of 25 Years' Yachting in Australia in 1888. As a politician he was responsible for the supreme court act, the district courts act, and insolvency and public trustee acts. As a judge he was courteous and particularly anxious to preserve the rights of the subject, and concerned that prisoners who were not defended should receive justice. He published several pamphlets including Land Reform, Education, Trades Unions (1889), Some Thoughts on the Administration of the Criminal Law (1891), Conviction of Innocent Men (1900).

This shop drawing will require the builder and mechanical engineer to specify the opening size for an air-intake and exhaust louvers to be placed in the concrete openings. Installation information for electrical connections for chiller unit with surface mounted starter. Installation information will need to be reviewed with electrical and plumbing trades to coordinate third-party service connections. A shop drawing is a drawing or set of drawings produced by the contractor, supplier, manufacturer, subcontractor, consultants, or fabricator. Shop drawings are typically required for prefabricated components. Examples of these include: elevators, structural steel, trusses, pre-cast concrete, windows, appliances, cabinets, air handling units, and millwork. Also critical are the installation and coordination shop drawings of the MEP trades such as sheet metal ductwork, piping, plumbing, fire protection, and electrical. Shop drawings are produced by contractors and suppliers under their contract with the owner. The shop drawing is the manufacturer’s or the contractor’s drawn version of information shown in the construction documents. The shop drawing normally shows more detail than the construction documents. It is drawn to explain the fabrication and/or installation of the items to the manufacturer’s production crew or contractor's installation crews. The style of the shop drawing is usually very different from that of the architect’s drawing. The shop drawing’s primary emphasis is on the particular product or installation and excludes notation concerning other products and installations, unless integration with the subject product is necessary. Information required to be included in Shop Drawings =Comparison information for the architect and engineer= The shop drawings should include information for the architect and engineer to compare to the specifications and drawings. The shop drawing should address the appearance, performance, and prescriptive descriptions in the specifications and construction drawings. The shop drawing often is more detailed than the information shown in the construction documents to give the architect and engineer the opportunity to review the fabricator’s version of the product, prior to fabrication. References to the construction documents, drawings, and specifications assist the architect and engineer in their review of the shop drawings. Attachment of manufacturer’s material specifications, “catalog cut sheets,” and other manufacturer’s information may be helpful to accompany these drawings. Because shop drawings facilitate the architect’s and engineer’s approval of the product, they should be as clear and complete as possible. =Notes of changes or alterations from the construction documents= Notes concerning changes or differences from the original documents should be made on the shop drawing for the architect’s and engineer’s approval. Ultimately, they are responsible for changes in these drawings and should have the opportunity to analyze any modifications. A dialogue should occur between the fabricator and the architect and engineer about any areas needing clarification. Successful installations are the result of collaboration between the designer, fabricator, and contractor. =Information needed to fabricate the product= Dimensions, manufacturing conventions, and special fabrication instructions should be included on the shop drawing. It should be clear to fabrication personnel what will be manufactured from the shop drawings alone. The construction documents are rarely used as a reference in fabrication, with the fabricators relying on the shop drawing for all information. =Indication of dimensions needing verification from the jobsite= Most jobsite dimensions, such as the dimensions between two surfaces on the jobsite, need to be verified. A dimension may be shown on the construction drawings, but the actual dimension may vary, from very small to large increments, depending on jobsite conditions. It is extremely important that the fabricated item arrive on the jobsite ready to be installed without field modification. Special care must be taken by the contractor to measure and verify dimensions. In new construction, plan dimensions usually are sufficient for ordering many fabricated items such as structural steel or precast concrete. In remodeling and renovation work, it is essential that field dimensions be verified prior to fabrication. Some fabricators, such as cabinet and casework suppliers, prefer not to rely on the contractor’s verification and will verify the dimensions with their own personnel. =Placement or installation information= Some fabricators and manufacturers will provide symbols, data, or instructions concerning installation. This can include a list of other materials, such as fasteners or adhesives, appropriate but not included for the product. Third party review may be required for major building systems. An example of this would be a commercial chiller which would be furnished by the mechanical contractor, but would require electrical connections, plumbing, rigging, insulation and commissioning. Various third parties will need to review the installation information and confirm they are furnishing compatible equipment and proper layout of services. Review of installation information for major equipment should be reviewed with field supervisors including the project superintendent, trade foremen and field engineer. Installation of major equipment will dictate structural clearances and temporary openings. =Samples= Some fabrications will require a sample submittal with the shop drawing, primarily for color and texture selection of finishes. =Computer- aided Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Design Coordination= Problems with design coordination, such as time consumption and ineffectiveness related to the current 2D paper-based process, are some of the top concerns of a general contractor, since late conflict correction increases the potential for errors in the field. In order to address this issue, there have been an increasing number of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) firms utilizing building information models (BIM) in their coordination and clash detection processes, which according to practitioners, allows for increased coordination and fewer field problems. Leite et al.Leite, F.; Akinci, B.; Garrett, J. (2009) Identification of data items needed for automatic clash detection in MEP design coordination. In: Proceedings of the 2009 Construction Research Congress, Seattle, WA. compared types of clashes identified in a manual coordination process (overlay of 2D drawings on a light table by pairs of subcontractors) and through automatic clash detection using a Building Information Model (BIM). The automatic clash detection identified several clashes that were missed by the subcontractors, who were performing this task manually. Also, the manual clash detection identified clashes which could not possibly be found by the automatic clash detection software, since one of the clashing objects (e.g. cable trays) was not modeled in the BIM. This study also included site observations of field detected clashes, some of which were not identified in either manual or automatic processes. Leite noted that the combination of clashes identified in coordination meetings, those automatically detected, as well as those identified in the field enable identification of objects that need to be modeled in order to capture the largest possible number of clashes. This paper was limited to the comparison of types of clashes identified in each of the three methods during a specific project. Although their results cannot be generalized, they still provide insight towards the need to identify what needs to be modeled in a BIM for MEP coordination prior to the start of the coordination process. Reviews Because writing comments on eight to ten copies is a tedious process and an inefficient use of the architect and engineer's time, they will frequently specify other methods for distributing comments. Quick review is essential during the approval process. Any method that facilitates this, while providing ample opportunity for comment and complete distribution, should be considered. Although a procedure may be specified in the contract drawings, most architects and engineers are open to suggestions and innovations that speed up the process. =Number of copies= Shop drawings are required, in various forms, depending upon the practice of the architect and engineer. A specific number of copies may be required by the specification. An example distribution of the completed and corrected shop drawings may include the: *Owner—file or inspection copy *Architect—file copy *Architect—field copy or inspection copy *Consulting engineer—file copy *Consulting engineer—inspection copy *Contractor—file copy *Contractor—field copy *Supplier—original copy or one copy =Submittal of one or two copies of the shop drawing= Corrections are made by the architect and engineer, and the shop drawing is corrected by the supplier, then the appropriate number of copies is distributed. This method can be time consuming, as the shop drawing is not approved until the corrections are made on it. =Submittal of a copy that can be reproduced = The architect and engineer make comments on the reproducible, then copies are distributed. This method facilitates the timely approval and distribution of the shop drawing. Review comments usually are obvious on the reproducible copy. When sepia copies are used, the reproduction of the sepia often is not as clear as a normal blue-line print. =Compatible CAD software= When the supplier and designer have compatible CAD software or when universal file formats such as IFC, PDF or DWG are utilized, the review can be made from a CD, email or FTP transfer. Comments can be made by the designer in a bold font or changes can be boxed for emphasis. Popular CAD platforms used for generating shop drawings are Advance Steel, AutoCAD, Revit, CATIA, Creo Elements/Pro, Inventor, Solidworks and Tekla Structures. Shop drawings in concrete reinforcing Concrete reinforcing is one of the many items requiring specialized shop drawings for the fabrication of the material. Concrete reinforcing is custom-fabricated from 60-foot-long reinforcing bars. The reinforcing bars are cut to length and bent to specific configurations. The shop drawing and the accompanying “cut sheet” lists the quantity, sizes, lengths, and shapes of the reinforcing bar. This information is provided for review by the structural engineer to ensure that sufficient reinforcing is being supplied; fabrication of the bar by the supplier’s shop; an inventory list for the contractor, upon delivery the typical project has thousands of pieces of reinforcing steel that need to be organized for storage and installation; and placement by the ironworker. The Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) has developed standard symbols, graphics, and formats for shop drawings and cut sheets that generally are used by reinforcing steel fabricators. Each fabricator, has particular style for shop drawings and cut sheets, depending on the draftspeople and Computer-aided design systems. Examples of software used are Advance Concrete, AutoCAD, MicroStation, ProConcrete and Tekla Structures.

The peak of his career was at Santos, despite the fact he was sent off at his debut against São Paulo, where Santos lost at home 2–3. He gained the nickname \\"Bombeiro\\" (Portuguese for Firefighter), because he was always putting away crisis with solid displays or key goals - in fact, he only scored on Santos' single goals victories. He could play as a defensive midfielder or a defender, whether a centre back or a sweeper, being better at this last role on his late career because he lost most of his pace. He was known for fierce and sometimes ugly tackles. Though, he had a really stead temper, rarely being booked for complaining.

Developing several sharp divergences from the tenets of canonical Marxist thought, the authors begin by tracing historically varied discursive constitutions of class, political identity, and social self-understanding, and then tie these to the contemporary importance of hegemony as a destabilized analytic which avoids the traps of various procedures Mouffe and Laclau feel constitute a foundational flaw in Marxist thought: essentializations of class identity, the use of a priori interpretative paradigms with respect to history and contextualization, the privileging of the base/superstructure binary above other explicative models. Organization The book is divided into four chapters (~50 pages each). The first two chapters deal with conceptual developments in the manner of an intellectual history, albeit with much more of an eye to disputation and intervention than traditional intellectual history employs. Specifically, Chapter 1 discusses the work of Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, Eduard Bernstein, and Georges Sorel (among other texts by major thinkers in the Marxist tradition). Chapter 2's discussion of Gramsci's conception of cultural hegemony is followed by Chapter 3's more politicized development of Laclau and Mouffe's own arguments regarding hegemony's character and constitution. Finally, the fourth chapter argues for the relevance of hegemony as an analytic for the understanding and governance of contemporary politics, political engagement, and self-understanding on the Left.  Reception  Hegemony and Socialist Strategy was greeted with positive reviews and has become a reference point in its field; for example, Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek cited Hegemony and Socialist Strategy as a work having influenced his book, The Sublime Object of Ideology. Furthermore, its resolutely \\"post-Marxist\\" self-definition marks it as one of the first major texts associated with this disciplinary development. A new edition was published in 2001, which included a preface by the authors in which they reaffirmed their commitment to the arguments made in 1985. The concept had a great influence on the theory of social movements and post-colonial researchInternational encyclopedia of the social sciences. Vol. 6 / William A.

George Ritzer. — Oxford, etc: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2009. The work also inspired the political movements Podemos and La France insoumise. Norman Geras, in a New Left Article titled 'Post-Marxism?', lambasted Lacau and Mouffe for what he regarded as shallow obscurantism grounded on basic misunderstandings of both Marx and Marxism. After Laclau's and Mouffe's response to Geras' paper (in 'Post- Marxism without apologies'), Geras doubled down with 'Ex-Marxism Without Substance: Being A Real Reply to Laclau and Mouffe' in which he further criticised the post-Marxist turn.

His reputation as the Chicago mob's man in Los Angeles made him one of Hollywood's most fabled and influential fixers.Sidney Korshak, 88, Dies; Fabled Fixer for the Chicago Mob, The New York Times, January 22, 1996 His partnership with Chicago mobsters led him to be named \\"...the most powerful lawyer in the world\\" by the FBI. Early life Sidney was born into a Jewish family, with four siblings, in Chicago's West Side Lawndale neighborhood, on June 6, 1907. His parents were Harry Korshak (1876–1931)Harry Korshak (January 15, 1876 – January 29, 1931) and Rebecca Beatrice Lash (Lashkovitz, Laskowitz) (1883–1963),Rebecca Beatrice Lashkovitz (1883 – November 4, 1963) who were married on July 15, 1902 in Chicago. Sidney's father Harry was a wealthy Chicago contractor. Sidney's younger brother Morris Jerome \\"Marshall\\" Korshak (1910–1996)Morris Jerome \\"Marshall\\" Korshak (February 6, 1910 – January 19, 1996) became a longtime Chicago politician, city treasurer and state senator. Sidney attended Herzl Elementary School, the University of Wisconsin–Madison and obtained his law degree from the DePaul University College of Law. Career Korshak's law practice brought him into contact with many mobsters, such as Al Capone,\\"Mafia Jews...\\" Lisa Keys, The Jewish Daily Forward, 27 Oct 2006 Frank Nitti, Sam Giancana, Tony Accardo and Moe Dalitz. His services were used by the upper ranks of both legitimate and illegitimate business in the United States. Korshak numbered among his friends many Hollywood celebrities and leading figures in the entertainment industry, including MCA/Universal chiefs Jules C. Stein and Lew Wasserman, entertainment lawyer Paul Ziffren (the driving force behind bringing the 1984 Olympics to Los Angeles), MGM chief Kirk Kerkorian, Gulf+Western founder Charles Bluhdorn, Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, William French Smith (labor attorney and future United States Attorney General), California governor Edmund \\"Pat\\" Brown and his son, California governor Edmund \\"Jerry\\" Brown, future Governor of California Gray Davis, producer Robert Evans, Warren Beatty, Barron Hilton and Hugh Hefner. Korshak was highly successful in the field of labor consulting and negotiations, and his client list included Hilton Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, MGM, Playboy, MCA/Universal, and Diner's Club. One of his clients was Jimmy Hoffa, notorious head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Korshak was heavily involved in the Teamsters' west coast operations during a time when organized labor was at the peak of its activity. Korshak was an attorney for various elements of the Chicago Outfit. Korshak bought the J.P. Seeburg Corporation and immediately before the company stock rose from $35 to $141.50 a share. He then sold 143,000 shares to pivotal figures in the stock market including Bernard Cornfield, who owned the FOF Property Fund, in Switzerland. Korshak received $5 million from the deal.

History Originally developed as The Elysian, the project was approved in June 2005; construction took place from 2006 until 2009. The 60 story hotel was designed by Chicago architect Lucien Lagrange and was developed by David Pisor. The project consists of two main parts: a 188-room hotel and 51 condominiums above (estimated at $280 million combined). In 2009 the condominiums were valued between $2.5 and $8.5 million. The hotel opened in February, 2009. In keeping with the tradition of the Gold Coast neighborhood the entrance of the project is a cobblestone courtyard. Its design emulates the grand hotels of Paris in the 1920s, complete with colonnades, spires, and a motor court. The hotel was reported to have failed to make a profit in its first two years and in September, 2011 it was announced that its owner Jones Lang LaSalle was looking to sell after Pisor's equity partner chose to remove itself from the hotel business, rather than developing the Elysian into a hotel brand as had been originally envisioned. Waldorf Astoria Tower in 2015 By November, 2011 it was announced that an investment group and Hilton Hotels would be purchasing the Elysian and converting it to a Waldorf Astoria. A Waldorf Astoria had been planned as part of an international expansion in 2007, but failed to take off due to the economy in 2008. Although a sales price was not disclosed, it is believed that it was purchased for $95 million, which would put it at a per room price of $505,000. It was renamed the Waldorf Astoria Chicago on February 1, 2012, although nearly all of the hotel remained the same.The Waldorf Astoria Chicago In June 2015 it was reported that Sam Zell of Equity Group Investments had reached an agreement to sell the hotel for $113 million to a group led by hotel investor Laurence Geller (who previously founded Strategic Hotels & Resorts) and including the real estate arm of Chinese manufacturer Wanxiang Group.Alby Gallun, \\"Zell to sell Waldorf Astoria for record Chicago price\\", Crain's Chicago Business, June 12, 2015.

Prior to October 1999, NAS Cecil Field was the largest military base in terms of acreage in the Jacksonville, Florida area. NAS Cecil Field consisted of four separate facilities, the NAS Cecil Field Complex (Cecil Field), Outlying Field Whitehouse (OLF Whitehouse), the Yellow Water Weapons Department and the Pinecastle [Pine Castle] Electronic Warfare Target Area / Warfare Range. Including nearly 2,500 acres (10 km²) at OLF Whitehouse, the NAS Cecil Field complex consisted of 22,939 acres (92.8 km²); in addition, the base leased another 8,379 acres (33.9 km²). By late 1999, approximately 17,200 acres (69.6 km²) were transferred to the civilian sector in the form of the Jacksonville Aviation Authority, while the remainder was transferred to Naval Air Station Jacksonville. As directed by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) and the U.S. Congress pursuant to BRAC 1993 and BRAC 1995, NAS Cecil Field was decommissioned as an active naval installation on 30 September 1999. It is now a civilian, public-use, joint civil-military airfield and industrial park known as Cecil Commerce Center and Cecil Airport. History NAS Cecil Field was named in honor of Commander Henry Barton Cecil, USN, who died in 1933 in the crash of the Navy airship USS Akron. Shortly before the United States' entry into World War II, a 2,600 acre (11 km²) tract of land was purchased in western Duval County and construction began on the \\"U.S. Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Cecil Field\\" (NAAS Cecil Field). =1940s= The base got its start in June 1941 as an outlying field of NAS Jacksonville, and operations were accelerated just 11 days after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. Carrier-based fighter (VF) and scout bombing (VSB) units of Advanced Carrier Group, Atlantic arrived at Cecil Field in late 1942 to commence replacement pilot combat training and Cecil Field was commissioned as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) in February 1943. In March 1943, the fighter training unit moved to nearby Naval Auxiliary Air Station Lee Field in Green Cove Springs, and NAAS Cecil Field became the principal war-at-sea and dive-bombing training center for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. From 1943 until the war ended, NAAS Cecil Field was a pilot's last stop before assignment to combat in either the Atlantic Fleet or Pacific Fleet. It operated at full capacity during the war years and after the war. FJ-3 from VF-62 at NAS Cecil Field, 1956. =1950s= Disestablished as NAAS Cecil Field at the end of World War II, it was then re-established and disestablished until finally redesignated as a Naval Air Station Cecil Field on 30 June 1952. The station was rejuvenated as an operating base for fleet aircraft squadrons and air groups, ushering in the \\"jet age\\" for Naval Aviation in the Jacksonville area. In the mid-1950s, NAS Cecil Field's growth was given further impetus when the station was selected to serve as one of four naval air stations to be designated as Master Jet Bases specifically used for the operation of carrier-based jet aircraft. In 1951, the land area of NAS Cecil Field was increased to 4,600 acres (19 km²) and additional new buildings and facilities were constructed. Naval Air Station Cecil Field occupied 19,664 acres (79.6 km²), and was projected to be Navy's largest Master Jet Base. =1960s= F8U-1s of VF-62 over NAS Cecil Field, 1962. It was RF-8 Crusaders from Light Photographic Squadron SIX TWO (VFP-62) out of NAS Cecil Field (along with Marine Aviators from Marine Photographic Squadron TWO (VMAQ-2VMCJ-2), based at MCAS Cherry Point, NC and flying the same aircraft) who, in coordination with U.S. Air Force U-2 and RF-101 aircraft, detected the presence of nuclear-armed intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba and monitored the associated Soviet buildup during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. =1990s: Base Realignment and Closure= Naval Air Station Cecil Field was identified for closure by the 1993 federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) and approved by the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton in July 1993. Upon this notice by the BRAC, the city of Jacksonville initiated the development of a reuse plan to guide transition of base property and facilities to other uses that support local goals for economic and community development. There have been efforts to see the base returned as a Naval Air Station (NAS), but these have failed due to political and economic forces.

The first weather observations were recorded at NAS Cecil Field in May 1949, with the first meteorological equipment installed in December of the same year. In those days, weather observing and forecasting services were provided by the Meteorology Division of the Air Operations Department. The \\"weather guessers\\" of Cecil Field first became a detachment, as Naval Weather Service Environmental Detachment (NWSED), Cecil Field when, in an effort to centralize control of support from the Navy's shore-based meteorological units, the CNO established the Office of the Naval Weather Service on 29 December 1965. In September 1979, almost 14 years later, the name changed to Naval Oceanography Command Detachment (NOCD), Cecil Field. Squadrons from NAS Cecil Field were aboard every Atlantic Fleet aircraft carrier deployed to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. During this period, thirteen NAS Cecil Field pilots were listed as POW or MIA. The POW/MIA memorial located behind the base chapel has become the chosen site for many retiring officers and enlisted personnel to hold their retirement ceremonies. The first Atlantic Fleet Squadrons to fly the A-7 Corsair II, the F/A-18 Hornet, the S-3A and S-3B Viking, and the ES-3A Shadow were all based at NAS Cecil Field. NAS Cecil Field squadrons again made history during the Gulf War, marking the final combat deployment for the A-7E Corsair II and the first combat operations for the S-3B Viking. F/A-18 Hornets from CVW-17 returning to NAS Cecil Field, 1994.

A Democrat, Carroll represented Colorado House District 36 in the city of Aurora from 2004 to 2008, and she represented the state's 29th Senate district from 2009 to 2017. Carroll served as President of the Colorado State Senate from 2013 to 2014 and as minority leader in 2015. Carroll stepped down as minority leader in July 2015 to unsuccessfully run against incumbent Republican Mike Coffman for Colorado's 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to her legislative work, Carroll works for the law firm of Bachus & Schanker. Early life and education Morgan Carroll was born November 24, 1971 in Denver, Colorado to John Carroll and Rebecca Bradley. Her father was a lawyer who served as a Colorado State Representative for Adams County between 1964 and 1974. Her mother was an attorney and Carroll's partner at the mother/daughter disability and family-law firm Carroll & Bradley in Aurora from 2000 to 2010. When Carroll was young, she helped care for her father after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's, and later, Alzheimer's. Her family experienced financial difficulties during that time. Carroll graduated from Boulder High School in 1990. She worked various jobs, including at a gas station and fast-food restaurant, to pay for her education. She graduated from the University of Colorado Denver in 1996 and from the University of Colorado Law School in 2000. Colorado State Legislature =Colorado House of Representatives= Carroll first ran for the Colorado House of Representatives District 36 in 2004, defeating Republican Jim Parker 55%-45%. She won reelection in 2006 with 62% of the vote against Republican Brian R. Boney. =Colorado State Senate= Carroll first ran for the Colorado State Senate District 29 in 2008, defeating Republican Suzanne Andrews 69%-31%. She won re-election in 2012 with 59% of the vote, defeating Republican Bill Ross and Libertarian Michele Poague. = Tenure = Carroll sponsored lobbying disclosure laws in 2006 and 2014. During her first year in office, she refused to discuss legislative issues with lobbyists during debate, a practice that led them to complain about her to the Democratic leadership. Her first bill, a workers compensation measure that would allow injured workers to choose their own doctors, was opposed by 240 lobbyists and ultimately failed, as did the other two bills Carroll submitted that year. She is considered an environmentalist, and has been criticized by lobbyists for oil and gas companies. In 2013, Carroll and fellow Democratic Representative Rhonda Fields sponsored Colorado House Bill 1229, which mandates universal background checks for gun purchases in the state. Colorado State Senate Committee assignments *Senate Judiciary Committee (Chair) *Executive Committee of the Legislative Council (Vice-Chair) *Legislative Council (Vice- Chair) *Senate Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Energy Committee *Senate Health and Human Services Committee *Police Officers and Firefighters Pension Reform Committee *Redistricting Committee =2016 U.S. Congress campaign= Carroll was the 2016 Democratic nominee in Colorado's 6th congressional district. She was defeated by incumbent Republican Representative Mike Coffman in the general election, in which she won 42% of the vote. Carroll was endorsed by Democratic Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, EMILY's List, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the League of Conservation Voters. A super PAC called Immigrant Voters Wins supported her, spending $10,000 as of September 2016. Carroll raised the majority of her contributions from individual donors. Americans For Prosperity, the conservative advocacy organization backed by the Koch family, alleged that Carroll had conflicts of interest while serving in the state senate. The Denver Post rated the claim somewhat true and wrote that AFP's claim of a conflict of interest was not true in that Carroll had not benefited from the bill, but that the Colorado Ethics Board of the General Assembly had ruled that lawmakers should proactively disclose \\"potential\\" conflicts of interest. =Colorado Democratic Party= After an unsuccessful campaign to become the next congressional representative for Colorado's 6th congressional district, Carroll shortly after announced her candidacy for the chairmanship of the Colorado Democratic Party. On March 11, 2017, Carroll was elected as the next Chairperson of the party. Personal life Carroll was briefly married and is now divorced. Her longtime partner and former campaign manager, Mike Weissman, is a member of the Colorado House of Representatives. Carroll is the author of Take Back Your Government: A Citizen's Guide to Grassroots Change (2011).

At the time of its closure in 2001, it was managed by the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust. History =Early history= Victorian wing Edwardian wing just before demolition in 2013 Following a large donation by Thomas Jessop, a wealthy steelworks-owner, a new building was commissioned to replace the old Sheffield Hospital for Women at Figtree Lane, which had only six beds. The new facility was designed by John Dodsley Webster in the Gothic Revival style. The building cost £26,000 – a lot of money at the time – all paid for by Jessop. It opened as the Jessop Hospital for Women in 1878. An extension, known as the Edwardian wing, was completed in 1902. Between 1927 and 1972 the hospital had a 45 bed annexe at Norton Hall known as the Firth Auxiliary Hospital. Operation of the hospital was transferred from the Sheffield Health Authority (dissolved on 1 April 1992) to the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust on 1 November 1991, who continued to operate the hospital until its closure. The hospital was in the news in 1998 when Diane Blood gave birth to a baby boy, having been inseminated using her husband's sperm, which had been taken from his body while he was unconscious on life support, shortly before his death. A prolonged legal case gave her the right to do this, despite not having the written consent of her husband. =Closure and redevelopment= After services transferred to the Jessop Wing of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, the hospital closed in 2001. In 2007 the majority of the 1970s wing was demolished by the University of Sheffield as part of their Jessop West development. The Victorian Wing of the original hospital was converted to house the Department of Music, who occupied it in 2009. Despite being a Grade II listed building, demolition of the Edwardian wing started on 30 July 2013. Demolition was pursued in favour of renovation as it provided the University of Sheffield with a greater floor area for new development at a lower cost.

He previously played for the New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, Houston Astros, Toronto Blue Jays, and Cleveland Indians. After playing baseball at J. W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida, the Yankees drafted Clippard in the ninth round of the 2003 MLB draft. He debuted with the Yankees as a starting pitcher in 2007. After being traded to the Washington Nationals he was named to the MLB All-Star Game in 2011 and 2014, and won the MLB Delivery Man of the Month Award in June 2011. Amateur career Clippard was born in Lexington, Kentucky. His family moved to Florida when he was a toddler. Clippard played baseball in Little League; in eleven years, he won seven district titles, but was never able to reach the Little League World Series. He learned to pitch when he was eight years old. In 2001, he was a member of the Palm Harbor team that won the Senior League World Series. Clippard began his high school career at Palm Harbor University High School in Palm Harbor, Florida. After failing to make the varsity baseball team in his first two seasons, he transferred to J. W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida, where he played for the school's baseball team. As a junior, in 2002, he won six games. He was named to the All-Conference first team. In 2003, his senior season, Clippard had a 1–1 record with an 0.81 ERA and 31 strikeouts in innings pitched. However, he was dismissed from the school's baseball team after being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Clippard transferred to Dunedin High School in Dunedin, Florida, which had a nationally ranked baseball team. Clippard attempted to play for their team, but the move was blocked by the Florida High School Athletic Association, as players are not allowed to transfer during the course of a season, nor are they allowed to transfer to avoid sanctions given for disciplinary reasons. After taking classes at Dunedin for a month, Clippard transferred back to Mitchell in order to graduate from high school with his friends. Clippard competed for the Central Florida Renegades in Connie Mack Baseball, an amateur 18-and-under competition organized by the American Amateur Baseball Congress. He earned pitcher of the week honors in the Florida State Elite Baseball League in June 2003. Clippard also played golf at Mitchell. As a sophomore, in 2001, Clippard was named one of the ten best golfers in Pasco County. He registered the best individual score in the Sunshine Athletic Conference tournament that year. He was named to the All-Conference first team as a junior and to the All-County as a senior, and helped lead Mitchell to victory in the Sunshine Athletic Conference tournament during his senior year. Professional career =Draft= Without the benefit of a full senior season to show himself off to scouts, Clippard proactively sent scouts a schedule of when he was throwing and attended as many showcases as he could. He trained with Roy Silver, a retired professional baseball player, who worked with Clippard on his mechanics and his maturity. Clippard's father, Bob, teamed up with Tom Kotchman, father of Florida high school player Casey Kotchman, to form showcases with past teammates of Clippard. Clippard was drafted in the ninth round of the 2003 MLB draft, with the 274th overall selection, by the New York Yankees. Though he had signed a National Letter of Intent in the fall of 2002 to attend the University of South Florida on a baseball scholarship, allowing him to play college baseball for the South Florida Bulls, he chose to turn professional due to his draft position and the opportunity to play for the Yankees. =New York Yankees= Clippard made his professional debut that year in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) with the GCL Yankees, pitching to a 3–3 win–loss record with a 2.89 ERA. In innings, he allowed 33 hits and five walks while striking out 56. Moving up to the Battle Creek Yankees of the Class A Midwest League for the 2004 season, Clippard had a 10–10 record with a 3.44 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.53:1 in 25 starts. Clippard was 10–9 with a 3.18 ERA for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL) in 2005. He was named to the West team in the FSL All-Star Game. However, he did not appear in the game, as the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League needed another pitcher that day. Clippard was named FSL pitcher of the week for the week of July 10 through 17. For the season, opponents batted .219 against him and he struck out 169 batters in innings, while walking 34. He led Yankees farmhands in strikeouts and finished fifth in the affiliated minor leagues, behind Francisco Liriano, Joel Zumaya, Rich Hill and Chuck James. He also led the FSL in strikeouts and was seventh in ERA. However, he did not make the FSL post-season All-Star team and Baseball America did not rank him as one of the league's top prospects. Baseball America ranked Clippard as the Yankees' tenth best prospect heading into the 2006 season. Promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League in 2006, Clippard again led Yankee farmhands in strikeouts (175). He allowed just a .200 batting average and had three times as many strikeouts as walks. Clippard was 12–10 with a 3.35 ERA for the Trenton Thunder. He threw the first no-hitter in franchise history on August 17, shutting down the Harrisburg Senators. He was named the Eastern League's pitcher of the week for his accomplishment. Earlier in the season, Clippard flirted with a perfect game, retiring the first 21 batters in a game against the Binghamton Mets. Clippard also won nine straight games at one point, breaking the club record of eight shared by Tomo Ohka and Carl Pavano. He teamed with Phil Hughes to form one of the best pitching duos in minor league baseball. Clippard again was fifth in the affiliated minors in strikeouts, trailing Yovani Gallardo, Francisco Cruceta, Matt Maloney and Franklin Morales. He led the Eastern League in strikeouts and was seventh in ERA. Baseball America ranked him as the tenth-best prospect in the Eastern League. Clippard began 2007 with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA in his first eight starts, striking out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the starting rotation, they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard. When Darrell Rasner broke his finger in May, Clippard was called up to New York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and Jeff Karstens. Making his MLB debut on May 20, 2007, in an interleague game against the New York Mets, Clippard recorded his first MLB win. He pitched six innings, giving up one run off the bat of David Wright and three hits. He struck out his first major league batter, José Reyes, on three pitches. He recorded his first career hit in his second at-bat off Mets pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, a double to right center in the sixth inning. Clippard was optioned back to the minor leagues in June. He struggled in his return to the minor leagues for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and was demoted to Trenton in July. Though he was a member of the Trenton team as they won the Eastern League championship, Clippard struggled in the playoffs. The Yankees recalled him in September. Overall with, he had a 3–1 record and a 6.33 ERA with the Yankees. =Washington Nationals= Washington Nationals in 2011 Clippard was traded on December 4, 2007, to the Washington Nationals for relief pitcher Jonathan Albaladejo. The Nationals viewed him as a contender for a spot in the starting rotation. However, he began the season with the Columbus Clippers, Washington's Class AAA affiliate. He pitched his first game for the Nationals on June 9, 2008, after Odalis Pérez was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was optioned to the minor leagues after this start, but was given a second start a few days later, as Pérez was not yet ready to return. The Nationals then optioned Clippard to Columbus after his second start, in which Clippard pitched to a 1–1 record and 4.35 ERA. He was recalled later in June as Shawn Hill was placed on the disabled list. He spent most of the season with Columbus, going 6–13 with a 4.66 ERA. He tied Yorman Bazardo and Charlie Haeger for the most losses in the International League that season. During spring training in 2009, the Nationals optioned Clippard to the Syracuse Chiefs, Washington's new Class AAA affiliate. Despite starting six games with the Yankees in 2007 and two for the Nationals in 2008, he was converted to a relief pitcher for the 2009 campaign. Nationals' pitching coach Steve McCatty told Clippard that his future was pitching in relief, because his pitch count tended to get too high in starts, and opposing batters hit Clippard well by the third time the lineup turned over in a game. Clippard at first resisted the transition to the bullpen, but conversations with his father and agent, Casey Close, reassured him to continue pursuing his dream. Clippard appeared in 20 games for Syracuse in 2009, posting a 4–1 record, 0.92 ERA, and 42 strikeouts in 39 innings. Clippard pitched in 14 consecutive scoreless appearances before being promoted to the Nationals on June 21, 2009, replacing Kip Wells in the Nationals' bullpen. Used sparingly in the first weeks after his promotion, he posted a 2.69 ERA through innings, with 67 strikeouts. Since 2010, Clippard has pitched exclusively out of the bullpen; primarily in the eighth inning. That season, Clippard and Drew Storen served as setup pitchers to Matt Capps. After pitching effectively in the first half of the season, Clippard and Capps earned the nickname \\"Clip and Save\\". Clippard finished eighth in the National League in appearances, with 78. He won eleven games on the season, which led the team. In the first half of the 2011 season, Clippard had a 1–0 record and 1.73 ERA. He struck out 63 batters and allowed only 26 hits in innings pitched, and allowed only six of 32 inherited runners to score. For his achievements, Clippard was selected to appear in the All-Star Game. He earned the victory for the National League as the game's winning pitcher, despite not retiring a batter. Adrián Beltré, the only batter Clippard faced, singled, but Hunter Pence threw out José Bautista at home plate, and the NL took the lead in the next inning. Clippard finished the season with a 3–0 record, a 1.83 ERA, and 104 strikeouts in innings pitched across 72 appearances. He led the National League in win probability added. Before the 2012 season, Clippard and the Nationals agreed to a one-year contract worth $1.65 million, avoiding salary arbitration. Clippard became the de facto closer for the Nationals in the first half of the 2012 season. After injuries to Storen and Brad Lidge, Henry Rodríguez became the closer, but Rodriguez lost the job to Clippard due to his struggles. The Nationals kept Clippard as their closer even after Storen returned to the team. He was named the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month for his performance in June 2012, recording ten saves in ten opportunities, and allowing zero runs in innings pitched. Clippard earned $4 million in 2013. He had a 6–3 record with a 2.41 ERA and 73 strikeouts in 71 innings pitched. Clippard and the Nationals agreed on a $5.875 million salary for the 2014 season. He appeared in 20 of the Nationals' first 40 games, and struggled with poor command of his pitches. His command improved as his workload decreased, and he was named to the appear in the 2014 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a 2.18 ERA, and led MLB with 40 holds. =Oakland Athletics and New York Mets= New York Mets in 2015 The Nationals traded Clippard to the Oakland Athletics for Yunel Escobar on January 14, 2015. Clippard and the Athletics agreed on an $8.3 million salary for the 2015 season. With Athletics' closer Sean Doolittle beginning the season on the disabled list, Clippard served as the team's closer. Clippard saved 17 games for the Athletics, pitching to a 2.79 ERA in innings. On July 27, 2015, the Athletics traded Clippard to the New York Mets for pitching prospect Casey Meisner. Clippard returned to a setup role, with Jeurys Familia remaining the Mets' closer. In innings with the Mets, Clippard pitched to a 3.06 ERA. In the 2015 MLB postseason, Clippard allowed five earned runs in innings. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Clippard with the Diamondbacks in 2016 After receiving fewer contract offers than he had expected, Clippard signed a two-year, $12.25 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks on February 8, 2016. Through July 31, 2016, Clippard pitched to a 4.30 ERA in innings with one save. =Second Stint with Yankees= On July 31, 2016, the Diamondbacks traded Clippard to the Yankees for Vicente Campos. He had a 2.49 ERA in innings pitched for the Yankees in the remainder of the 2016 season. He began the 2017 season with a 1.57 ERA in 23 innings. He then struggled with his command, pitching to a 13.06 ERA over his next innings, though he followed the All-Star break with two scoreless appearances. As a result, his ERA rose to 4.95. =Chicago White Sox= On July 18, 2017, the Yankees traded Clippard, Blake Rutherford, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polo to the Chicago White Sox for David Robertson, Todd Frazier, and Tommy Kahnle. Clippard made 11 appearances with the White Sox, earning two saves, and pitching to a 1.80 ERA. =Houston Astros= The White Sox traded Clippard to the Houston Astros in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations on August 13, 2017. Clippard broke the news himself by changing his biographical information on Twitter and Instagram. With the Astros to finish 2017, Clippard made 16 more appearances out of the bullpen, having a 0–2 record and a 6.43 ERA. Overall in 2017, combined with all three teams he had played for, Clippard's total stats came to 67 appearances out of the bullpen, a 2–8 record, and a 4.77 ERA. The Astros finished the 2017 season with a 101–61 record, clinching the AL West. Clippard, however, was not part of any postseason action, although he was still on the Astros 40-man roster at the time. The Astros won their first World Series in franchise history as they bested the Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games of the 2017 World Series. Clippard would still win his first career World Series championship after 11 seasons of service in the Majors. =Toronto Blue Jays= On March 7, 2018, Clippard signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. His contract was purchased by the Blue Jays on March 29, 2018, and he was assigned to the Opening Day roster. After Roberto Osuna, the Blue Jays' closer, was placed on administrative leave in May, Clippard began receiving save opportunities. Clippard received his World Series ring on June 25, when the Blue Jays visited Houston. On August 2, Clippard made his first start since 2008 against the Seattle Mariners. His 680 relief appearances between starts established a new major league record. Clippard finished the 2018 season with a 3.67 ERA, seven saves, 15 holds, and 85 strikeouts over 68 innings. = Cleveland Indians = On February 23, 2019, Clippard signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, worth $1.75 million if he pitched at the major league level. He also received a non-roster invitation to spring training Clippard strained a pectoral muscle during spring training, and was shut down for the remainder of spring training. To avoid paying Clippard a $100,000 retention bonus, the Indians released and re-signed Clippard on March 20.

With the 2020 Minnesota Twins, Clippard appeared in 26 games, compiling a 2-1 record with 2.77 ERA and 26 strikeouts in 26.0 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/tyler-clippard-461325 International career Clippard played for Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, helping the team win the tournament. He pitched 4 and a third innings giving up only one run and recording six strikeouts. Scouting report Clippard is listed at and . He has an unorthodox pitching delivery, rocking forward while sticking his gloved hand high in the air, which creates an unusual arm angle while pitching, making it difficult for hitters to pick up the ball in their line of vision. Clippard's father taught him to pitch this way when Clippard was eight years old by having him throw his baseball glove. McCatty nicknamed Clippard's delivery \\"The Funk\\". Clippard primarily throws a fastball and a changeup. His hard, straight four-seam fastball averages about , topping out at , and sets up a deceptive changeup in the high 70s to low 80s. Periodically, he throws a cutter early in the count to right- handed hitters and a curveball in the mid 70s. Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success comes from his curveball and changeup. Clippard has compiled a strikeout rate of greater than 10 per 9 innings over his career. According to Clippard, \\"I don't try to strike out everyone that I face. Strikeouts just kind of happen with the way I pitch.\\" Personal life Clippard was raised by his parents, Bob and Debbie Clippard. He has a brother named Colin, who played Little League baseball with Tyler. He is from Tampa, Florida.

Early life and academic career Dyke was born Franklin Moore Brown in San Francisco, on April 16, 1915. He was the son of Frank A. Brown and Dorothy Gary Moore. According to his niece, Nancy Woodward, the name \\"Dyke\\" began in early childhood. His mother used to call him a \\"cute little tyke\\". When his brother Gary mispronounced \\"tyke\\" as \\"dyke\\", the nickname stuck. His high school years were spent at Piedmont High School; he graduated in 1932. Before enrolling in college, he traveled in Europe and attended the Schule Schloss Salem school in Germany, then under the direction of the noted educator, Kurt Hahn. Returning to the U.S., Brown attended U.C. Berkeley and graduated in 1936, with a BA with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa. He then went to University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, from 1936 to 1938, earning a B.A. and M.A. in Politics, Economics, and Philosophy. While at Oxford, Brown visited Italy, where he met his future wife, Catherine Whitely, known to all as Kate. From Berkeley, Brown went to Yale Law School, where he earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1941, and was immediately hired as Assistant Dean and Assistant Professor of Law by Yale. World War II America entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. Brown, like many of his generation, immediately enlisted in the Navy, and was appointed flag lieutenant and aide to Admiral Jules James, commander of the Sixth Naval District in Charleston, South Carolina. Brown was on active duty from 1942 to 1945. 1946 to 1962: From the Practice of Law to the Ford Foundation After the war, Brown returned to San Francisco and his law career. He first worked for John Francis Neylan (William Randolph Hearst's general counsel) and then in 1949, became a partner at the firm of Cooley, Crowley and Gaither. Horace Rowan Gaither was commissionedHistory  About  Ford Foundation by the Ford Foundation's Board of Trustees to create a series of studies to guide the Foundation's growth. In 1949, Gaither recruited Brown to serve as an Assistant Director of the Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program. In 1953, Dyke was elected a Vice President of the Ford Foundation, with an emphasis on the Foundation's Public Affairs Program and the Program in Economic Development and Administration. The Brown family moved from California to Scarsdale, New York. Brown's interest in educating youth grew out of several sources: his own children's educational experiences and his work for the Ford Foundation in youth development and preventing juvenile delinquency. He conceived the desire to start a boarding school that would embody his ideas. The Athenian Years, 1962 to 1977 Brown left the Ford Foundation in 1962, and returned to the San Francisco Bay Area to raise funds and look for land for the school. In 1963, a portion of the Blackhawk Ranch was purchased, and construction began. The school opened with 9th and 10th grades, in the fall of 1965. Brown continued to serve as the founder and chief fundraiser, working toward his goal of four distinct campuses sharing a common core of facilities. In the early years, Brown also taught a seminar to upperclassmen in constitutional law. Activities after The Athenian Years Brown retired from active service to Athenian in 1977, focusing his interest on younger children. He coordinated with the Hewlett Foundation to create the Child Development Project. Brown was strongly influenced by Kurt Hahn, the German educator who founded Outward Bound and Gordonstoun in Scotland. The conferences of schools influenced by Hahn's educational ideas is called Round Square. For many years, Athenian was the only American member of the Round Square conference.

The book contains three stories that first appeared in The American Magazine: * \\"Before I Die\\" (April 1947) * \\"Help Wanted, Male\\" (August 1945) * \\"Instead of Evidence\\" (May 1946, as \\"Murder on Tuesday\\") Each of the stories involves a character who is posing as someone else. Reviews and commentary * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime — A particularly good bunch of early shorts ... All three start with victims or potential victims—of murder chiefly, but also of blackmail. The plots and their unraveling by Wolfe and Archie are superior examples of art, with plenty of drama, humor, and exact reasoning.Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. * Beatrice Sherman, The New York Times Book Review (February 27, 1949) — \\"A Nero Wolfe Threesome\\" is the subtitle for this collection of mysteries. The opening situation in each story is that of a man who feels sure he is going to be killed and wants to pay Wolfe handsomely to stave off the evil day — permanently, if possible. Wolfe refuses to set his nimble brain, his bulky body or his trusted aide, Archie, working on such cases. The odds against a determined murderer are too long. Mr. Wolfe would rather devote himself to his orchids. As it turns out, Wolfe and Archie are drawn into the thick of all three cases, and solve them by playing their usual fast-and-loose game of cooperation with the police. Lovely going all the way, but not the Nero Wolfe-Archie team at its best. * The New Republic (February 7, 1949) — Nero Wolfe and Archie have never been in better form than they show in these three novelettes. Exciting action interesting characters and lively dialogue furnish an evening of solid pleasure. * Saturday Review of Literature (February 19, 1949) — Nero Wolfe and his ineffable henchman Archie perform through three \\"novellas\\" of crime and caustic conversation. First appearance in book form of tales that have even more pungency and punch than recent book-length adventures of precious Manhattan duo. Very good. * J. Kenneth Van Dover, At Wolfe's Door, on the novella \\"Before I Die\\" — Wolfe contrives to execute justice. The murderer's indictment and trial might cause an emotional strain on an innocent person. Therefore, Wolfe sets up the situation resulting in the justifiable homicide. Wolfe's aside regarding lawyers — \\"They are inveterate hedgers. They think everything has two sides, which is nonsense\\" — points to a basic appeal of the detective genre: its commitment to a clearcut morality to which evil-doing is inexcusable and retribution is unapologetic. Wolfe also argues that the wishes of gangsters are as much entitled to respect as are those of \\"an oil marauder or a steel bandit.\\"Van Dover, J.

It is situated adjacent to the River Avon, near the village of Brandon, a few miles east of Coventry. The reserve is also the headquarters of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. Formerly used for sand and gravel quarrying, the 92 hectare (228 acre) site is owned by French industrial company LaFarge Industries and is leased to the Trust. Today, Brandon Marsh is a mixture of flooded gravel pits, fen, scrubland, reedbeds and woodland, much of which is uncommon habitat for the local area. The site is particularly important for birdlife, with a wide range of breeding and wintering birds--237 different species had been recorded up to the end of 2018. The reserve also supports a variety of mammals and insects, over 500 species of plant, and more than 570 species of fungi. The nature reserve and Visitor Centre are open to the public seven days a week. History Although the landscape features of the site are mainly derived from gravel pits and settling pools alongside the River Avon, the area was originally farmland, and the first pools were created by mining subsidence in the 1940s and 1950s caused by workings at Binley Colliery. The site was of interest to local naturalists for its range of bird life, especially as by 1959 the area of open water was far larger than it is now, although much was lost when Severn Trent Water dredged it in 1963. Shortly afterwards the first official attempts at using the site for conservation purposes came when the West Midlands Trust for Nature Conservation, supported by the West Midland Bird Club began moves to secure the site as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Brandon Marsh Conservation Group was formed in 1968, and by 1973 the site had been confirmed as an SSSI. In 1981, the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust (the successor to the West Midlands Trust) came to an agreement with Lafarge whereby the site is leased for a period of 99 years at a peppercorn amount of £1 a year, leading to the creation of the nature reserve. Visitor Centre The first bird hides were constructed in 1984, overlooking the East Marsh and Teal Pools. Quarrying ceased in 1989, and by 1991 the Trust had moved their headquarters to the site and erected a small visitor centre. As improvements to the reserve continued and visitor numbers grew, a requirement for a much improved infrastructure was identified, and in 1998 the new Visitor Centre at Brandon Marsh was opened by Sir David Attenborough. It cost over £600,000 to build and was mainly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, with support from Lafarge through the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme and an appeal to Trust members. The Centre is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas Day, and also houses an Education Centre catering for school visits, a conference centre, and a tearoom and gift shop. Nature reserve The nature reserve itself is a large expanse of wetland and pools. There are a number of paths and trails for visitors to follow, and seven bird hides from which to observe the wildlife. The flora and fauna is extremely varied due to the numerous types of habitat, and includes many species that are otherwise rare in the area. Large numbers of bird species are resident or passage migrants here, including many ducks, geese and waders. The wide range of species is mainly due to Brandon Marsh being one of the few extensive areas of water in the area (accounting for such local rarities as osprey and whooper swan) together with the existence of habitats such as reedbed and woodland in close proximity. 148 different species were recorded during 2009 alone--including one new record, a vagrant woodchat shrike which was the first recorded in Warwickshire--and 66 species bred at the site. These figures have been assisted by a nest box scheme; in 2008 there were 49 occupied nest boxes which produced 270 fledged young, and by 2009 these numbers had increased to 65 and 352 respectively, including two owl species, barn owl and tawny owl. As well as birds, the reserve also harbours a varied selection of mammals. These are mostly of common species, although otters have been recorded and evidence suggests they were present for the whole of 2009. An attempt is being made to establish the endangered water vole to the site, although success has been irregular and there were no sightings at all during 2008 or 2009. The reserve is a haven for dragonfly and damselfly with areas being tailored to their needs--16 species were recorded in 2008, along with 24 species of butterfly and 220 species of moth. Plant life varies throughout the reserve depending on the habitat, and notable species are mentioned in the relevant sections. As the reserve develops, new species are being regularly recorded, including four in 2008 and three in 2009. The large number of fungus species recorded is also due to the diversity of habitat, but even so, species unknown elsewhere in the region have been recorded, such as Taphrina pruni and Otidea bufonia. =Pools= LaFarge aggregate processing centre in the background. The wind pump for irrigation of the reedbeds can also be seen. There are eight main pools in the reserve, some of which are maintained to support specific flora or fauna. At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool, the largest of the pools, which contains two islands. Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here, notably common tern and little ringed plover. There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool, again to induce common tern to breed; eight pairs did so in 2008. Willow Island is much larger and more grassy, providing suitable areas for lapwing, common redshank and green sandpiper. The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes. There are three hides overlooking the pool. An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed, as they did when the gravel quarry was operational; this was successful for the first time in 2009, with eight nestholes occupied and over 40 young fledged. To the south lie Teal Pool and River Pool, created in 1983 when an earth dam was constructed between the two in order that Teal Pool retained water to provide habitat for dabbling duck species, which generally include common teal and mallard. River Pool is a larger expanse of water popular with wading birds, especially redshank and greenshank. Central Marsh and Pool is a diverse area where the main flora is common reed, reed sweetgrass, sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are particularly important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. Alder trees support birds such as redpoll, siskin and various tit species. Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as marsh marigold and meadowsweet, flourish here. Adjacent to the visitor centre are three further pools. Grebe Pool is named for the great crested grebes which regularly breed there, whereas Goose Pool was used by the aggregate company for water storage, and as such the water level is very variable due to its unstable base. Swallow Pool was so named because it was formerly a favourite roosting area for swallows, although this is no longer the case. =Reedbeds= The main reedbed on the site is known as Newlands, an extensive area forming the eastern end of the reserve. Together with other areas in the West Marsh, the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares (61 acres). A wind-powered water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare (22 acre) area near the Visitor Centre. This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1,200 hectare (3,000 acres) of reedbed nationwide. The reedbeds support a number of acrocephalid warblers such as the reed warbler, sedge warbler and marsh warbler as well as others such as grasshopper warbler, and it was the first recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti's warbler. There is a long-term plan to have an endangered species, the Eurasian bittern, breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred, with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009. A new hide overlooking Newlands, named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009, was opened in 2014. =Other habitats= New Hare Covert is woodland, mainly composed of oak, ash, larch and Scots pine. The area is managed for biodiversity purposes and provides habitat for numerous mammals, including muntjac, as well as woodland bird species. Between New Hare Covert and Swallow Pool there is also an area of grassland, which attracts numerous species of butterfly. The area also has a large population of small mammals such as common shrew, field vole and bank vole, which in turn attract birds of prey such as the common kestrel and short-eared owl. Horsetail Glade, as the name suggests, is home to a large area of giant horsetails. There are numerous willow species, and common spotted orchid grows here in the summer. =Threats= Brandon Marsh has a very low risk of pollution and as such the main threat from man has been from vandalism; in 2007, a fire started by youths destroyed a third of the Newlands reedbed. This was the second time the reed bed had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck. Most of the current threats to the biodiversity of the site are natural in origin. A perennial problem is the invasive Japanese knotweed, which shades out local plant species with its dense growth. Removing it is time-consuming as the herbicide used to control it has to be injected straight into the root system, to prevent it reaching other flora. Alder trees are also at risk at the reserve, this time from a fungal disease caused by Phytophthora alni. Being water-borne, this infection could spread to all the alders on the site. Another natural threat is that of the introduced Harlequin ladybird which was first identified at the site in June 2008 and is a severe threat to the native seven-spot ladybird population as it is such an effective aphid predator. Mink are occasional visitors to the reserve, although humane traps are used in an attempt to control them. Mink are a serious threat to ground-nesting birds, and since they are strong swimmers, the nests on the East Marsh islands are vulnerable to them.

Ashkenaz is the first son of Gomer, and a Japhetic patriarch in the Table of Nations. In rabbinic literature, the kingdom of Ashkenaz was first associated with the Scythian region, then later with the Slavic territories, and, from the 11th century onwards, with Germany and northern Europe. His name is related to the Assyrian Aškūza (Aškuzai, Iškuzai), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian highland of the Upper Euphrates area.Russell E. Gmirkin, Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic Histories and the Date of the Pentateuch, T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 2006 pp.148, 149 n.57. Medieval Jews associated the term with the geographical area centered on the Rhineland of Western Germany. As a result, the Jewish culture that developed in that area came to be called Ashkenazi, the only form of the term in use today. Hebrew Bible In the genealogies of the Hebrew Bible, Ashkenaz (Hebrew: , ’Aškănaz; ) was a descendant of Noah. He was the first son of Gomer and brother of Riphath and Togarmah (, ), with Gomer being the grandson of Noah through Japheth. According to , a kingdom of Ashkenaz was to be called together with Ararat and Minni against Babylon, which reads: > Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, > prepare the nations against her [ie. Babylon], call together against her the > kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; > cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars. According to the Encyclopaedia Biblica, \\"Ashkenaz must have been one of the migratory peoples which in the time of Esar-haddon, burst upon the northern provinces of Asia Minor, and upon Armenia. One branch of this great migration appears to have reached Lake Urumiyeh; for in the revolt which Esar-haddon chastised, the Mannai, who lived to the SW of that lake, sought the help of Ispakai 'of the land of Asguza,' a name (originally perhaps Asgunza) which the skepticism of Dillmann need not hinder us from identifying with Ashkenaz, and from considering as that of a horde from the north, of Indo-Germanic origin, which settled on the south of Lake Urumiyeh.\\" Medieval reception =Rabbinic Judaism= In rabbinic literature, the kingdom of Ashkenaz was first associated with the Scythian region, then later with the Slavic territories,Kraus. S, 1932, Hashemot 'ashkenaz usefarad, Tarbiz 3:423-435 and, from the 11th century onwards, with northern Europe and Germany. The region of Ashkenaz was centred on the Rhineland and the Palatinate (notably Worms and Speyer), in what is now the westernmost part of Germany. Its geographic extent did not coincide with the German Christian principalities of the time, and it included northern France. How the name of Ashkenaz came to be associated in the rabbinic literature with the Rhineland is a subject of speculation., Chapter 3, footnote 9. In rabbinic literature from the 11th century, Ashkenaz was considered the ruler of a kingdom in the North and of the Northern and Germanic people. (See below.) =Ashkenazi Jews= Sometime in the post Biblical early medieval period, the Jews of central and south central Europe came to be called by the name Ashkenazim,Paul Kriwaczek, Yiddish Civilisation, Hachette 2011 p. 173 n. 9. in conformity with the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain being identified as Sefarad (), France as Tsarefat (), and Bohemia as Land of Canaan.Michael Miller, Rabbis and Revolution: The Jews of Moravia in the Age of Emancipation Stanford University Press,2010 p. 15. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter,\\"Ashkenaz\\" in Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik (eds.) Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, Gale Virtual Reference Library, 2007. 569–571. Yoma 10a where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose.Michael Brenner, A Short History of the Jews Princeton University Press 2010 p. 96. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe the German language, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France.David Malkiel, Reconstructing Ashkenaz: The Human Face of Franco-German Jewry, 1000–1250, Stanford University Press, 2008, p. ix. Ashkenazi Jewish culture later spread in the 16th Century into Eastern Europe, where their rite replaced that of existing Jewish communities whom some scholars believe to have been larger in demographics than the Ashkenazi Jews themselves,Cecil Roth, \\"The World History of the Jewish People. Vol. XI (11): The Dark Ages. Jews in Christian Europe 711-1096 [Second Series: Medieval Period. Vol. Two: The Dark Ages\\", Rutgers University Press, 1966. Pp. 302-303. and then to all parts of the world with the migrations of Jews who identified as \\"Ashkenazi Jews\\". =Armenian tradition= In Armenian tradition, Ashkenaz, along with Togarmah, was considered among the ancestors of the Armenians. Koriun, the earliest Armenian historian, calls the Armenians an \\"Askanazian (i.e., Ashkenazi) nation\\". He starts the \\"Life of Mashtots\\" with these words: > I had been thinking of the God-given alphabet of the Azkanazian nation and > of the land of Armenia - when, in what time, and through what kind of man > that new divine gift had been bestowed...Koriun, The Life of Mashtots, > Yerevan, 1981. Translated from Old Armenian (Grabar) by Bedros Norehad Later Armenian authors concur with this. Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi (10th century) writes: > ...The sixth son was Tiras from whom were born our very own Ashkenaz > [Ask'anaz] and Togarmah [T'orgom] who named the country that he possessed > Thrace after himself, as well as Chittim [K'itiim] who brought under his > sway the Macedonians. 7. The sons of Tiras were Ashkenaz, from whom > descended the Sarmatians, Riphath, whence the Sauromatians [Soramatk'], and > Togarmah, who according to Jeremiah subjugated the Ashkenazian army and > called it the House of Togarmah; for at first Ashkenaz had named our people > after himself in accord with the law of seniority, as we shall explain in > its proper place.Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi, History of Armenia, Chapter I > 6-7 Because of this tradition, Askanaz is a male given name still used today by Armenians. =German royal genealogy= In 1498, a monk named Annio da Viterbo published fragments known as \\"Pseudo-Berossus\\", now considered a forgery, claiming that Babylonian records had shown that Noah had more sons than the three sons of his listed in the Bible. Specifically, Tuiscon or Tuisto is given as the fourth son of Noah, who had been the first ruler of Scythia and Germany following the dispersion of peoples, with him being succeeded by his son Mannus as the second king. Later historians (e.g. Johannes Aventinus and Johann Hübner) managed to furnish numerous further details, including the assertion by James Anderson in the early 18th century that this Tuiscon was in fact none other than the biblical Ashkenaz, son of Gomer.James Anderson, Royal Genealogies, Or the Genealogical Tables of Emperors, Kings and Princes (1732) p. 441 (Table 213); also p.442 \\"The Most Ancient Kings of the Germans\\". James Anderson's 1732 tome Royal genealogies reports a significant number of antiquarian or mythographic traditions regarding Askenaz as the first king of ancient Germany, for example the following entry: > Askenaz, or Askanes, called by Aventinus Tuisco the Giant, and by others > Tuisto or Tuizo (whom Aventinus makes the 4th son of Noah, and that he was > born after the flood, but without authority) was sent by Noah into Europe, > after the flood 131 years, with 20 Captains, and made a settlement near the > Tanais, on the West coast of the Euxin sea (by some called Asken from him) > and there founded the kingdom of the Germans and the Sarmatians... when > Askenaz himself was 24 years old, for he lived above 200 years, and reigned > 176. In the vocables of Saxony and Hessia, there are some villages of the > name Askenaz, and from him the Jews call the Germans Askenaz, but in the > Saxonic and Italian, they are called Tuiscones, from Tuisco his other name. > In the 25th year of his reign, he partitioned the kingdom into Toparchies, > Tetrarchies, and Governments, and brought colonies from diverse parts to > increase it. He built the city Duisburg, made a body of laws in verse, and > invented letters, which Kadmos later imitated, for the Greek and High Dutch > are alike in many words. The 20 captains or dukes that came with Askenaz > are: Sarmata, from whom Sarmatia; Dacus or Danus – Dania or Denmark; Geta > from whom the Getae; Gotha from whom the Goths; Tibiscus, people on the > river Tibiscus; Mocia - Mysia; Phrygus or Brigus - Phrygia; Thynus - > Bithynia; Dalmata - Dalmatia; Jader – Jadera Colonia; Albanus from whom > Albania; Zavus – the river Save; Pannus – Pannonia; Salon - the town Sale, > Azalus – the Azali; Hister – Istria; Adulas, Dietas, Ibalus – people that of > old dwelt between the rivers Oenus and Rhenus; Epirus, from whom Epirus. > Askenaz had a brother called Scytha (say the Germans) the father of the > Scythians, for which the Germans have of old been called Scythians too (very > justly, for they came mostly from old Scythia) and Germany had several > ancient names; for that part next to the Euxin was called Scythia, and the > country of the Getes, but the parts east of the Vistule or Weyssel were > called Sarmatia Europaea, and westward it was called Gallia, Celtica, > Allemania, Francia and Teutonia; for old Germany comprehended the greater > part of Europe; and those called Gauls were all old Germans; who by ancient > authors were called Celts, Gauls and Galatians, which is confirmed by the > historians Strabo and Aventinus, and by Alstedius in his Chronology, p. 201 > etc. Askenaz, or Tuisco, after his death, was worshipped as the ambassador > and interpreter of the gods, and from thence called the first German > Mercury, from Tuitseben to interpret. In the 19th century, the German theologian August Wilhelm Knobel again equated Ashkenaz with the Germans, deriving the name of the Aesir from Ashkenaz.Die Völkertafel der Genesis, (The Table of Nations from the Book of Genesis) (1850) by August Wilhelm Knobel References * J.

Its PHOENIX Documentation is an Internet-based archive offering detailed information on drugs, their components, indications, and effects. Formation of Holding company PHOENIX International Beteiligungs GmbH. Phoenix Group is majority owner of the pharmaceutical wholesalers Purus A.S. in the Czech Republic and Tamro in Finland. Phoenix Group itself is majority-owned by pharmaceutical conglomerate Merckle Group. History The PHOENIX Pharmahandel Aktiengesellschaft & Co was founded from the German regional wholesalers F. Reichelt AG (Hamburg), Otto Stumpf GmbH (Berlin), Ferd. Schulze GmbH (Mannheim), Otto Stumpf AG (Nuremberg), and Hageda AG (Cologne) in early 1994. The newly established enterprise has achieved a market leading position in its home markets from day one. Only one year later in 1995, the company brand PHOENIX was established and a major strategy roll-out throughout Germany, Hungary, Italy and the Netherlands was initiated: During this process PHOENIX acquired majority shareholdings in the Hungarian pharma wholesaling company Parma Rt., the Northern Italian pharmaceutical wholesaler Comifar S.p.A., 60-per cent shareholding in the second-largest Dutch pharmaceutical wholesaler ACF Holding NV, based in Maarssen near Utrecht. In 1996, the PHOENIX group already achieved a group-wide turnover exceeding EUR 10 billion for the first time in its history. Following this achievement further acquisitions in Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary were completed to strengthen the market position. In addition new branches were established in Poland and France. Several different problems in Poland and Hungary triggered a country-exclusive restructuring process in 1997 and was accompanied with a 100% takeover of the Austrian company Hestag and the renaming of Schulze Pharma France in PHOENIX Pharma during the same year. The entry into the United Kingdom market occurred in 1998 with the establishment of 11 distribution centres, a wholesale network with almost nationwide coverage. PHOENIX GROUP also acquired the regional wholesalers L. Rowland & Co. and Philip Harris Medical to establish a PHOENIX presence in the UK, with the aim of establishing a third significant player in the pharmaceutical distribution industry, alongside AAH/Lloyds and Unichem/Moss. The Rowlands estate comprised approximately 70 pharmacies at this time (November 2011). In 2000, the number of employees across the group exceeds 10,000 for the first time and the company acquired the Finnish Tamro Group in April with a 33.7% stake. In the year 2002, PHOENIX Pharmahandel AG & Co KG merged with Ferd. Schulze GmbH Co., subsequently its number of employees across the group exceeded 15,000 for the first time with a group-wide turnover of more than EUR 15 billion. Two years later, PHOENIX received title to all shares of Tamro Corporation in May 2004 and subsequently acquired a 100% shareholding in Tamro: It was the largest acquisition in the history of PHOENIX successfully to date; Tamro was delisted from the Helsinki Stock Exchange in the same year. In 2006, the group-wide turnover exceeds EUR 20 billion for the first time. In July 2011, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s upgraded PHOENIX’s rating from B+ to BB- with continuing positive outlook. In August, the rating agency Moody’s raised the outlook for PHOENIX from “stable” to “positive”. In October, the rating agency Fitch issued a rating for PHOENIX of “BB” with a “stable” outlook. In May 2013, PHOENIX group has issued a corporate bond with a volume of EUR 300 million (May).

The bridge was originally integral to the Southside Railroad between Petersburg and Lynchburg. As the site of the Battle of High Bridge in April 1865, the bridge played a pivotal role in Lee's retreat in the final days of the American Civil War - and ultimately the war's outcome. Rebuilt after the Civil War to its former dimensions, the 21-span structure was long at a maximum height of above the Appomattox River Valley - though is currently unusable for traffic. By 2005 its then-owner, Norfolk Southern, had abandoned the corridor, subsequently giving 33 miles of the line to the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). High Bridge opened to the public on April 6, 2012, the 147th anniversary of the Battle of High Bridge. The remains of the bridge and its adjacent rail line are now a rail trail park, High Bridge Trail State Park, with a completed trail open to hiking, biking and horse back riding for 16 miles on either side of the former bridge. Design and construction High Bridge in the 1850s In the 1850s, the Southside Railroad built a rail line between Petersburg and Lynchburg, passing through Farmville between Burkeville and Pamplin City. The route, subsidized by a contribution from Farmville, required an expensive crossing of the Appomattox River valley, at a site near property known as Overton farm. The site was surveyed and the bridge engineered by C.O. Sanford, who later reported to the stockholders of the Southside Railroad: \\"there have been higher bridges not so long, and longer bridges not so high, but taking the length and height together, this is, perhaps the largest bridge in the world.\\" The High Bridge's twenty piers contained almost four million bricks, and supported a wooden superstructure with a pedestrian walkway beside the rail line - along with an adjacent wagon bridge (known also as the lower wagon bridge) -- which would ultimately play a pivotal role in the outcome of the Civil War. The bridge itself was completed in 1852 and the full line was completed in 1854. American Civil War The Southside Railroad was heavily damaged during the American Civil War. The High Bridge played a key role during Confederate General Robert E. Lee's final retreat from Petersburg in the last days of the War. The Battle of High Bridge took place there on April 6–7, 1865. Fleeing the Union troops, the Confederates set the bridge afire after crossing it, but failed to destroy it. Union troops were able to use it and continued the chase, which ended several days later at Appomattox Courthouse, where Lee's surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant took place on April 9, 1865. Post-bellum, AM&O;, N&W; After the Civil War, Robert E. Lee directed the Confederate engineers who had attempted to destroy the bridge to rebuilt it. Under the leadership of former Confederate General William \\"Billy\\" Mahone, the bridge was rebuilt, including 21 new Fink deck truss spans on the High Bridge erected in 1869. In 1870, the Southside Railroad was combined with the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to form Mahone's Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&O;), which stretched 400 miles across the southern tier of Virginia from Norfolk on Hampton Roads to Bristol. After the Financial Panic of 1873, the AM&O; fell into default on its debt, and was purchased in the early 1880s by new owners who renamed it the Norfolk and Western (N&W;). N&W; replaced the High Bridge's Fink truss spans in 1886 with minimal interruption of rail traffic, one span at a time, first suspending a new Pratt deck truss from traveling wooden falsework and then removing the old truss. In 1982, N&W; became part of the current Norfolk Southern Railway system. Abandonment by railroad and future use Partially due to the high cost of maintaining the High Bridge over the Appomattox River valley, Norfolk Southern downgraded and eventually abandoned the line through Farmville in favor of the \\"Low-grade Line\\" between Burkeville and Pamplin. The low-grade line, completed in 1916, contained more favorable grades for westbound trains. The Southside Railroad had originally envisioned using the low-grade route until persuaded by the citizens of Farmville, Virginia to bring the line through their town. Following 2006 discussions to turn the High Bridge into a portion of a rail trail or part of a linear state park, the rail land and bridge have since been donated to the State of Virginia and have become the High Bridge Trail State Park. The renovated bridge opened April 6, 2012.

The typical material (Metglas) is an alloy of iron with boron, silicon, and phosphorus in the form of thin (e.g. 25 µm) foils rapidly cooled from melt. These materials have high magnetic susceptibility, very low coercivity and high electrical resistance. The high resistance and thin foils lead to low losses by eddy currents when subjected to alternating magnetic fields. On the downside amorphous alloys have a lower saturation induction and often a higher magnetostriction compared to conventional crystalline iron- silicon electrical steel.K.Inagaki, M. Kuwabara et. Al., Hitachi Review 60(2011) no. 5 pp250, http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2011/icsFiles/afieldfile/2011/09/06/2011_05_113.pdf Core loss and copper loss In a transformer the no load loss is dominated by the core loss. With an amorphous core, this can be 70–80% lower than with traditional crystalline materials. The loss under heavy load is dominated by the resistance of the copper windings and thus called copper loss. Here the lower saturation magnetization of amorphous cores tend to result in a lower efficiency at full load. Using more copper and core material it is possible to compensate for this. So high efficiency AMTs can be more efficient at low and high load, though at a larger size. The more expensive amorphous core material, the more difficult handling and the need for more copper windings make an AMT more expensive than a traditional transformer. Applications The main application of AMTs are the grid distribution transformers rated at about 50–1000 kVA. These transformers typically run 24 hours a day and at a low load factor (average load divided by nominal load). The no load loss of these transformers makes up a significant part of the loss of the whole distribution net. Amorphous iron is also used in specialized electric motors that operate at high frequencies of perhaps 350 Hz or more. Advantages and disadvantages More efficient transformers lead to a reduction of generation requirement and, when using electric power generated from fossil fuels, less CO2 emissions. This technology has been widely adopted by large developing countries such as China“SPC Note on T&D; network loss reduction and energy saving plan” SPC Transportation and Energy Section, Document #123, 1997 (in Chinese). and IndiaB.S.K. Naidu, “Amorphous Metal Transformers—New Technology Developments”, Keynote Speech, CBIP-AlliedSignal Seminar (India), April 1999. where labour cost is low. AMT are in fact more labour-intensive than conventional distribution transformer, a reason that explains a very low adoption in the comparable (by size) European market. These two countries can potentially save 25–30 TWh electricity annually, eliminate 6-8 GW generation investment, and reduce 20–30 million tons of CO2 emission by fully utilizing this technology.Li, Jerry (2011), Review and The Future of Amorphous Metal Transformers in Asia - a brief industry update, AEPN.

Prior to a 2017 restructuring, it was called SNS Bank, which remains its major brand name. It became a subsidiary of SNS Reaal in 1997 when the holding company bought the insurance company Reaal. The bank and its parent were rescued by the Dutch government in 2013 and have been state owned since then. In 2016, SNS Bank was the fourth- largest bank in the Netherlands in terms of total assets. History The history of the bank goes back to 1817 when the first Netherlands savings bank () was established as Nutsspaarbank. The saving bank movement was part of a campaign to encourage individual citizens to save for their future. The savings banks used these funds to provide mortgages to individuals who would otherwise not have the ability to buy their own house, much like the building society movement in the UK. In 1987 a merger with several regional banks, including Gelders-Utrechtse Spaarbank en Spaarbank Limburg, formed SNS Bank. SNS is an abbreviation for Samenwerkende Nederlandse Spaarbanken (English: \\"Co-operating Dutch savings banks\\"). The holding was called Sanes Holding N.V. The second half of the 20th century saw a big consolidation of spaarbanks in the Netherlands. Some joined SBS Bank, while others joined VSB (, ), which later became part of Fortis. In 1990, following several more mergers, SNS Bank N.V. and its holding company SNS Groep N.V. were formed. In 1997, SNS Groep N.V. and insurer REAAL Group N.V. merged into SNS REAAL N.V. The holding company was listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam on May 18, 2006. On December 4, 2006, it was announced that SNS REAAL would purchase RegioBank from ING Bank in a €50M deal. CEO Maurice Oostendorp and Dutch minister of Finance Jeroen Dijsselbloem reveal the new logo at the Utrecht headquarters (September 2016). On February 1, 2013 SNS Bank and its parent SNS REAAL were nationalized by the Dutch government to save it from default.

It is located along the Mississippi River waterfront, stretching from the base of Canal Street, upriver to the New Orleans Morial Convention Center. It is connected to the adjacent Hilton New Orleans Riverside Hotel. History By the start of the 1980s, increased use of containers in shipping made some of the older riverfront wharves less useful, so the Poydras Street Wharf and the Julia Street Wharf were demolished, and the land was used as part of the 1984 World's Fair. After the fair, this section was redeveloped into the \\"Riverwalk,\\" an upscale mall intended to attract both tourists and locals. On the afternoon of Saturday, December 14, 1996, the MV Bright Field freightliner/bulk cargo vessel slammed into the mall. No one was killed in the accident, although approximately 66 were injured; fifteen shops were damaged. Physical damage to the Bright Field was calculated at $1,857,952 (US). Damage to the mall, including the pier, condominium properties, shops, and hotel totaled an estimated $15 million (US). The Bright Field was unable to be removed from the crash site until January 6, 1997, by which time the site had become something of a \\"must-see\\" tourist attraction. The spot where the Bright Field collided with the Riverwalk is marked on site with a plaque. The mall closed for a few months after Hurricane Katrina, due to extensive wind and looting damage. It reopened in early December 2005, in hopes that Christmas shopping would jump-start the area's recovery. Only a small number of shops were able to open at first. Additional businesses slowly opened over the next several years, eventually bringing the mall back to near 100% occupancy. In 2014, the mall closed temporarily and underwent renovations. It reopened in late spring 2014 as The Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, and became the nation's first downtown outlet center, with shops which include a Coach, Inc., outlet and Neiman-Marcus Last Call Studio outlet. But in 2020 Neiman-Marcus last call studio outlet had closed its doors for good due to Neiman-Marcus had to file for bankruptcy.

An important figure in the Merseybeat scene, Wooler was instrumental in introducing The Beatles to their manager, Brian Epstein. In later years, Wooler staged annual Beatles conventions in Liverpool with one-time Beatles manager Allan Williams. Career While he was living in Garston, he became involved in managing a skiffle group called The Kingstrums. He entered them into a talent contest at the Gateacre Labour Club. The competition was won by a group called The Mars Bars, who later became Gerry & The Pacemakers. The Kingstrums disbanded in 1958, but his experience of the music scene convinced Wooler that he was more suited to being a compère for the shows put on at local jive hives. As a compère/disc jockey he worked, part-time, for promoters such as Wally Hill of Peak Promotions. Wooler's encyclopaedic knowledge of the local scene soon made him a sought-after figure by promoters and his advice was regularly heeded. Allan Williams offered him a job at the Top Ten Club, but it burned down shortly after opening. Always of smart attire, Wooler then started full-time employment, in his most notable role, as compère at the Cavern Club. Whilst Williams was sorting out his finances, due to his former club burning down, he recommended that Wooler become The Beatles' manager, an offer that he declined. Wooler himself was subsequently instrumental in introducing the Beatles to their future manager, Brian Epstein. His voice was captured on a live EP by the Big Three at the Cavern, saying \\"We've got the hi-fi high & the lights down low, so here we go, with the Big Three Show!\\" Wooler became one of the major figures on the Mersey Scene and did much to help the various groups, remaining at the Cavern until 1967. Famously, Wooler was physically attacked by John Lennon at Paul McCartney's 21st birthday party in 1963. A drunk Lennon was incensed by an apparent jibe that Wooler made about Lennon's recent holiday to Spain with Epstein. Wooler is given credit for creating and being the first to print the familiar Beatles first-name order of John, Paul, George, and Pete (later Ringo). In later years, Wooler and Allan Williams staged annual Beatles conventions in Liverpool.

He was awarded an academic scholarship to Nottingham High School and an academic scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1986 and was awarded a master's degree in 1990. Hammond is divorced with two sons and one daughter. Rubik's Cube Hammond was introduced to the Rubik's Cube in 1979 by Peter Horrill, head of mathematics at Nottingham High School. The early cubes often broke and Hammond started corresponding with David Singmaster who was importing and selling Rubik's Cubes. Singmaster reported Hammond's speed in solving the Rubik's Cube (28 seconds) in his Rubik's Notes and later in his Cubic Circular. By 1980, Hammond had the fastest times for solving the Rubik's Cube. Reader's Digest, Scientific American This book contains reprints from Hofstadter's Scientific American 1981–1983 articles. (March 1981) and TIME (March 1981) covered Hammond as one of the world's first cube-meisters. Hammond was the fastest qualifier for the first British Rubik's Cube Championship when he won the Midlands heat of the British Rubik's Cube Championship with a time of 35.38 seconds but did not win the event. Hammond used a computer to determine an upper bound of 21 moves for the Rubik's Cube U group. Television appearances On 24 January 1981 Hammond appeared on BBC TV's live Saturday morning show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop with Erno Rubik and solved the Rubik's Cube in 37 seconds. This was the first solving of the Rubik's Cube on national television in England. Two weeks later, five others tried to beat this time, the closest was 57 seconds. Hammond solved the cube on other television shows including The Paul Daniels Magic Show, Midlands Today, ATV Today, as well as appearing on The Adventure Game with Graeme Garden, Carol Chell and Lesley Judd on 2 November 1981. In December 2006, almost 25 years after his first appearance on TV, Hammond appeared on Swap Shop and solved the Rubik's Cube in 36 seconds. Books Hammond wrote the book How To Solve The Cube in 37 Seconds, published by DRG Blackhall in 1981. The book describes the various techniques that Hammond uses to solve the cube. It is based on the bottom, middle, upper layer approach and includes tables to help improve speed. The book also includes a simple, five move, solution to solve the Rubik's Cube.Rubik's cube solution Business Hammond founded NJH Security Consulting, a company specialising in performing Internet security audits for banks, stockbrokers, stock markets in 1996. He also started Intelligent Shopping, a company that created software for purchasing highly secure products over the Internet in the same year.

The building was constructed with federal assistance and opened with an enrollment of 1500 students (500 over the building's specifications). When Richmond County schools were integrated in the 1970s, the enrollment of the school decreased to about 500 students. Court-ordered busing was instituted to ensure racial balances in student population and to remedy fluctuating enrollment patterns. In 1980 it became a magnet school, housing grades K-5. Like in other magnet schools in the county, racial quotas maintained a racially balanced student body (45% African American, 45% Caucasian, 10% other). The concept brought changes in structural organization. During its first year as a magnet school, C.T.

Since draught animals such as oxen were not heavily used, water transport was usually the only alternative to going on foot until the 19th Century. The history and current importance of Zambian waterways, as well as the types of indigenous boats used, provide information on this important aspect of Zambian economy.  Indigenous boats and traditional use of waterways  = Dugout canoes = The techniques of making temporary boats or rafts by weaving together bundles of buoyant reeds were known to African people living near the many rivers, lakes, lagoons and swamps of what is now Zambia.Yuyi K Libakeni: “The Nalikwanda”, on The Lowdown website accessed 24 February 2007. The coming of the Iron Age introduced tools such as the adze which facilitates the construction of dugout canoes, especially from African teak (Pterocarpus angolensis or 'mulombwa' in Chibemba, 'mulombe' in Chilozi, 'mukwa' in Chishona) which has a long life even when constantly immersed. The dugout then took over as the principal means of fishing and travel by boat, whether paddled in deeper water, or punted in shallow water like makoros in neighbouring Botswana. When explorer David Livingstone, the first European to see Lake Bangweulu arrived on the western shore of that lake in 1868, he was conveyed across it efficiently in a dugout canoe 45 feet long and 4 feet wide (about 14 m by 1.2 m), paddled by six men. The people of the lake and its wetlands, which cover a completely flat area of more than 10,000 km² in flood, have the ability to navigate unaided across open water or through mazes of swamp channels despite having no landmarks to guide them most of the time.David Livingstone and Horace Waller (ed.): The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death. Two volumes, John Murray, 1874. There is an account of the Shila people in the Luapula swamps in the 19th Century hunting hippos with great skill by throwing harpoons at them from dugout canoes, despite being in great danger from these huge aggressive animals’ ability to overturn a canoe and virtually bite its paddlers in half, and they are responsible for many human deaths in Zambia.(On www.nrzam.org.uk website accessed 24 February 2007) William Lammond: “The Luapula Valley”, in The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2 No 5 pp 50−55(1954) Several dugout canoes may be lashed together and a timber platform built over them to carry heavy loads, and many early pontoon ferries were made in this way, such as the first ferry over the Luangwa River in 1929, which could carry a 1.5 ton truck. Paddled by a dozen men, the crossing used to take four to six hours, not because of the great width of the river but the need to go a long way upstream before the crossing, when the current would sweep the pontoon several kilometres downstream.(On www.nrzam.org.uk website accessed 24 February 2007) H. C. N. Ridley: “Early History of Road Transport in Northern Rhodesia”, The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2 No 5 (1954) There are both permanent and seasonal fishing communities to which the only access is by boat or canoe, such as in Bangweulu and Mweru Wantipa in particular, but also along many rivers and lake shores. To such communities canoes and boats are a way of life. A colonial administrator in the 1920s saw a dugout canoe crossing Lake Tanganyika (35 km wide) which is large enough to have waves of around 1 m. Though such a feat was commonplace, he was astonished to discover that the three paddlers were all blind, and the boat was being steered by a small child to the store at Mpulungu so they could buy supplies.(On www.nrzam.org.uk website accessed 24 February 2007) — (No author): “Strange Encounter”, in The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2 No 5 p55 (1954) = Lozi timber plank boats = Before the coming of the Europeans from 1860 onwards, the Lozi people of Barotseland were building Nalikwanda royal barges made from teak planks fixed with iron nails (extensive Rhodesian Teak forests grew in the east of Barotseland). As seen in the Kuomboka ceremony these reached huge sizes, requiring a hundred paddlers or more. Although there has been speculation that the Lozi learnt this method of boat building from Arab or Portuguese traders, the Lozi did not allow such traders to enter their territory, and the traders certainly did not haul boats overland to central Africa with them. There is no evidence to suppose that the Lozi plank boat is anything other than an indigenous technology.  Water transport in the colonial era  For about three decades after the start of the colonial era as North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia, there was no road transport in the territory, except by ox-wagon. Even when the first railway reached the Copperbelt in 1910, there was no mechanised road transport from that single line into the surrounding areas or the rest of the country. Water transport was used by colonial officials, businesses, and the few settlers, and some Africans made their living hiring out their canoes and labour to them. The main waterways used in this way were: = Lake transport = # Lake Tanganyika: the port of Mpulungu was one of the main entry points to the north of the territory until World War I, and even after remained a significant route with services by the MV Liemba connecting to the Kigoma-Dar es Salaam railway. # Lake Bangweulu and Bangweulu swamps: from Samfya and Nsombo to all parts of the system. # Lake Mweru: Nchelenge-Kashikishi to Kilwa Island, Chiengi and Pweto. = River and swamp channel transport = # Zambezi River: Katombora Rapids to Sesheke and Katima Mulilo, just above which is a series of rapids over a distance of 20 km, and then the Ngonye Falls 75 km further on at Sioma. Depending on the water level, boats could be paddled or pulled through or carried around the rapids, and at Sioma, Chief Yeta had a team of 40 oxen available to pull barges 5 km over land around the Ngonye Falls.(On www.nrzam.org.uk website accessed 26 February) E.

The Belgian Congo government also operated a sternwheeler paddle steamer, the Charles Lemaire, on the Luapula and Lake Mweru.The Northern Rhodesia Journal online, Vol 2 No 3 (1954) pp 86-7.

During the later stages of World War I, a fleet of 900 boats (mainly dugout canoes) ferried supplies over this route for British forces near Abercorn. ::* Kapalala to Lake Bangweulu and Samfya/Nsombo. ::* Chambeshi to Nsombo. = Other waterways, local use = * The Kafue River, though navigable between the town of Kafue and the Copperbelt was not used for that route because its meandering course which takes it far to the west makes the route three times longer than the straight-line distance, and it does not pass close to any areas with much population. * Similarly the Luangwa River does not constitute a major waterway since it does not pass through any well-populated areas, and becomes very shallow in the dry season. * Dongwe River and Kabompo River in the west * Lungwebungu River in the west * Luena-Luongo in the north * Upper Kalungwishi River the north * Lake Mweru Wantipa in the north * Lukanga Swamp in the centre  Boat operations in the present day  There is a need to develop inland waterways in Zambia but it is hampered by a lack of management know-how in the sector and a lack of port facilities.Engineering and Consulting Firms Association of Japan website: “Report on Zambia: Sectorial Development Strategies”, p 4-A-8 (2003). Accessed 24 February 2007. Development of the road network has reduced the demand for commercial boat services where road services compete. No major urban centres have developed on any waterways and so boat transport is not used for any urban or inter-urban travel. The only centres which can be considered to have commercial boat services are, in rough order of size: = Commercial operators = * Mpulungu, Lake Tanganyika, serving the Zambian shore and islands up to Nsumbu and Ndole Bay, with international services to Tanzania, DR Congo and Burundi. * Samfya, Lake Bangweulu * Nchelenge-Kashikishi, Lake Mweru (with international connections to DR Congo at Kilwa and Kasenga). * Mongu, Zambezi River, especially to Kalabo. = Tourism operators = Boat operators serving the tourist trade are found in:Zambia National tourist Board website accessed 24 February 2007 * Mpulungu on Lake Tanganyika * Nsumbu National Park at Kasaba Bay on Lake Tanganyika * South Luangwa National Park on the Luangwa River * Kafue National Park on the Kafue River and the lake formed by the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam * Mongu on the Zambezi * Livingstone on the Zambezi * Siavonga and Sinazongwe on Lake Kariba * Lower Zambezi National Park on the Zambezi In addition to these there are a number of tour companies and camps set up for fishing and adventure tours, especially on the upper Zambezi, mostly catering for international tourists at high prices. = Boat use for non-commercial and subsistence use = Use of dugout canoes has declined somewhat except in more remote locations, due to a relative shortage of good African Teak trees, and competition from timber plank, aluminium and glass-fibre boats. The use of outboard motors remains relatively low due to the high cost of fuel and lack of maintenance services.

Its proximity to Clingmans Dome and its location along the Appalachian Trail make it a popular hiking destination. Silers Bald is located on the crest of the Smokies with Thunderhead Mountain to the west and Clingmans Dome to the east. The Tennessee-North Carolina state line crosses the summit, with the mountain split evenly between Sevier County, Tennessee to the north and Swain County, North Carolina to the south. Silers Bald rises appx. above its northern base near Fish Camp Prong (of Little River), and appx. above its southern base near Forney Creek. While Silers Bald was a grassy bald for most of the 19th and early-20th centuries, it was probably a wooded peak before the arrival of European settlers. For this reason, the park service does not maintain the bald atop the mountain (the Great Smoky Mountains National Park currently maintains only two grassy balds-- Gregory Bald and Andrews Bald).Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 178. A narrow corridor for the Appalachian Trail, which crosses the summit, is kept clear for thru-hikers. There is still a small bald area at the summit, approximately in diameter, where the Appalachian Trail makes a 90-degree turn. Several grassy meadows remain on the mountain's western slope.  Geology  Silers Bald consists of Thunderhead sandstone, a small pile of which crowns the summit. This sandstone, part of the Ocoee Supergroup, was formed from ocean sediments nearly a billion years ago. The mountain, like most of the Smokies, was formed some 200 million years ago when the North American and African plates collided during the Appalachian orogeny, pushing the rock upward.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 26-27.  History  Clingman's Dome, looking east from the summit of Silers Bald While Silers Bald is hardly mentioned in Cherokee lore, a petroglyph was discovered near the summit in 1917.Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927), 44. The mountain's elevation is probably recorded by Arnold Guyot during his 1859 survey of the Smokies crest, but under a different name (possibly Guyot's \\"Big Stone Mountain,\\" which Guyot listed with an elevation of and lying somewhere between Mt. Buckley and Thunderhead).Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927), 55-56. right210pxthumbWhat was once a massive grazing land has reverted to patches of meadow and young woodland on the western slope of Silers Bald Silers Bald is named after Jesse Siler, a prominent North Carolinian who grazed sheep and cattle atop the mountain in the 19th century. Likewise, Siler Bald, in the Nantahala Mountains to the south, was named after Jesse's brother, William. Albert Mountain, also to the south, was named after Jesse's nephew, Albert Siler.Larry Luxenberg, Walking the Appalachian Trail (Mechanicsburg, Penn: Stackpole Books, 1994), 25. By the late 19th century, Silers Bald was the far eastern end of a giant grassy pasture that stretched several miles across the Smokies' western ridge all the way to Russell Field, which overlooks Cades Cove.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 21.

Access  The summit of Silers Bald. The white arrows mark the direction of the Appalachian Trail The easiest access to Silers Bald is to take the Clingmans Dome tower trail from the Forney Ridge Parking Lot to the tower. From there, following the Appalachian Trail west for just over four miles (6 km) brings one to the summit of Silers Bald. This leg of the trail is riddled with elevation gain and loss, crossing Mt. Buckley (a knob of Clingmans Dome), Jenkins Knob, and a sparsely-wooded ridge known as \\"The Narrows\\". At the summit of Silers Bald, an unmarked spur trail winds several yards to a cliff on the northwest slope of the mountain.

It is set in the fictional nation of Latveria, and involves the characters Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine, Falcon and Ms. Marvel from the Avengers, and Prowl, Ratchet, Jazz, Bumblebee and Optimus Prime from the Autobots. It was written by Stuart Moore, penciled by Tyler Kirkham and premiered on July 5, 2007. The tag line for the series is \\"Assemble and Roll Out!\\"New York Comic Con: New Avengers/Transformers According to information currently available, the storyline takes place between the first story arc The Transformers: Infiltration and the second arc The Transformers: Escalation for the IDW Transformers series, and between the Breakout and Sentry arcs for New Avengers. Writer Stuart Moore has indicated that it takes place in the regular Marvel continuity between the first two-story arcs of New Avengers,Moore Talks New Avengers/Transformers and it is currently held as semi-continuity for IDW, which entails that, although it will not have any effect on the overall storyline of Transformers, it will not contradict it either. This is Spider- Man's second appearance alongside the Transformers, as he appeared in the third issue of the original Marvel Transformers comic in 1984. However, this will not have any bearing, as the bio for Death's Head in the third issue of the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A–Z (released on March 22, 2006) indicated that all previous encounters with the Transformers took place in an alternate universe, thus separating these stories from existence in standard Marvel Universe continuity. Plot A war is looming between the neighboring Eastern European states of Latveria and Symkaria. Called in by S.H.I.E.L.D., Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine and Luke Cage investigate. Discovering a non-human structure and an army of destroyed Doombots, they attempt to force their way inside, only to be met with deadly attacks. Spider-Man is captured as the others force their way out, with the team beginning to fight among themselves. An observing Optimus Prime decides to take the Autobots to counter the threat, as Megatron reveals to a captured Spider-Man that one of Doom's devices is responsible for the tensions, and they prepare to experiment on his mutated DNA. Falcon and Ms. Marvel arrive, followed by the Autobots. Prime's order for them to leave is met by a full attack by the Avengers. As the fight continues, with Ms. Marvel and Wolverine in particular appearing highly vicious against their opponents, Doctor Doom intervenes and places a device on Captain America's neck that instantly calms him down. After he manages to talk down Ms. Marvel and Wolverine, the rest of the team talk to the Autobots, and Doom reveals that the Avengers' heightened aggression was caused by a device he developed which was stolen by the Decepticons. Doom departs to attempt to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict with Symkaria, leaving the Autobots and the Avengers to storm the Decepticon base to rescue Spider-Man. However, Megatron has already determined that the mutated elements of Spider-Man's blood will enable him to enhance his forces' power to a level that not even Energon has accomplished, the enhanced firepower knocking out Optimus Prime just as Iron Man arrives on the scene. Iron Man, in new, Transformer-sized armor, helped to turn the tide against the Decepticons, allowing Prowl, Ratchet, Luke Cage and Wolverine to get inside the ship and rescue Spider-Man. As Iron Man and Megatron face off outside the base, the Autobots track down Spider-Man, subsequently freeing him with the aid of Doctor Doom (who has turned on the Decepticons after they betrayed him). Realizing that the Decepticons are too powerful to take on as they are, the Autobots ask for Spider-Man and Wolverine's permission to use the same energy-enhancement method that the Decepticons used, taking blood samples from the two and using it to enhance their own abilities, and the two heroes agree to the procedure. While Spider-Man joins the Autobots outside the ship, Wolverine and Doctor Doom track down the device that initially amplified the Avengers' aggression and Wolverine destroys it, leaving Doom to make his own way out as he rejoins his teammates. Although Iron Man's Transformer armor is destroyed after it suffers an overload while fighting Megatron, the Autobots are still able to turn the tide, thanks to their power boost Spider-Man and Luke Cage knocking down Megatron and forcing him to flee. With the other Decepticons and the Autobots subsequently departing themselves, the Avengers are left to report to the government about the situation. Meanwhile, the Autobots reports that Ramjet has gone to earth and it is implied that he has taken the form of the Avengers Quinjet.

The single-shot Deer gun was intended for distribution to South Vietnamese guerrillas as a weapon against North Vietnamese soldiers. Design The Deer gun was made of cast aluminium, with the receiver formed into a cylinder at the top of the weapon. The striker protruded from the rear of the receiver and was cocked in order to fire, and a plastic clip was placed there to prevent an accidental discharge, as the Deer gun had no mechanical safety. The grip had raised checkering, was hollow, and had space for three 9 mm rounds and a rod for clearing the barrel of spent cases. The Deer gun lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user, in order to prevent tracing of the weapons, and all were delivered in unmarked polystyrene boxes with three 9 mm rounds and a series of pictures depicting the operation of the gun. A groove ran down a ramp on top for sighting. The barrel unscrewed for loading and removing the empty casing. A cocking knob was pulled until cocked. The aluminium trigger had no trigger guard. Operation Instruction leaflet The Deer gun was loaded by removing the barrel and placing a 9 mm cartridge in the chamber. The striker was then cocked, and a small plastic clip placed around the striker to impede the forward motion of the striker to prevent accidental discharge. The barrel was then screwed back onto the receiver. The gun was fired by removing the plastic clip, placing it on the barrel where it would become the sight, and pulling the trigger. At this point the user would take the victim's equipment if opportunity presented itself, and then flee. Later, the user would reload the gun by unscrewing the barrel and ejecting the spent case with the provided barrel rod, and follow the outlined procedure. History One production run of 1,000 Deer guns was made in 1964 as an initial run, with the final cost projected as US$3.95 per gun (). Rather than the Vietnam war being a small clandestine war, it became a full-scale war where the Deer gun would not be as useful as foreseen. Some Deer guns were evaluated in Vietnam, but the fate of the rest is unknown. Most sources state that all were destroyed.

Annius was made caesar on 12 October 166 AD, alongside his brother Commodus, designating them co-heirs of the Roman Empire. Annius died on 10 September 169, at age seven, due to complications from a surgery to remove a tumor from under his ear. His death left Commodus as the sole heir. Life Bust of Marcus Aurelius, Annius' father Marcus Annius Verus was born in late 162 or 163 AD, the son of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. He was given the name of Marcus Annius Verus because it was the original name of his father, Marcus Aurelius. On 12 October 166 AD, during a triumph celebrating the victory of the Romans in the Parthian War of Lucius Verus, Annius and his elder brother Commodus were both made caesars, designating them as co-heirs to the Roman Empire. At the time, Annius was three, and Commodus was five. This was the first time such an explicit declaration of heirship had been made at such a young age, and showed a marked shift from the traditional cursus honorum, in which a presumed heir would be gradually raised through offices of increasing importance, in order to learn the skills of all positions, to a new system of imperial succession, wherein dynastic hereditary descent was the path to the throne, with heirs being instructed in how to be an emperor. Annius died on 10 September 169 AD, at seven years of age, due to complications in removing a tumor from under his ear. This left Commodus as the sole heir. His father, Marcus Aurelius, mourned his death for just five days, while still continuing public work. Aurelius argued that because the games of Jupiter Optimus Maximus were ongoing, he should not interrupt them with his mourning. His lack of mourning was likely influenced by his Stoic philosophy, which taught of the dangers of emotion, and the brutal culture of the Romans, which considered hysterical grief at the loss of loved ones as unmanly and unnatural. Aurelius ordered statues to be made in his honor, and a golden image of him to be carried during the procession of the games. Aurelius also had his name inserted into the Carmen Saliare, the ritual songs sung by the Salii, a group of 12 priests. Family Annius Verus was the son of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. Annius was the younger brother of, in order of birth: Domitia Faustina, Titus Aurelius Antoninus, Titus Aelius Aurelius, Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, Titus Aelius Antoninus, an unnamed son, Annia Aurelia Fadilla, Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus (Commodus).

It was the only railcar operated by NZR not designated as a member of the NZR RM class; while a railcar, it retained the designation of A 88. This designation was wholly unrelated to the steam locomotive A class of 1873 or A class of 1906.  History  In the 1910s, NZR began experimenting with railcar technology to cater for passengers on routes that could not economically support locomotive-hauled dedicated passenger trains and thus had to settle for undesirably slow mixed trains (freight trains with passenger carriages attached). World War I and its subsequent economic impacts brought research to a halt after three unsuccessful experiments. In 1924, work resumed at Christchurch's Addington Workshops after a local engineer, E. B. Buckhurst, was given approval to convert a regular passenger carriage into a railcar. A 88 was the carriage chosen for the task; it had been imported from the United States in 1878 and prior to its renovation, it provided seated accommodation for second class passengers.David Jones, Where Railcars Roamed (Wellington: Wellington Tramway Museum, 1999), 7.  Technical details  A 88 was fitted with a unique gearbox designed by Buckhurst. Power was provided by a Hudson six cylinder petrol engine typically used by cars that was slung laterally beneath the long, carriage. Compartments for the driver were installed at each end of the carriage, giving it a passing resemblance to trams of the era. A total of 48 passengers could be carried by an A 88 in its railcar guise.  Trials  The first test run of the railcar was to Sandy Knolls, from Addington, and subsequent trials meant the railcar covered a distance of more than . The railcar successfully operated at a speed of , with its top attained speed approximately , but problems and faults became manifest over the trial period. The most notable problem was that the engine tended to overheat, and this combined with other flaws meant that the project became uneconomic and was abandoned before A 88 entered regular passenger service. The railcar parts were removed and sold and A 88 was returned to regular locomotive-hauled service in passenger trains after being re-converted into an un-motorised carriage.

History On June 16, 1959, WETC first signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-62 page B-123 It was a 250 watt daytimer. Because AM 540 is a clear-channel frequency reserved for Canada and Mexico, WETC had to sign-off every evening at sunset to avoid interfering with skywave signals of other radio stations. It was later allowed to broadcast at night, but only with reduced power. WETC's call letters originally were said to stand for \\"We Entertain Tobacco Country.\\" It was a long-time country music station. In 1992 it became the first radio station to target the Research Triangle's Spanish-speaking community. It went completely Spanish by the late 1990s. WETC was owned by East Wake Broadcasting and later Carolina Regional Broadcasting before being sold to Prieto Communications in 2004. Prieto Communications sold WETC to Marta Sanchez's Sanchez Broadcasting Corporation for consideration of the forgiveness of $1.45 million in debt; the transaction was consummated on January 4, 2013. WETC's programming was once simulcast on AM 1490 WDUR in Durham, North Carolina.http://www.radio- info.com/site/markets/grid/raleigh-durham, Retrieved on 2010-03-18. That station now airs a South Asian format. On March 25, 2016, WETC was granted a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to increase its daytime power to 10,000 watts. On October 1, 2018, Divine Mercy Radio filed a Remain Silent Authority application with the FCC, citing major technical issues. At the time the station was expected to remain off the air for 120 days while technicians made repairs. WETC resumed regular operations at 3:55 p.m. EST on February 4, 2019.\\"540AM Status Update: We Are On the Air!\\" (posting made on February 4, 2019 at WDMR.org) References External links ETC Catholic radio stations ETC Radio stations established in 1959 1959 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"WETC"},{"id":"9724204","text":"Torill Kove (born 25 May 1958) is a Norwegian-born Canadian film director and animator.

She moved to Montreal to continue her academic studies in urban planning at Concordia University earning a master's degree (MUP '89) at McGill University later changing her major to animation. Characteristic illustration by Torill Kove; from Norwegian children's book Johannes Jensen føler seg annerledes (Johannes Jensen feeling strange) from 2003 Kove has previously stated that she in fact did not watch much animation until she was in her thirties. Unemployed in the fall of 1991, rather than look for work she spent time at the NFB's former public access facility on St. Denis Street, where every day she would watch films. \\"Two things happened as I was sifting through the NFB animation collection: one was excitement at having discovered such a wonderful treasure of films, and the other was a voice in me that said loud and clear 'I want to do this.'\\" Her first Academy Award nomination was for My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts in 2000, inspired by the story of her own grandmother who had ironed the shirts of Norway's King Haakon VII for many years. In 2013 she directed the Danish-Norwegian-Swedish animated feature Hocus Pocus Alfie Atkins, based on the Alfie Atkins books by Swedish children's book author Gunilla Bergström.

In 1985 the station was acquired by the Twin Star Broadcasting Company, which changed the call sign to WMYT and implemented a rock music format. However, the station faced severe financial difficulties, and Twin Star was dissolved in bankruptcy, which caused the station to go off the air for ten months. WMYT resumed broadcasting in July 1986 with a Christian-gospel format, after being reacquired by Benchmark Communications,\\"Mebane airwaves get radio\\" by Jim Wicker, Burlington Times- News, July 23, 1986, page D1. and the call sign was changed to WGLH. Three months later WGLH was acquired by Jim McManus,\\"Radio changes ownership\\" by Jim Wicker, Burlington Times-News, October 20, 1986, page 16A. however within a few months the station once again fell silent, this time for an extended period. Rev. James Lee Christopher, pastor of the People's Pilgrim Holiness Church, formed the Great Speckled Bird Broadcasting Co., Inc. (named after a traditional gospel tune) in order to revive the facility. The call letters were changed to WGSB, and the station returned to the air on July 8, 1990 with a non-commercial gospel format, operating from a wing in the church's education building. In 1995 the station adopted a contemporary Christian format, joining WRTP, AM 1530 in Chapel Hill, and WRTG, AM 1000 in Garner. Between these three stations the full Triangle region was covered, but only during daylight hours, as all three were licensed only for daytime operation. In 1996 the station was acquired for a third time by Roger Jennings and Benchmark Communications, for $4,000 in cash and a 10-year 10% promissory note for $125,000.\\"Transactions: North Carolina\\", Radio & Records, February 2, 1996, page 10.

Biography Vera Stepen was born on Chicago's west side to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. As a teenager, she was more interested in playing the cello than in mathematics, but she left high school two years early to go to the University of Chicago, and finished her studies there in three years. Inspired by Irving Kaplansky to study abstract algebra,. she stayed at the university for a master's degree, which she earned in 1952 not long after marrying her husband, a high-energy experimental physicist. She began working in physics at the University of Chicago, but soon won a fellowship to study at Northwestern University. Her husband became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Pless moved with him to Massachusetts, where she completed her doctorate from Northwestern in 1957 under the supervision of Kaplansky's student Alex F. T. W. Rosenberg, soon before the birth of her first child. Two years later, bored with being a stay-at-home mother, Pless began teaching courses at Boston University, and a few years later began searching for a full-time job. Unable to obtain an academic position, she took a position at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory in Massachusetts. where she began working on error- correcting codes. During this time she helped to found an organization called Women in Science and Engineering, and at one point was president. She stayed at AFCRL from 1963 until 1972; a regular visitor and inspiration during this time was Harvard mathematician and cryptographer Andrew Gleason.. When the Mansfield amendment banned the military from performing basic research, she moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked as a research associate for Project MAC. She returned to Chicago in 1975 as a full professor of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her husband and youngest son had remained in the Boston area, and five years after the move, she and her husband divorced.

Published by Electronic Arts in 1983, it was one of the five initial releases from the company. Worms? is an interactive version of Paterson's Worms. Maynard later worked on the 8-bit word processor from Electronic Arts, Cut & Paste. Gameplay The game is abstract, like Conway's Game of Life, but the player's ostensible goal is to optimally program one or more worms (each a sort of cellular automaton) to grow and survive as long as possible. The game area is divided up into hexagonal cells, and the worms are essentially programmed to move in a particular direction for each combination of filled-in and empty frame segments in their immediate vicinity. Over the course of a game, the player needs to give the worm less and less input, and more and more moves by the worm results in the encountering of a familiar situation for which the worm has already been trained. As the worms move, they generate aleatoric music. Reception Allen Doum reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Worms? can be played competitively, either by teams or individuals or can be used solitaire as a pattern drawing puzzle. Its sound and graphics are excellent, and some of the graphics elements and the speed of the game can be varied.\\" Orson Scott Card in Compute! gave complimentary reviews to the EA games Worms?, M.U.L.E., and Archon: The Light and the Dark. He said of the trio that \\"they are original; they do what they set out to do very, very well; they allow the player to take part in the creativity; they do things that only computers can do\\". Leo Laporte wrote in Hi-Res said that Worms? was \\"Very nice, very pretty, very boring ... I've been playing with this program for two weeks. It hasn't gotten any more interesting\\". Compute!'s Gazettes reviewer called Worms? for the Commodore 64 \\"one of the most fascinating games I've played in a long time. It's so different from anything else that it quickly captivated me. Worms? tournaments become popular among the staff of Compute! ... [It] is as much fun to watch as it is to play\\". He added that part of its appeal was that \\"The game is hard to master. It's easy to play, but seems almost impossible to play well time after time\\". Compute! listed the game in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", writing that four years after its introduction \\"Worms? is still in a class by itself\\", requiring \\"a sense of strategy as well as proficiency at joystick maneuvers\\".

These sensors provide vertical intensity profiles of airglow emissions in the extreme ultraviolet and far ultraviolet spectral range of 800 to 1700 Angstrom (80 to 170 nanometre) and scan from 75 km to 750 km tangent altitude. The data from these sensors will be used to infer altitude profiles of ion, electron and neutral density. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) developed five ultraviolet remote sensing instruments for the Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). These instruments known as SSULI (Special Sensor Ultraviolet Limb Imager) launched aboard the DMSP block of 5D3 satellites, which started in 2003. SSULI measures vertical profiles of the natural airglow radiation from atoms, molecules and ions in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere by viewing the Earth's limb at a tangent altitude of approximately 50 km to 750 km.This article contains public domain material from the United States Navy. See the below citation for the source: * Overview The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) built five of these ultraviolet spectrographs for the United States Air Force (USAF) Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) block of 5D3 satellites. Launch The first sensor was launched on the DMSP F16 spacecraft in October 2003 into a sun-synchronous 830 km circular orbit at a local time of 0800-2000 UT. Three of the remaining four SSULIs were launched on the following DMSP Block 5D3 satellitesDefense Meteorological Satellite Program#Block 5D: :DMSP F17 - November 4, 2006 :DMSP F18 - October 18, 2009 :DMSP F19 - April 3, 2014 The last SSULI is at NRL awaiting a new \\"ride\\" due to the cancellation and preservation of the last DMSP satellite. Mission details Measurements are made from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to the far ultraviolet (FUV) over the wavelength range of 80 nanometers to 170 nanometers, with 1.8 nanometer resolution. The satellites will be launched in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of approximately 830 km. The Low Resolution Airglow and Auroral Spectrograph (LORAAS), a SSULI prototype, was launched on board the Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS_(satellite)) on February 23, 1999. LORAAS data was used to validate SSULI algorithms that convert raw measurements (Figure 2) into useful environmental parameters that characterize the upper atmosphere. Software An extensive operational data processing system has been developed to generate environmental data from SSULI spectral data. Spectral data from the LORAAS instrument is also part of this platform. This system, known as the Ground Data Analysis Software (GDAS), includes operational data reduction software using advanced science algorithms also developed at NRL, a customized graphical user interface (GUI), and comprehensive validation techniques. Programs are designed to generate a SSULI Prep file from multiple data sources including Raw Sensor Data Records (RSDR) at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), HIRAAS real-time data assembled at US Space Command, and an extensive HIRAAS infobase on site at the Naval Research Laboratory. Technical information The sensor has a field-of-view of 2.4°x0.15° and sweeps out a 2.4°x17° field-of-regard during each 90 second scan, with wavelength coverage between 800Å and 1700Å at 23Å resolution. The field of view scans ahead of the spacecraft in the orbital plane through a 17° field of regard, corresponding to approximately 75–750 km altitude.

He was also founder of Hellmuth Ladies' College and Hellmuth Boys' College, both now defunct, formerly of London, Ontario. Biography Isaac was born in Poland in 1819 into a Jewish family and educated at the University of Breslau. His father was a rabbi and he trained to be a rabbi himself. However, intellectual discourse with theologians of other faiths made him question his faith and his father disowned him. He was forced to take his mother’s maiden name. He moved to England in 1842 and made his decision to convert to Christianity, specifically Anglicanism, and later confirmed to the Church of England in Canada. By 1844 he entered the ministry and was sent to the Anglican Diocese of Toronto. He studied for his ordination and, because of his prior education, soon had an appointment to Bishop's University (Bishop's College) in Lennoxville where he was ordained and became a professor of Hebrew and rabbinical literature. In 1854 he returned to England and became organizing secretary in London for the Colonial Church and School Society but was asked by the Society to move back to Canada in 1856 as a Superintendent. He resigned in 1861 and was collated Archdeacon of Huron by Bishop Benjamin Cronyn. He acted in a fund-raising capacity to establish Huron College, a training establishment for clergy and the founding college of the University of Western Ontario. He was the first principal of the college until 1866, when he was appointed Dean of Huron. In 1871 he was elevated to coadjutor Bishop of Huron, becoming bishop on Cronyn's death later that year. Hellmuth founded the Western University of London, Ontario in 1878, which was later renamed University of Western Ontario. He returned to England in 1883, to become Assistant Bishop of Ripon, but served only briefly; he died in Weston-super-Mare, England in 1901. He had married twice: firstly Catherine Maria Evans, daughter of Thomas Evans, with whom he had three children and secondly Mary Louisa Glyn, née Duncombe. His son, I. F. Hellmuth (1845–1944), was the first champion of what became the Canadian National Tennis Championship, now known as the Canadian Open (tennis) or the Rogers Cup (tennis). Isadore Hellmuth also founded the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club and won the inaugural United States national tennis championship tournament played in 1881 at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club.

Over the history the company has made an impact on the piano industry with new inventions and innovative designs. Schimmel instruments are produced in the Schimmel workshop in Braunschweig, Germany. With more than 40 awards, Schimmel Pianos are the most highly awarded Pianos from German production.  History  =1st Generation: Foundation and growth= The history of Schimmel Pianos began on the 2nd of May 1885 as Wilhelm Schimmel founded his own workshop in Leipzig, Germany. His slogan “Quality prevails”, proved to be right as his business succeeded and his instruments grew popular for their advanced technique, excellent sound and contemporary design. In May 1894, Wilhelm Schimmel produced his 1000th instrument. The company had moved to bigger workshops due to the increasing production. In 1897, Wilhelm Schimmel built his own state- of-the-art factory in Leipzig-Stötteritz on 4000 m2 large grounds. Due to the outstanding playability, the highly developed mechanics and the tonal quality the brand Schimmel soon belonged to the circle of renown pianoforte factories in Leipzig, which used to be, besides Berlin the centre of piano manufacturers in Germany. Schimmel Pianos soon developed an international reputation as their instruments were exported to Russia, Italy, France, the U.S., Switzerland, and many other countries. Schimmel received the title of purveyor of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and the purveyor of the King of Romania. At the World Exhibition in 1913 and 1914, the instruments received first gold medals. Wilhem Schimmel, company founder Self-Playing Piano Ducanola by Schimmel An outstanding technical innovation was the development of a self-playing piano, called Ducanola in around 1915. = 2nd Generation: 1927 to 1961 = At the age of 73, Wilhelm Schimmel passed the company's management to his son, Wilhelm Arno Schimmel. Due to the economic situation the new manager was faced with difficulties concerning the production as well as the sales of pianos. The Hyperinflation in 1923 was followed by the great depression with the Great Stock Market Crash on Black Friday in 1929. The piano industry also had to compete with the radio and the gramophone. A number of German piano manufacturers united their businesses in December 1929 to the corporation “Deutsche Piano-Werke-AG” with the aim to overcome the challenging situation by unifying certain operations. The production of the cooperation was located in Luckenwalde and Braunschweig in Germany. Instruments of a higher quality such as Schimmel pianos were produced in Braunschweig. The production of grand pianos stayed in the company in Leipzig. Regarding the difficulty to unite different interests within the organization, the cooperation wasn't fit for the future. Wilhelm Arno Schimmel left the cooperation and founded the “Wilhelm Schimmel, Pianoforte GmbH” 1932 in Braunschweig, Germany. For the 50th company jubilee, Schimmel developed a small piano without back posts and a newly designed action. The Modell J 50, contemporary trend design was one of the most important new constructions of the 1930s. Arno Schimmel developed further small pianos with a small height. The smallest model only measures a height of 98 cm with a width of 140 cm. On the 8th of January, Arno Schimmel called the patent “small piano”. Schimmel also produced the smallest grand piano with the length of only 117 cm. As Braunschweig was the center of the aeroplane industry during the 2nd World War, the city was attacked numerous times by the allies. During the bomb attack in October 1944, a great part of the Schimmel piano factory was destroyed and the production of instruments came to a halt. After the war ended the factory was rebuilt, first focusing on various kinds of woodwork and furnishing until the production of pianos was continued in 1949. Schimmel glass piano 1951 The 1950s were marked by expansion and new inventions. In 1951 Schimmel presented the first acrylic glass piano in the world on the trade fair in Düsseldorf. The sales boomed during the 50s and end of 1958 Schimmel was the most frequently sold German piano. According to the sales volume Schimmel was the biggest piano manufacturer on the German market: The company exported their pianos worldwide. = 3rd Generation: 1961 - 2003 = In 1961, Wilhelm Arno Schimmel died unexpectedly. His son, Nikolaus Wilhelm Schimmel (*1934), who was trained as a piano builder as well as businessman took over the company's management. As the 1960s were also marked by a boom in the piano industry, the factory in Braunschweig soon became too small for the expanding production. In 1966, a new factory was built on larger premises in the south of Braunschweig. Over 7.500 instruments left the factory in 1975. In the 1980s, the production and sales had increased to annually 10.000 instruments (including the series Pleyel pianos, produced 1972 to 1996). In 1985, the company was considered as leading German piano manufacturer. Two thirds of the production was exported in the European Union, to North America and the Paciifc regions. = 4th Generation: 2003 - today = In 2003, Nikolaus W. Schimmel gave the management to the next generation. Regarding the transforming market the company expanded their product line and developed the new product series “Schimmel Konzert” for the premium section. Over the next 10 years, 6 new grand piano and 3 upright piano models were developed. The newly developed and patented method of construction based on the construction of a grand concert piano, which is used for all instruments. Furthermore, the company invested in research and development and founded another production plant in Kalisz in Poland. Here the series “Wilhelm Schimmel” is produced, which competes with Asian instruments regarding the price, but is produced in Europe. The financial crisis in 2008 had a large impact on Schimmel Pianos. In 2009, the company filed for self-administered insolvency, ending successfully on the 30th of March in 2010. In the following years Schimmel expands on the Asian market, focusing especially on China, the world's largest piano market. To enter the Chinese market successfully the company founded a strategic alliance with the Pearl River Piano Group, the world's largest piano producer in 2016 and majority share holder of Schimmel Pianos. Schimmel developed a new piano series, “Fridolin Schimmel” especially for the Asian market, The model is designed for piano beginners and is manufactured in cooperation with Pearl River in China. In May 2019, Schimmel Pianos found a subsidiary company in China responsible for all sales and marketing activities in China.

In the course of the company history extraordinary instruments have been designed. In 1913 the Schimmel piano Wilhelmina has been awarded for its outstanding design with a gold medal at the world fair in Leipzig. Tapping the pulse of the time, cooperating with renowned artists and designers, and using new materials, Schimmel Pianos developed a number of instruments in the following years with an extraordinary and timeless design. The Schimmel piano “Classic” model C 116 received numerous awards, such as the reddot design award 2018 for its clear minimalistic and timeless design.  Art Collection  Schimmel Glass Piano Together with renowned artists the German piano manufacturer developed the Schimmel Art Collection. 1952 Schimmel Pianos caused a sensation with the presentation of the first transparent acrylic glass piano. The glass piano was improved 30 years later by Nicholas Schimmel. The piano soon became famous as it toured the world with the entertainer Udo Jürgens. Today the glass piano is highly demanded for TV shows, concerts tours and stages. Schimmel Pegasus Piano The Pegasus piano designed in cooperation with Luigi Colani transcended the traditional form of pianos. The piano is positioned on an acrylic glass plate so the piano seem s to hover in mid-air. The stool is part of the piano body and the lid opens automatically. Schimmel Otma Alt Piano The grand piano designed by the artist Otmar Alt attracts attention with its colourful, flamboyant design.  Production  The Schimmel models “Classic” and “Konzert” are artfully crafted since 1885 in Germany. Based on the quote of Wilhelm Schimmel “Quality prevails” the company's production is based on tradition, innovation and handcraft. Committed to a high quality “Made in Germany\\" is of elementary significance for the piano manufacturer. The selection of high-quality materials and the use of CNC machines guarantee precision parts of a constant high quality. The majority of the production process is nevertheless hand work based on the experience of artful craftwork grown over years. Instruments by Schimmel Pianos are made of more than 10.000 pieces, that are fitted precisely and artfully in hand work. For a constant improvement of their products and production processes Schimmel is involved in research and development. New developments are fostered through own innovations as well as cooperation with renowned scientists and institutes (Fraunhofer Society, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig, Wilhelm Klauditz Institut für Holzforschung). The development of the own company software CAPE (computer assisted piano engineering) facilitates the construction of new models with a higher precision and quality.

The raw dough is baked normally, but halted at about 80% of the normal cooking time, when it is rapidly cooled and frozen. The partial cooking kills the yeast in the bread mixture, and sets the internal structure of the proteins and starches (the spongy texture of the bread), so that the inside is sterile and stable, but the loaf has not generated \\"crust\\" or other externally desirable qualities that are difficult to preserve once fully cooked. A parbaked loaf of semi- cooked bread is in a form that is relatively stable against aging. It can be transported easily, and stored until needed. Parbaked loaves are kept in sealed containers that prevent moisture loss. They are also usually frozen. A parbaked loaf appears as a risen loaf of bread, with much of the firmness of a finished loaf, but without a browned or golden crust (in the case of a normally light colored bread). It does not age or become stale like a fully baked loaf of bread. When the final bread product is desired, a parbaked loaf is \\"finished off\\" by baking it at normal temperatures for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. The exact time must be determined by testing, and varies by the product. The final bread is then often indistinguishable from freshly baked bread.  Effect on cost and supply of bread  Parbaking has shifted the economics of freshly baked bread. Parbaking allows manufacturers of bread to prepare, and then distribute bread to a market far beyond the geographic limits of conventional fresh bread. In the past, the roughly one day expiration period of freshly baked bread limited the reach of small bakeries to a local market. Significant transport times would waste too much of the bread's useful life. However, with a parbaked product that is frozen until final baking, a bakery can supply distant outlets with breads ready for baking on demand. Parbaking can save costs for many parties that distribute bread. The source bakery benefits because it can sell to more customers: The range of its breads are no longer limited by an expiration date. More varieties of bread can be produced for this larger market, because much less will expire in transit. The product is not wasted if unconsumed, so less-popular specialized breads can be delivered. Also, commercial buyers can buy larger quantities without fear of expiration. Since most of the baking occurs at the source bakery, the source bakery can also assure that their branded product will reach consumers in peak quality. Parbaking has enabled national bakery brands distributed in either supermarkets and branded retail shops. Some examples include Brioches la Boulangere in France; Signature Breads in the United States; and Tim Hortons in Canada. Supermarkets (secondary distributors) also benefit, because parbaking lets them reduce the need for skilled bakers in their stores. Only a simple finishing bake is needed, so simple instructions and baking times are easy for untrained store personnel. Instead of a complex bakery with specialized equipment, only a simple oven is needed. Also, bread is baked only when it is needed. As bread sells out through the day, more can be baked. The consumer benefits, because freshly baked bread is available in markets where it may not have previously been available due to geography or other causes. Thus, small towns without specialty bakeries can benefit. On the other hand, parbaked bread is not a natural product. Chemicals are added to guarantee the flour and dough composition. Yeast may be added in excessive quantities to create breads of the same size but more air content and less dough. Also, the bake-off product hardens more quickly than an artisan bread or roll. The parbaking technique may upset the dynamic of the local \\"artisanal\\" producer if one already exists in a neighborhood. If parbaked bread is introduced to consumers previously accustomed to such local products, and if the new parbaked product is equally palatable, and available at lower cost (due to efficiencies achieved by mass distribution), the local producer may be at a disadvantage.

In 2009, he began teaching Coastal and Ocean Law at the University of Texas School of Law. In September 2008, he was quoted in The New York Times on the subject of damage to Galveston from Hurricane Ike and other hurricanes over the years. The 1900 Galveston hurricane that devastated Galveston, he said, was a “message from God.” He explained: “God’s message was, ‘man wasn’t meant to live on no damned island.’” In an Associated Press story after Hurricane Ike about the fact that the 1959 Texas Open Beaches Act, a state law protecting public access to beaches might cause some Galveston- area homes to be seized by the state, Schwartz said, \\"\\"We're talking about damn fools that have built houses on the edge of the sea for as long as man could remember and against every advice anyone has given.\\" That story, in turn, led to an attack on Schwartz by radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, who said, \\"You know, folks, it’s one thing to be smacked by a natural disaster; it’s quite another to have to be smacked around by the government that you’re looking to for help.\\"Rush Limbaugh - 22 Sep 2008 - Morning Update His oral history for the Texas Legacy Project is featured on the project's site and in a 2010 book published from those interviews.

In Beloit's younger days, the city's fire protection consisted of two volunteer companies with hoses and mobile pumps that drew water from the Rock River and from private wells and cisterns. With . Several businesses burned just beyond reach of the hoses and finally in 1884 St. Thomas Catholic and Baptist churches went up in flames. Beyond fire protection, a source of clean drinking water would reduce the risk of diseases like diphtheria and typhoid fever. The rough-edged community debated for years whether a better water supply should be city-owned or a private enterprise. Finally in 1885 a consortium of local businessmen agreed to finance a private water works project. The financiers were: C.H. Morse, W.H. Wheeler, J.B. Peet, E.C. Allen, C.B. Salmon, and C.H. Parker. They hired Fairbanks, Morse Co. of Chicago to design the system, and J.B. Kinley designed the tower. It sits on one of the high points of town, with limestone walls 36 feet tall. The walls are octagonal, 36 feet in diameter at the base with walls eight feet thick. As the walls rise, they taper in four stages with the top stage 30 feet in diameter. Lancet-arched windows let light into the tower. Originally, a tank 20 feet deep sat atop the tower, built of 3-inch cypress and holding 100,000 gallons of water. A pumping station was built just southwest of the tower, powered by steam-operated Smith and Vale pumps. The resulting system could shoot a two-inch stream of water 130 feet high. Seven miles of water mains were laid through the city feeding 72 hydrants. For the fire protection, the city paid a tax to the consortium. The water-works also tried to entice homeowners to give up their private wells and switch to city water, offering free pipe to the curb for the first 100 patrons. In 1914 the cypress tank collapsed. The water-works replaced it with a metal tank of the same size, built by the Eclipse Wind Mill Company, right in Beloit. On top of the tank was a cupola, and a flag pole on top of that. By 1929 the water system served 25,000 customers, but the tower was outdated. A modern (for the time) steel tower was built nearby, with a 200,000 gallon tank. The metal tank was removed from the old tower, the stairs inside were removed, and demolition of the stone walls began, but the walls were well-built, and demolition was deemed too expensive. After demolition was given up, a Beloit Daily News article stated that the tower was \\"once regarded as the finest piece of masonry in the west\\". In 1983 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now, the stone water tower is a visible community landmark offering excellent photo opportunities for camera buffs. The area surrounding the tower has been developed into Water Tower Park with an ADA accessible walkway. The Water Works Pump House has been completely restored and currently houses the City of Beloit Parks and Leisure Services offices and Friends of Riverfront offices. Also, visitors are welcome to stop in during business hours. The Shingle Style pump house at the base of the bluff now acts as the Beloit Visitor Center.

One of the most widespread and common species in the genus Scolopendra, this species is also found on virtually all land areas around and within the Indian Ocean, all of tropical and subtropical Asia from Russia to the islands of Malaysia and Indonesia, Australia, South and Central America, the Caribbean islands, and possibly parts of the southern United States. However, how much of this range is natural and how much due to human introduction is unclear. With a wide geographic range and numerous color variations, the species is known by a great many common names including Chinese red-headed centipede, jungle centipede, orange-legged centipede, red- headed centipede and Vietnamese centipede. It is among the largest centipedes with a maximum length of 20 cm. This centipede is an active, aggressive predator that preys on any animal it can overpower.  Description  Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans Scolopendra subspinipes japonica This is a large species which can grow up to 20 cm in length. It has colour variations. Its body is usually red or reddish brown with yellow or yellow-orange legs. In common with other members of genus Scolopendra, it has 22 body segments with each segment having one pair of legs. A pair of modified legs known as forcipules can be found on its head, which is covered by a flat shield and bears a pair of antennae. The forcipules are the major tools used by the centipede to kill its prey or for defense, as they have sharp claws that connect to venom glands. Centipedes breathe through the openings located along sides of their bodies. These openings are either round-shaped or S-shaped. They have simple eyes with poor vision, so they rely much on touch and their chemoreceptors. Habitats The species can be found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the Old World. It is also one of only three species of centipedes in Hawaii. Diet and behavior This is an aggressive and nervous arthropod which is ready to strike if interfered with and is sensitive to vibrations nearby. It preys primarily on arachnids, including spiders, scorpions, and vinegaroons. However, if it is large enough to overpower small vertebrates like mice or small reptiles, it will readily attempt to consume them as well. It tends to try to eat almost every living animal it encounters that is not longer than itself. It attacks its prey with the last prehensorial legs, then curves its head quickly behind to implant its venomous jaws deeply and firmly into the prey. The prey is held by the centipede's other legs until it dies from the fast-acting venom. During a fight, the centipede will use its entire body coiling the prey or enemy with its legs firmly attaching to the body of the opponent. Then, it will quickly penetrate its forcipules into the victim for venom injection. =Reproduction= The male produces capsules containing mature sperm cells, spermatophores, which are deposited in a reservoir called the spermathecae of the female during mating. The female then fertilizes her immature eggs, oocytes, and deposits them in a dark, protected area. The female lays 50 to 80 eggs which she vigilantly protects until they hatch and the baby centipede molt once. If danger is detected she will wrap around her babies to keep them safe. The young centipedes molt once each year, and take three to four years to attain full adult size. Adults molt once every year. They may live for 10 years or more. Venom Scolopendra subspinipes has been reported as the apparent cause of a human death. The fatal case was in Philippines in which the centipede bit a seven-year-old girl on her head. She died 29 hours later. Human uses S. subspinipes is a popular pet among arthropod hobbyists. The centipede was a traditional food source for Aboriginal Australians  Subspecies  The number of subspecies of S. subspinipes is unclear and varies between authors. Taxonomic characters have incorporated plastic traits such as colour and sulcus structure and the number and position of spines, producing indistinguishable and intergrading subspecies. A 2012 review found that one former subspecies, S. subspinipes cingulatoides is in fact a distinct species, and that S. subspinipes has no valid subspecies.

History  An administrative unit of Purdue University Libraries, Purdue University Press has its roots in the 1960 founding of Purdue University Studies by President Frederick Hovde on a $12,000 grant from the Purdue Research Foundation. This was the result of a committee appointed by Hovde after the Department of English lamented the lack of publishing venues in the humanities. The first editorial board was headed by Robert B. Ogle. William Whalen, Director of the Office of Publications, became the part-time Director of Purdue University Studies. Verna Emery was Managing Editor from 1977 to 1990, succeeded by Margaret Hunt who served until 2008. On September 12, 1974, Purdue University Studies became Purdue University Press. In June 1992 Whalen retired and David Sanders was appointed the first full-time Director of the Press serving until 1996. Also in 1992 administrative responsibility for the Press was transferred to the Dean of Libraries. Press Director Sanders was succeeded by Tom Bacher (1997-2008) and Charles T. Wilkinson (2008-2014). Under Sanders, Bacher, and Wilkinson the range of books published by the Press grew to reflect the work from other Colleges at Purdue University especially in the areas of agriculture, health, and engineering.

The film stars Zeynabou Diallo as Binta, Agnile Sambou as Binta's Father, and Aminata Sane as Soda. The film duration is approximately 31 minutes and has dialogue in Diola and French. The film is included in Oscar Nominated Short Films by Magnolia Pictures and Shorts International; the theatrical release of this collection was February 16, 2007.Magnolia Pictures It was made in collaboration with UNICEF, to which all of the profits were given.www.spike.com  Plot  Binta is a young African girl who serves as the narrator. She talks about her father and his 'great idea'. Binta's father is a small-time, local fisherman in a peaceful village (near the town of Bignona) in Senegal. His friend who recently visited Europe describes what fishing is like there. He tells him that the Europeans can catch thousands of fish with bigger boats equipped with sonar. The man, very impressed by this, encourages the father to approach the government and request a permit for a bigger boat. Binta's father also hears from his friend how once he attains wealth he must get a permit for a weapon so he can defend his wealth. The friend also shows off his watch which has an alarm set to ring every day at noon. \\"What happens at noon?\\" asks Binta's father. \\"Why, the alarm rings!\\" his friend replies. Binta's father is shown making his way up through the ranks of government, sharing his great idea with various officials. The film switches back and forth between the story of Binta and her father and the struggle between Binta's cousin, Soda, and her father, a village elder. Soda desperately wants to go to school, but her father believes African girls should not be educated; they should learn to tend the home and then get married and tend to home and family. The village school children put on a play to convince Soda's father to let her attend school. In the end, the father is finally convinced, and Soda is allowed to get an education. Finally, when Binta's father meets with the provincial leader, it is revealed what his great idea was: he wants do his part to make the world a better place by adopting a tubab (white child), \\"preferably weaned\\", to teach him or her qualities that Western industrialized society has largely lost, such as sharing, solidarity, and the sustainable use of resources.

The factory made porcelain of very high quality, especially in the years from 1813-1814 and 1817-1820. The body was extremely white and translucent, and was given overglaze decoration of high quality, mostly in London or elsewhere rather than at the factory. The wares were expensive, and mostly distributed through the London dealers. Plates were much the most common shapes made, and the decoration was typically of garlands of flowers in a profusion of colours, the speciality of the founder, William Billingsley. With Swansea porcelain, Nantgarw was one of the last factories to make soft-paste porcelain, when English factories had switched to bone china, and continental and Asian ones continued to make hard-paste porcelain.Battie, 147; Honey, 314-323 The history of the ownership and management of the factory is complicated. The first formula, used in 1813-14, gave excellent results, but had an unacceptably high wastage rate, being very prone to deform (\\"slump\\") during firing. This formula was also being used at Swansea, and pieces can be impossible to allocate between the two with confidence. After a period of experimentation, in 1817-1820 the original paste formula was used again.Honey, 314-316; Battie, 147 After ceasing to make or decorate porcelain in the 1820s, and a period of closure, the pottery reopened in 1833, making earthenware and stoneware, as well as clay pipes, before finally closing in 1920, when cigarettes had replaced pipes. The site is now a museum, and also a working pottery. In 2017 a limited quantity of porcelain was made there, using the original formula, as reconstructed.BBC Wales: \\"Nantgarw China Works porcelain produced after 200 years\\", 10 December 2017. History Established in November 1813, when artist and potter William Billingsley and his son-in- law Samuel Walker, a skilled technician, rented \\"Nantgarw House\\" on the eastern bank of the Glamorganshire Canal, eight miles north of Cardiff in the Taff Valley, Glamorganshire, Wales, and set about building the kilns and ancillary equipment in its grounds, necessary to transform the building into a small porcelain pottery. One of the kilns at the Nantgarw Pottery undergoing restoration in September 2006 Billingsley had been instrumental in the development of the porcelain recipe for Flight, Barr & Barr at Royal Worcester, he and Walker, had signed an agreement not to disclose their new porcelain recipe to a third party, but there was no clause preventing them from using that recipe themselves. They had left Worcester in secret and started the venture at Nantgarw with only £250 to invest in the project between them. By January 1814, the Quaker entrepreneur William Weston Young had already become the major share-holder in their venture, having invested £630 into the first production period at Nantgarw, as his diaries at the Glamorgan Record Office testify, where payments are recorded to a Mr \\"Bealey;\\" an alias Billingsley travelled under since leaving Royal Worcester. It is assumed Young was acquainted with Billingsley through a mutual friend, and fellow earthenware decorator Thomas Pardoe, whom Billingsley had approached at Swansea's Cambrian Pottery, while seeking employment in 1807. Young's work across Glamorganshire as a surveyor may have put him in the position to advise Billingsley whilst still at Royal Worcester, of the suitability of the site at Nantgarw. Its proximity to the Glamorganshire Canal enabled heavy shipments of china clay, as well as the pottery's delicate porcelain wares to be smoothly transported to and from Cardiff docks by barges. With the pottery established, Billingsley sought to produce a soft paste porcelain. Nantgarw porcelain was made to Billingsley's secret formula. Bones, burnt and mixed with clay, were ground by miller David Jones in a mill adjoining the Cross Keys public house, in the village. The water wheel was powered by a leat running from the canal to the River Taff. The high temperature needed to produce perfect pieces made Billingsley soft paste method difficult to fire. The vast majority of the pieces warped or shattered in the firing process. The resources of the three associates soon ran out and the group approached the British Government's Committee of Trade and Plantations (The Board of Trade), requesting a grant of £500, referring to the subsidy afforded to the famous Sèvres Porcelain Factory by the French Government. They were not successful, but one member of the committee, porcelain enthusiast Sir Joseph Banks, suggested his friend and potter Lewis Weston Dillwyn of the Cambrian Pottery of Swansea, Glamorganshire, should make an inspection and report on the matter. Dillwyn made the inspection, observing that 90% of the porcelain was ruined in the firing, but was so impressed with the quality of the surviving pieces that he invited Billingsley and Walker to use his facilities at the Cambrian Pottery to improve their recipe and process. An annexe was built for porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery, where Walker and Billingsley were based from late 1814. The recipe was modified and improved, but was still wasteful enough for Dillwyn to abandon the project in 1817, when the pair returned to Nantgarw. Royal Worcester's attempts to sue Dillwyn, Billingsley & Walker for breach of contract was a further reason for Dillwyn to cease porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery. The contract signed at Royal Worcester prevented the recipe being disclosed to a third party, which superficially, Flight, Barr & Barr could not prove. However, when Dilwyn's notebooks were interred at the V&A; Museum, South Kensington, London in 1920; Bilingsley's recipe was found, but had never used in Billingsley's absence. A jigger-and- jolley machine demonstrated by the curator of the Nantgarw pottery museum In the second phase of production at Nantgarw, Young invested a further £1,100 in the pottery as well as mustering a further £1,000 from \\"ten gentlemen of the county\\". Billingsley and Walker continued to fire their porcelain, which by this stage was of the finest quality Billingsley had ever attained but still at a loss until one day in April 1820, while Young was away in Bristol, the pair absconded to Coalport leaving behind them the lease to the pottery and several thousand pieces of undecorated porcelain in various stages of production (\\"in the biscuit and the white\\"). Young put the Nantgarw Pottery and its contents up for sale via public auction in October 1820, enabling him to buy out his minor partners, become sole proprietor and manage the completion and sale of the stock; effectively salvaging the business. He invited his friend and former co-working artist from the Cambrian Pottery, Thomas Pardoe, to aid him with the completion and decoration of the salvaged porcelain. Young and Pardoe experimented to perfect a glaze for the biscuit ware, but were unable to add to Billingsley's stockpile of porcelain, having no access to his recipe. The final sales of the finished porcelain (sold between 1821 and 1822), paid Pardoe and his staff's salaries in arrears, but failed to recoup Young's total losses, leaving Young narrowly avoiding bankruptcy. Besides the porcelain decorated by Young, but predominantly by Pardoe at Nantgarw, many pieces were sold in the white to be decorated in London. These wares are known to have been decorated by Thomas Martin Randall (working for John Mortlock at the time), John Latham, William Peg and probably Matthew Colclough. Some Nantgarw porcelain is identified with the mark \\"NANTGARW\\" impressed, often with the initials C.W. (for China Works) underneath. The word \\"NANTGARW\\" in red script is also seen on some of the finer specimens. In 1833 William Henry Pardoe, son of Thomas Pardoe, took over the vacant Nantgarw Pottery and began manufacturing stoneware bottles and brown glazed earthenware known as Rockingham ware. He also began manufacturing clay tobacco pipes, many of which were exported to Ireland. The business continued under Pardoe's descendants, and at its peak produced around 10,000 pipes a week, until its closure in 1920, when cigarettes replaced such clay pipes. Collections Collections of the historic wares can be seen at museums including the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw, Llanbedrog, Pwllheli, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. China Works Museum In 1989 the semi-derelict site was bought by Taff-Ely County Borough Council, who still today own the site. After the start of archaeological excavation and restoration of its kilns and buildings, the site opened it to the public two years later as the Nantgarw China Works and Museum. Closed at the end of 2008 due to budget cuts at Rhondda Cynon Taff council, the Nantgarw Chinaworks Museum was reopened during the week in November 2010 by two artists. The museum is currently (February 2016) used for artists' studios, exhibitions, art classes and special events, and the restoration of the kilns is being completed by the Welsh government.

US 45 heads to the northwest and travels just north of Lyons Park and skirts along the northeastern edge of USA Children's & Women's Hospital. It crosses over Threemile Creek and curves to the north-northwest. It passes just to the east of Washington Middle School and Carver Park. Just after passing Gorgas Park and LeFlore Magnet High School, the highway curves back to the northwest. At an intersection with West Prichard Avenue, it leaves Mobile and enters Prichard. It crosses over some railroad tracks of Canadian National Railway just before an interchange with Interstate 65 (I-65). The highway passes Whispering Pines Cemetery just before crossing over Eightmile Creek. Almost immediately, it intersects the southern terminus of SR 213 (South Shelton Beach Road). Approximately later is an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 217 (Lott Road). US 45 passes John F. Fagerstrom Municipal Park and then Collins–Rhodes Elementary School. It curves to the north-northeast and crosses over Seabury Creek. The highway curves to a nearly due north direction and has an interchange with SR 158 (Industrial Parkway). It curves back to the northwest and travels through Kushla, which is within the city limits of Prichard. Immediately after leaving the city, the highway crosses over Magee Creek. It then enters Mauvilla. Here, it intersects the southern terminus of County Route 78 (CR 78; Spice Pond Road). Just northeast of Mauvilla Cemetery is an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 55 (Kali Oka Road). US 45 curves to the north-northwest, leaves Mauvilla, and crosses over Williams Creek. It curves to the north and crosses over Silver Creek. It curves to the north-northeast and enters Chunchula. The highway curves back to the north- northwest and enters the main part of the community. There, the highway has an intersection with CR 63 (Chunchula–Georgetown Road/Roberts Road). It curves back to the northwest and crosses over Beaver Pond Creek. It curves back to the north-northwest and crosses over Sweetwater and Drinking branches. It heads to the north-northeast and crosses over Sand Hill Creek. In Gulfcrest, the highway intersects the eastern terminus of CR 92 (Gulfcrest Road). The highway curves to the north and passes McDavid–Jones Elementary School. Then, it enters Citronelle. Almost immediately is an intersection with CR 41 (Celeste Road), which begins to parallel the U.S. Highway. It passes Lott Middle School and then Pilgrims Rest Cemetery. At an intersection with the southern terminus of Main Street, CR 41 ends its paralleling of US 45\\\\. It curves to the north and crosses over Puppy Creek. In the main part of Citronelle, it has an intersection with both CR 96 (West State Street) and the northern terminus of CR 41 (East State Street). CR 96 has a brief unsigned concurrency with US 45\\\\. On the northeastern edge of the intersection is War Memorial Park. One block later, CR 96 splits off to the east, onto Lebaron Avenue. On the northeastern edge of the intersection, US 45 passes the new campus of Citronelle High School. It curves to the north-northwest and briefly leaves Citronelle. It passes Wesleyan Christian Academy and then re-enters the city for a very short stint. During the last stint, it crosses over Bennett Creek. Upon leaving the city, it enters Washington County. =Washington County= US 45 continues to the northwest, through rural areas of the state. It crosses over Long and Flat branches just before intersecting the eastern terminus of CR 8 (Deer Park–Burbank Road), just to the east of Deer Park. Almost immediately, the highway crosses over Yellowhouse Branch. Then, it curves to the north. It passes Deer Park Cemetery just before SR 17 splits off at a Y intersection. At this intersection SR 57 has its southern terminus, and begins traveling concurrently with US 45\\\\. The highway curves back to the northwest and crosses over Pine Branch on the Donald R. Stallworth Sr. Bridge before intersecting the southern terminus of CR 1 (Main Street). This intersection is just to the east of Vinegar Bend. Farther to the northwest, in an area known as Four Points, is an intersection with CR 20 (Four Points Road). The highway then crosses over the Escatawpa River. A short distance later, it enters Fruitdale. There, US 45 intersects CR 1 again. The highway curves to the north-northwest and leaves Fruitdale. It then begins paralleling Brushy Creek. The highway travels through Yellow Pine, just north-northwest of which is the end of the paralleling of the creek. It continues to the north- northwest and reaches the Mississippi state line. Here, SR 57 ends, and US 45 continues its path into that state. =National Highway System= All of US 45 in the state of Alabama is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of highways determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History =1910s and 1920s= The road that would become US 45 in Alabama was designated at least as early as 1914. This road traveled in Mobile and Prichard as an \\"improved hard surface road\\" (macadam, gravel, chert) and from Prichard to Citronelle as an \\"improved soil road\\". There was also a segment from about Deer Park to Yellow Pine as an \\"unimproved road\\". By 1925, the roadway was entirely built in the state. It was designated as SR 28, and it is an \\"existing road upon which state has done no work\\". That year, US 45 was designated along its entire length in the state. The entire highway was an \\"existing road upon which the state has done no work\\" except for a segment from just north of Gulfcrest to Fruitdale, which was indicated to be graded. By 1928, the segment from Mobile to just north of Gulfcrest was indicated to be \\"unimproved\\", while the segment from Fruitdale to the Mississippi state line was indicated to be graded, in addition to the Gulfcrest-to-Fruitdale segment. Also, SR 57 was designated along the entire length of the highway. =1930s= By 1930, the highway was indicated to have a \\"hard surface\\" in Mobile and Citronelle; a gravel/chert or a sand- clay/topsoil surface from Mobile to Citronelle; and \\"graded\\" from Citronelle to the Mississippi state line. Later that year, the entire Mobile County segment was indicated to have a \\"hard surface\\". The entire Washington County segment was indicated to have been graded. By the end of 1934, US 43, along with SR 5 were designated in Mobile, but the state maps are unclear as to whether they traveled concurrently with US 45/SR 57. By 1935, the entire Mobile County segment was indicated to have a \\"pavement\\" surface. The entire Washington County segment was indicated to have a \\"gravel or chert\\" surface. By 1939, the highway was indicated to be under construction from the Mobile–Washington county line to about Fruitdale. =1940s to 1980s= By 1941, the highway was indicated to be under construction from just southeast of Fruitdale to just northwest of Yellow Pine. By 1942, US 45 was indicated to be paved for its entire length in the state. By 1952, SR 57 was decommissioned south of the Deer Park area. It was replaced by SR 17, as it exists today. By 1957, SR 5, which was concurrent with US 43 in Mobile was truncated farther north. It was replaced by SR 13\\\\. However, it was still not clear whether US 43 and SR 13 were concurrent with US 45 in the city. By 1983, US 43 and SR 13 were moved off of US 45 and SR 17 in Mobile.

A series of archaeological sites located in the Upper Great Lakes, the Greater Illinois River Valley, and the Ohio River Valley in the American Midwest have been discovered to be a Red Ocher burial complex, dating from 1000 BC to 400 BC, the Terminal Archaic – Early Woodland period. Characterized as shallow burials located in sandy ridges along river valleys, covered in red ochre or hydrated iron oxide (FeH3O), they contain diagnostic artifacts that include caches of flint points, turkey-tails, and various forms of worked copper. Turkey-tails are large flint blades of a distinct type. It is believed that Red Ocher people spoke an ancestral form of the Algonquian languages. Red ochre has a long history of use in North America; as early as the Folsom tradition during the Paleo-Indian period, certain localities in New Mexico and Wyoming were being mined for the substance.Tankersley, Kenneth B., et al. \\"They Have a Rock That Bleeds: Sunrise Red Ochre and Its Early Paleoindian Occurrence at the Hell Gap Site\\". Plains Anthropologist 40.152 (1995): 185-194: 187. The people today known as Red Ocher were first identified by the University of Chicago in 1937. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Red Ocher Culture was a topic of great interest among archaeologists who were trying to better define the burial culture through various methods of research. Since then intermittent archaeological works have been published dealing with specific sub-topics within the burial culture and supported by more reliable AMS carbon dates. Nevertheless, many important archaeological questions regarding the Red Ocher burial manifestation and cultural phenomenon are still without answers. Etymology This culture used powdered red ocher in their burials. There is considerable variation from site to site in the few sites with this artifact. Robert E. Ritzenthaler, Curator of Anthropology, Milwaukee Public Museum and George I. Quimby; Curator of North American Archaeology and Ethnology; Chicago Natural History Museum Chicago Natural History Museum; Fieldiana Anthropology; Volume 36 March 27, 1962 No.11; Chicago Natural History Museum; Chicago, Illinois; 1962 The term \\"Red Ocher\\" was first used in 1937 as a description from three sites in central Illinois. Some additional sites have since been recognized as Red Ocher because of their cultural similarity to these. There is not a broad synthesis of the existing information and it is easily confused the Glacial Kame Culture. Location It is found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio. The sites are from eastern Iowa to central Ohio and from southern Ohio to the Manitoulin District of Ontario. Most of the sites seem are in southeastern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northern Indiana, and the southern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This area of Red Ocher culture is a co-occupant with Glacial Kame. It seems probable that the Old Copper merges into both Red Ocher and Glacial Kame.

It is native to Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario. It is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a threatened species.United States Fish & Wildlife Service. 2005. Threatened and Endangered Animals and Plants, Species Information. Species Information Threatened and Endangered Animal and Plants Description Pitcher's thistle is a plant of modest appearance through much of its lifespan; it concentrates most of its biomass in a massive taproot that can be 6 feet (2 m) in length. Its long, narrow, gray-green leaves are protected by spines and dense, silvery hairs. Between 2 and 8 years after germination, the juvenile thistle abruptly matures and sends forth a flower stalk of 100 cm (40 inches) or more in height. At the top of the blooming shoot is a spectacular effusive flower head, ranging in color from creamy white to very light pink, and guarded by spines. Some individuals may be quite bushy, and produce numerous flowering heads. Usually at least 5 years are required for the thistle to reach maturity. Pitcher's thistle is monocarpic; after flowering once, the plant dies. Most of its seeds do not disperse very far, in fact, entire heads are occasionally buried, producing clusters of seedlings.Flora of North America, Dune or sand-dune thistle, Cirsium pitcheri (Torrey ex Eaton) Torrey & A. Gray The Pitcher's thistle is adapted to life on open, windswept, semi-stable sand dune surfaces. It can flower at any time from mid-June through mid-September, depending on the amount of energy it has stored in its taproot and on local rain conditions immediately prior to the flowering. History and identification The Pitcher's thistle was first identified by Dr. Zina Pitcher, an amateur naturalist and U.S. Army field surgeon stationed at Fort Brady, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. In an unknown summer at some point in the 1820s, Dr. Pitcher was granted leave to go on an adventure camping trip west of the fort on a sandy shoreline of Lake Superior. While exploring what are now the Grand Sable Dunes of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Dr. Pitcher discovered a Pitcher's thistle in flower. The physician shipped the specimen to botanists who published and named it in his honor, Cirsium pitcheri.Torrey, John ex Eaton, Amos 1829. Manual of Botany for North America. Fifth edition. 180, as Cnicus pitcheriTropicos, Cnicus pitcheri Torr. ex Eaton Distribution The Pitcher's thistle is found exclusively along the shorelines of Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior, particularly in areas of sand dunes.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Two of the largest remaining populations have been identified in the Nordhouse Dunes area of the Manistee National Forest, and within Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In addition, Pitcher's thistle continues to grow and flower in some smaller state parks and private tracts along these lake shores. Great Lakes dune habitat is threatened by invasive species such as spotted knapweed. In addition, the high economic value of Great lakes shoreline for real estate development continues to threaten the Pitcher's thistle. Although it can be locally abundant in areas of relatively undisturbed habitat, the thistle is highly vulnerable because it is adapted to live in locations where many people would like to build vacation homes and resorts and is therefore critically threatened by anthropogenic habitat destruction. This fact, as well as its general vulnerability due to its specialized habitat and restricted range, has led to Pitcher's Thistle being federally listed as a threatened species by the U.S. government; it is also listed as either threatened or endangered at the state level.Michigan Natural Features Inventory: Pitcher's thistle. 2004; Michigan State University, East Lansing, Mich.

New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007. , p. 34 Coltrane had previously recorded as a sideman, and had co-led a session with Paul Quinichette released in 1959 as Cattin' with Coltrane and Quinichette, but never as sole bandleader.Lewis Porter. John Coltrane: His Life and Music. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1999. , pp. 117-8. Coltrane had been fired by Davis in April 1957 for drug abuse, and went home to Philadelphia to clean himself out.Ratliff, pp. 34-35. He returned to New York City for mid-May sessions with Prestige, this one taking place the day after Memorial Day. By the summer, Coltrane would be recording with Thelonious Monk and playing as a member of his quartet for the rest of the year.Porter, pp. 108-9. For his debut, Coltrane chose a tune by his friend Calvin Massey, in addition to three standards including the relatively obscure \\"Time Was\\". Sidemen included Paul Chambers and Red Garland from the Davis band, and Philadelphia colleagues Johnnie Splawn and Albert Heath. The album was 20-bit-remastered for compact disc by Fantasy Records in 2001.

He was born in 1955 in New York City, New York. Originally trained as a concert pianist, de la Peña switched to ballet while studying at the High School for the Performing Arts in New York City. He graduated from George Balanchine’s School of American Ballet. He joined American Ballet Theatre in the 1970s, rapidly rising to soloist. While at ABT, de la Peña danced in works choreographed by Mikhail Baryshnikov, Agnes de Mille, Kenneth MacMillan, and Jerome Robbins. By 1985, de la Peña and his then-wife Rebecca Wright had both left ABT and moved to California. De la Peña and Wright had two children before they separated.) He and Ms. Wright can be seen in Baryshnikov's production of The Nutcracker on television and on DVD. De la Peña began acting when he was cast as Vaslav Nijinsky in Herbert Ross's film Nijinsky (1980),, and for some time thereafter, he was typecast in Russian roles. In a 1983 interview in the New York Times, an exasperated de la Peña, who is of mixed Russian and Argentinian descent, pointed out that producers thought he was not a native English speaker. He appeared on Broadway in Woman of the Year, the revival of On Your Toes, the notorious flop The Red Shoes (Drama Desk Award nomination), and Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Drama League Award). While living in Los Angeles during the 1980s, he performed in Cats and various regional productions. His film and television credits include Personal Best (1982), The Flamingo Kid (1984), Kuffs (1992), Brain Donors (1992), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), and guest appearances on shows such as L.A. Law and Star Trek: The Next Generation. He was seen in the film The Dust Factory, with Hayden Panettiere and Armin Mueller-Stahl. De la Peña was married to ballerina Rebecca Wright from 1984 to 2006. They had two children. Rebecca Wright died from cancer in 2006. De la Peña has taught at universities, including CalArts, Connecticut College, and the University of Iowa, where he is the chair of the Department of Dance. He continues to teach for ABT. A director and choreographer for both theatrical works and concert dance, he assisted figure skater Debi Thomas with her routine for the Olympics.

The official city of license is George, referring to George Air Force Base, which at its 1989 sign-on was an active military base and census-designated place. The base was decommissioned in 1992 and later annexed by the city of Victorville. The station is owned by El Dorado Broadcasters and broadcasts a country music format. KATJ-FM broadcasts in HD Radio. History KATJ-FM first signed on June 29, 1989 with a country music format. It was licensed to the community of George, California; this referred to George Air Force Base, an active military base and census-designated place near Victorville. The base was decommissioned in 1992 and it became the civilian Southern California Logistics Airport, an area later annexed by the city of Victorville. Original owner Crown Broadcasting, headed by Sid King, attempted to sell KATJ-FM and sister station KCIN (1590 AM) to Victor Valley Broadcasting for $1.36 million in August 1989. The potential buyer was a company led by Kenneth Devine, Peter Trosclair, and John Binsfield, all partners in a New Orleans-based engineering company. However, that transaction was unsuccessful. Crown then struck a deal with Island Broadcasting Corporation, headed by Scott Brady and Richard Sadowsky, in October 1990 to purchase the combo for $1.575 million. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the transfer of both stations' licenses to the new owner December 21. In January 1995, Island Broadcasting sold KATJ-FM and KCIN to Park Lane Group for $1.8 million. In June 1996, the station hired Harry Hall, former afternoon drive show producer at Los Angeles country station KZLA, as a part-time on-air personality. In June 1997, Regent Communications purchased Park Lane Group's 16 stations in California and Arizona, including KATJ-FM, for a total of $23.5 million. In April 2000, Clear Channel Communications proposed a complex station swap with Regent Communications which would have involved 20 stations nationwide, including KATJ-FM, and a payment of over $67 million by Regent to Clear Channel. This deal was one of many divestitures required of Clear Channel and AMFM, Inc. by the FCC as a condition of their merger, in order to satisfy ownership caps in each affected media market. While this exchange was not implemented fully, Clear Channel did acquire KATJ-FM and its AM sister station, now called KROY. In June 2007, Clear Channel sold 16 stations in California and Arizona, including KATJ-FM, to El Dorado Broadcasters for $40 million.

His lifelong interest in Byzantium (especially its architecture) was a major theme which ran through his poetry, fiction and travel writing, along with family, friends and the three major cities he has lived in. As well as his books (largely published by Carcanet), his work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Washington Post and Paris Review. Life John Ash was born in Manchester, England in 1948, the son of schoolteachers. With a brief break to attend the University of Birmingham (B.A. 1969) and to take a post-graduation year in Cyprus, he remained in the city of his birth until 1985. In the notes to his first book, a sequence titled Casino, Ash remarked that it had grown \\"out of several years of research for another project - a prose work which was to have been called \\"The Mauve Book: In Praise of Decadence\\". He also noted that titles of some sections and the over-all structure had a musical analogy. Musical references continued in the books he published while still in England. Moving to New York City in 1985, Ash became associated with the New York School of poets and formed a strong and lasting friendship with its leading proponent, John Ashbery. After stints teaching at the University of Iowa and the University of California, Berkeley, he moved to Istanbul in 1996, where he has lived since, first teaching at Boğaziçi University, before moving to Kadir Has University.

It derives from the Old Gaelic name \\"MacCuarta\\" or sometimes \\"MacCuairt\\", translating as \\"the son of Cuairt\\", a byname meaning \\"visitor\\". Another interesting feature of the name is the associations with that equally Old Gaelic name of Muircheartaigh which may be perceived through the anglicized pronunciation of that surname as McCourt (or McCord) - (very roughly \\"Murr Ciart\\") McCourt is a surname of ancient origin, being first recorded in the Kingdom of Oriel, which comprised mainly the modern counties of Armagh and Monaghan, with parts of Down, Louth and Fermanagh, in the 9th century. Colla Uais, their ancestor, was King of Ireland from 322 to 326. Kinsmen of the O’Carroll Princes they were Chiefs of a considerable territory in the north of County Louth near the Armagh border. As a result of the Anglo-Norman invasions in the late 12th century, their patrimony was greatly diminished, but most remain in or near their homeland. A branch of the family who settled in County Tyrone, gave their name to the village of Cappagh (in Gaelic Ceapach Mhic Cuarta) near Dungannon in County Tyrone This is written in Gaelic as \\"Ceapach Mhic Cuarta\\", which translates as an outlying settlement of the Mac Cuarta's, one remote from the main sept. As early as the 16th century, the surname was recorded as far south as Munster, where in several County Cork documents, it was equated with Rothe, i.e. a lease dated 1484, listed Elias Roothe alias Mc Cuarta. (viz. Muircheartaigh). Others of the \\"sept\\" are found in the Hearth Money Rolls of County Armagh for 1664, under the spelling Mac Quorte and Father Ronan, in his Irish martyrs, gives the anglicized form as Mac Worth. The name has gained a permanent place in the literary history of Ireland, due to James Mac Court or Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta [1647–1733] whose poems were collected and published by Rev. L. Murray. Known as Courtney as well as McCourt, he was a friend of Turlough O’Carolan; and he has been described as “the greatest of the northern Gaelic Poets.” More Irish Families by Edward MacLysaght, 1960, p.69 Mc Court households in each county in the Primary Valuation property survey of 1847–64: *Antrim 28 *Armagh 61 *Belfast city 14 *Cavan 1 *Derry 5 *Down 49 *Dublin 5 *Dublin city 5 *Fermanagh 32 *Galway 1 *Louth 37 *Meath 3 *Monaghan 20 *Roscommon 2 *Tyrone 106 *Waterford 1 *Wicklow 2 In 1565, along with Roger MacCongall, a priest called Conacius McCourt was flogged to death in Armagh for refusing to acknowledge the Queen's supremacy.

In 2005, Sonoma County acquired the entirety of the lake and virtually its whole drainage basin from the Cardoza family for the sum of $18 million; the County's intention is to utilize the property as Tolay Lake Regional Park for ecological and archaeological preservation, as well as public use and enjoyment.Sonoma County Agricultural and Open Space Agency: Acquisition of Tolay Lake Ranch Tolay Lake and its immediate drainage area is home to several nesting pairs of golden eagles, Aquila chrysaetos,Christine Sculati, News From the Conservation Community and the Natural World, Bay Nature, January-March, 2005 and a number of rare, threatened or endangered species including the California red-legged frog, Rana draytonii; Western pond turtle, Actinemys marmorata; and Western burrowing owl, Athene cunicularia. Tolay Lake was initially altered about 1850 by European settlers who dynamited a natural earth dam on the lake's south side, in order to enable more intensive agricultural cultivation and grazing of the basin; at times thereafter, the lake typically became almost dry in the summer months, when rainfall in this region is at its seasonal nadir. Another modern alteration is the construction of an east-west earthen causeway that effectively bisects the lake, impeding thorough water circulation and fragmenting plant and animal colonies of the lake. History Drystone bridge circa 1900 over Cardoza Creek in the Tolay Lake watershed. Dating to at least 4,000 years, habitation of the original Tolay Lake perimeter occurred on a seasonal basis by the Coast Miwok, Pomo and other native Californians. It is known that this has been a regional gathering place for diverse tribes, probably associated with the beliefs that healing powers were derived from this lake. One of the main bases for this knowledge is the discovery of many prehistoric charmstones and numerous arrowheads in the lake bed.Tolay Lake Park: Natural and Cultural History Evidence suggests that these stones were brought from distant parts of California and as far away as Mexico for a ritual in which the native threw the stone into Tolay Lake, with the belief that this act rid the thrower of affliction or disease or would invoke enhanced crop yields. Some of these artifacts are situated in a small museum on site, and a number of them are within the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Museum. These archaeological findings received such widespread attention that the lake was at one time alternatively known as Charmstone Lake. Greg Sarris, chairman of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria of Coast Miwok or Pomo descent said: \\"The lake and surrounding area was highly sacred and was considered one of three areas in all of northern California where Indian nomads from different tribes convened for sacred ceremonies and the exchange of ritual objects and songs for the purpose of healing.\\"County of Sonoma Regional Parks Department: Tolay Lake Regional Park, August 20, 2007. He also said the 1000 charmstones discovered there, to date are: \\"the most significant discovery of cultural material for my people, but no doubt for all native people in California.\\" José Altimíra, founder of Mission San Francisco Solano described the lake in 1823, \\"We found on said hillock, a little further on, the large lake of Tolay--named after the chief of the Indian nomadic tribals \\"(Mr.Hukalaka Tolay), who in former times settled there. Its width at some parts is, with little difference, one hundred and fifty varas (), at others two hundred varas (), and at one point one- fourth of a league, which is also its length.\\" In the mid-nineteenth century European settlers began to develop the Tolay Basin agriculturally along with the Sonoma Valley and Petaluma River Basin. Initially the Europeans compromised the natural earthen dam that impeded outflow at the southern end of the lake, primarily by dynamite. This hydrologic change reduced the lake size by approximately 50 percent and enabled more intensive grazing as well as growing of crops. The Tolay Lake basin's agricultural use expanded until about 1940 when the Cardoza family purchased the 1737 acre (7.03 km²) holding and called it the Cardoza Ranch. The Cardozas made further improvements to the ranch containing Tolay Lake and retained ownership until 2005. During the Cardoza tenure, numerous road and fence additions were made as well as well crafted dry stone bridge and wall structures; these changes were introduced to facilitate the cattle grazing, pumpkin farming and other farming uses. In 2005 the Board of Supervisors of Sonoma County entered into an option purchase agreement of the entire property for somewhat below the appraised land value. The Cardozas retain ownership to the considerable collection of charmstones found prior to the date of this contract. Subsequently the County exercised its option and as of 2007 has active planning underway to place this holding into the county's park system. On September 20, 2006, Sonoma County found that the conversion to a public park may have a significant impact on the environment and thus a full Environmental Impact Report must be prepared.Environmental Impact Report: Summary of major California environmental determinations for 2006 As of February, 2007 public access is on a limited ranger-guided appointment basis only. Hydrology One of the anthropogenic ponds within the Tolay Lake Basin. The Tolay Lake basin is a bowl shaped structure confined by two north-south running ridges of the southern Sonoma Mountains. Tolay Lake is fed by 18 separate springs distributed around the perimeter of the lake, some of which develop into intermittent streams. The largest such stream known as Cardoza Creek feeds Tolay Lake from the southeast. The winter maximum lake depth varies typically between four and eight feet (1 and 2 m) deep depending upon that season's rainfall. Tolay Lake functions more as a large freshwater marshTolay Lake Regional Park Property Conditions Report, Circuit Rider Productions, July 2006 based upon extensive aquatic vegetation and shallow depths. The lake surface level is at an altitude of approximately 150 feet (46 m) above mean sea level, while the highest point in the watershed is on Cougar Mountain on the eastern ridge, which attains an elevation of about 800 feet (240 m). At the southern end of the lake Tolay Creek provides a virtually perennial outlet; Tolay Creek thence flows in a southerly course to discharge into the Napa Sonoma Marsh adjoining San Pablo Bay, the northern arm of San Francisco Bay. There are several ponds within the Tolay Lake Basin, including two large artificial ponds clearly separate from the lake; these ponds serve as watering sources for cattle and are also habitat to some of the native species of amphibians and reptiles associated with Tolay Lake. Another modern alteration is the construction of an east-west earthen causeway that effectively bisects the lake, impeding thorough water circulation and fragmenting plant and animal colonies of the lake. Annual rainfall in the Tolay Lake Basin is approximately 29 inches (740 mm). Architectural/cultural Cardoza Ranch buildings on south side of Tolay Lake. Present in the Tolay Lake Basin are a number of well-preserved architectural features, most notably a set of ranch buildings, many of which date from the first half of the twentieth century. Most of these structures were erected by the Cardoza family as integral elements of a working ranch. They represent an opportunity for preservation not only of an architectural style from this earlier era, but also as a complete collection of the building types involved in a broad function Sonoma County ranch, not dissimilar in function to its nineteenth-century predecessor. The county is analyzing alternative uses of some of the structures that not only offer preservation, but integration into the educational themes that are to embody the future Tolay Ranch Regional Park. The county is also actively consulting with representatives of Native American groups that are descendants of early tribes who used the site. These discussions are for the purpose of portraying the lives of prehistoric inhabitants in a faithful and sympathetic manner, and examining opportunities for cultural education. For example, this project offers an opportunity for the Native American community to cultivate and restore large tracts of purple needle grass, California's official state grass. This grass is the preferred material utilized by the California Indian basket weavers for teaching children the art of basket weaving. Flora and fauna oak woodland pockets where golden eagles nest, with cows grazing in foreground. Considerable biodiversity is found in Tolay Lake and the surrounding hills of the Sonoma Mountains;Madrone Audubon Society, Sonoma County, October2004 historical habitats include the lacustrine or marsh environment; grasslands and California oak woodland on higher elevations especially in the steep upland ravine areas. The lake itself has a diverse flora and fauna, including several threatened and endangered species including the California red-legged frog, Rana draytonii and western pond turtle, Actinemys marmorata. Because of the numerous natural fresh water seeps, wildlife is abundant in the Tolay watershed, including the upland areas. The valley harbors several significant species, including the burrowing owl, Athene cunicularia; golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos; white-tailed kite, Elanus leucurus; California horned lark, Eremophila alpestris; and the endangered tricolored blackbird, Agelaius tricolor. Tolay Lake is also one of only two known locations in the Bay Area that produce a special \\"moist prairie grass\\". Habitat restoration Looking across upper Tolay Lake from atop the earthen causeway, showing introduction of unnatural channelization from culvert placed into the causeway. One of Sonoma County's primary purposes in acquiring the Tolay Lake watershed is the ecological restoration of this area to its pre- European settlement condition. In that earlier era the lake would have been double its present size and native marshes, grasslands and even some upland forested areas would have been in greater evidence, prior to the destructive force of cattle grazing and other intensive agricultural practices. Sonoma County is accepting public comment as of February, 2007 to understand the views of scientists and the general public regarding the outcome restoration strategy and how that is balanced with some form of public access. For the lake itself, there is the prospect of greater size, depth and increased water circulation; additionally there is the potential of re-integration of the two lake segments, which are presently divided by the man-made earthen causeway. Breaching of this causeway would mitigate the effects of fragmented floral and faunal colonies and associated pressures of local colony extinction. Tolay Lake restoration fits into a regional mosaic of open space, conservation easements and wildlife areas in the process of being enhanced. These efforts all link to the wetlands and uplands adjoining the San Pablo Bay marshes, which areas are known to comprise one half of all the wetlands capable of restoration in the entirety of San Francisco Bay. Ongoing vicinity acquisition efforts further expand the regional landscape of baylands restoration: Petaluma Marsh properties, Dickson Ranch, the New North Point former casino site, and Skaggs Island. According to a non-profit environmental organization, Friends of Tolay Lake Park: The Tolay land acquisition is magnified by \\"this integrated effort to regain some of the connections and integrity of the area’s natural systems; together, their restoration will greatly improve the chances of survival for endangered marsh and upland species and will contribute to the overall health of San Francisco Bay\\". One drawback to the site ecological restoration is the presence of a major noise generator, Infineon Raceway, immediately to the southeast; the potential effects of raceway noise upon the future desired wildlife enhancement has not been thoroughly investigated. Scientists know from studies in other areas that some animal species are sensitive to man-made noise and may limit their use of certain locales heavily impacted by noise.Charles S.

Lennon. The film is about the effect of AIDS on orphans in Yingzhou District of Fuyang, Anhui, China. It won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). The film documents the plight of young orphans in Anhui whose parents have died after contracting AIDS as a result of infection while donating blood to earn income, and who sometimes do not receive care in their village since many people in the villages are terrified that they may be infected as a result of contact with the children. Background In June 1985, the first case of AIDS was reported in China. At first, the disease was largely considered a disease of foreigners since most of the people diagnosed from 1985 to 1988 were either foreigners or Chinese people who had recently been overseas. The Chinese government took quick action by immediately banning all import of blood products. However, this action did not have the desired effect since AIDS continued to spread throughout China. From 1988 to 1993 most of those being diagnosed were intravenous drug users, and it was also common for new cases to be in the Yunnan among sex workers, people seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and Chinese people who had been employed abroad.\\"HIV AND AIDS IN CHINA\\". Avert. Retrieved 14 Dec. 2018. Unfortunately, by 1998 AIDS had spread beyond coastal cities and Yunnan to all the regions of China. =AIDS in the Henan Province= In the 1950s, the Chinese government established a blood donation system in the Henan Province. This system helped the government since it allowed the government to create revenue for rural health care, and in the 1990s the system helped them deal with a financial shortfall by encouraging villagers to sell blood and plasma for profit.\\"Whistle-Blowing AIDS Doctor Reflects on Roots of Epidemic in China\\". The New York Times, 1 Dec. 2016. This was a very attractive deal to the villagers since they did not believe the blood-selling process to be dangerous or exhausting, so it seemed like easy money that these poverty-ridden Chinese people could not let pass by. This also seemed like easy money to the government since it had to spend close to nothing on infrastructure and labor. The stated purpose of the Henan government was to establish a ‘blood economy’ in order to ‘shake off poverty and attain prosperity’ and ‘make people rich and the nation strong.’ Nevertheless, this seemingly perfect deal soon began to show its down side. Greed took over and caused the desire for profits from blood products to be regarded as more important than safe blood and plasma donation practices. One of the most common unsafe practices included allowing the villagers to donate plasma multiple times in a day to attempt to maximize their profits even though it is recommended that people donate plasma once every two weeks at most. Another extremely common unsafe practice at the blood donation centers was the pooling of blood donated by all individuals in order to extract the plasma before injecting the pooled blood back into the donor. Moreover, these stations did not stress the importance of sterilizing materials used in the process of blood donation. These unsafe practices caused the risk of contracting AIDS to increase dramatically among those who made blood donation a common practice.\\"The Village that AIDS Tore Apart\\". Sixth Tone. Retrieved 14 Dec. 2018. On January 1995, healthcare workers identified the first cases of AIDS in the Henan region and rapidly linked the development to the increase in blood-selling practices. However, the Henan government refused to accept this fact, and they asserted that there was no AIDS in their province. Unrecognized, the disease continued to spread among the people of the Henan Province until, in 2000, there were so many cases reported that the government could no longer hide the presence of AIDS in the province. It is estimated that by that time 500,000 to 700,000 people in the region had contracted AIDS because of the unsafe practices of the ‘blood economy.’ Cinematographic response to AIDS epidemic The Blood of Yingzhou District was released in 2006 and directed by Ruby Yang, a Hong Kong director. Through this documentary, Yang intended to communicate to the rest of China and the international community the struggle of orphans in the Anhui Province who had lost all support simply because their parents had been diagnosed with AIDS. Yang also released a documentary later on called The Blood of Yingzhou District Revisited which showcased the lives of the same children in The Blood of Yingzhou District some years later and allowed people to see their development and how growing understanding of AIDS helped improve their lives over the years. Additional cinematographic responses include Love For Life,\\"Love For Life\\" Wikipedia. Retrieved 14 Dec. 2018. a movie released in 2011 directed by Gu Changwei. A documentary that goes along with this movie as a sort of behind the scenes look into the life of the actors in the movie who are carriers of AIDS was also filmed; the name of this documentary is Together, and it was directed by Zhao Liang (director) and released in 2012. Reception This documentary follows the daily lives of various orphans from the Anhui Province who lost their parents to AIDS. The storyline is very powerful and striking because these young kids have been mostly abandoned by their relatives and the village as a whole.\\"Exploitation and The Blood of Yingzhou District\\". Danwei, 3 March 2007. The documentary showcases the lonely lives these children have been living since the death of their parents simply because of a stigma against AIDS. These children are rejected and marginalized even though they themselves do not have the disease because of the ignorance of those around them. The documentary does a great job of communicating the importance of awareness because it is demonstrated that the children's parents contracted the disease because of a lack of education on how to prevent the disease from spreading, and the children are shown to have fell victim to ignorance as well because if the village or their relatives had been better educated, they would have received more much needed help earlier on. Thankfully, towards the end of the documentary and improvement in these children's lives is seen as they become part of a new family and are taken under the wing of a developing organization that aims to help victims of AIDS. =Impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS= The moving images of the children from the Anhui Province who had been affected by the spread of AIDS, has inspired several charities and non-governmental organizations to step in.\\"Opportunities, Goals and Strategies of Chinese NGOs Working on HIV/AIDS\\". Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Retrieved 14 Dec. 2018. In many cases, such organizations have aided in the spread of awareness about the nature of the ways in which HIV/AIDS is spread and how people should approach and treat the disease as well as those who have it. In addition, such organizations have helped provide opportunities to marginalized victims of AIDS by creating educational programs and by helping them find job opportunities. These efforts have improved the lives of victims of AIDS since possessing this misunderstood disease prevented them from being accepted among peers at school or by potential employers. Yang allows the public to have an inside look into the effects of the organizations' activism in The Blood of Yingzhou District Revisited. The results are promising, but there is still much work to be done to prevent further spread of the disease and to ensure victims can lead normal lives.

Early life and education Born in Horatio, Arkansas, Esther McCoy was raised in Kansas. She attended the Central College for Women, a preparatory school in Lexington, Missouri, prior to a college career which took her from Baker University, to the University of Arkansas, then to Washington University, and finally the University of Michigan. She left the University of Michigan in 1925, and by 1926 was living in New York City and embarking on a writing career. California and later life In 1932 McCoy was diagnosed with pneumonia and headed West for Los Angeles to recover. She purchased in a bungalow in the Ocean Park section of Santa Monica in the late 1930s, where she lived for the remainder of her life, although she traveled widely. During World War II, McCoy worked as a draftsman for R.M. Schindler after being discouraged from applying to USC's architecture school due to her age and sex. After a long and varied writing and teaching career, she died in December 1989. Fiction and journalism In 1929, McCoy began to publish fiction, her work appearing in noted magazines such as The New Yorker and Harper's Bazaar, as well as in University quarterlies. Her short story \\"The Cape\\" was featured in The Best American Short Stories of 1950. In 1924, McCoy had met author Theodore Dreiser, and for more than a decade she conducted research for him. She wrote novels, short stories and screenplays during her years in New York and after moving to Los Angeles. She continued to write fiction into the 1960s, though her first significant article on architecture had been published in 1945. McCoy and a friend, Allen Read, co-authored a series of detective novels under the pseudonym \\"Allan McRoyd.\\"Writing Home, Susan Morgan, East of Borneo, May 22, 2012. McCoy was also a journalist and active member of the Left who wrote for Direction, Upton Sinclair's EPIC [End Poverty in California] News, and the United Progressive News. Architectural writing From 1950 until her death in 1989, McCoy was a frequent contributor to John Entenza's Los Angeles-based magazine Arts & Architecture, to Architectural Forum, Architectural Record, and Progressive Architecture, as well as to European magazines such as L'Architectura and Lotus. She also wrote pieces on architecture for The Los Angeles Times and The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Her first major book, published in 1960, was Five California Architects, the first work to bring to the attention of a wide audience the works of pioneer California modernists Charles and Henry Greene, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck, and the Los Angeles-based Austrian emigre Rudolf Schindler. This book was followed by others devoted to the Case Study Houses sponsored by Arts & Architecture, Schindler's fellow emigre Richard Neutra, and architects Craig Ellwood, Calvin C. Straub, among others. During this era she also wrote catalogues for a number of gallery and museum exhibitions devoted to modern California architecture, and contributed essays to numerous other exhibition catalogues. She lectured at the University of Southern California and at UCLA, and transcribed and catalogued Richard Neutra's papers in the UCLA archives. In addition to her work in California, McCoy wrote extensively on Italian architecture, making several extended trips there during the 1950s and 1960s, and she was curator of an exhibition entitled Ten Italian Architects which was mounted by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In recognition of her research and writing on Italian architecture, the Italian government in 1960 awarded her the Star of the Order of Solidarity. McCoy's last work was an essay for the catalog of an exhibition on the Case Study Houses which was mounted by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. She died in Santa Monica in December, 1989, one month before the exhibition opened. Her extensive collection of papers, and her numerous slides and photographs, are held by the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution.

Intellectual contribution Warschauer's contributions fall in four areas: *technology and language learning, *technology and literacy, *the digital divide, and *laptops in education. Warschauer is among education researchers that recognize the potential of technologies, such as laptops, for fostering increased learning opportunities for second language learners. His several books on the topic, including Internet for English Teaching, Virtual Connections, Telecollaboration in Foreign Language Learning, and Network-Based Language Teaching, attracted the attention of second and foreign language teachers and researchers around the world. In these books, Warschauer critiqued previous views of computer-assisted language learning, which often emphasized tutorials of grammar and vocabulary, and instead articulated a vision of global citizenship and agency through online communication and research. Warschauer expanded this vision with his book Electronic Literacy: Language, Culture, and Power in Online Education. This book focused on two themes that became prominent in his career: the particular skills and competency involved in becoming literate in the digital age, and the impact of this digital literacy on overcoming the marginalization of culturally and linguistically diverse learners. Warschauer's book Technology and Social Inclusion: Rethinking the Digital Divide, and his numerous articles on the same topic, including one in Scientific American, critiqued the traditional view of the digital divide as focused narrowly on hardware and software, and instead illustrated how social relations, human capital, culture and language were all critical for shaping people's access to and use of new information and communication technologies. The book was based on Warschauer's research on technology, education, and social development projects in Egypt, Brazil, China, India, and the U.S. In this book, Warschauer explains three models of information and communications technology (ICT) and the digital divide: devices, conduits, and literacy. While approaching ICT access in terms of access to devices and conduits might be the simplest way to understand the digital divide, these models of access neglect the technological aptitude necessary to effectively utilize ICTs. Instead, he argues for the third model of access, literacy, as the superior model. Warschauer's most recent area of research focuses on laptop computers in education. His book, Laptops and Literacy: Learning in the Wireless Classroom analyzes how students learn to read, write, think, conduct research, and produce media in the laptop classroom. Though mostly a positive account, it includes enough negative examples to illustrate a point central to all of Warschauer's work, that of technology as intellectual and social amplifier. In this case, laptops were demonstrated to help good schools become better, but only exacerbated problems in troubled schools. Background Warschauer served as a faculty researcher and doctoral candidate at the University of Hawaii, where he published several of his early books and also organized two seminal international symposia on technology and language learning. While at the University of Hawaii, Warschauer also founded and edited Language Learning & Technology, one of the first peer-reviewed academic journals published on the World Wide Web. Following Hawaii, Warschauer took a position as director of educational technology on a large language education US aid project in Egypt. Warschauer's work in Egypt, which he wrote about extensively, also served as a basis for his publications on the digital divide. Since 2001, Warschauer has been a professor in the Department of Education and the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, where he also contributes to the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations and the Ada Byron Research Center for Diversity in Computing and Information Technology. Warschauer is the founding director of the PhD in Education program at UC Irvine, one of the few graduate programs in the U.S. that includes a specialization in Language, Literacy, and Technology. Recognition Warschauer was the recipient in 1998 of the Educational Testing Service/TOEFL Policy Council Award for outstanding international contribution in the field of technology and language learning.Awards Presented at TESOL His books have been translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese and have been critically acclaimed in fields as diverse as education, media studies, cultural studies, communication, sociology, and information studies.

Pre-war aikido In the pre-war period, aikido was still in formation and had not yet established itself as a separate art from that of Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu. However, it was fast attaining an identity of its own. In 1942, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, in its efforts to standardize Japanese martial arts, came to an agreement with representatives of Ueshiba's school that the name aikido would be used to refer to the jujitsu derived art form Ueshiba had brought to prominence. Post-war aikido (first 40 years) In the post war period, the Aikikai Foundation led by the Ueshiba family has become the most successful organisation in terms of growth in numbers and prominence in the public eye. However, it was not the first to bring aikido to prominence in Japan in the immediate post-war period. Immediately after the war, due to the ban on martial arts imposed by occupying US forces, aikido was not being taught in Tokyo. A number of students including Koichi Tohei and Gozo Shioda took it upon themselves to become active in disseminating aikido. Some years later, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, the Founder's son began to actively revive the Aikikai Headquarters in Tokyo. From the post-war period until the 1980s, numerous aikido organizations evolved in parallel to the main branch led by the Ueshiba family. The earliest independent styles to emerge were * Yoshinkan aikido founded by Gozo Shioda in 1955, *Yoseikan aikido, begun by Minoru Mochizuki in 1931, and *Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967. *Shin'ei Taidō (親英体道) is a style closely related to aikido, founded in 1956 by Noriaki Inoue (井上 鑑昭 Inoue Noriaki, 1902-1994), a nephew and pre-war student of Morihei Ueshiba. The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan aikido, did cause some controversy as it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido. After Ueshiba's death, more senior students branched out on their own to establish independent schools. * Iwama Ryu - This style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Japan, and the teaching methodology of long term student Morihiro Saito. It is unofficially referred to as the \\"Iwama style\\". Saito's students have split into two groups; one remaining with the Aikikai and the other forming the independent organization in 2004 around Saito's son Hitohiro Saito (斎藤 仁弘 Saitō Hitohiro, born 1957). * Ki Society - Another event that caused significant controversy was the departure of the Aikikai Honbu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba (植芝 吉祥丸 Ueshiba Kisshōmaru, 1921-1999), who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu aikido, and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society.

Unrelated arts using the term \\"aikido\\" The above styles can trace their lineage through senior students back to the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba. Two other prominent martial arts use the name aikido but are not directly related. They are Korindo aikido founded by Minoru Hirai (平井 稔 Hirai Minoru, 1903-1998) and Nihon Goshin aikido (日本護身合気道 Nihon Goshin Aikidō) founded by Shodo Morita 書道森田 (Morita Shodo, fl. c. 1930s-1962). These schools, with some historical justification, suggest that the name aikido is not the exclusive domain of arts derived from the teachings of Morihei Ueshiba.

TRPC channels form the subfamily of channels in humans most closely related to drosophila TRP channels. Structurally, members of this family possess a number of similar characteristics, including 3 or 4 ankyrin repeats near the N-terminus and a TRP box motif containing the invariant EWKFAR sequence at the proximal C-terminus. These channels are non-selectively permeable to cations, with a prevalence of calcium over sodium variable among the different members. Many of TRPC channel subunits are able to coassemble. The predominant TRPC channels in the mammalian brain are the TRPC 1,4 and 5 and they are densely expressed in corticolimbic brain regions, like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and lateral septum. These 3 channels are activated by the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine. In general, TRPC channels can be activated by phospholipase C stimulation, with some members also activated by diacylglycerol. There is at least one report that TRPC1 is also activated by stretching of the membrane and TRPC5 channels are activated by extracellular reduced thioredoxin. It has long been proposed that TRPC channels underlie the calcium release activated channels observed in many cell types. These channels open due to the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Two other proteins, stromal interaction molecules (STIMs) and Orais, however, have more recently been implicated in this process. STIM1 and TRPC1 can coassemble, complicating the understanding of this phenomenon. TRPC6 has been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease. Role in cardiomyopathies Research on the role of TRPC channels in cardiomyopathies is still in progress. An upregulation of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 genes are seen in heart disease states including fibroblast formation and cardiovascular disease. The TRPC channels are suspected of responding to an overload of hormonal and mechanical stimulation in cardiovascular disease, contributing to pathological remodelling of the heart. TRPC1 channels are activated by receptors coupled to phospholipase C (PLC), mechanical stimulation, and depletion of intracellular calcium stores. TRPC1 channels are found on cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Upon stimulation of these channels in cardiovascular disease, there is an increase in hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. TRPC1 channels mediate smooth muscle proliferation in the presence of pathological stimuli which contributes to hypertension. Mice with myocardial hypertrophy exhibit increased expression of TRPC1. The deletion of the TRPC1 gene in these mice resulted in reduced hypertrophy upon stimulation with hypertrophic stimuli, inferring that TRPC1 has a role in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels are activated by PLC stimulation and diacylglycerol (DAG) production. Both these TRPC channel types play a role in cardiac hypertrophy and vascular disease like TRPC1. In addition, TRPC3 is upregulated in the atria of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). TRPC3 regulates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy which contributes to the formation of fibroblasts. Accumulation of fibroblasts in the heart can manifest into AF. Experiments blocking TRPC3 show a decrease in fibroblast formation and reduced AF susceptibility. TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 channels are all involved in cardiac hypertrophy. The mechanism of how TRPC channels promote cardiac hypertrophy is through activation of the calcineurin pathway and the downstream transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). Pathological stress or hypertrophic agonists will trigger G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and activates PLC to form DAG and inositol triphosphate (IP3). IP3 promotes the release of internal calcium stores and the influx of calcium via TRPC. When intracellular calcium reaches a threshold, it will activate the calcineurin /NFAT pathway. DAG activates the calcineurin/NFAT pathway directly. NFAT translocate into the nucleus and induce gene transcription of more TRPC genes. This creates a positive feedback loop, leading to a state of hypertrophic gene expression and thus, cardiac growth and remodelling of the heart. TRPC channel's involvement in well studied signaling pathways and significance in gene impact on human diseases make it a potential target for drug therapy. TRPC has been shown to potentiate inhibition in the olfactory bulb circuit, providing a mechanism for improving olfactory abilities.

Functional TRPM channels are believed to form tetramers. The TRPM family consists of eight different channels, TRPM1–TRPM8. Unlike the TRPC and TRPV sub-families, TRPM subunits do not contain N-terminal ankyrin repeat motifs but, rather, contain entire functional proteins in their C-termini. TRPM6 and TRPM7, for example, contain functional α-kinase segments, which are a type of serine/threonine-specific protein kinase.

He is a leading name associated with the English Romantic style of paintings of groups of flowers on porcelain that is sometimes called \\"naturalistic\\" by older sources,Honey, 12 although that may not seem its main characteristic today. He trained in his home town of Derby, and though his work certainly reached the London market, all his many movements never took him further than the Midlands and South Wales, by then the heart of the British porcelain-making industry, although wares were often sent to London to be painted. His porcelain body was made by him at Pinxton and later at the Nantgarw Pottery, which he founded in 1813 with his son-in- law. He had spent over twenty years at Derby porcelain, a period after 1808 at Worcester porcelain, and ended his career at Coalport porcelain. Biography Billingsley was born in Derby in 1758. He was apprenticed at William Duesbury's Royal Crown Derby porcelain works for five years on 26 September 1774. He finally left them in 1796, by which time he was their outstanding painter of flowers, the mainstay of decoration.Honey, 164 Billingsley developed a distinctive style of flower painting, which involved using a loaded brush and then removing the colour using a dry brush. He was particularly associated with borders of roses with the prime example of the Prentice Plate. This plate was used in the Derby factories to show trainees the standard that was expected. The name of The Prentice Plate is a shortening of Apprentice Plate.Signage in Derby Museum, June 2011 Plate, c. 1820 Billingsley decided to leave Derby in 1795 despite protestations to the owner from Joseph Lygo, their London agent, that he was too valuable to lose, and would carry his style to other factories: \\"his going into another factory will put them into the way of doing flowers in the same way, which they are at present ignorant of\\".Honey, 164 After staying for 22 years at Derby, he was highly mobile for the remainder of his career. He appears to have moved constantly and worked at a number of different potteries. Pinxton Cream Jug, about 1800 First he went to Pinxton, a small village in Derbyshire in October 1795 and superintended the erection of the Pinxton manufactory, with John Coke. He had become interested in improving the formula for soft-paste porcelain, apparently with the intention of exceeding the Sèvres soft-paste in beauty. In this he was swimming against the tide of the period; Spode's improved formula for bone china was taking over most English production, and Sèvres, at this point making both soft and hard-paste porcelain, was to drop the former by 1806.Battie, 141-142; Honey, 309-313 He stayed at Pinxton until 1799; The factory itself continued until Lady Day 1813, possibly only decorating \\"blanks\\" made elsewhere.Battie, 141 It was by then under the direction of a local landscape decorator, John Cutts who later obtained employment as a decorator at the Wedgwood factory.Honey, 312 Its products are scarce and well sought after commanding good prices. Billingsley's further moves took him to Mansfield, operating only a painting workshop, and about 1802 or 1803 to Torksey, Lincolnshire, where it has been claimed he made porcelain, as also at the neighbouring village of Brampton. It is thought he first came into contact with the potter Samuel Walker there, who later married Billingsley's daughter Sarah in 1812, when the group moved to Worcester porcelain. Another supposed pottery he started, between 1804 and 1808, was at Wirksworth in Derbyshire.Honey, 309 Before settling at Worcester, Billingsley approached a number of potteries in search of employment, including the Cambrian Pottery, Swansea, Glamorganshire in 1807. Plate perhaps painted at William Billingsley's decorative workshop in Mansfield Billingsley started at Royal Worcester in 1808 where he was instrumental in the firm's refinements of its porcelain recipe. While at Royal Worcester under Flight, Barr & Barr, Billingsley signed a contract preventing him from disclosing porcelain recipes, however no clause prohibited him from producing porcelain himself. In 1813 Billingsley took his porcelain recipes and lifetime's experience in the industry, along with his daughters Lavinia, and son-in-law Samuel Walker to Nantgarw, Glamorganshire, Wales, where he established the Nantgarw Pottery. Nantgarw Pottery was established in November 1813, when Billingsley & Walker leased \\"Nantgarw House\\" on the eastern side of the Glamorganshire Canal, eight miles north of Cardiff in the Taff Valley, Glamorganshire, and set about building the kilns and ancillary equipment, in its grounds, necessary to transform the building into a small porcelain pottery. Billingsley and Walker had brought with them a total of £250 to invest in their project and by January 1814, the Quaker entrepreneur William Weston Young had already become the major share-holder in their venture. It is assumed Young was acquainted with Billingsley through a mutual friend, and fellow earthenware decorator Thomas Pardoe, whom Billingsley had approached at Swansea's Cambrian Pottery, while seeking employment in 1807. Young's work across Glamorganshire as a surveyor may have put him in the position to advise Billingsley, while still at Royal Worcester, of the suitability of the site at Nantgarw. The pottery was set up, but something of Billingsley & Walker's understanding of the recipe or manufacturing process was amiss, as 90% of the porcelain was ruined in the firing. The resources of the three associates soon ran out, and the group approached the Committee of Trade and Plantations asking for a grant of £500, referring to the subsidy the French Government had given the famous Sèvres Porcelain Factory. They were not successful, but one member of the committee, a porcelain enthusiast; Sir Joseph Banks, suggested to his friend and ceramicist Lewis Weston Dillwyn of the Cambrian Pottery of Swansea, should make an inspection. Dillwyn made the inspection, and saw the extent of the firm's losses, but was so impressed with the quality of the surviving pieces that he offered Billingsley and Walker use of the Cambrian Pottery to improve their recipe and process. An annex was built for porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery, where Walker and Billingsley were based from late 1814. The recipe was modified and improved, but was still wasteful enough for Dillwyn to abandon the project and in 1817, Billingsley, his younger daughter Lavinia and Samuel Walker returned to Nantgarw; Sarah, Billingsley's older daughter, Walkers wife, had died in January of that year, sadly, Lavinia also died in September of this year at Nantgarw. Young reinvested in the pottery at Nantgarw, additionally becoming an art teacher at Cowbridge Free School to help raise the funds. Billingsley and Walker continued to fire their porcelain at a loss however until one day in April 1820, while Young was away in Bristol, Billingsley (know locally a Mr Beeley) and Walker absconded to Coalport porcelain leaving behind them the lease to the pottery and several thousand pieces of undecorated porcelain in various stages of production. Billingsley worked for the Coalport Porcelain Works until his death in 1828. Walker was also employed at the Coalport pottery but later emigrated to America where he established the Temperance Hill Pottery in West Troy, New York. Billingsley's porcelain pieces are one of the main components of the porcelain collection at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. The Nantgarw pottery has, through the efforts of the \\"Friends of Nantgarw\\", established in 1993, been saved for posterity and is now open as a museum with a growing display of porcelain. Although in its early experimental stages, Nantgarw pottery has recently achieved one of its original goals of successfully reproducing porcelain items using Billingsley's soft paste porcelain recipe and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future of the museum.

He served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1971. Commissioner Thrower in 1970 Early life and education Thrower was born in Tampa, Florida. He graduated from Georgia Military Academy in 1930. He received an undergraduate degree from Emory University in 1934 and received his law degree from the Emory University School of Law in 1936. Career Following graduation from law school he joined the firm of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP, a law firm with principal offices in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. He became a partner and remained one until his death. Many of his early cases involved handling appeals for death row inmates in Georgia prisons. According to the New York Times, Thrower was haunted for the rest of his life by the case of his client Will Coxson, a black teenager who had been convicted for rape. Thrower was convinced he was innocent. Thrower had just joined the United States Marines, so he let another lawyer take over the appeal, believing that Coxson would surely be acquitted by the Supreme Court of Georgia. However, Coxson was put to death while Thrower was serving in World War II. In 1942 he joined the FBI, then became a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, being deployed to the Philippines and Okinawa during World War II. Thrower, running as a Republican, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent segregationist James C. Davis for a seat in Congress in 1956.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867171,00.html \\"New Faces of 1956,\\"] Time, October 29, 1956. He served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1971. During his tenure he revoked the tax-exempt status of private schools that excluded blacks. He also helped to draft the Tax Reform Act of 1969. However, he was alarmed by requests from the White House for the IRS to perform tax audits on Nixon's enemies. In 1971 he requested a meeting with Nixon, believing that the president would be horrified to learn that some of his aides were attempting to use the IRS for political purposes. Instead of a meeting with Nixon, he got a phone call from John D. Ehrlichman telling him that he was fired. He accepted the White House announcement that he had \\"resigned for personal reasons\\" and quietly returned to the Atlanta law firm. A few years later he visited the IRS headquarters on business, where he was spontaneously greeted by employees as a hero. From 1980 to 1992 he was chairman of the City of Atlanta's Board of Ethics. Recognition In 1993, Thrower received the American Bar Association Medal, the ABA's highest honor, for his public, professional, and government service. He was the recipient in 1995 of the Court of Federal Claims Special Service Award and received the Tax Section's Distinguished Service Award for 1996. In 1992 he received the Leadership Award of the Atlanta Bar Association and more recently the Segal-Tweed Founders Award of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Thrower was presented with the \\"American Inns of Court Professionalism Award for the Eleventh Circuit\\" in May 2003. Personal life He was married for 70 years to Margaret Logan Munroe, whom he met at Emory. They lived in Atlanta and had five children. He turned 100 in September 2013 and died in March 2014 at his home in Atlanta.

It was designed to simplify tedious, difficult to maintain or error prone aspects of integration/B2B activities.WebMethods Business Integration – Detailed Features The Software AG Designer is the IDE in which to write flow code. History webMethods developed flow as a technology to increase the ease and speed of development on their B2B/enterprise integration platform. A language that would be a suitable fit with the desire for a service-based application server was another driving force. Philosophy The main driver behind flow syntax was to allow the graphical configuration of the mapping logic that forms the major part of Integration projects. Transformation and conversion of data in a text based programming language quickly becomes unwieldy and cluttered. It is also quite difficult to maintain due to the cumbersome nature. Flow code seeks to alleviate this problem by creating a programming language similar to the way you would indicate mapping of data if your source and destination data formats were placed side by side on a white board and lines connecting source to destination. The other goal of flow was to allow a service based view of the application. Any existing code is a service. Invoking functionality is akin to treating it as a \\"black box\\" requiring certain inputs (which are mapped from your available variables). The results of that operation are then treated as outputs of the \\"black box\\". The concept of the \\"pipeline\\" is the means by which to pass data to and get results back from invocation of services.explanation of the webMethods pipeline Syntax There are the following operators in the flow language:Nathan's Intro to webMethods Flow * Map * Invoke * Branch * Loop * Repeat * Exit * Sequence The operators are stored on disk as XML but this is not generally edited directly, rather the IDE (webMethods Developer) is used.Vishal KHAPRE on webmethods file structure Advantages * Mapping logic is easily performed and fairly natural to understand (by a range of technical abilities from Developer to business analyst). * Allows ease of reuse of existing services via a service based view of code * Allows rapid prototyping * Natural fit to the SOA model of software architecture * Automatic exposure of all services (Java and Flow) as Web Services and use of Web Services as \\"services\\" to be invoked Criticisms * Incorrectly used flow can produce some ugly code due to too much in the way of mapping in a single Map operation. * It is a proprietary language and as such there is little support or reference material available outside webMethods and a few isolated user created pages. * Source code is stored as XML, making it rather difficult to use traditional editors, source control and merge tools. * The graphical nature of the language may give the impression that non- technical staff are capable of writing good code in it. A solid technical background in other programming languages is of great advantage in producing good quality flow code. * Fairly heavily mouse driven compared to java/c++/c# etc. and can result in sore mouse arm while first developing in it * Only the webMethods platform has an implementation, so should a shift from that platform be desired a complete re-write of all flow code is required * Code refactorization is only partially supported by the tool and had to be done by hand * Due to specific approach of viewing and editing the Flow code, in complex implementation is very hard to find and understand existing code, because enforcing multiple mouse clicking at subsequent steps in Flow code to see parameters/details (HTML view might be little more helpful).

He is considered the founder of the field of avalanche research and forecasting in North America.  Early life  In 1904, Atwater was born in Baker City, Oregon.  Education  In 1926, Atwater earned an English Literature degree from Harvard College.  Career  Atwater worked a number of jobs including football coach, cattle rancher, and trapper. He lived in Montana in the 1930s and wrote short stories and mysteries, some under the pseudonym of Max Montgomery. During World War II, Atwater served in the 10th Mountain Division as a winter warfare instructor. Atwater reached the rank of captain while in active combat duty and being wounded. Atwater was discharged due to his injury. In autumn 1945, Atwater became a forest ranger for the Wasatch National Forest where he managed public safety in Little Cottonwood Canyon in Alta, Utah. Over the next two decades he established the first avalanche research center in the Western Hemisphere at Alta, inventing many of the techniques and much of the equipment needed for avalanche forecasting and control. In 1960, Atwater served as the Avalanche Control Chief during the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California. Atwater successfully preventing any major avalanches during the Games despite a history of huge chairlift-destroying avalanches there. In 1960s, with Frank Parsoneault, Atwater developed the Mark 10 Avalaunchers, a pneumatic cannon for launching avalanche control explosives. In 1964, Atwater retired from the Forest Service. In 1966, he repeated his masterful job of avalanche control at the alpine skiing World Championships in Portillo, Chile, where the ski area had been almost completely destroyed by massive avalanches only a year earlier but successfully held the Championships unscathed. He also served as a consultant to ski areas, mining companies, and telecommunication companies throughout the mountainous regions of North and South America. Atwater ran a small research lab in Squaw Valley. Personal life  In 1945, Atwater moved to Alta, Utah. Atwater had three sons, James E. Atwater, Robert and Montgomery. In 1976, Atwater died of a heart attack.  Awards  * 1973 Father of snow avalanche work in the United States.

An Act of Congress of 31 January 1862 authorized President Abraham Lincoln to seize control of the railroads and telegraph for military use in January 1862.Gable, Railroad Generalship, p. 13. In practice, however, the USMRR restricted its authority to Southern rail lines captured in the course of the war. As a separate organization for rail transportation the USMRR is one of the predecessors of the modern United States Army Transportation Corps. History Transportation on the Potomac. Cars loaded at Alexandria can be carried on barges or arks to Aquia Creek, and sent to stations where the Army of the Potomac is supplied, without break of bulk. Military railroad bridge across Potomac Creek, on the Fredericksburg Railroad The American Civil War was the first war where railroads were a significant factor in moving troops and supplying forces in the field. The United States Military Railroad organization was established to coordinate this new capability for the Union Army. The USMRR organization benefited from the appointment of experienced railroad men from the private sector. Thomas A. Scott, vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), served as an Assistant Secretary of War during the period 1861–1862. In January 1862 Scott prepared a report on military transportation that anticipated the creation of the USMRR.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.48 Daniel C. McCallum, former general superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad, was appointed as Military Director and Superintendent of U.S. Railroads.O.R. Series III, Vol. III (S# 124), p. 1126 Herman Haupt, former chief engineer of the PRR, was appointed as Chief of Construction and Transportation in the Virginia theater. The departments in the USMRR tended to operate autonomously, although micromanagement from the Secretary of War and overlapping authority between departments did affect their operations.Gable, Railroad Generalship, p. 14. Over time the USMRR would buy, build or capture 419 locomotives and 6,330 cars beyond the rolling stock that was requisitioned from the various Northern railroads. When Col. McCallum was first appointed the USMRR system consisted only of 7 miles of the Washington and Alexandria Railroad;Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.21 however, by war's end the USMRR exercised control over a network of more than 2,000 milesHodges Railroad Tactics, p.8 of military railroads and captured Southern rail lines. =Northern Virginia: 1862= Union soldiers survey wreckage on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad.

In the fall of 1863 the Confederate railroads, acting as interior lines of communication, transferred two divisions and an artillery battalion of Lieutenant General James Longstreet’s I Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, by railroad from Virginia to Georgia to reinforce General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Tennessee. The troops began arriving at the Catoosa Platform, Georgia on September 19,Turner, Victory Rode the Rails, p. 285 having begun their journey from Virginia on September 9.Turner, Victory Rode the Rails, p. 284 Ultimately, only 5 of Longstreet’s 10 infantry brigades arrived in time to participate in the Confederate victory at Chickamauga.Turner, Victory Rode the Rails, p. 286 Following their defeat, the troops of MG William Rosecrans’ Army of the Cumberland fell back to Chattanooga, Tennessee where they were surrounded by the Confederates who occupied the heights surrounding the town. On the evening of September 23, 1863, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton convened a meeting with President Lincoln, Major General Henry Halleck, Secretary of State William Seward and Treasury Secretary Salmon ChasePickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.4 to review plans to reinforce and relieve the Army of the Cumberland with troops from other Union departments. Major General William T. Sherman, with 4 divisions of the Army of the Tennessee, was already moving east from the vicinity of Vicksburg, Mississippi and expected to arrive in about 10 days. Stanton proposed that reinforcements be sent from the then idle Army of the Potomac, his initial recommendation was to move 30,000 troops in just 5 days to the vicinity of Bridgeport, Alabama.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.5 Much debate surrounded the proposal. Halleck opined that such a movement would require at least 40 days and even the President doubted that the troops could reach Washington in 5 days.Turner, Victory Rode the Rails, p. 289 Daniel McCallum of the USMRR was summoned to the meeting and given a basic outline of the plan. After making some quick calculations McCallum declared that the proposed operation could be completed within 7 days.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.6 The President ultimately gave the order to begin the transfer of troops from the Army of the Potomac to the west, starting the largest troop rail movement of the war. In 12 days the USMRR moved approximately 25,000 men over 1,200 miles overshadowing the Confederacy's earlier movement of 12,000 men over 800 miles in 12 days.Gable, Railroad Generalship, p.6 On September 24 the men summoned to plan the rail movement arrived in Washington to work out the details. Secretary Stanton telegraphed them asking for their assistance even before the President approved the plan: John W. Garrett, President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;); Thomas Scott of the PRR; S. M. Felton, President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad; William P. Smith, Master of Transportation for the B&O; and McCallum.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.45Weber, Northern Railroads, p.182 The men at the conference worked out the detailed route planning, a task complicated by the different gauges of railroad track in use at the time. The initial movement of troops from Virginia was allocated to the USMRR under McCallum's direction. Garrett and Smith would supervise the movement from Washington, D.C. to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and Scott would travel west to supervise the move from Louisville, Kentucky, to Bridgeport, Alabama.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.53 As finally settled, the movement involved 9 different railroads in order get the troops from Virginia to Bridgeport. The USMRR, operating on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad from Bealeton, Virginia to Washington, passed the movement off to the B&O; from Washington to Benwood, West Virginia.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.84 At Benwood, the troops crossed the Ohio River via a pontoon bridgePickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.97 and boarded Central Ohio Railroad trains to move from Bellaire, Ohio to Columbus. From Columbus, troops moved via the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, Little Miami Railroad, and the Indiana Central Railroad to reach Indianapolis, Indiana. From Indianapolis the route used the Jeffersonville Railroad to return to the Ohio River.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.101 The troops crossed the Ohio River to Louisville and boarded trains using the tracks of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to reach Nashville, Tennessee. From Nashville the final leg of the trip used the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad to deliver the troops to Bridgeport.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.120 While the railroad men planned the movement of reinforcements to the west, Halleck began issuing the orders that assigned actual units to the move. Major General Joseph Hooker, former commander of the Army of the Potomac, was assigned to command the eastern reinforcements. Major General George Meade, the commander of the Army of the Potomac, was directed to prepare the XI and XII Corps for movement beginning September 25. At the time the XII Corps’ two divisions were on picket duty along the Rappahannock River and had to be relieved by the I Corps before it could move to the railroad. The XI Corps’ remaining two divisions were deployed to the army's rear guarding the Orange and Alexandria railroad which simplified their preparations to move. Meade initially ordered the XII Corps to march to Brandy Station, but the corps was directed to march 10 miles further up the railroad to Bealeton where there were better arrangements for loading the trains.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.77 McCallum directed the XI Corps infantry to move to Manassas Junction, Virginia, to board trains, but had the corps’ artillery march to Alexandria, where the best facilities to load the guns were located.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.73 By the end of operations on September 25, 1863, 5,800 of the 7,500 soldiers in the XI Corps were on trains headed for Bridgeport. By the morning of September 27, 12,600 men, 33 cars of artillery and 21 cars of baggage and horses were in motion.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.89Turner, Victory Rode the Rails, p. 291Weber, Northern Railroads, p.184 By 10:30 PM September 30, the first 4 trains of troops reached Bridgeport.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.130 By October 3 Major General Hooker was able to report that all of the XI Corps’ troops were at Bridgeport and the XII Corps was passing through Nashville to begin the final leg of the trip. Moving the troops and artillery did not complete the job. On September 27 the railroads began loading the camp baggage, wagons, ambulances, horses and mule teams that were part of the corps. The XI Corps had 261 six mule teams, 75 two horse ambulances, 3 spring wagons and the XII Corps needed 150 four horse teams and 156 six mule teams moved.Pickenpaugh, Rescue by Rail, p.131 The last regiment of troops passed through Indianapolis on October 6 and reached its destination October 8, 1863, ending the 1,233 mile troop movement.Weber, Northern Railroads, p.186 By October 12, the USMRR and civilian railroads completed the movement of both corps and all of their artillery, transportation, and baggage. From Bridgeport, Hooker marched his force towards Chattanooga to participate in the fighting to relieve the Army of the Cumberland. =Atlanta Campaign= Nashville, Tenn. Fortified railroad bridge across Cumberland River =Petersburg Campaign= Railroad mortar at Petersburg, Va., July 25, 1864 City Point US Military Railroad Depot, looking towards the James River. At the conclusion of the Overland Campaign in 1864, LTG Grant directed MG Meade to transfer his Army of the Potomac to the south side of the James River in effort to capture the Confederate rail center of Petersburg and sever Richmond’s supply lines. The Union did not capture Petersburg before the city's defenders were reinforced by troops from General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. The continual Union movement towards the Confederate flanks gave way to digging as siege operations to isolate the Confederate capital began in earnest. LTG Grant established his headquarters on the grounds of Appomattox Manor overlooking the confluence of the Appomattox and James rivers. City Point, Virginia, modern day Hopewell, became the principal logistical base for the Virginia theater supplying the troops of both Meade's Army of the Potomac and MG Benjamin Butler’s Army of the James. In all the United States Military Railroad supplied more than 100,000 troops and more than 65,000 horses and mules with food, equipment and supplies from the waterfront docks on the navigable portion of the James River at City Point. Initial railroad operations began when the USMRR rebuilt and restored service along 9 miles of the Petersburg and City Point Railroad’s line.Gable, Railroad Generalship, p. 21. As the Union Army steadily extended its siege lines to the south and west, the USMRR construction corps followed in the Army's wake extending rail service from City Point to positions behind the new Union left flank. Eventually the USMRR added 21 additional miles of track which partially encircled Petersburg from the east to the southwest. Parts of the USMRR extension are preserved today within the borders of Fort Lee, Virginia, where a series of four historic markers show the route that the railroad followed behind the Union lines. When Petersburg was eventually abandoned in 1865 the 25 engines and 275 pieces of other rolling stock had logged a grand total of 2,300,000 operating miles.

As its title indicates, the subject of the play is a staple of the classical literature; Shirley most likely drew upon Book 13 of the Metamorphoses of Ovid as his direct source, along with Thomas Heywood's play The Iron Age.Edwin F. Ochester, \\"A Source for Shirley's The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses,\\" Notes and Queries 17 (1970), p. 217. The play was first printed in an octavo volume issued by the bookseller John Crooke, containing both The Contention and another play by Shirley, Honoria and Mammon. The title page states that The Contention was \\"nobly represented by young gentlemen of quality, at a private entertainment of some persons of honour.\\" No specific data about the stage history of either piece has survived, however; both may have been works that Shirley prepared for performance by the schoolboys he taught after the theatres closed with the start of the English Civil War in 1642. While not one of Shirley's most famous works, The Contention contains a funeral dirge that begins \\"The glories of our blood and state / Are shadows, not substantial things,\\" which has been often excerpted and reproduced, sometimes under the title of \\"Death the Leveller.\\"Henry Van Dyke and Hardin Craig, eds., Little Masterpieces of English Poetry, Vol. 7, New York, Doubleday, Page and Co., 1907; p. 9. Included in collections of familiar quotations, the poem is the most famous and popular work in Shirley's canon; Louisa May Alcott quotes its concluding line in Little Women. The poem was set to music, and was well known as a song -- King Charles II was reportedly fond of it.Samuel Edgerton Brydges, Censura Literaria, Vol. 3, London, Longman, Hurst, Ress and Orme, 1807; p. 385. Synopsis The play is set in the Grecian camp outside the walls of Troy, during the Trojan War; it opens soon after the death of Achilles, with the pages of Ajax and Ulysses disputing the relative worths of their masters. The pages' dispute quickly turns into an argument, and then a fight. The fight is broken up by the entrance of Calchas, who clears away the pages for the debate that is about to occur. The Greek generals and officers, led by Agamemnon and including Menelaus, Nestor, Thersander, and Diomedes, enter and seat themselves to hear the debate; Ajax and Ulysses follow. Ajax begins, and makes long and fulsome speeches in praise of his own valor and prowess in battle; he also attacks the courage and character of his opponent. Ulysses speaks second, and is far more eloquent and perceptive, turning Ajax's bluster against him. Once the contenders withdraw, the generals decide to award Achilles' armor to Ulysses. The play's second scene is devoted to Ajax's madness: Ajax has lost his mind as a result of his defeat to Ulysses, and eventually commits suicide. The brief final scene shows Ajax's funeral.

The 39th Congress proposed the principle underlying the Citizenship Clause due to concerns expressed about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act during floor debates in Congress.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 597.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2896. The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to entrench the principle in the Constitution in order to prevent its being struck down by the Supreme Court or repealed by a future Congress.United States v. Wong Kim Ark, . Text Section 1, Clause 1, of the Fourteenth Amendment, reads: Naturalization The reference to naturalization in the Citizenship Clause is to the process by which immigrants are granted United States citizenship. Congress has power in relation to naturalization under the Naturalization Clause in Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution.Reyes, Carla. \\"Naturalization Law, Immigration Flow, and Policy\\" in Transforming America: Perspectives on U.S. Immigration, Volume 1, p. 149 (Michael LeMay ed., ABC-CLIO, 2013).Epps, Garrett. The Citizenship Clause: A \\"Legislative History\\". 60 American University Law Review 331, 352 (2010). \\"This language [in the Civil Rights Act of 1866] is significant but does not directly demonstrate anything about the 'clear intent' of the Citizenship Clause. First, it is a statute, enacted under the authority of some combination of the Naturalization Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment; the Fourteenth Amendment is a change to the Constitution, creating entirely new rights and providing government with new powers.\\"Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 258 (1967). \\"Therefore, a bill was introduced [in 1818] to provide that a person could voluntarily relinquish his citizenship by declaring such relinquishment in writing before a district court and then departing from the country. The opponents of the bill argued that Congress had no constitutional authority, either express or implied, under either the Naturalization Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause, to provide that a certain act would constitute expatriation.\\"Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 940 (1983). \\"It is also argued that these cases present a nonjusticiable political question, because Chadha is merely challenging Congress' authority under the Naturalization Clause, U.S.Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, and the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S.Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 18.\\"In contrast to the aforementioned sources, Black's Law Dictionary defines \\"Naturalization Clause\\" as being equivalent to the Citizenship Clause. See Senate debate The text of the Citizenship Clause was first offered in the Senate as an amendment to Section 1 of the joint resolution as passed by the House. There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment. While the Citizenship Clause was intended to define as citizens exactly those so defined in the Civil Rights Act,Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. Senator Reverdy Johnson said in the debate: \\"Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Powerfor that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before usshall be considered as citizens of the United States ... If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States.\\" which had been debated and passed in the same session of Congress only several months earlier, the clause's author, Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan, phrased it a little differently. In particular, the two exceptions to citizenship by birth for everyone born in the United States mentioned in the Act, namely, that they had to be \\"not subject to any foreign power\\" and not \\"Indians not taxed\\", were combined into a single qualification, that they be \\"subject to the jurisdiction\\" of the United States, and while Howard and others, such as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, the author of the Civil Rights Act, believed that the formulations were equivalent, others, such as Senator James R. Doolittle from Wisconsin, disagreed, and pushed for an alternative wording.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890, 2892-3, 2896. Howard, when introducing the addition to the Amendment, stated that it was \\"the law of the land already\\" and that it excluded only \\"persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\\".Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2890. Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572. During the debate on the Civil Rights Act, Trumbull stated, \\"The Senator from Missouri and myself desire to arrive at the same point precisely, and that is to make citizens of everybody born in the United States who owe allegiance to the United States. We cannot make a citizen of a child of a foreign minister who is temporarily residing here. There is a difficulty in framing the amendment [to the Act] so as to make citizens of all people born in the United States who owe allegiance to it. I thought that might perhaps be the best form in which to put the amendment at one time, 'That all persons born in the United States and owing allegiance thereto are hereby declared to be citizens'; but upon investigation it was found that a sort of allegiance was due to the country from persons temporarily resident in it whom we would have no right to make citizens, and that that form would not answer.\\" Concerning the children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens (and not foreign diplomats), however, three senators, including Trumbull, as well as President Andrew Johnson, debated how both the Civil Rights Act and the Citizenship Clause could confer citizenship on them at birth,Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange: Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891-2.See veto message by President Andrew Johnson and Trumbull stated that \\"What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means.\\"Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull, participating in the debate, stated the following: \\"What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means.\\" He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by \\"complete jurisdiction\\": \\"Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court? ... We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction. ... If we want to control the Navajoes, or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?. ... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another? ... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens.\\" Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland commented that subject to the jurisdiction thereof in the proposed amendment undoubtedly meant the same thing as \\"not subject to some foreign power\\",Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. and Trumbull asserted that this was already true prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, but Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania disagreed, arguing that this was only true for the children of European immigrants. Senator John Conness of California expressed support for the Amendment for giving a constitutional basis for birthright citizenship to all children born in the United States to any parentage (including Chinese noncitizen residents who do not intend to reside permanently in the United States), even though he (and others) thought it had already been guaranteed by the Act,Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2891. During the debate on the Amendment, Conness declared, \\"The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal Civil Rights with other citizens.\\" He further added that \\"they [the Chinese] all return to their own country at some time or other\\". whereas Cowan opposed the Amendment (and Act), arguing that it would have the undesirable outcome of extending citizenship to the children of Chinese and Romani immigrants.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891-2. Cowan expressed concern over the prospect of a state not being able to determine its own citizens. In particular, he identified two groups that he felt were unsuitable for citizenship but would have such bestowed upon their children by the Amendment: Chinese and Gypsies, the latter of which he described thus, \\"who owe to her [Pennsylvania] no allegiance; who pretend to owe none; who recognized no authority in her government; who have a distinct, independent government of their own ...; who pay no taxes; who never perform military service; who do nothing, in fact, which becomes the citizen, and perform none of the duties which devolve upon him, but, on the other hand, have no homes, pretend to own no land, live nowhere, settle as trespassers where ever they go.\\" He subsequently cautioned against adopting the proposed Amendment, \\"Are these people, by a constitutional amendment, to be put out of the reach of the State in which they live? ... If the mere fact of being born in a country confers that right then they will have it. ... Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be a citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less pestiferous to society than I look upon Gypsies.\\" Most of the debate on this section of the Amendment centered on whether the wording in the Civil Rights Act or Howard's proposal more effectively excluded Indians on reservations and in U.S. territories from citizenship. Doolittle asserted, and Senators Johnson of Maryland and Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana concurred, that all Indians were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, so that the phrase \\"Indians not taxed\\" would be preferable,Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2893-4. but Trumbull and Howard disputed this, arguing that the U.S. government did not have full jurisdiction over Indian tribes, which governed themselves and made treaties with the United States.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull, participating in the debate, stated the following: \\"What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means.\\" He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by \\"complete jurisdiction\\": \\"Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court? ... We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction. ... If we want to control the Navajoes, or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?. ... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another? ... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens.\\"Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2895. Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant \\"the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now\\" and that the United States possessed a \\"full and complete jurisdiction\\" over the person described in the amendment. On the subject of citizenship for Indians, Trumbull said that \\"It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens.\\" Moreover, they objected to the phrase \\"Indians not taxed\\" on the basis that it could be construed as making citizenship dependent on wealth and also that it would allow states to manipulate who is a citizen in their state through tax policy.Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2894-5. Birthright citizenship The Citizenship Clause has been interpreted to the effect that children born on United States soil, with very few exceptions, are U.S. citizens. This type of guarantee--legally termed jus soli, or \\"right of the territory\\"--does not exist in most of Europe, Asia or the Middle East, although it is part of English common lawToday British nationality is defined in statute, which supersedes the common law. and is common in the Americas. (For birthright citizenship for children born abroad to US citizen parents, see \\"Birthright citizenship in the United States\\"). The “jurisdiction” requirement was considered in two Supreme Court cases. In Elk v. Wilkins, , the Court held that Native American tribes represented independent political powers with no allegiance to the United States, and that their peoples were under a special jurisdiction of the United States. It held that a Native person born a citizen of a recognized tribal nation was not born an American citizen and did not become one simply by voluntarily leaving his tribe and settling among whites. The syllabus of the decision explained that a Native person \\"who has not been naturalized, or taxed, or recognized as a citizen either by the United States or by the state, is not a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the first section of the Fourteenth Article of Amendment of the Constitution\\".Elk v. Wilkins, In 1870, the Senate Judiciary Committee also had expressed the proposition, saying: \\"the 14th amendment to the Constitution has no effect whatever upon the status of the Indian tribes within the limits of the United States\\". About 8% of the Native population at the time qualified for U.S. citizenship because they were \\"taxed\\", while others obtained citizenship by serving in the military, marrying whites or accepting land allotments, such as those granted under the Dawes Act. Children born to these Native American tribes therefore did not automatically receive citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment if they voluntarily left their tribe. Native tribes that paid taxes were exempt from this ruling; their peoples were already citizens by an earlier act of Congress, and all non-citizen Natives were subsequently made citizens by the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. On the other hand, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a man born within the United States to foreigners (in that case, Chinese citizens) who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States and who were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power, was a citizen of the United States. More broadly, the court characterized the statement, All persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States as \\"the broad and clear words of the Constitution\\", ruling that Wong's U.S. citizenship had been acquired by birth and had not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth. A 2010 Congressional Research Service report observed that, though it could be argued that Congress has no power to define \\"subject to the jurisdiction\\" and the terms of citizenship in a manner contrary to the Supreme Court's understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as expressed in Wong Kim Ark and Elk, since Congress does have broad power to pass necessary and proper legislation to regulate naturalization under the Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cls. 4 & 18 of the constitution Congress arguably has the power to define \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" for the purpose of regulating immigration. Historian Eric Foner has explored the question of birthright citizenship and argues that \\"birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism...birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle.\\"Eric Foner, \\"Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism,\\" The Nation Aug. 27, 2015 Loss of citizenship The Fourteenth Amendment does not provide any procedure for revocation of United States citizenship. The Supreme Court in Afroyim v. Rusk held that loss of 14th-Amendment-based U.S. citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:Afroyim v. Rusk * Fraud in the naturalization process. Technically this is not loss of citizenship, but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant never was a U.S. citizen. * Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the State Department or through other actions (e.g., treason) that demonstrate an intention to give up U.S. citizenship.U.S. State Department, Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality. Such an act of expatriation must be accompanied by an intent to terminate United States citizenship.Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252 (1980): \\"As we have said, Afroyim requires that the record support a finding that the expatriating act was accompanied by an intent to terminate United States citizenship.\\" For jus sanguinis U.S. citizenship, i.e., citizenship for the children born abroad of U.S. citizen parents, which is established only by congressional statute and not the U.S. Constitution (including its amendments), these restrictions do not apply (e.g., cf. Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971)). Right to travel In Saenz v. Roe, the Supreme Court held that this clause protects an aspect of the right to travel.Saenz v. Roe, . Specifically, the Saenz Court said that the Citizenship Clause protects a citizen's right to resettle in other states and then be treated equally: The Saenz Court also mentioned the majority opinion in the Slaughterhouse Cases, which had stated that \\"a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State.\\"Slaughterhouse Cases, . Natural-born citizens The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) at \\"natural-born\\" defines it as a person who becomes a citizen at birth (as opposed to becoming one later). It lists this definition as going back to the 16th century. OED cites a law of 1695 (Act 7 & 8 Will. III (1696) 478) that states, \\"A Natural born Subject of this Realm...Who shall be willing to Enter and Register himself for the Service of His Majesty.\\" It also quotes Thomas Jefferson 1776 (in T. Jefferson Public Papers 344): \\"All persons who..propose to reside..and who shall subscribe the fundamental laws, shall be considered as residents and entitled to all the rights of persons natural born.\\" Blacks Law Dictionary (10th Edition) defines 'Natural Born Citizen' as \\"A person born within the jurisdiction of a national government.\\" Webster's International Dictionary (3rd edition, 2000) defines \\"natural-born\\" as \\" especially: having the legal status of citizen or subject.\\" Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution requires that a candidate for President of the United States be a \\"natural-born citizen.\\" According to a former edition of the US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual: \\"the fact that someone is a natural born citizen pursuant to a statute does not necessarily imply that he or she is such a citizen for Constitutional purposes.\\" The majority opinion by Justice Horace Gray in United States v. Wong Kim Ark observed that: > The constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these words [\\"citizen\\" and > \\"natural born citizen\\"], either by way of inclusion or of exclusion, except > in so far as this is done by the affirmative declaration that 'all persons > born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction > thereof, are citizens of the United States.' This observation by Gray about the term \\"natural-born citizen\\" was obiter dicta, since the case did not involve any controversy about presidential eligibility.

He is known for starting a 4x4 offroad tire and parts supplier in 1963. Dick Cepek Tires was one of the first off- road enterprises.Offroad Motorsports Hall of Fame Biography, Retrieved August 29, 2007 Early life Cepek was born on November 28, 1930 in Hillsboro, Wisconsin. Afterwards, his family moved to Columbus, Ohio, where his father worked in the maintenance department at a trucking company. Cepek served in the United States Navy in the 1950s. He married Dorothy Mudd in 1954 while he was working for Westinghouse Electric. Career Soon after marriage he was transferred to South Gate, California. In 1958 he purchased a Land Rover, which he used to explore the California desert. He began riding on group excursions into the desert. While on these excursions, he saw the need for wider, more durable tires for off-roading. He had Armstrong Rubber build him wider tires for his Land Cruiser. Soon other group members wanted wider tires for their vehicles too. He saw the need for the larger off-roading community to purchase tires, so he had Armstrong Rubber build enough tires to fill his one and a half car garage. He took out an advertisement in Sunset magazine. In 1960 he took his wife Dorothy to a for sale barber shop in South Gate. He asked the owner if she would mind if he would rent the space for his tire business. She agreed, and he moved in. He quickly outgrew the space. After being in business for two years, he was able to quit at Westinghouse to dedicate himself full-time to the tire business. He moved the business to an old fire hall down the street. He began selling other off-roading equipment, from shock absorbers and suspensions to camping gear. The business grew to three warehouses and 15 stores, plus a catalog business. Influence Cepek was influential in the growth of organized off-road racing. In 1966 he joined Ed Pearlman and two other teams to set a new record time for a four-wheeled vehicle to cross the Baja California peninsula. Pearlman and Cepek crossed the desert in 56 hours, second place behind Claude Dozier and Ed Orr's 41 hours and 45 minutes. Drino Miller and John Lawlor completed the trek in 66 hours. During the crossing, Pearlman and Cepek discussed creating an organization. After the race, Pearlman held a meeting at his house, and created the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA). NORRA organized the original Baja 1000 races. Cepek competed in the first three races. He was inducted in the Off- Road Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1978. He also sponsored racers, including fellow Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame inductees Larry Minor, Rod Hall and Drino Miller. Death Cepek died on March 1, 1983 in South Gate, California. Until 2000, Cepek Tires was run by his son Tom Cepek when it was sold to Mickey Thompson Performance Tires.

He was born in Ottawa and raised in its Westboro neighbourhood, where he attended Woodroffe Avenue and Broadview Public elementary schools followed by Nepean High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from Carleton University, and a diploma in health sciences from Humber College. He wrote articles for the Newswest community paper in its early days.\\"From the editor: You make it happen.\\", Don McGillivray, Newswest, December 1980 He died in November 2012 while vacationing in Cuba. Political career Little was involved in politics from a young age as a member of the provincial Ontario and Federal Progressive Conservative parties. He worked for Progressive Conservative MP Walter Baker when he was 16 years old. He first ran for election in Goulbourn outside of Ottawa in 1988 at age 24. Little ran in newly formed Kitchissippi Ward (which included the former Elmdale and Queensboro Wards and finished second to incumbent Joan Wong. He helped lead the effort to oppose the National Capital Commission (NCC) plan to widen the Champlain Bridge,\\"NCC reconsiders widening of bridge after community group files lawsuit\\" Leonard Stern. Ottawa Citizen. Aug 16, 1996. pg. A.1. and was a local community leader, volunteer and activist for local organizations, charities and community service groups. Little served as the founding president of the revamped Westboro Community Association, served as a board member for the not- for-profit community-based publication Newswest and president of the Westboro Kiwanis Club. He also helped develop and worked with several initiatives reaching out to marginalized youth. As one friend put it: \\"He talked about the importance of reaching out to youth and getting involved with them before they go down the wrong path\\". Ottawa city council On his second attempt, in 1997, for a seat on City Council Little was elected to represent Kitchissippi. Elected at age 33, Little was one of the youngest councillors in Ottawa's history (that honour now belongs to Rideau-Vanier councillor Mathieu Fleury, who was elected at age 25 ). He represented the City at the World Capitals Forum in Tapei, Taiwan in 1997 and was elected to the national Board of Directors as an Ontario Director for the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In his community, he was known to be a fiscally conservative and socially progressive politician. During his subsequent nine year council career (1997–2006), Little chaired the City's Licence Committee and Animal Control Tribunal, was Vice-Chair of the Planning Committee and was a member of the Community and Protective Services Committee, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, the City's Task Force on Property Tax Reform and the Priorities and Planning and Budget Committee. He served as a member of the Board of the Ottawa Civic Hospital, a Trustee for the Ottawa Public Library, on the Board of the Westboro Business Improvement Association, Ottawa Board of Health, and as a City Council liaison to the Ottawa Youth Cabinet. Second term In 2000 the former City of Ottawa and surrounding municipalities and townships amalgamated to form the new City of Ottawa. Little again ran for election to represent Kitchissippi Ward against Regional Council member Linda Davis. During the campaign Little supported plans to build a new Loblaws store in the area.\\"Huge Loblaws approved for Westboro\\" CBC News, April 5th 2000 The race was one of the most bitter in the city with Little's supporters accused of stealing lawn signs while Davis was accused of leaking libellous, frivolous and fictional material to Frank magazine. Little defeated Davis with close to 50% of votes cast compared to Davis's 40%. Little was one of only three councillors from the former City of Ottawa re-elected to the newly amalgamated Council. When it was approved, the new Loblaws in Westboro was seen as a victory for the community and one that revamped and revitalized the many small businesses lining Richmond Road and West Wellington Street that had been in sharp decline. Third term and later career At the 2003 elections Councillor Little sought re-election for a third term.\\"Little re-elected with just 27% of vote;\\" Bruce Ward, Erin Conway-Smith and Ken Gray. Ottawa Citizen. Nov 11, 2003. pg. B.3 The race attracted many challengers, including Linda Davis. Little was re-elected, receiving a 27% plurality. Little had decided to stand as a candidate in the 2006 municipal election, but had a change of heart before the elections took place, noting that he had accomplished all of the important goals for the area he set for himself when he first ran for office and endorsed candidate Christine Leadman instead.\\"Little bows out of race for Kitchissippi seat\\" Jake Rupert. Ottawa Citizen. Sep 14, 2006. pg. C.1 One of these goals was revitalizing Hintonburg, a neighbourhood that once had 67 known problem rental properties, and drug issues among its population. After leaving politics in 2006, Little managed an Ottawa-based tech company until 2010. In August 2010, Little returned to politics as a candidate in Ottawa's 2010 municipal elections for the Bay Ward, which was held by incumbent Alex Cullen.\\"Little seeks return to council\\". Susan Sherring. Ottawa Sun. Aug 19, 2010. pg. 15. Although Little came in fifth place behind candidate Terry Kilrea, Cullen was defeated.

Over a million copies of the original printing were sold, and reprints have continued for decades. It came in #18 in the 1978 Locus Poll Award for best science fiction. Plot summary =Preamble= Elkinos Skander is an archaeologist stationed on the planet of Dalgonia. The planet was formerly occupied by the long-dead Markovian race, who are known only for the planet- sized computers they built into the crust of the planets they inhabited. He leads a group of students studying the ruins. Skander unlocks the mystery of the apparently dead computer. One of the students, patterned (and named) after a brilliant mathematician named Varnett, sees Skander interacting with the computer and confronts him. The two conclude that the computer runs on a form of energy unknown to human physics, forming the basic unified field that governs the existence of the universe. The computer runs on, and controls, that energy. The rest of the team discovers a surface anomaly near the north pole of the planet, where a hexagonal \\"hole\\" appears for a brief interval every day. Skander and Varnett both believe that they will be able to use this anomaly to access the planetary computer, and both set off to attempt to take control. Trying to protect the discovery, Skander stops at the team's camp and murders them. By the time he arrives at the anomaly, Varnett has already prepared for his arrival and the two struggle on the surface. They are swallowed up by the anomaly when it reopens. Meanwhile, the interstellar freighter Stehekin is transporting three passengers and grain intended for famine relief. The passengers are a businessman named Datham Hain, his \\"niece\\" Wu Julee, and a diplomatic courier identified as Vardia Diplo 1261. During the trip, the ship's captain, Nathan Brazil, discovers that Hain is a \\"sponge merchant\\", a trafficker in a substance that causes an incurable, degenerative brain disease. Using the threat of withholding the arresting agent, the substance can be used to gain power over those it infects. Hain keeps Wu Julee as an example of what happens in this case; she has regressed to a mental age of five and will eventually be turned into a vegetable and allowed to die. Brazil diverts the Stehekin from its course, in an attempt to reach the planet where the alien substance originated to obtain the retardant. Before they arrive, Brazil receives a distress call from Dalgonia and detours to investigate. There, they find the seven students murdered by Skander. Subsequently, the entire party travels to the polar gate, and while they are investigating there, the anomaly reopens and they are transported to the Well World. =Well World= The Well World is a Markovian construct that stabilizes the equation of our universe. Like Dalgonia, the planet consists largely of an enormous computer that can interact with and control the forces of nature. The surface has been patterned into a series of hexagonal patches where Markovians were allowed to experiment in creating their own new forms of intelligent life, and if they were successful they would be sent off into the universe to evolve on their own. Another Markovian was then allowed to try their hand at species design in the now-empty hex. The planet still contains 1,560 races that were on the Well World when the Markovians disappeared. At the Well World, Brazil and his companions set off to track down Skander and Varnett, to stop them from gaining access to the central computer there and do untold mischief to the universe. The complication is that travelling through the polar gate on Dalgonia has transformed all of the humans, with the exception of Nathan Brazil, into members of the various species which inhabit the planet. As the book continues, Brazil comes to realize that his existence is not as it appears, and memories start to surface.

When Missouri tax collectors attempted to collect revenue from the new territory they were run out of the state. In the process they cut down three trees with honey bee hives for partial payment. The source of the debate was the definition of the Des Moines Rapids. When Missouri entered the Union in 1820 it said its border extended from the rapids on the River Des Moines. Brown couldn't find the rapids at the said intersection with the river-and hence-said the rapids were further north. The Supreme Court was to repudiate what was called \\"Brown's Line\\" and uphold the Sullivan Line as the border (although resurveyed).

Original North American copies of Stadium Events are now considered to be among the rarest NES games, leading to high prices in the secondary video game collecting market. Gameplay Stadium Events is a fitness game that allows the players to compete in four different sporting events: 100M dash, 110M hurdles, long jump, and triple jump. The game utilizes the Family Fun Fitness control mat which supports up to two players simultaneously, although up to six alternating players can be registered for each event. The left side of the mat must be used for the dash and hurdle events, while the other events can use either side. The top speed of the player's runner is dependent upon which row of buttons on the mat is used. If the player lifts their feet slightly before the starting signal, it is considered a false start. A player competes against the computer in the 110M hurdles The 100M dash event places two players against each other in a race. The 110M hurdles event is similar to the dash, but the players must jump when white box markers appear along the edge of the screen. The long jump has the players running and then jumping and staying in the air as long as possible to record a longer distance. The triple jump is similar to the long jump but includes three separate jump markers. In tournament mode, the player must compete against computer players at the 100M dash and 110M hurdle events. The player must beat each of the six computer players at both the dash and hurdle events in order to win. In this mode, three false starts results in a disqualification. In another mode, \\"The Olympics\\", numerous players can compete in all four events consecutively. In this mode, the Guinness 1982 world track record is used as a reference for scoring standards. Release Stadium Events was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in September 1987. Nintendo saw promise in the Family Fun Fitness technology, so purchased the mat and re-branded it as the Power Pad. Stadium Events was also re-released as World Class Track Meet. The North American version of Stadium Events is considered one of the rarest NES games. The total number of copies sold to consumers is unknown. The standard minimum initial run for an NES game was around 10,000 copies, but collectors believe the game's scarcity is much lower. A popular rumor that the game was sold at one Woolworth's store was proven false. Howard Phillips, a former spokesman for Nintendo of America, did not believe the cartridges were destroyed and claimed that reworking all of the cartridges would have been impractical. Stadium Events copies have been sold for up to in the video game collecting market. The 2015 documentary Nintendo Quest considered it the single rarest NES title.

The club had approximately 1,300 members and included the country's largest youth department. History The history of the association was marked by a long string of mergers and name changes. The earliest predecessor sides were FV Brandenburg Berlin founded on 20 March 1892, and FC Lichterfelde established 18 June 1912. FV fielded strongly competitive sides in the early 1900s until the club briefly split in two with the formation of TuFV Helvellia Berlin. These two sides were re-united in 1905 but the club was seriously weakened by World War I and nearly disappeared. At the end of the war in 1919 FV merged with Berliner SC 09 Brandenburg to form SV Brandenburg Berlin. Another union followed in 1921, this time with BBC 03 Berlin to create BBC-Brandenburg Berlin. Both Brandenburg and Lichterfeld were playing second-tier football through this period with SCB winning promotion to the top-flight for a two-year turn that ended in 1925 after which BBC again became an independent side. By 1929 the '92 Brandenburg side was playing as FV Brandenburg Berlin and in 1933 merged with FC Eintracht Lankwitz. At the outbreak of World War II FV formed a partnership with Rot-Weiß-Schöneberg in order to be able to continue to field a team during the conflict. At war's end in 1945 occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Later that year the membership of FVBB established SG Steglitz-Friedenau (renamed FV Brandenburg Berlin in 1950) and the Lichterfeld club also re-appeared being known briefly as SG Lichterfeld. A 1971 merger joined FCL and FVBB to create FV Brandenburg Lichterfelde which was in turn joined in 1988 by Lichterfelder Sport-Union (founded 15 February 1951) to form VfB Lichterfelde 1892. The association adopted its last name in 2004. These myriad predecessor sides enjoyed only limited success with both Lichterfelder sides making occasional appearances in the Amateurliga Berlin (III-IV) in the 50s and 60s. Sport-Union spent a single season in second-tier competition in the Regionalliga Berlin in 1966–67. VfB won promotion to the Oberliga Berlin (III) in 1989, became a founding member of NOFV-Oberliga in 1991, and played there continuously until being demoted in 2004 after a 16th-place finish. A highlight for the club during this period was the club's advance to the final of the Paul-Rusch-Pokal (Berlin Cup) in 1998. Now playing as FC the club claimed the 2006 Verbandsliga Berlin (V) championship to return to the Oberliga. In 2013 the club merged with BFC Viktoria 1889 to form a new club, FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin. Stadium Lichterfeld played its home matches at the Stadion Lichterfelde in Steglitz. The stadium has a capacity of 4,300 which includes 1,800 seats (800 covered, 1,000 uncovered). Construction of the facility began in 1926 and it was inaugurated on 16 June 1929. From 1933 to 1945 the facility was known as the Adolf Hitler Stadium and it was used as a training venue for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Severely damaged in the course of the war, the stadium was not restored to a usable condition until April 1952 and underwent a major renovation that included the installation of floodlights in the 1980s, followed by the installation of artificial turf in the 90s.

Zoo emergency response teams, also called emergency weapons teams, lethal restraint teams or firearms emergency response teams, are teams that respond when zoo animals escape their enclosure and threaten zoo visitors and employees. Duties Emergency response teams are responsible for the capture of escaped animals. Goals include: (listed in order of priority) # Ensure public safety # Ensure staff safety # Ensure animal safety # Recapture the animal Training Emergency response teams are not full-time but are typically composed of zoo employees who have received special weapons training from a police agency. They are trained to use deadly force, but only as a last resort when the escaped animal is threatening the life of a human being. Zoos frequently perform training drills in order to keep the team up to date and ready for a real animal escape. Escaped animal procedures When an animal escapes, guests are immediately evacuated from the area and escorted to secured buildings on zoo grounds by the zoo’s emergency response team (veterinarians armed with tranquilizer equipment, zoo firearms team and animal management staff). The zoo’s perimeter is sealed off for safety and is usually reopened after the animal is secured.http://www.phinneywood.com/2009/08/01/zoo-protocol-for-escaped- animals/ Australian zoos use a set of standard emergency radio codes for dealing with escaped animals. Many zoos in America have a similar policy. *Code red - dangerous animal escape (lion, tiger, male giraffe). *Code blue - hazardous animal escape (cheetah, camel, female giraffe, bongo). *Code yellow - non-threatening animal escape (koala, meerkat, turtle). *All clear - self- explanatory (usually only issued by the senior keeper). Notable events =Dallas Zoo= Many zoos created or enhanced their emergency response teams following a gorilla attack at the Dallas Zoo in 2004. =Denver Zoo= On February 24, 2007, an emergency response team at the Denver Zoo shot and killed a jaguar which had attacked a zookeeper. The zookeeper later died from her injuries. =San Francisco Zoo= Two tiger attacks at the San Francisco Zoo occurred on December 22, 2006, and December 25, 2007, both involving a 243-pound Siberian tiger named Tatiana (June 27, 2003 — December 25, 2007). In the first incident, a zookeeper was bitten on the arm during a public feeding. During the second incident, in which two people were injured and one killed, police officers fatally shot the tiger. = Cincinnati Zoo = On May 28, 2016, a 4-year-old boy climbed through a public barrier at Gorilla World at around 4pm at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden and fell into the exhibit’s moat. The two female gorillas in the exhibit were recalled immediately, but the third, a male named Harambe, remained in the yard with the child. The Zoo’s Dangerous Animal Response Team responded to the situation by fatally shooting the gorilla. http://cincinnatizoo.org/blog/2016/05/28/media-update-gorilla-world/ Equipment The following equipment is used by most zoos in the recapture of an escaped animal. *Tranquilliser gun *Firearm *Pepper spray *Fire extinguisher *Water spray bottle *Catch pole *Net *Net Gun *Fladry line (flags on a string) *Broom *Towels *Tarpaulins *First aid kit *Flashlight See also * Emergency management * Zoo References ","title":"Emergency response team (zoo)"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},P={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your bitcoin🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",P,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const F=d(R,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/19.md","filePath":"library/19.md"}'),H={name:"library/19.md"},W=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{L as __pageData,W as default};
