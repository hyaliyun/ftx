In 1906 a separate Department of Philosophy and Psychology was explicitly established, and in 1912 Philosophy split to form its own department. The department is located in the Philosophy Building on Surrey Street, a set of three adjacent townhouses joined through a series of corridors and forming part of the Strand Campus of King's College.http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/about/Map-Philosophy- building.pdfhttp://transact.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Strand.pdf The vaults along the back of the building are those containing the old Roman Baths on Strand Lane. In 1989, Sir Richard Sorabji founded the King's College Centre for Philosophical Studies at the department with the aim of promoting philosophy to the wider public. The Head of Department is currently Bill Brewer, Susan Stebbing Professor of Philosophy at King's.  Traditions  The Department of Philosophy owns a historic bar on its premises in Surrey Street, officially the King's College Sports & Social Club Bar but referred to informally as simply the Philosophy Bar. Management of the bar was taken over by the King's College London Students' Union in 2016. Academic staff and students of the department also make an annual trip to Cumberland Lodge, a Grade II listed country house in Windsor Great Park. There is a programme of lectures, communal meals and other activities, including an annual football match played between staff and students. Student life in the department is administered mainly by the King's College London Philosophy Society.  Rankings  The Department of Philosophy at King's ranks highly in both national and global rankings. The Philosophical Gourmet Report lists the department at 4th in the UK and 26th in the English-speaking world. QS World University Rankings places the department at 5th in the UK and 10th globally in 2019.

While harboring a collection of pieces that utilize different mediums, she most frequently displays paintings that focus on progressive ideas of gender and beauty, as well as people who identify as queer.  Personal life and education  Born in the United States, Kim Leutwyler spent her formative years traveling from place to place. She did not spend a substantial amount of time in any given area, and only briefly lived in places like Chicago, Illinois, Arizona, and Connecticut. Initially, Leutwyler sought to study accounting after finishing her high school education, but an impulse led her to enroll in the art history program at Arizona State University. It was there that she focused almost exclusively on ceramics and printmaking until she received concurrent bachelor's degrees in both Studio Art and Art History. Seeking to further her education, she later graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with a Painting and Drawing degree as well. However, her time spent studying abroad at the University of Auckland in New Zealand was very impressionable. Leutwyler fell in love with the landscapes and spirit of adventure, and promised herself that she would once again visit the South Pacific when given the chance. An opportunity eventually presented itself, and she migrated to Australia in late 2012.  Career  Leutwyler has actively created work through a variety of mediums to include installation, ceramics, drawing, and printmaking. Predominately focusing on LGBT-identified and allied women, trans, and gender nonconforming people, her large-scale paintings stimulate dialogue in both mainstream and feminist art worlds. Her portraiture series features a mix of notable activists and artists including musician and drag queen Trixie Mattel, marriage equality activist Sally Rugg, Olympic athlete Michelle Heyman and DJ, writer and actor Faustina Agolley. Leutwyler harbors a deeper desire to contribute to the destabilization of gender borders. As Leutwyler herself often explains, her work tends to explore the fine lines between objectification, glorification, and modification. Both the fluidity and overall complexity of identity continue to generate inspiration for the artist. Just as people often evolve and adapt to their surrounding social environment, they also do so upon her canvases. With a particularly unique aesthetic, Leutwyler's work harbors bold and bright blocks of color that meld with the subjects. As she elaborates in an interview: > The 'ideal' female anatomy has changed over time, with varying aesthetics > that metamorphose based on age, race, geography and time period. For > centuries, humans have embraced body modification as a means of expression, > rites of passage, religious beliefs and cultural aesthetics. I paint my > friends and the people that I care about most, who embrace a small fraction > of current cultural aesthetics and modifications. Body art, plastic surgery > and piercings are not uncommon among the women you see in my work. It was the historical use of patterns to contemplate concepts like beauty, piety, and even justice that invoked a deep inspiration behind much of Leutwyler's work. In fact, many of the subjects in her works are depicted before their favorite patterns. It was this very fascination that eventually led her to the discovery of Kehinde Wiley, an artist with highly naturalistic work that displays individuals posed before patterns of various cultures. Upon the realization that other artists were exploring similar boundaries, she sought further inspiration and investigation into history. This led her to artists like Caravaggio who utilized tenebrism, painting only where the light bounced off of the subject. Inspired by such techniques, she therefore adopted the practice of blending bright and vivid patterns where the shadows of the subject would be. Another great inspiration was Robert Rauschenberg, an artist with not only art that garnered Leutwyler's attention, but a lasting legacy. He contributed a substantial amount of money and time to the establishment of organizations that supported such things as human rights and world peace. Such philanthropic efforts were something that she admired. In fact, her desire to impact the world through artistic vision remains an ultimate goal, and has since led her to the founding of a project, PhilanthropART, in which she periodically donates a portion of the proceeds from her artwork to a different non-profit organization each. = Collections = * Brooklyn Art Library, Brooklyn, New York * Printmaking Student Association Collection, Arizona State University = Exhibitions =  2014  * Artfully: A Digital Discovery, Zigi's Art Gallery, Sydney, Australia * The Comfort Zone, Gasworks Arts Park, Melbourne, Australia * Inquisitarium, Art @1 Spring Street, Melbourne, Australia  2015  * Archibald Prize, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia * The Other Art Fair, aMBUSH Project Space, Sydney, Australia * Home Free: A Midsumma Exhibition, Gasworks Arts Park, Melbourne, Australia  2016  * Portia Geach Memorial Award, S.H.

Ancient Greek pottery is one of the most commonly found types of artifacts from the ancient Greek world. The information learned from vase paintings forms the foundation of modern knowledge of ancient Greek art and culture. Most ancient Greek pottery is terracotta, a type of earthenware ceramic, dating from the 11th century BCE through the 1st century CE. The objects are usually excavated from archaeological sites in broken pieces, or shards, and then reassembled. Some have been discovered intact in tombs. Professional conservator-restorers, often in collaboration with curators and conservation scientists, undertake the conservation-restoration of ancient Greek pottery.  History of conservation and restoration approaches  = Ancient = Ancient repairs were made to damaged pottery using metal pins or staples, which could be made of copper, lead, or bronze.Snow, Carol (1986). \\"The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration.\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4. Animal or vegetable based adhesives may have also been used. Fragments from other vessels were sometimes used to replace damaged or missing sections of an object.Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/ The decorative elements on the replacement pieces may or may not have matched the rest of the vase.

Several small holes around the handles were used for repairs in antiquity. = 18th to early 20th century = Restoration methods used during the 18th through early 20th century generally attempted to restore vessels to a near pristine state and hide any evidence of past damage.Snow, Carol (1986). \\"The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration.\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4. Archaeological discoveries and a surge in the popularity of ancient Greek art in the 18th and 19th centuries created a high demand for objects and artifacts. The customary restoration method started with reassembling vessel fragments. Missing fragments were replaced with new glazed and fired pieces of pottery and gaps were filled in with plaster. The surface was then painted, sometimes extensively.Snow, Carol (1986). \\"The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration.\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4. Materials used included shellac, protein glues, oil paints, gypsum, plaster of Paris, barium sulphate, calcite, clay, kaolin, and waterglass (calcium silicate).Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases In some cases, decorative imagery was censored and painted over, in order to appeal to the tastes of contemporary society and potential collectors.Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/ = Modern = The modern approach to conservation generally involves using non-destructive methods to evaluate objects and restoration techniques which emphasize the difference between areas of modern repair and ancient craftsmanship. Reversible adhesives, paint, and other materials are used in restorations.Snow, Carol (1986). \\"The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration.\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 6. Conservation departments at museums such as the Getty Villa approach conservation of ancient pottery with the goal to \\"visually integrate filled areas and make them less obtrusive while still distinguishing them from the original ceramic and preserving an object's history.\\"Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/  Materials  Most ancient Greek pottery is terracotta, a type of earthenware fired clay ceramic. The composition of minerals, metal, organic and other inorganic materials in the clay varies depending on its source. These variations affect the color of the clay before and after firing. Iron is the most common material found in clay, and can add red, grey, or buff coloring to the object.Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205 Pottery can be coarse wares, which are undecorated or only minimally decorated utilitarian vessels, or fine wares, which are decorated, finely potted, and used for a variety of purposes, including ceremonial use. Vase paintings were primarily created using slip, a thin, transparent layer of clay which turned color after firing. Other materials used in vase paintings include added pigment, added clay to create a relief on the surface, or dilute gloss that added color after firing.Oakley, John H. The Greek Vase: Art of the Storyteller (London: British Museum, 2013), 16. Unevenly applied gloss or misfiring also created variations in color or surface texture. Gilding was also sometimes added after firing.  Agents of deterioration  Ceramics, and ancient ceramics in particular, can suffer a variety of types of damage. Most agents of deterioration are due to environment and are inherent to the materials; however, the most common damage is caused by human action. = Physical damage = Breaks, losses, or abrasions can be caused by improper handling, impact (dropping), or excavation. Ceramics are strong in compression, but weak under tension, meaning they are fragile and susceptible to mechanical shock.Buys, Susan and Victoria Oakley, Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics (Routledge, 2014), 18. = Soluble salts = If a piece of pottery has been buried in salty or alkaline soil or submersed in seawater, the clay may have soaked up soluble salts, such as sulphite, nitrates, or chlorides. Changes in relative humidity can cause the salts to react and dissolve (in high humidity) or recrystallize (in low humidity).Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205 These reactions can cause pottery to suffer surface losses or delamination.Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases = Previous restorations = Previous restorations can cause unintended damage over time. Metal pins or staples can corrode and deteriorate. Plaster repairs may become unstable. In-painting may fade or discolor. Intentional over-painting from past conservation efforts is another form of damage. Scenes were sometimes altered in order to appeal to current tastes. A common example is a fig leaf being painted over a nude figure. Overly aggressive cleaning with acid can also cause damage. Acid cleaning is meant to remove insoluble salts and minerals from the surface of archaeological ceramics. Pottery that has been improperly cleaned and damaged by acid may have pitted, cracked, powdery, or flaking surfaces.National Park Service. \\"Long-term Effects of acid-cleaning on archaeological ceramics,\\" Conserve-O-Gram (September 1999) https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/06-06.pdf Onésimos red- figure Kylix with a youth carrying a pole with two baskets ca 490 BCE from the Thorvaldensmuseum cc0 H605  Preventive conservation  Preventive conservation measures can help slow further deterioration or damage. = Handling = As with any fragile ceramic object, proper handling techniques will help prevent accidental damage. Objects should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary, objects should be held at their strongest points only. Pressure on the weakest points, such as handles, necks, or areas with existing damage, should be avoided. Objects should be handled with clean, dry hands, or with nitrile gloves. Cotton gloves are not recommended, because the fabric prevents a stable grip and threads can snag on rough surfaces. Objects on display in museums are secured with mounts or protected by cases to prevent unwanted or accidental contact. Vessels may be displayed upright or at an angle, depending on the decorative elements on display. Any mounts should keep the object stable without putting pressure on any fragile areas. = Environmental conditions = Despite having been dried and fired, pottery clay is still a porous material which will react to changes in environmental conditions. Avoiding extreme changes in temperature can help maintain the condition of ancient Greek pottery. As discussed above in the section on damage from Soluble Salts, preventing extreme fluctuations in relative humidity can also help prevent further deterioration. Objects should be protected from water and dirt.  Examination  The following techniques are used by conservators to evaluate the condition of ancient Greek pottery and determine appropriate treatment. Examination is the first step in the conservation process. = Visual inspection = Conservators begin the evaluation of an object with careful visual inspection to identify areas of weakness, loss, delamination, discoloration, or old repairs. Further examination with a low power microscope can help conservators identify materials and technical features, such as pigment, gilding, or added clay.Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html = Ultraviolet (UV) visible fluorescence = When exposed to invisible UV light, many types of materials will display certain colors of visible light. This can enable conservators to identify areas of different media throughout the object.Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html = X-radiography = X-rays can reveal breaks, internal features, or hidden ancient repairs, such as pins.Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html Another type of X-ray, called X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy can reveal the elemental and chemical composition of a material. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy can reveal the iron oxidation states in pottery (the factor that determines black and red color) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses can provide information on the molecular structure of iron minerals.Abraham, Melissa. \\"Deciphering the Elements of Iconic Pottery,\\" National Science Foundation (March 28, 2011) https://www.nsf.gov/mobile/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119082&org;=NSF  Conservation treatment  After evaluation is completed, conservator- restorers can determine the most appropriate form of treatment. Treatments can range from non-invasive techniques, such as cleaning, to more invasive conservation, such as disassembly, reconstruction, and restoration. Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923 = Cleaning = Basic mechanical cleaning can remove dirt, dust, and grime. Cleaning solvents and water can also be used to remove dirt, varnish, wax, in- painting, or adhesives. Acids should be used with caution. Desalination is a cleaning method that removes as much soluble salt from the porous fired clay as possible. Fragments are soaked in highly purified water for multiple days. The water is changed regularly until salt levels are reduced.Usui, Emiko and Julia Gaviria, Eds., Conservation and Care of Museum Collections (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 2011), 152. = Disassembly = For vessels that have been previously conserved and reassembled, shards may need to be disassembled in order to remove old restoration materials and complete conservation. Adhesives and fill are systematically removed, revealing the original pottery and allowing the vessel to be deconstructed. = Reconstruction and restoration = Separated shards are carefully reassembled. Conservators use identifying clues, such as shape, texture, and decorative pattern or painted scenes, to piece together fragments. Missing shards can be recreated out of plaster and replaced. In-painting is used to disguise areas of repair. In modern conservation treatment, the media used by conservators is reversible and can be distinguished easily from ancient material. Different conservators, or conservation departments, may have different policies regarding in- painting. Some conservators leave replacement fragments completely undecorated in order to easily distinguish them as modern additions. Some conservators paint silhouettes of missing figures, using existing fragments, scene narrative, and other extant vases as examples. This approach helps show the narrative of the painted scene, while still distinguishing the modern restoration from the original fragments. Some conservators use more extensive in-painting to recreate missing decoration.  Notable examples  The Affecter Amphora, in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, is a case study for the history of conservation of Greek vases. The black figured Attic (meaning from Athens region) vessel was created around 540 BCE by a well documented vase painter known as the Affecter Painter. Treatment of the vase in the 1980s provided the conservation field with significant insight into the history of the restoration of Greek vases. Conservators discovered that the amphora had been broken and repaired in antiquity. Samples of burial dirt found within holes in the vase proved that the repairs were made prior to the vase being used in an ancient funeral. Conservators also discovered that the vase was restored in the late 19th century with materials and methods typical of the time period. Plaster, replacement pieces of terracotta, and extensive overpainting had been used in the restoration. Overpainting disguised repairs and also altered the appearance of nude satyrs on the decorative panels. The 1980s conservation revealed the original work of the Affecter Painter and restored the vase to a stable condition.Snow, Carol (1986). \\"The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration.\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44. Attic Black-Figure Volute-Krater, known as the Francois vase, ca. 570-565 BCE The Francois Vase, in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Florence, Italy, is a large Attic volute krater, which is both a superb example of black-figure pottery from c. 570-560 BCE, as well as an example of extensive conservation work. The vase was discovered in a tomb in 1844. In the year 1900, a member of the museum staff smashed the display case and the vase shattered into over 600 pieces. It was restored by 1902, and then restored again in 1973, with previously missing pieces.

After Binnya U's death in 1384, Ngan-Mohn was put in prison by his half-brother Razadarit who seized the throne with the help of the court. The prince was executed in 1389/90. Brief He was born to Mwei Ma-Gu-Thauk and King Binnya U of Hanthawaddy. He was named Baw Ngan-Mohn (also known as Baw Khon-Hmaing).(Pan Hla 2005: 47, footnote 6): Baw Ngan-Mohn per Pak Lat; Baw Khon-Hmaing per Razadarit Ayedawbon. His mother was a concubine but later became a queen with the title of Yaza Dewi.Pan Hla 2005: 44–45, 47 He was born 1370.Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 185) says that Ngan-Mohn was younger than his half-brother Binnya Nwe (Razadarit) who was born in 1368. According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle, the handsome and composed Ngan-Mohn was his father's favorite.Pan Hla 2005: 47–48 The king had anointed Ngan-Mohn as his heir-apparent certainly by 1382, perhaps even earlier.Pan Hla 2005: 64 By 1383, the king's health had deteriorated to such a degree that several pretenders began jockeying for power. Binnya U had handed much of the power to his sister Gov. Maha Dewi of Dagon although some factions of the court secretly opposed her. Ngan-Mohn also had a serious rival in his elder half- brother Binnya Nwe, who had been persuaded by Minister Zeik-Bye to raise a rebellion. Ngan-Mohn too saw his aunt Maha Dewi as a threat, and began allying himself with Nwe.Pan Hla 2005: 81 In May 1383, Nwe went on to start a rebellion at Dagon, 60 km southwest of the capital Pegu.Pan Hla 2005: 94 After the death of Binnya U in January 1384, the court handed the power to Nwe, who took the title Razadarit. Ngan-Mohn did not oppose Nwe's accession.Pan Hla 2005: 158 The new king in turn awarded Ngan-Mohn the title of Binnya Dok (ဗညားဒုတ်, ). Despite the initial gesture, Razadarit never trusted his younger half-brother. He could not forget their father's repeated statements that Ngan-Mohn was to be king. Soon after, he had Ngan-Mohn imprisoned.Pan Hla 2005: 185 Ngan-Mohn spent the next five plus years in prison. The prince was executed in the dry season of 1389–90 on the order of Razadarit.

As a method of preservation it has largely been replaced by freeze drying and preservation in alcohol. In some cases caterpillar inflation offers better colour retention than preservation in alcohol, although the rise of colour photography rendered this less important. A limitation of the technique was that it could produce poor results, in the form of oversized and distended specimens with poor colour, especially if carried out when the caterpillar was moulting or about to undergo pupation. Colour retention was not always perfect and some collectors painted or dyed their inflated specimens although water colours could distort the skin. Technique The caterpillar was first killed. If it was hairy then it was soaked in alcohol for half an hour before being left to dry out. The rear of the caterpillar was then cut open and the contents of the bowels squeezed out by applying gentle pressure to the outside of the caterpillar. Pressure would be applied, working from the rear towards the front of the caterpillar, until the intestines started to protrude from the cut. Forceps would then be used to pull the intestines from the caterpillar's body which would in turn drag out most of the rest of the caterpillar's innards with them. A straw was then inserted into the cut, and air blown into it while the caterpillar was gently heated in order to dry it. For an experienced practitioner the entire process took about 5 to 6 minutes. Once the caterpillar was dry it was ready to be prepared for mounting. This was done by pushing a loop of wire coated in shellac into the caterpillar via the cut, after which the wire was attached to an entomological pin for mounting in a storage cabinet. Various devices, such as miniature alcohol heated ovens, were developed to apply the techniques with different entomologists taking different approaches. A closely related technique was to inject the caterpillar with wax after the organ removal stage.

Carpenter was taken from her workplace in Surrey and found dead in the Fraser Canyon several weeks later, and the prime suspect, Fernand Auger, committed suicide before arrest. Disappearance On January 6, 1995, Melanie Carpenter, a 23-year-old woman from Surrey, British Columbia, had received suspicious phone calls from a man feigning interest in a business deal. Later that day, Carpenter was abducted from where she was working alone at a tanning salon in the Fleetwood town centre of Surrey. Investigation The afternoon that Carpenter went missing, a bank security camera recorded a 37-year-old man, Fernand Auger, making a $300 withdrawal using Carpenter's debit card, and the footage was shown on national TV the next day. Auger was a drifter from Ontario, frequently working as a waiter in restaurants, and had been a resident of Calgary, Alberta, until moving to British Columbia days before the murder. In August 1994, Auger had been released from prison in Bowden, Alberta, where he had served a 16-month sentence for armed robbery, and was on parole at the time. Auger quickly became the number one suspect in the abduction, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On January 15, 1995 Auger was found dead at a vacant home in High River, Alberta, south of Calgary, by a real estate agent during a viewing with a client. Auger had committed suicide in a garage on the property by inhaling carbon monoxide fumes from the engine of his car, a Hyundai Excel rented from Calgary. Carpenter's corpse was found shortly afterwards along an isolated road in a First Nations reserve near Hope, a rural town in British Columbia's Fraser Canyon, northeast of Chilliwack. Her body had been abandoned in a crevice and concealed by a white blanket.Carpenter's body found in B.C. Alberta Report / Newsmagazine, 02250519, 2/13/95, Vol. 22, Issue 9 Aftermath In 1995, the Melanie Carpenter Foundation was established to create a memorial for Carpenter.

Early life  Jose Petrick (née Tizard) was born in England in 1924. She trained as a secretary then as a nurse. She came to Australia on a working holiday in 1950 and worked in Sydney, Hobart and Adelaide.  Life in the Northern Territory  Eager to see a cattle station before she returned to England, Petrick came to the Northern Territory in 1951 to be a governess for three months on MacDonald Downs Station, 300 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs. She married Martyn Petrick from nearby Mt Swan Station in 1952 and had two children Suzette and Grant. In 1960, they moved to Neutral Junction Station near Barrow Creek, where Petrick ran the health centre in the community. When Martyn died in 1974, Petrick moved to Alice Springs and became a journalist with the Centralian Advocate. She wrote weekly features identifying the town’s 100 streets named after Central Australian pioneers. The Centralian Advocate then published the features in a booklet entitled Street Names tell History of Alice Springs and The Story of the Centralian Advocate Alice Springs first newspaper by Robert Watt. As the town grew more streets were named after pioneers, Aboriginal words and flora. Petrick wrote four more editions of the street name book and included landmarks named after people. The fifth edition, with more than 600 entries, entitled, The History of Alice Springs through Landmarks and Street Names was first published in 2010.  Later life  Petrick was awarded an Order of Australia Medal in January 2000, for the preservation and recording of the history of Alice Springs and for her voluntary work at the Old Timers Home. In June 2000, she carried the Olympic Torch in Alice Springs. Petrick is a life member of the Alice Springs Running & Walking Club, the National Trust, NT and Heritage Alice Springs Inc. She is a member of Alice Springs Toastmaster’s Club, the Probus Club of Stuart and U3A Alice Springs, Inc.

It is Thomas's debut novel, expanded from a short story she wrote in college in reaction to the police shooting of Oscar Grant. The book is narrated by Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl from a poor neighborhood who attends an elite private school in a predominantly white, affluent part of the city. Starr becomes entangled in a national news story after she witnesses a white police officer shoot and kill her childhood friend, Khalil. She speaks up about the shooting in increasingly public ways, and social tensions culminate in a riot after a grand jury decides not to indict the police officer for the shooting. The Hate U Give was published on February 28, 2017, by HarperCollins imprint Balzer + Bray, which had won a bidding war for the rights to the novel. The book was a commercial success, debuting at number one on The New York Times young adult best-seller list, where it remained for 50 weeks. It won several awards and received critical praise for Thomas's writing and timely subject matter. In writing the novel, Thomas attempted to expand readers' understanding of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as difficulties faced by black Americans who employ code switching. These themes, as well as the vulgar language, attracted some controversy and caused the book to be one of the most challenged books of 2017 and 2018 according to the American Library Association. The book was adapted into a film by Fox 2000 in October 2018, which received positive reviews. The novel was also adapted into an audiobook, won several awards and praise for its narrator, Bahni Turpin. Development and publication Shaken by the 2009 police shooting of Oscar Grant, then- college student Angie Thomas began the project as a short story for her senior project in Belhaven University's creative writing program. While writing the short story, the project quickly expanded, though Thomas put it aside for a few years after graduation. Speaking to her hometown newspaper, Thomas said, \\"I wanted to make sure I approached it not just in anger, but with love even\\". The deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and Sandra Bland drew Thomas back to expand the project into a novel, which she titled after Tupac Shakur's \\"THUG LIFE\\" concept: \\"The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody\\". Events surrounding the killings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and Michael Brown, and widespread ensuing protests against racism and police brutality, also informed moments in the book. Unsure whether publishers would be interested in the Black Lives Matter-inspired material, Thomas reached out to literary agent Brooks Sherman on Twitter in June 2015 to ask for advice. In February 2016, HarperCollins' imprint Balzer + Bray bought the rights to the novel in an auction, outbidding 13 other publishing houses, and signed a two-book deal with Thomas. Fox 2000 optioned the film rights the following month. The 464-page book was published on February 28, 2017, when the industry was attempting to address a decade-long stagnation in the number of children's books by African-American authors. Since its publication, Thomas has become an example of attempts by publishers to publish more young adult African-American novelists. Plot Starr Carter is a 16-year-old black girl who lives in the fictional, mostly poor black neighborhood of Garden Heights, but attends an affluent predominantly white private school, Williamson Prep. After a shooting breaks up a party Starr is attending, she is driven home by her childhood best friend and sometimes crush Khalil. They are stopped by a white police officer. The officer instructs Khalil, who is African American, to exit the car; while outside the car, Khalil leans into the driver-side window to check in on Starr. The officer then fires three shots into Khalil, killing him. Starr agrees to an interview with police about the shooting after being encouraged by her Uncle Carlos, who is also a detective. Carlos was a father figure to Starr when her father, Maverick, spent three years in prison for gang activity. Following his release, Maverick left the gang and became the owner of the Garden Heights grocery store where Starr and her half-brother Seven work. Maverick was only allowed to leave his gang, the King Lords, because he confessed to a crime to protect gang-leader King. Widely feared in the neighborhood, King now lives with Seven's mother, Seven's half-sister Kenya, who is friends with Starr, and Kenya's little sister, Lyric. Khalil's death becomes a national news story. The media portrays Khalil as a gang banger and drug dealer, while portraying the white officer who killed him more favourably. Starr's identity as the witness is initially kept secret from everyone outside Starr's family, including her younger brother Sekani. Keeping the secret from her white boyfriend Chris and her best friends Hailey Grant and Maya Yang – who all attend Williamson Prep;– weighs on Starr, as does her need to keep her Williamson and Garden Heights personalities separate. Starr's struggles with her identity are further complicated after her mother gets a higher-paying job and the family moves out of Garden Heights. After a grand jury fails to indict the white officer, Garden Heights erupts into both peaceful protests and riots. The failure of the criminal justice system to hold the officer accountable pushes Starr to take an increasingly public role, first giving a television interview and then speaking out during the protests, which are met by police in riot gear. Her increasing identification with the people of Garden Heights causes tension with Starr's friends, especially with her boyfriend Chris. But by the end of the novel, Starr and Maya have started standing up to Hailey's racist comments while Chris offers support to Starr. The climax of the novel occurs during the riot following the grand jury decision. Starr, Chris, Seven, and DeVante – who Maverick helped leave the King Lords – successfully defend Maverick's store from King. The neighborhood stands up to King and as a result of testimony by DeVante, King is arrested and expected to be imprisoned for a lengthy sentence. Starr promises to keep Khalil's memory alive and to continue her advocacy against injustice. Style Vincent Haddad of Central State University reads The Hate U Give as an attempt to build empathy with the Black Lives Matter movement, as \\"the appeals for empathy figured by Starr's first-person account ultimately serve to discipline those who seek solutions deemed too 'un-realistic' to oppose the 'sustained violence against Black communities. By maintaining realism, and explicitly naming real-world victims of police brutality, Haddad contends that Thomas is able to spur action in her readers. However, he ultimately feels that there are limits to this approach because it is about the individual rather than the collective. By contrast, Vox's Constance Grady argues that this realism is what makes the novel ultimately work to larger purposes: \\"The specificity and whimsy of ideas like the anger scale of breakup songs is what keeps The Hate U Give moving so deftly through its heavy subject matter; it stays warm and focused and grounded in character even when it's dealing with big, amorphous ideas like systemic racism.\\" Themes Examining race relations is a core theme of the novel. Professor Khalil Muhammad of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government sees the novel as a way to have discussions among people who might not otherwise discuss Black Lives Matter: \\"The book – and to some degree the movie – has been read and will be read by students in all-white spaces, where otherwise the urgency of these issues has not affected them personally.\\" At the same time, it could offer solace for black teens who have faced similar challenges to Starr. An example of this is Starr's ability to code switch between her private school and home, which Thomas demonstrates through the slang that Starr uses in each context's dialogue. Also helping Starr is her family who offer a variety of points of view, including her Uncle's thoughts as a police officer and her father teaching Starr and her siblings about the Black Panther Party. The novel also shows Starr's parents' struggles with remaining connected to their community while needing to protect and give opportunity to their children. The Hate U Give shows Starr's dual need to respond both to the trauma of witnessing Khalil's death and her need to do so politically. This dual need, combined with Thomas's ability to root these struggles in their historical context, helps give the book its power, according to Jonathan Alexander writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books. Los Angeles Times critic Adriana Ramirez sees Starr as similar to the protagonists of fantasy dystopian novels like Divergent and The Hunger Games as she seeks to change an entrenched system of power, noting, \\"it is also a dystopian young adult novel that happens to be set in reality\\". Nick Smart, a professor at the College of New Rochelle, takes this further, stating, \\"In The Hate U Give, there's also a girl – who happens to be a black girl – being sent out against the system, against the world, against an entrenched opposition\\", while Ramirez notes that Starr's blackness is a core element for some readers. Before its publication, exploring a female perspective on the isolation and need to be a model minority at an elite private school was something which had not been conducted in literature or film with the same frequency as for males. Thomas's ability to capture these feelings stemmed from her own experiences with the reactions of her white classmates following the death of Oscar Grant. The novel does not shy away from the realities of urban life, exemplified by the title's reference to the Tupac Shakur quote. Starr's feelings about Khalil evolve during the novel. The reader is first introduced to him at the party as a friend of Starr's and as a victim of a police shooting. This narrative is then complicated both for Starr and in the novel's world at large when it is learned that Khalil dealt drugs. However, Starr comes to disagree with the way the media is portraying Khalil. As Starr finds her own agency, she is able to challenge this narrative first for herself and then for others, recognizing that Khalil was forced into these circumstances by poverty, hunger, and a desire to care for his drug addict mother. She is able to show her courage speaking to the grand jury, and realizes that she needs to participate in the protests which follow its decision. How and where Khalil and Starr can find justice also drives Starr's decision to join in the protests.  Reception  The book debuted at the top of The New York Times young adult (YA) best-seller list, and was on it for more than 80 weeks. The book had 100,000 copies in print in the first month, eventually selling more than 850,000 copies . The book was popular with readers, winning Goodreads annual awards vote in the categories of Best Young Adult Fiction and Debut Author. Critics also widely praised the book. In the Christian Science Monitor, Katie Ward Beim-Esche wrote, \\"Believe the hype: The Hate U Give, Angie Thomas's extraordinary and fearless debut, really is that good.\\" Shannon Ozirny of The Globe and Mail also felt it would have wide appeal, \\"Ignore the YA label – this should be the one book everyone reads this year.\\" On Salon, Erin Keane wrote that the novel is \\"topical, urgent, necessary, and if that weren't enough, it's also a highly entertaining and engaging read.\\" The book also earned starred reviews by multiple review journals. Kirkus, which nominated the book for its Kirkus Prize, praised both its writing and timelines: \\"With smooth but powerful prose ... This story is necessary. This story is important.\\" Young adult literature expert Michael Cart, writing in Booklist, also praised Thomas's writing as Starr: \\"Beautifully written in Starr's authentic first-person voice, this is a marvel of verisimilitude.\\" While praising the overall book in a starred review, School Library Journals Mahnaz Dar criticized the writing of several characters as \\"slightly uneven\\". The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, Horn Book Magazine, and VOYA also gave the book their equivalents of starred reviews. =Awards= The book was recognized in 2018 by the American Library Association with the William C. Morris Award for best debut book for teens, the Coretta Scott King Award for the best novel by an African-American author for children, and was an honor book for the Michael L. Printz Award for best novel for teens. The novel also won the overall Waterstones Children's Book Prize and American Bookseller's Association Indie Award for Best Young Adult Novel. The Hate U Give was named to the National Book Awards longlist for young adult literature, was nominated for the 2018 Carnegie Medal, and won the 2018 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in the \\"young adult jury\\" section. =Challenges= The American Library Association listed the book as one of the ten most-challenged books of 2017 and 2018, \\"because it was considered 'pervasively vulgar' and because of drug use, profanity, and offensive language\\". In July 2018, a South Carolina police union raised objections to the inclusion of the book, as well as the similarly themed All American Boys by Brendan Kiely and Jason Reynolds, in the summer reading list for ninth- grade students of Wando High School. A representative of the police lodge described the inclusion of the books as \\"almost indoctrination of distrust of police\\" and asserted that \\"we've got to put a stop to that.\\" The books remained on the list and Wando's principal was later recognized by the state school library association for her defense of the challenged books. The book was removed from the school libraries of the Katy Independent School District due to its explicit language. Thomas responded to these challenges by defending the book's message and saying that it is a spur for conversation. Adaptations = Film = Fox 2000 optioned The Hate U Give for a film adaption in March 2016, shortly after the book's auction. Director George Tillman Jr. and actress Amandla Stenberg were immediately attached to the project. The movie also features Issa Rae, Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, Algee Smith, KJ Apa, Lamar Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Common, and Sabrina Carpenter. The film is based on a screenplay by Audrey Wells, who died one day before it was released. Stenberg's casting received some criticism because of her lighter complexion as compared to the girl on the novel's cover. The movie was given a limited release on October 5, 2018, and a wide release on October 19, 2018. The film was favorably received, with a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 8.2 out of 10, and an A+ CinemaScore. the film had a worldwide box office gross of $34 million against a budget of $23 million. =Audiobook= An audiobook was released by Harper Audio on the same day as the novel and featured narration by Bahni Turpin, whom Thomas had selected. Audiobook producer Caitlin Garing spoke of the importance of matching the material with the narrator and spoke of Turpin's skill, \\"you can trust her to get to the heart of a story and lead the listener there\\". It was well reviewed and won Audie Awards for best YA and best female narrator. In her acceptance speech, Turpin said it was \\"an important book for our time\\". It also won the 2018 Odyssey Award for best children's audiobook. Odyssey committee chair Joan Schroeder Kindig said, \\"Bahni Turpin's powerful narration of this timely novel will inspire listeners to find their own voices.\\" Turpin downplayed the award saying, \\"I don't think the public is aware of most of our awards, though – in general, I think those who most appreciate the awards are ... the people in the business of books\\". Publishers Weekly, in its starred review of the audiobook, praised Turpin's abilities to convey \\"the complexity of the 16-year-old protagonist who sounds both youthful and mature for her age, as she relies on code-switching to navigate two different social settings\\". Maggie Knapp in her starred review for School Library Journal and Lynette Pitrak in her starred review for Booklist also praised Turpin's ability to capture Starr's voice in her performance.

In 1965 she became the first Aboriginal woman to have a pre-school named in her honour in Australia. Early life Glynn was born at Woodgreen Station in Central Australia, the daughter of Ron Price and Topsy Glynn, a housemaid and cook. She had one half- sister Freda. Topsy and her two children were placed in a \\"half-caste institution\\", a home for people of mixed European and Aboriginal descent known as The Bungalow at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station in September 1939. Glynn was just three year's old at the time. Topsy worked as a laundress at the institution in order to stay with her children. Career Glynn attended the Alice Springs Higher Primary School in 1951 and was known to be an excellent student. At the age of 16, she became the first Aboriginal school teacher in Central Australia. She was appointed by the South Australian Department of Education as junior teacher at the Alice Springs school after gaining her Intermediate Certificate in four subjects. She then took the position of a grade two teacher at Hartley Street Primary School. She later wrote a column for the Centralian Advocate. She was evacuated from Alice Springs to New South Wales during World War II. When she returned, she lived at the newly established St Mary’s Church of England Hostel on the Stuart Highway. In 1954, Glynn moved to Melbourne to train as a nurse.. She undertook General training at the Melbourne School of Nursing, graduating in 1957. The following year she undertook Midwifery training at the Royal Women's Hospital, also in Melbourne, where after completing the year long course she remained on staff, becoming a Charge Sister. In 1962 Glynn returned to Alice Springs where she became the first Aboriginal Charge Sister (Maternity Ward) at the Alice Springs Hospital. She delivered around 2000 babies. She was known for taking grapefruits from the garden of the matron's quarters and distributing them among the new mothers on the ward. Annoyed, the matron stormed the ward asking whether anyone what was happening to the fruit. Glynn apparently placed her finger to her lips indicating the mothers to be quiet. When the matron left, they continued eating the grapefruit. Legacy In 1964 Glynn married pastoralist Bill Schaber. She died the following year after complications from childbirth. A pre-school located at Ross Park Primary School was named after her in 1965. She was the first Aboriginal woman to have a pre-school named in her honour in Australia.

It is a ground orchid with a single sparsely hairy leaf and up to three white to cream-coloured flowers which sometimes have red streaks. It is similar to Caladenia reticulata but is large and taller with more stiffly spreading lateral sepals and petals. Description Caladenia valida is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single sparsely hairy leaf, 100–150 mm long and 10–25 mm wide with red blotches near its base. One, two or three flowers up to 70 mm wide are borne on a hairy spike 200–400 mm high. The sepals have dark red, club-like glandular tips 3–5 mm long. The dorsal sepal is erect or curved forward, 35–50 mm long and about 3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 35–50 mm long and about 4 mm wide and curve stiffly downwards. The petals are 35–45 mm long, 2–3 mm wide and curve downwards. The labellum is cream-coloured to white, 12–15 mm long, 9–11 mm wide with red markings. The sides of the labellum have reddish teeth up to 2 mm long, the tip of the labellum is curved downwards and there are four or six rows of reddish calli up to about 1 mm long, along its mid-line. Flowering occurs in September and October. Caladenia reticulata is similar and C. valida was originally described as a variety of it but is a larger, taller orchid with more stiffly spreading sepals and petals and is pollinated by different species of thynnid wasp - C. reticulata is pollinated by Phymatothynnus victor and C. valida by Phymatothynnus pygidialis. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1942 by William Henry Nicholls who gave it the name Caladenia reticulata var. valida. The type specimen was collected near Portland and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989 Mark Clements and David Jones raised it to species status in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (valida) is a Latin word meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"powerful\\" although Nicholls did not give a reason for applying this name. Distribution and habitat The robust spider orchid occurs in Victoria and South Australia where it grows in coastal, or near- coastal heath. In Victoria it grows near Portland and Anglesea and in South Australia on Kangaroo Island and southern Fleurieu Peninsula. Conservation Caladenia valida is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and under the Government of South Australia National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.

She became the eighth president of the Women's Relief Corps in 1890, which at the time, was the largest fraternal association in the country. Early years and education Mary Sears was a native of New Boston village, in the town of Sandisfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, December 30, 1834. Her parents were David G. and Olive (Deming) Sears. She was descended from an old English family that can be traced back through a long line of preachers, scholars, patriots and nobles. The Sears family was of Saxon origin, and the family line extended back to Edward III. The American branch came directly from Richard Sears, who was married to Lady Anne Bonchier Knyvet. Their only son, John Bonchier Sears, was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Hawkins, the navigator and admiral. Their great-grandson, Richard Sears, came to America and was called \\"the Pilgrim.\\" He married and settled in Plymouth, and his descendants have distinguished themselves as patriots, scholars, statesmen and philanthropists. Some of their descendants were foremost in resenting the Stamp Act. Isaac Sears led the company that marched to the house of the lieutenant-governor to demand the stamps. Such was the energy of Isaac Sears and his influence in the American Colonies that he was nicknamed \\"King Sears\\". Two of this family fitted out at their own expense war vessels, which engaged in battles on the sea during the American Revolutionary War. One of them established the first bank in America. Barnas Sears, D.D., LL.D., an uncle of McHenry and served as professor in Hamilton College, New York, later president of Newton Theological Seminary, then president of Brown University, and afterwards superintendent of the Peabody Education Fund. David G. Sears, after the birth of his daughter Mary, resided successively in Hartford, Connecticut and in New York City, engaged in the mercantile business. The family subsequently settled in Ogle County, Illinois, where the father purchased a section of land and applied himself to farming. Mary Sears completed her school studies at the Rockford Seminary (now Rockford University) in Rockford, Illinois. It was here that she met William A. McHenry, a young man employed by her father. Their courtship was interrupted by the American Civil War's call for volunteers. In the stress of patriotism, marriage plans were held in abeyance and the young man enlisted for three years of service. After three years in the army, Mr. McHenry's period of enlistment ended and it was planned that he should return to Illinois, to wed. After his re-enlistment as a Sergeant of Company S, 8th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry, he obtained a furlough and on January 28, 1864, the couple wed at the Rockford home. Career The furlough was for 30 days. During that time, William's brother, Morris, then treasurer of Crawford County, Illinois, visited his brother and his wife, and knowing her clerical ability and excellent handwriting, he proposed that she come to Crawford County to act as deputy treasurer and recorder. This offer was accepted and Mrs. McHenry moved to this county, while her husband rejoined his regiment. When her husband returned from the American Civil War, they settled in Denison, Louisiana. The husband became a banker and a breeder of Angus cattle. He was interested in the Relief Corps and also in other patriotic and charitable work in which his wife was a leader. He was Department Commander of Iowa G. A. R., 1886–87, and represented that order in San Francisco at the National Encampment, Grand Army of the Republic (G. A. R.), in 1886. A local camp of Sons of Veterans bears his name, W. A. McHenry Camp, S. of V., No. 53. In July, 1883, at the convention in Denver, Colorado, of all the women's societies in the country that were working for the Grand Army of the Republic, McHenry was an unauthorized representative from Iowa. The Denver convention resulted in the organization of the National Woman's Relief Corps. Upon McHenry's return to Denison, a local corps was formed under her leadership. She was elected President thereof, and was active in the work throughout the State. After serving in various other capacities, she was chosen Department President of Iowa, and later served as Department Treasurer. At the convention held in Tremont Temple, Boston, in July, 1890, McHenry was elected National President, to succeed Annie Turner Wittenmyer. Her administration was conducted in an able manner, and in her travels in several States, she gave such a favorable impression of the order that many corps and members were added to its rolls. At the next national convention, in Detroit, Michigan, in August, 1891, McHenry gave a detailed and interesting account of the year's work. Private life McHenry was a liberal contributor to various charities. In her later years, she was interested in public work. The McHenry's had four children, two sons and two daughters. She died at her summer home on the banks of Lake Okoboji, in Iowa, on July 26, 1912. Her remains were brought to Denison and she was buried in the Oakland cemetery.

The first of these sieges was carried out by Satyros I, the father of Leukon I. Prelude Satyros had recently bribed Gylon, an Athenian official of Nymphaeum, to hand over the city. He had recently acquired the city of Phanagoria as well prior to laying siege to Theodosia. He had also recently involved himself with the Sindike Kingdom, attempting to gain influence with the king Hekataios by deposing the king's wife, Tirgatao. Satyros then besieged Theodosia to attempt to make it a part of his dominions. Siege Satyros I had been besieging Theodosia with little success until he had to shift his attention to Tirgatao, an Ixomataen queen who was wronged by Satyros and began laying both fire and sword to his land back east, as well as having killed his son Metrodoros. Heraclea Pontica came to the aid of Theodosia, perhaps possibly to protect their colony at Chersonesus from the rule of the expansionist Spartocids whose domain was ever increasing. Upon returning, Satyros died of despair while sieging at the age of 81, having had two wars that he was losing on two fronts. On his death, he passed over his throne to two of his sons, Leukon I and Gorgippos who would later finish what he began. Aftermath Around 20 years after the death of Satyros, his son Leukon began a second Siege of Theodosia in around 365 BC. Leukon lifted this siege due to Heraclea Pontica sending Tynnichus, one of its generals, to aid the city and who succeeded in doing so. The city was conquered around 5 years after that, but the Bosporans had enraged the full wrath of Heraclea Pontica, and received another war from Heracleia Pontica.

Her second young adult novel, On the Come Up, was released on February 25, 2019.  Early life  Angie Thomas was born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, where she still resides today. Thomas was subjected to multiple instances of gun violence at a young age. She grew up near the home of assassinated civil rights activist Medgar Evers, stating that her mother heard the gunshot that killed him. When she was six years old, Thomas witnessed a shootout. In an interview with The Guardian, she recounted how her mother took her to the library the following day to show her that “there was more to the world than what [Thomas] saw that day.” This inspired her to take up writing. In her adolescence, Thomas shared her skills as a rapper, although her career in music was short-lived. She was, however, the subject of an article in Right On! magazine. Thomas went on to obtain a BFA from Belhaven University, a private Christian college in Mississippi. She was the first black teenager to graduate in creative writing.  Career  Thomas' initial intention was to write fantasy and middle grade novels; however, she was worried that her stories would not matter. While querying her first manuscript, she began another that would soon turn out to be her first novel, The Hate U Give. While she was a college student, one of her professors suggested that her experiences were unique and that her writing could give a voice to those who had been silenced and whose stories had not been told. During this time, Thomas also heard about the shooting of Oscar Grant on the news. This story, compounded by the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, and Sandra Bland, was a major influence on the novel. Thomas cites Tupac Shakur as inspiration for her writing. She has felt a wide range of emotions when listening to his music, and wanted to achieve a similar effect as a writer, saying, \\"I want to make you think at times; I want to make you laugh at times; I want to make you cry at times – so he was an influence in that way.\\" She has explained that the title The Hate U Give was inspired by Tupac's THUG LIFE tattoo, which was supposedly an acronym for \\"The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody.\\" Thomas understands that to mean, \\"that what society feeds into youth has a way of coming back and affecting us all.\\" In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Thomas stated that she aims to \\"show truth and tear down stereotypes\\" in her writing, and further says that it is important for the white community to listen to the grievances of the Black Lives Matter movement. After its publication, The Hate U Give was adapted into a 2018 film of the same name by Fox 2000, starring Amandla Stenberg.  Activism  In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Thomas gives insight on her role as an activist, “I’ve always seen writing as a form of activism. If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before; they can promote empathy. There is the movement Black Lives Matter and the organization Black Lives Matter, and I respect what both are doing. I know [The Hate U Give] is an “issue” book, but I didn't necessarily want it to be that way... I wanted to make something that is so political seem personal. While I wanted Khalil to represent these young men who lose their lives and are quickly labeled thugs, I wanted [the plot of the book] to be its own thing. I didn't want to disrespect anyone's family, anyone's memory.”  Works  = The Hate U Give (2017) = The Hate U Give, originally written as a short story, debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list for young adult hardcover books within the first week of its release in 2017. The Hate U Give was written, as Thomas says, to bring light to the controversial issue of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. The book's plot follows a teenage girl, Starr Carter, and how her life is impacted by the death of her friend, Khalil, an unarmed black teen shot by a white police officer. The Hate U Give deals with the effect of police brutality on the communities of those around the victim. In 2018, the Katy Independent School District in Katy, Texas removed the book from its shelves after complaints over profanity, and a South Carolina police union requested the book's removal from a school's summer reading list, because of what the union considered \\"almost an indoctrination of distrust of police.\\" = On the Come Up (2019) = Thomas' second book On the Come Up was released in February 2019. Thomas wrote the book so she could discuss the costs tolled on minorities and women when they do speak-up. The book tells the story of a teen rapper who becomes a viral sensation and the way that this distorts and changes who she is. It takes place in the same fictional universe as The Hate U Give. The book was a bestseller. On December 11, 2019, Thomas shared on Twitter that Kay Oyegun, producer of This is Us, has been recruited to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of On the Come Up. = Concrete Rose (2021) = Thomas has tweeted multiple times about the process of writing her third book. On March 30, 2020, Thomas revealed her third novel Concrete Rose. The book is a prequel to The Hate U Give and is set to be released on January 12, 2021 in the US and the UK. The book tells the story of Starr's father Maverick Carter.  Accolades  Angie Thomas has received several major awards for her work, including: *2015 **Walter Grant from We Need Diverse Books *2018 **William C. Morris Award for The Hate U Give **Michael L. Printz Award Honor for The Hate U Give **Coretta Scott King Award Honor for The Hate U Give **Amnesty CILIP Honour for The Hate U Give **Waterstones Children's Book Prize for The Hate U Give **Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis for the German edition of The Hate U Give (translated by Henriette Zeltner) References External links * Living people 1988 births Writers from Jackson, Mississippi 21st-century American novelists Belhaven University alumni African-American novelists American women novelists 21st-century American women writers ","title":"Angie Thomas"},{"id":"53598889","text":"Pontibacter akesuensis is a bacterium from the genus of Pontibacter which has been isolated from desert soil in Akesu in China.

Satyrus I, the father of Leukon, had previously laid siege on Theodosia but died during it. The exact numbers of the forces in the siege aren't known. Siege After becoming king of the Bosporan Kingdom in 389 BC, Leukon would later attacked the city of Theodosia perhaps as revenge for the death of his father, who died at Theodosia that same year. Tynnichus, a probable Heracleote commander, was sent with a small force to relieve the siege, numbering less than 200 men. Tynnichus managed to send three small boats under the cover of darkness, in which each boat had a trumpeter. He then had his trumpeters make the loudest din they could possible do, taking care that at least two were playing at the same time so that it would sound much stronger than it actually was. The Bosporan army, upon hearing the sound of what should've been an army coming to relief the city, fled. He also successfully defeated the Bosporans as he managed to destroy their siege weapons at night. Leukon was forced to retreat back to Panticapaeum. Aftermath Leukon retreated back to Panticapaeum shortly after Tynnicus lifted the siege. Due to his failure at Theodosia, he had to deal with a conspiracy against his life by his closest friends and advisors. He swiftly dealt with the conspiracy with the aid of merchants and sometime in 360 BC, he attacked the city of Theodosia again, starting another siege, but this time finally being able to take the city.

Story The villainous figure the Jackal on the panel from The Amazing Spider-Man #146 (July 1975) also debuted in this comic, art by Ross Andru. A new costumed character called the Jackal has appeared and hired a vigilante, the Punisher, to kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man, meanwhile, is web-slinging through the city contemplating the recent death of his girlfriend Gwen Stacy; he stops to take some pictures of a robbery and stop it along the way. He takes the photos to the Daily Bugle as Peter Parker, where J. Jonah Jameson has a fit that Parker has not been able to get any photos of the Punisher, and that all the competition is snapping up photos of him in action. Peter leaves and changes back to Spider-Man, and soon finds himself attacked by the Punisher, who thinks that Spider-Man is a regular crook just like everyone else he kills. The vigilante does not have much of an upper hand against Spider-Man, and the Jackal (who was hiding near the battle) decides to attack him. When his claws rake the back of Spider-Man's head, the Punisher calls the Jackal on his \\"unjust\\" methods of killing Spider-Man. Spider-Man manages to get away when he stumbles off the edge of the building they are fighting on, gains control, and swings away. When the Jackal and Punisher depart, Spider- Man returns to the scene and collects on the Punisher's weapon that was left behind and sees that it was made by a company named Reiss Armories. As he returns to his apartment, now dressed as Peter Parker he mends his costume, unaware that his friend Harry Osborn is listening and suspecting that Peter may know that he has decided take up the mantle of the Green Goblin after his father. While at ESU, Miles Warren has sought out Mary Jane Watson to see if she can pass along an apology to Peter over their brief run-in while he was trying to get help for her when the Vulture had captured her.Amazing Spider- Man #127-128 At the secret hideout of the Jackal, the Punisher lashes out at the Jackal over their methods of elimination. The Punisher leaves to go to the Mechanic, his gun supplier, to resupply. This quest brings him to Reiss Armories, where he finds Spider-Man, who just stumbled upon the Mechanic's dead body. Believing that Spider-Man was the one who had killed the Mechanic, the Punisher attacks him. During their fight, Spider-Man manages to get the upper hand and bind the Punisher. He then makes the vigilante see that the Jackal's trademark clawings were the cause of the Mechanic's death. Realizing that the Jackal had been manipulating him to do his dirty work and then intended to frame him for murder, the Punisher vows to get revenge against the Jackal and storms out, leaving Spider-Man alone at the crime scene. When Spider-Man hears police sirens on their way there, he leaves as well. The Jackal, watching on, vows that he will eventually destroy Spider-Man. Reception The magazine Complex ranked the cover by Kane and Romita as both the number 32nd most iconic Spider-Man image ever and the fourth best The Amazing Spider-Man cover of all time. Comic Book Resources named the cover to be the twelfth greatest Spider-Man cover of all time in 2012 and again in 2017. The issue was voted by fans as the fiftieth greatest Marvel Comics issue of all time in 2001 and therefore was included in the trade paperback 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time, and the fifty-seventh greatest single Marvel comic book issue ever in 2017. CBR.com ranked the story \\"The Punisher Strikes Twice\\" as the 32nd greatest Punisher story of all time. The Punisher's unusual behaviour for a character in a superhero comic made his debut controversial, with very few characters being willing to kill at that time in the medium. Greg Turner of Back to the Past stated in his review that as far as an introduction goes, it was good for the Punisher and that it was no surprise that the character showed up soon again in issue #134, since he proved very popular. Todd Frye, the author of the book Marvelous Mythology, asserted that the Punisher was unusual even as a super-villain at the time, stating that the character's willingness to kill with conventional military weaponry, as opposed to using technological sci-fi gadgets which instead stunned the hero like most antagonists, was something new. Kenny Coburn of ComicVerse expressed that from reading the issue one gets a good grip about the Punisher's philosophy on killing and his code of conduct which is bonded with a strict moral code, which according to Coburn clearly indicates that the character was meant to be sympathetic from the beginning, in contrast to most of Spider- Man's villains whom were introduced at the time. Coburn also expressed that it was easy to see how the Punisher stood out against other characters of the time, starting: \\"[after realizing that he's been manipulated by the Jackal] The Punisher punches a wall and walks away, mumbling about how he is fighting a lonely war. It's this type of dark brooding that makes it easy to see why the Punisher didn't fit in after his initial debut, especially juxtaposed against Spider-Man's bright colors and constant quips.\\" In difference from Coburn, Mark Ginocchio, the author of 100 Things Spider-Man Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die believes that the Punisher's success as a character was mostly an accident and that the main focus of the story and the character that was introduced and meant to be a major player for the Marvel Universe was the Jackal.https://www.batmansbookcase.com/updates/2018/9/4/the-punishers-code-a- look-at-frank-castles-first-appearance-in-amazing-spider-man-129 Legacy The character of the Punisher was well received at the time and his characterization has stayed largely consistent since his introduction in this issue. None of the character's backstory is given in the issue besides him being a Marine veteran and his core personality would be more refined by later authors. The character, whose real name was later revealed to be Frank Castle, would return to the comic only a few issues later in Amazing Spider-Man #134-135; after that, he received some solo one-shots before gaining his own limited series and later three ongoing series in the 80's and 90's. During that time, the Punisher was one of Marvel Comics' most profitable and well- known characters and remains integral to the company in recent years, with his skull insignia being an iconic symbol. As a breakout character for Marvel, like few others the character helped launch the enduring popularity of anti- heroes in superhero comics. According to Jason Serafino of Complex magazine, despite the character's many incarnations and interpretations as everything between a lone vigilante, a spandex-wearing superhero and a supernatural guardian angel, the character always eventually retreats back to his grim and violent origins, which were portrayed in this first comic. The events of the comic are mirrored in Ultimate Spider-Man #157, in which Spider-Man ends up taking a bullet to save the life of Captain America from an assassination attempt by the Punisher, which was described by Andy Khouri of ComicsAlliance as a clever call-back and a fairly poetic way for Spider-Man to die in the Ultimate Comics Universe alternate continuity.

Its conservation status is listed as ‘Not threatened’.  Description  The heath is a slender erect shrub that grows to a height of 60–90 cm or 90–120 cm, depending on its location. It is often branched near the base, with crowded, spreading leaves that are narrowly linear-lanceolate to lanceolate in shape, 5-13mm long and 0.6-3mm wide. Its leaves are smooth, flat or concave, with the mid-vein upturned towards the apex beneath and obscure venation. The leaves are hard and have are sharp point at the tip with a leathery feel. The woolly heath mostly flowers from late winter to early summer. When in bloom, small white flowers forming in dense terminal clusters along the upper 10 cm or more of branches. With 13-30 bracts and lanceolate sepals about 4.5-7.5mm long both brown with a papery texture. The corolla is white and tubular to narrowly bell shaped 4.5-8mm long, equal to or slightly longer than the calyx, with tiny white hairs internally, the petal lobes 2.7–4 mm long, obtuse; anthers enclosed within the corolla tube; ovary also finely hairy, nectary scales narrowly triangular, style slightly thicker and pubescent in middle third, 5.5–7.5 mm long. Its fruit is a papery capsule. When the lower capsule on the stem has opened the capsules higher on the stem are ready to collect. Germination of the seed takes place under dark conditions and using heat shock combined with smoke and water treatments. elanuginosa.jpgEpacris lanuginosa Photo courtesy of Rob Wiltshire  Habitat and distribution  Common in southeast Australia Epacris lanuginosa is natively found in very few parts of NSW, Victoria across the south from predominately in; Glenelg Plain, Otway Plain, Greater Grampians, East Gippsland Lowlands and Wilsons Promontory. It is also found in evenly distributed across Tasmania, including all the islands that surround the state. It is abundant in wet heathland environments, from sea-level to 1000m. In wet scrub and in healthy forests, on poorly drained peaty soils that are moist and waterlogged.  Threats and conservation  Epacris lanuginosa is highly susceptible to the exotic fungal rot root disease Phytophthora cinnamomi. It is a water mould pathogen that can cause disease and death by impairing the plants physiological and biochemical functions where the roots are the primary site of infection. Although there is currently a threat abatement plan in place for the reduction of the pathogen, it has only recently been implemented and the heath is still vulnerable to contracting the disease.

As a consequence of the taxes imposed by the Ming dynasty, the aboriginal chieftains She Chongming and An Bangyan rose up in revolt. The rebellion lasted almost eight years and was eventually suppressed in the summer of 1629. Background The Ming dynasty raised taxes to finance the war effort in the frontier province of Liaodong where the Jurchens were invading. Provinces such as Sichuan and Guizhou were required to provide troops, supplies, and grain as taxes. Rebellion The Yongning (now Xuyong) tusi chief She Chongming originally agreed to provide Ming 1,500,000 kg of grain and 20,000 Yi tribal warriors for Liaodong. However, when he showed up at Chongqing in 1621 he brought with him 20,000 troops along with their families numbering an additional 80,000, including animals. When the local governor informed them that only fighters were needed and ordered the majority of them to return home while refusing to provide food for the trip back, they attacked Chongqing, killed the governor, and several of the local officials. It's likely that She planned to attack Chongqing from the beginning since he had already started laying waste to regions he passed through on the way to Chongqing. According to one traveler in the region at the time, \\"any semblance to human activity is gone.\\" She proclaimed the Kingdom of Shu with himself as its ruler and sent his forces, which had reportedly swelled by an additional 100,000 Chinese renegades, to conquer Sichuan. The rebels swept from Sichuan into Guizhou, taking Zunyi, but were unable to conquer Chengdu, which they besieged unsuccessfully for 102 days. Chongqing was recovered by Ming forces a month later. Following in She Chongming's footsteps, the tusi of Nasu Yi, An Bangyan, also sent troops instead of grain as tax payment. When the Ming officials refused his troops rations and supplies, An rebelled as well and joined She Chongming \\"in order to reclaim his ancestors' glory.\\" Together the two aboriginal chieftains marched on Guiyang with an army of 300,000 and besieged it. Although Guiyang only contained 5,000 soldiers, the indigenous army was unable to penetrate its defenses since they only attacked one side at a time. The siege of Guiyang was lifted after 296 days in late winter of 1622. Barely 200 defenders survived. An Bangyang retreated into his mountain hideouts and feigned surrender, but when an envoy was sent to negotiate his surrender, he had the messenger killed. The rebellion renewed in the spring of 1623 when a Ming army of 40,000 was ambushed and killed by local aboriginals. The commander on the scene, Zhu Xieyuan, immediately requested an additional 200,000 troops as well as three million taels in supplies to suppress the rebellion. A year later, the conflict in Sichuan was still ongoing. The Ming army had reportedly killed 18,000 rebels, but could not decisively end the rebellion due to a lack of supplies. By 1625, 27,500 rebels had been killed. Conflict in the Sichuan- Guizhou region would continue until the summer of 1629 when eventually a total of 450,000 troops were mobilized to engage with She Chongming and An Bangyang's Shu forces. Both rebel leaders perished in battle the same year, The Kingdom of Shu was quickly dismantled. Aftermath The She-An Rebellion took an astronomical toll on Ming finances. The entire anti-rebellion effort costed the Ming a total of 35 million taels of silver and consumed 145 billion kilograms of grain.

Early life Born at Clatto House, near Cupar in Fife, the eldest son of Captain Robert Low of Clatto, and his wife (the daughter of Dr. Robert Malcolm). He was educated at St. Andrews University, attending the sessions of 1802–3 (Register), and in 1804 obtained a Madras cadetship on the nomination of John Hudleston. Military career On 17 July 1805 Low was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 1st Madras Native Infantry. For the part taken by six of its companies in Vellore mutiny the regiment was disbanded in January 1807; Low became an officer in the reformed 24th Madras Infantry. In 1816 the 24th was renumbered as the 1st Madras Infantry, in recognition of its conduct at the battle of Sitabuldi. Low became captain in the regiment in 1820, major 17th Madras infantry (late 2nd battalion 24th) in 1828, and lieutenant-colonel 19th Madras infantry in 1834. In 1839 he obtained the colonelcy of his old corps, the 1st Madras Infantry, which he held for the rest of his life. He became a major- general in 1854, lieutenant-general in 1859, general in 1867, and was placed on the retired list in 1874. Low saw in his early years varied military service. He was attached to the office of the quartermaster-general, 11 May 1810; rejoined his corps in February 1811; was attached to the 59th Foot in the Java expedition of 1811, and was wounded at the storming of Fort Cornelis. He was brigade-major in the ceded districts, and was Persian interpreter and head of the intelligence staff to Colonel Dowse in the South Mahratta country in 1812–13. He was in commissariat charge of Brigadier William Tuyl's force sent against the Guntoor rebels in 1816; and was present at the defeat of the Mahrattas at the Battle of Mahidpur, 21 December 1817, as extra aide-de-camp to Sir John Malcolm. In March following, as first political assistant to Malcolm, he was employed with a force of three thousand men and ten guns in pacifying the Chindwarra district. Resident and political agent Low induced the Mahratta Peshwa, Baji Rao II, to place himself under British protection. When Baji Rao retired to Bithoor, near Kanpur, Low was appointed Resident there. He filled the post for six years. From that time Low's services were mostly political, though at Lucknow and later at Hyderabad his functions included the control of troops. In 1825 he became political agent at Jeypore. In 1830 he was appointed by Lord William Bentinck to a similar post in Gwalior State, where he opposed the regent Baiza Bai. In 1831 he was sent as Resident to Lucknow. In 1837 the East India Company took over the government of Oudh State. Low suggested the alternative of deposing the king and placing the heir-apparent on the throne, and the governor-general Lord Auckland left the matter to Low. Meanwhile, the king died suddenly; a pretender and court favourite was placed on the throne and the heir was taken prisoner. Summoning a Bengal regiment to his aid, Low, after a parley, had the gates of the palace blown open and the pretender seized. The heir was then installed by the British resident. Low was made C.B. on 20 July 1838. He made efforts to suppress a taluqdar, Bhagwant Singh, in 1841. In poor health, he returned to the United Kingdom in 1842. Low returned to India in 1847, and in 1848 was appointed the governor-general's agent in Rajputana and commissioner at Ajmer-Merwara. There he remained until 1852, when he was sent by Lord Dalhousie to Hyderabad, in succession to James Stuart Fraser, as resident with the Nizam. There he negotiated the treaty by which the Berar Division was assigned to the British government, in return for the maintenance of the Hyderabad subsidiary force. On 22 September 1853 Low was appointed a member of council. His experience of Indian princes was wide, but had not made him a hawk. In February 1854, he protested the Nagpur annexation; on this, and on other occasions, his views were ignored by Dalhousie. In the questions that ended with the annexation of Awadh, Low advocated interference in 1855. When early in May 1857 news presaging the Indian Rebellion, Low at first advised leniency; but the outbreaks at Meerut and Delhi saw him advocate the recovery of Delhi. Last years In In April 1858, Low returned to the United Kingdom. He was made a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1862, and a G.C.S.I. in 1873. He died at Norwood, Surrey on 10 January 1880, at age 91, but was buried near his family home in the churchyard at Kemback in Fife. He had received the East India war medal with clasps for Java and Mahidpur, the British war medal for Java, and the Indian Mutiny Medal. Family Augusta Shakespear, 1826 portrait In 1829 Low married Augusta Shakespear, second daughter of John Talbot Shakespear, Bengal civil service, and sister of Sir Richmond Shakespear, one of Low's assistants at Lucknow. They had four sons and five daughters:Ferdinand Mount, The Tears of the Rajas: Mutiny, Money and Marriage in India 1805–1905 (2015) * Susan Elizabeth Low (1830–1831) * Emily Low (1832–1832) * Charlotte Herbert Low (1833–1853), who married Sir Theophilus John Metcalfe, 5th Baronet, of the Bengal Civil Service * William Malcolm Low (1835–1923), Conservative MP for Grantham, who married Ida Matilda Alice Feilding, daughter of William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh, and is the great- great-grandfather of British politician David Cameron * General Sir Robert Cunliffe Low (1838–1911), British Indian Army officer * John Alwes Low R.N.

Retrieved March 26, 2017. or Fergus Falls City Light StationOtter Tail County Historical Society) was a concrete hydroelectric gravity dam on the Otter Tail River in Otter Tail County, Minnesota in the United States. Constructed in 1908 to supply power to the nearby town of Fergus Falls, the dam suddenly failed on September 24, 1909. Collapse of the dam caused the failure of four others downstream as well as significant property damage. No lives were lost. City officials left the damaged structure in place and today its ruins lie along the recreational Otter Tail River State Water Trail at Broken Down Dam Park. The only flood recorded in the history of Fergus Falls was due to this disaster.  Construction  In 1907, the growing city of Fergus Falls began enhancing a dam on the Otter Tail River about two miles upstream at Page Mill to satisfy its electricity needs. The mill had burned several years earlier and the city used the small dam as a power plant. At the same time, the city began constructing a much larger dam about three miles above the city as a permanent replacement. The new dam began generating power in 1908. Engineers had unknowingly built the dam on top of a spring without having done proper site evaluations. By the following year the concrete foundations had been undermined by the spring flows.  Collapse  At 4:20 a.m. on September 24, 1909, dam attendants discovered the electric lights fading and water flowing over the powerhouse floor. They quickly fled along a railway embankment just as the 10-ton generator was swept into the river. They reached a farm, procured a team of horses, and headed towards Fergus Falls to raise alarm. En route they met the city electrical superintendent travelling towards the dam to find out why power had failed and why the station crew had not answered the telephone. The dam broke in the center and the resulting flood first destroyed the Kirk Dam, which furnished power for the city water works. The water then destroyed the Mount Faith Avenue Bridge. One block further downstream the Red River Mill Dam and Woolen Mill Dam were swept away. Damage to the two mills totaled over $15,000 (). The Central Dam in the city also failed. While there was additional flooding to homes and farms, there was no loss of life. Dayton Hollow Dam, to the southwest, was saved from destruction. Its owner, president of the Otter Tail Power Company Vernon Wright, received enough advance warning to reach his dam by 6:15 a.m. and open the flood gates. Following the disaster, Otter Tail Power was engaged by the city to build their transmission lines into town. This helped spawn a local rumor, fueled by radical newspaper editor Haldor E. Boen, that Wright had deliberately destroyed City Dam by secretly distributing quicksilver from a rowboat to undermine it. Later it was determined natural springs under its foundation made the dam's failure inevitable.Wrede, Erik. Tales of Water Trails: Otter Tail River State Water Trail.

He has released recordings since 1989 under the monikers Badawi, Sub Dub, Ghost Producer, Psy Co., and Raz Mesinai and is the founder of the \\"Underground Producers Alliance\\", an artist development agency in New York City co founded by Scott Harding (Wu Tang Clan). Biography Mesinai began experimenting with cassettes and sampling at the age of 10, and at 14, was discovered by musician Juma Sultan while creating music for breakdancers on the streets of New York City. Juma gave him a Multi-Vox Tape Echo machine and a ribbon microphone to produce his early work. In the early 1990s, Mesinai formed the group Sub Dub with John Ward. The group is credited as an integral part of the founding of the illbient genre. Following Sub Dub's demise, Mesinai began to record under the alias Badawi. After meeting John Zorn at a party, he recorded and released Before The Law (2001), an album inspired by Czech writer Franz Kafka for Zorn's Tzadik record label. His 2001 album, The Unspeakable, featured unreleased music that he composed for the Hellraiser 6 soundtrack. The material was rejected after being considered \\"too scary for the movie\\". The Wire described Mesinai's Soldier of Midian (2001) as \\"explod[ing] with Middle Eastern percussion, Persian horn samples and dulcimer licks played by an ensemble of genuine Middle Eastern musicians, then cut up with a major dose of studio tricnology.\\" Mesinai's album Badawi: The Heretic of Ether (1999), was used as the template for the score to the blockbuster film, Black Hawk Down. This experience led him to coin the term \\"Score Design\\" and led to work creating music for major motion pictures, including The Fountain, Black Swan, The Wrestler, and A Late Quartet. Mesinai has described Score Design as \\"conceptualiz[ing] scores that are not calling for the traditional musical score that composers and musicians are used to...It's similar to sound design, where you create the atmosphere and develop sounds, hopefully from scratch, to implement the overall atmosphere and concept of the film.\\" In 2004, Mesinai was awarded the Sundance Composers Lab Fellowship, where he worked on scores for Sundance Directors. In 2016, Mesinai released a collaborative film that he directed and scored with Jonathan Uliel Saldanha, titled Tunnel Vision. The film and its music explores subterranean frequencies and was recorded in tunnels and caves, and mixed as a dub record. Tunnel Vision explores a narrative format created by Mesinai called \\"Dub Fiction,\\" or \\"a form of storytelling utilizing various mediums of modern technology to create elastic narratives which can be manipulated and, essentially, remixed by others.\\" Mesinai has taught master classes in music production, sound design and film scoring at UCSD, The New School, Dub Spot, and NYU. He founded the Underground Producers Alliance (UPA) and now teaches for the school exclusively. Mesinai has received commissions from The Lincoln Center Festival, Carnegie Hall, Kronos Quartet, Ethel, and The Kitchen and has officially remixed artists such as Burning Spear, Shackleton, and Arto Lindsay. In addition to his musical output, Mesinai draws and writes comic books including issues for Marvel, as well as album artwork for artists such as Kode9 and The Spaceape. In 2015, Mesinai founded the artist development organization the \\"Underground Producers Alliance\\", also acting as a school for teaching extended techniques in music production and sound design to professionals, along with co founders producers Scotty Hard (Jungle Brothers, New Kingdom), Prince Paul (De La Soul), Honeychild Coleman (The Slits) and HPrizm (Anti Pop Consortium).

The band is stationed at Karlskrona, was formed in 1680 and is mainly active in the south part of the country with concerts and regimental ceremonies but has also a major part in the state ceremonial, royal pageants and changing the King’s guard at the Stockholm Palace in Stockholm. The Swedish Armed Forces Music Centre (Försvarsmusiken, FöMus) heads all bands in the Swedish Armed Forces.  History  The earliest mentioning in writing of the band is at the inauguration of the Karlskrona Admiralty Church in 1685, whereas the musicians went about the town to give the word for the ceremony next Sunday. In 1780 the music at the naval base was formed as two bands of the Första och Andra volontärregementet eng. 1st and 2nd Naval Regiment. In 1804 the two bands were amalgamated into the band of the Naval Artillery Regiment (Sjöartilleriregementet) and later transferred to the Marine Regiment (Marinregementet). As the Marine Regiment was disbanded between 1871 and 1877 the music and leading musicians at the Karlskrona station was gradually transferred to the band of the Corps of Naval Volunteers which later was the basis for the band of the Royal Swedish Navy. Sergeant-Major August Fiedler late of the band of The Marine Regiment was the first Director of Music of the Royal Swedish Navy Band and his successor in 1873 was Frans Ferdinand Heimdal In the Swedish navy all musicians had second tasks aboard and ashore and must therefore be considered part-time musicians. The band used brass instruments only with main task to provide men o’ war with buglers and ensembles. In 1915 Director of Music Heimdal was succeeded by Georg Ringvall which reorganized the band and introduced woodwind instruments.

Bosporan expansion began after Spartokos I, the first Spartocid (and after whom the dynasty is named) took power and during his seven-year reign, established an aggressive expansionist foreign policy that was followed by his successors. Background It is possible that Spartokos I was a Thracian mercenary who usurped the Archaeanactids, a Greek dynasty of Bosporan rulers who had ruled for 40 years. Although disputed, some sources say that Spartokos may have been related to the Odrysian royal dynasty as some members included the names of \\"Sparatokos\\" and may have sought influence in other parts of the Black Sea. Spartokos I only reigned for 7 years, leaving his son, Satyrus I to carry on his expansionist policies. Satyrus became involved with the neighbouring Sindike Kingdom, and was interested in bringing Nymphaeum under his kingdom's control as well. Encounter with Gylon Gylon, the maternal grandfather of Demosthenes, was an Athenian official in charge of the Athenian garrison at Nymphaeum, which was a city that was possibly part of the Delian League. Satyros bribed Gylon so that he surrendered the city of Nymphaeum to Satyros. This resulted in Gylon being exiled, as he was regarded as a traitor by the Athenians. Gylon had received \\"The Gardens\\" from Satyros as part of their deal. Around this time, Phanagoria lost its independence. Gylon married a Scythian noble woman. Their daughter, Kleoboule, would go on to become the mother of Demosthenes. Kimmerikon also seems to have fallen into Bosporan influence shortly during or after the taking of Nymphaeum. Conflict with Tirgatao Satyros delved into Sindian affairs, offering his daughter to marry Hekataios, the king of the Sindians. Satyros told him to kill his existing wife, Tirgatao, but instead, Hekataios sent her to a tower and imprisoned her there. Tirgatao managed to escape to her home tribe, the Ixomatae, and married her father's successor and rallied many tribes to her aid and ravaged the lands of Satyros. Satyros sued for peace, offering one of his sons, Metrodoros, as a hostage. Tirgatao agreed and ended her war against Satyros, only to be subject to an assassination attempt organized by Satyros. Upon learning of this, Tirgatao killed her hostage, Metrodoros, and began another war against Satyros. 1st Siege of Theodosia At the same time as he was trying to gain influence with the Sindoi, Satyros had laid siege to Theodosia, a city that was a commercial rival to Panticapaeum due its ice-free ports and a possible ally of Heraclea Pontica. Satyros lost his life at Theodosia while laying siege to the city in 389 BC. He was succeeded by his sons, Leukon and Gorgippos. Peace with Tirgatao Upon the death of their father, Leukon and Gorgippos ascended to the Bosporan throne with Gorgippos suing for peace with Tirgatao, who demanded a great tribute from them in exchange for peace. After that, Gorgippos and Leukon focussed on their on-going war with Theodosia and Heraclea Pontica and further expansion to the west and south of Panticapaeum. 2nd Siege of Theodosia Leukon laid siege to Theodosia around 365 BC, hoping to annex it to his dominions. During the siege, Tynnichus, a Heracleote commander, had been sent from Heraclea Pontica with a small force including a merchant ship and a trireme, successfully defeated the Bosporans as he managed to destroy their siege weapons during the night and thus succeeded in relieving Theodosia from the siege. Putting down the insurrection Stele with two soldiers of the Bosporan Kingdom wearing chitons and Corinthian helmets, from the Taman peninsula (Yubileynoe), southern Russia, 3rd quarter of the 4th century BC; marble, Pushkin Museum After his father's defeat at Theodosia, as well as his own, Leukon's subjects were not pleased with their king. Leukon suspected that there would be an attempt to remove him from the throne, and rallied the merchants to his aid and borrowed whatever money he could from them. He argued that if his throne was lost, the merchants would not be able to get their money. The merchants then armed themselves and some acted as his bodyguards while others protected the palace. With the help of the merchants, he killed the conspirators. He repaid the merchants as soon as he could. 3rd Siege of Theodosia After putting down a conspiracy against his throne, in around 360 BC, some time after his unsuccessful first attempt at subjugating the city of Theodosia, Leukon laid siege to Theodosia once more when the Heracleotes had recently left, possibly due to Clearchus of Heraclea making himself tyrant of Heraclea and a change of power from an oligarchy to a tyranny. Leukon attacked the city at night and succeeded in defeating and annexing the city, finally putting an end to the war that took his father's life. Leukon had later provoked the wrath of Heraclea Pontica with his victory at Theodosia, making them wage an all out war against Leukon. They succeeded in defeating the Bosporan fleet, and soon landed on Bosporan territory. Leukon quickly went out to meet them, preparing to protect his kingdom. Leukon was concerned that some of his men might flee the battle, so he placed his Scythian allies to the rear with specific orders to strike down any men who sought to flee. With this tactic, he was able to defeat the Heraclean army. War with the Sindike Kingdom The Sindike Kingdom was in the midst of a civil war, as Oktamasades, the son of Hekataios, had taken the throne for himself. Oktamasades had attacked the city of Labrys. Leukon, aiming to annex it into the Bosporan Kingdom, waged war against Oktamasades and quickly defeated him in the Battle of Labrytai, ultimately driving him out into Scythia. Before the battle, Leukon is reported that he “made a vow to erect a victory monument, but not to the local Apollo of Labrys, but to the supreme deity and patron of all the Bosporans\\", Apollo the Healer. Leukon succeeded in convincing Hekakatios to renounce his kingship, or perhaps he died while Leukon was fighting Okatamsades. Leukon immediately became ruler of the land. Gorgippos renamed the capital \\"Sindia\\" to Gorgippia and Gorgippos established himself as the dynast of the Spartocids on the Asiatic side of the Bosporan Kingdom. Conflict with Memnon of Rhodes During the last years of Leukon's reign, Memnon of Rhodes was hired by the city of Heraclea Pontica to wage war on Leukon. He sent ambassadors and envoys to Leukon as if he were wanting an alliance, but in reality, he sent them there to look at Leukon's army. Upon learning about Leukon's forces, Memnon waged war on Leukon and landed on Bosporan soil. He led his army to a field where he was met by a Bosporan army. Memnon retreated to a nearby hill and hid some of his troops, to make it look like that there was discord in his army. Memnon also sent a \\"deserter\\" to the Bosporan camp, to tell them that were was a mutiny in the army. When the Bosporans heard of this, they marched to Memnon's army but were quickly defeated, as Memnon's army was not facing any mutiny. Later Campaigns and Aftermath Later on Leukon may have conquered several other tribes, such as that of the Dandarioi, Toretai, and the Psessoi. These tribes were a part of his dominions as they were mentioned as parts of his lands in his title. His son Paerisades I expanded the kingdom even further; at some point during his reign taking Tanais, but the exact date of Tanais being conquered is not known. Through his marriage to his paternal cousin, Komosarye, a daughter of Gorgippos, Paerisades achieved the title \\"King of the Sindians\\". Paerisades was also regarded as \\"divine\\" by his people, a position none of his predecessors held. Satyros, Leukon, and Gorgippos had established a dynasty that would rule the Bosporan Kingdom for three centuries, and would enjoy relative peace until 310 BC, when Paerisades I died. Paerisades's sons began the Bosporan Civil War in which the kingdom was divided. The victor of this war, Eumelos, would later increase the power of the kingdom to the point of being able to rival the powerful state created by Lysimachus, one of Alexander's generals.

The split Prior to the war there had been much discussion about opposing the impending war amongst the SPD, but once the war started the SPD agreed on a political truce or Burgfriedenspolitik whereby despite their disagreements none of the MPs voted against war credits. Originally even Karl Liebknecht only abstained, although in 1914 he voted against war credits. Then on December 1915 20 MPs from the SPD issued a statement in the Reichstag against the truce, twenty MPs from the SPD opposed the war loans in parliament.

The phrase \\"the first full moon after the equinox\\" is taken exactly: they each are instantaneous astronomical events; if the full moon occurs after the equinox, it is the Paschal full moon, even if they occur on the same day. An example would be the full moon at 04:05 Jerusalem time on 21 March 2019, after the equinox at 00:20 Jerusalem time the same day. The reform would have been implemented starting in 2001, the first year in which the Eastern and Western dates of Easter would coincide after this method was proposed in 1997. While for Eastern Christians, the date of Easter would change roughly 70% of the time, assuming a start date of 2001, the first difference for Western Christians would be in 2019, where the Aleppo method gives 24 March (as opposed to 21 April under the Gregorian method). However, if one begins calculations in 1997, there is a difference in the following year: the Aleppo method gives Easter Sunday as 19 April 1998; in this case Western Christians (who celebrated on 12 April that year) would have had to change their date while Eastern Christians would not, a phenomenon which would also apply in 2049, 2106, 2143, 2147, 2150, 2174, 2201 etc. The proposal will have the effect of slightly widening the range of dates on which Easter could be celebrated; while the current extremes are 22 March and 25 April, the range would widen by one date on each side. These new dates, however, would be extremely uncommon: commencing calculations from 1997, the first occurrence of Easter on 26 April would be in 2201 (a year in which under the Gregorian method Easter falls on 19 April), while the first occurrence of Easter on 21 March would not be until the year 2877 (a year in which under the Gregorian method Easter falls on 25 April). The Aleppo method would make it possible for Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday to coincide, as Ash Wednesday would fall on 3 February if Easter fell on 21 March in a common year; and also for Laetare Sunday to occur in the month of February, which is not currently possible, as an Easter of 21 March would position Laetare Sunday on 28 February (or on 29 February if the 21 March Easter is occurring in a leap year). An Easter of 21 March would also produce an April date for the Feast of the Ascension, occurring on 29 April; although as an April date for the Ascension is already possible (as it would occur on 30 April when Easter falls on 22 March, possible under the Gregorian method), this is less noteworthy. In the 21st and 22nd centuries, it is the years in which the Paschal Full Moon on the Gregorian tables falls on its latest possible date (18 April) — the year 2019 and every nineteenth year after that — when the Aleppo method gives Easter approximately a month earlier than the Gregorian. The gradually accumulating gap between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and full moon means that in these years, the true full moon in March occurs just after the equinox; while the equivalent full moon in the Gregorian algorithm falls on 20 March (the approximated equinox), meaning that the Paschal Full Moon is delayed until the following month. In the year 2000 (which is technically part of the 20th century), however, this is not the case. One might think, based on the occurrences in 2019 and every nineteenth year after that, that the Aleppo method would give 26 March as Easter Sunday for 2000. However, the gap between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and full moon had not yet widened enough to place the true March full moon after the equinox; in 2000 a full moon occurred at 07:05 Jerusalem time on 20 March, before the March equinox at 09:36 Jerusalem time the same day; as a result, the Paschal Full Moon was not until the following month (as it is defined as the first full moon after the equinox), and the date given for Easter 2000 by the Aleppo method was therefore 23 April, the same as by the Gregorian method. The proposal is not without controversy; Orthodox Christians tend not to look favourably upon the roughly one-in-five occurrence of Easter on or before the first day of Passover in the Aleppo method, because if Easter is not the Sunday after Passover there is a conflict with the Gospels (despite the Orthodox practice often not having Easter on the Sunday after the first day of Passover in the majority of years when there is more than seven days' difference between the first day of Passover and Easter Sunday). Implementation This reform has not been implemented. It would have relied mainly on the co-operation of the Eastern Orthodox Church, since the date of Easter would change for them immediately; whereas for the Western churches, the new system would not differ from that currently in use until 2019 (again, assuming a start date of 2001; and not taking into account the aforementioned situation in 1998 should calculations begin from the proposal of the method in 1997). However, Eastern Orthodox support was not forthcoming, and the reform failed. The much greater impact that this reform would have had on the Eastern churches in comparison with those of the West led some Orthodox to suspect that the World Council of Churches' decision was an attempt by the West to impose its viewpoint unilaterally on the rest of the world under the guise of ecumenism. However, it could also be argued that it is fair to ask a significant change of Eastern Christians, as they would be simply making the same substantial changes the various Western Churches have already made in 1582 (when the Catholic Church first adopted the Gregorian calendar) and subsequent years so as to bring the calendar and Easter more in line with the seasons.

Peace was made under the tree on 10 January 1806 after the Battle of Blaauwberg, thereby starting the second British occupation of the Cape and leading to the permanent establishment of the Cape Colony as a British possession.

In 1509 a massacre by Khoikhoi of 64 Portuguese sailors under the command of Dom Francisco de Almeida took place close to the tree. Protection The City of Cape Town owns the property, and the tree was declared a monument in 1967.

On the centre service line. The server hits the serve from directly behind her on the baseline\\". The net player then indicates, (privately); typically with their hands behind their back which side of the court they will move to as the return of serve is hit. These hand gestures let the server at the baseline know which side of the court they are to serve to, and than move to. For intermediate players such as league, or club players it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained) Advanced competitors such as professional; and tour players are known to use other combinations for example Australian Doubles which deliberately exposes one side of the court to entice the return of serve be hit into the open space. The ultimate aim here is for the net player to cut off the return of serve hopefully ending the point. Why I-formation is Effective In tennis you want to keep the ball away from the net player, because it is easy to put the ball away from closer to the net than any other position on the court. This tactic has the player returning the serve guess as to which side the opponents net player will be. So basically there is a 50–50 chance the person returning the server is going to hit the ball right into their opponents net player which effectively can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles. Tips To play this tactic successfully It's important players be comfortable serving the ball with enough precision to place the ball out wide, into the body; and down the \\"T\\" in each service box. Accuracy is also required so you don't hit the net-player in the back or head. Another key to success with this tactic is understanding the ins and outs of returning a serve, and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is harder to change the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also, there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt, because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net. It helps to know your opponent's weaknesses and strengths before playing this strategy; so if your opponent has a whopping big crosscourt return of serve, this is good to know beforehand; because you can force them to return the ball down the line where the net is higher, the distance is shorter and the angle is harder; this can intimidating the player returning the serve into making an error. The net- player is required to get low, and it is important that they be able to move quickly out of this position, so it's recommended the net player be on their feet, crouching, as opposed to one or both knees. Also, it is easier to move to the ball from the balls of the feet as opposed to being flat-footed. Also typically you want this position to be uncomfortable because you are going to want to move out of it quickly. Communicating to the Server Often the net player will put their hands behind the back to indicate where the server should serve. So if the server is serving on the deuce side of the court the index finger is used to point to the ad side, The middle finger is used to indicate a to-the-body shot, and the pinkie finger is used to reflect the down-the-line position.(Westermann 2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXoOGJkBIuQ The net-player then communicates if they are going to move to the ad or deuce service-box. It's also common for the net-player to walk back to the service line and whisper his/her choice of combinations to the server; this helps to slow the game down, which can frustrate the returning team's rhythm; and also helps the server to stay calm.

She noted in her review that the grammatical correctness in the dialogue by Tade Ogidan was top notch. She went further to say Wale Ojo and Nico Panagio playing \\"Kola Alabi\\" and Riikard Van Outen respectively was a highpoint in the character depictions of the film, but felt Kemi Lala role wasn't convincing. She also observed that Afolayan's use of many languages in his films gives a special impression.

The law initially required them to undergo surgical alteration of their genitals in order to have key identity documents changed. This has since been declared unconstitutional. Discrimination protections on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation vary across Germany, but discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and services is in principle banned countrywide.  The  In 1980, West Germany passed a law that regulates the change of first names and legal gender. It is called \\"Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen (:de:Transsexuellengesetz – TSG)\\" (Law about the change of first name and determination of gender identity in special cases (Transsexual law – TSG)). However, the name change becomes legally void if a child is born more than 300 days after the name change. Since 1990, the law applied to all of Germany following the reunification of East and West Germany. In the past, German law required parents to give their child a gender-specific name.Flippo, Hyde \\"The Germany Way\\" Published by McGraw-Hill (1996), Pages 96-97 This is no longer true, since the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany held in 2008 that there is no obligation that a name has to be sex-specific, even if it is the only one.BVerfG, 1 BvR 576/07 vom 5.12.2008, paragraph 16 One can either obtain a change of name alone, and proceed later with a change of legal gender, if possible or desired, or obtain both in a single legal procedure. For both, two independent medical court experts have to be commissioned by the judge. They are asked to evaluate, whether * the person \\"does not identify with the birth-assigned sex/gender,The German word (the teminology used in the law) can be translated as either \\"sex\\" or \\"gender\\". but with the other one\\", and * \\"feels a compulsion to live according to his/her ideas for at least three years\\", and * it is to be assumed with high probability, that the feeling of belonging to the other sex/gender is not going to change\\". For the change of legal gender, it was also once required that the person * is permanently infertile, and * has had surgery through which their outer sexual characteristics are changed to a \\"significant approximation\\" to the appearance of their preferred biological sex.Prerequisites for the statutory recognition of transsexuals according to § 8.1 nos. 3 and 4 of the Transsexuals Act are unconstitutional These requirements were declared unconstitutional by supreme court ruling in a 2011. Originally, the law stated that neither change of name nor legal gender were available for people under 25 years of age. This condition has been declared void by the courts, and today there is no minimum age. Until 2008, the person had to be unmarried. The TSG applies only to German citizens; there are exceptions only for non-German citizens with very specific legal status, such as stateless people living legally in Germany, or in case the foreign state has no equivalent law, which would be in accordance with German constitution. Several court decisions have further specified several matters. For example, a person with only a name change has the right to be called \\"Herr\\" or \\"Frau\\" (Mr. or Ms.) according to their first name, not their legal gender; similarly, documents have to be issued reflecting their actual gender identity, not legal gender. Job references, certifications and similar from the time before the change of name may be reissued with the new name, so effectively there is no way for a new employer to learn about the change of name and/or legal gender. Also, people with only a name change do not have to divulge their legal gender to employers. In 2011, the German Constitutional Court ruled that a person did not need either sex reassignment surgery or sterilization in order to legally change their gender. In January 2011, the German Constitutional Court ruled that these two requirements were unconstitutional.  Discrimination protections  The Equal Treatment Act came into force on 18 August 2006. It law bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in employment and the provision of goods and services. Hate speeches on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity are not banned nationwide in Germany. Some states have laws banning all forms of discrimination in their constitutions (Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Saarland and Thuringia). In those states, hate speech based on both sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited.

It colonised the Mediterranean by Lessepsian migration from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal. The keeled mullet is a species of minor importance in commercial fisheries. Description Liza carinata has a broad head with the mouth being as wide as the head, there is a well=developed adipose eyelid which covers most of the pupil. The upper lip is thin. its height being smaller than diameter of the pupil and the corner of the mouth reaches to nearly below the front of the eye. The pectoral fin's tip lies below the origin of the first dorsal fin, axillary scale rudimentary. There are 31-39scales on the lateral line and the scales on head extend as far forward as the anterior nostrils. It is greyish blue on the back and silvery on the flanks and belly. The dorsal fin has 5 spines and 8-9 rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 9 rays. It grows to 30 cm standard length but 15 cm is the more normal size. Distribution Liza carinata occurs in the western Indian Ocean, centred on the Red Sea. It has colonised the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, where it is still common in the canal and its associated salt lakes, by Lessepsian migration, the first record was in the 1920s off Port Said, Egypt and has now extended as far north as south-eastern Turkey and west along the North African coast as far as Libya It has also been recorded in the freshwater of Lake Kinneret in Israel where it was probably introduced among fry collected in a nearby estuary to stock the lake. Biology Liza carinata is a pelagic and euryhaline species, which is also tolerant of wide temperature variations, occurring mainly in marine coastal waters migrating inshore to lagoons and estuaries where there is abundant macrophyte vegetation in the spring, moving out to deeper coastal waters in the winter. The juveniles are associated with drifting seaweed. A study in the Great Bitter Lake found that the lifespan of L. carinata is normally three years but that the most rapid growth occurs in the first year of life. Males reach their first sexual maturity at 12.5 cm in total length while the females attain sexual maturity at 13.4 cm. A female may lay 24500 to 115258 eggs and the spawning season of L. carinata in Suez Bay may extend from November to March. The eggs are pelagic and non-adhesive. It feeds mainly on benthic algae and small molluscs. =Parasites= The following flatworm species have been found on L. carinata as endoparasites: *Elliptobursa megasacculum *Haplosplanchnus lizae *Lasiotocus lizae *Pseudohapladena lizae *Saccocoelioides lizae *Schikhobalotrema megaovus The following flatworm species have been found as ectoparasites: *Ligophorus bipartitus *Ligophorus campanulatus *Ligophorus lebedevi *Ligophorus mamaevi *Ligophorus simpliciformis *Ligophorus surianoae The copepod Caligus apodus has also been recorded as ectoparatsites. Human use Liza carinata is normally caught as a by catch when fishing for other mullets and is normally smaller in size than the target species, fresh fish are normally grilled. has a lower growth rate than other mullet species but there is a high market demand in Egypt, leading to high prices, for this species, especially when processed as salted fish. Taxonomy Liza carinata was named in 1836 by Achille Valenciennes as Mugil carinatus in the book Histoire naturelle des poissons. Vol. 11. by G. Cuvier, & A. Valenciennes. It was unclear what the distribution with and it was recorded from as far east as Japan. It was shown that there was a monophyletic group of three similar species which formed a species complex, Liza carinata in the Red Sea area, L. klunzingeri in the Indian Ocean from the Tigris- Euphrates Delta east to Bombay and L. affinis which is found in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean (Hainan). Recent taxonomic work on the family Mugilidae has resulted in a reorganisation the family and it has been proposed that many of the Indo-Pacific species previously assigned to the genera Liza and Chelon, as well as Paramugil parmatus, be placed in the resurrected genus Planiliza References carinata Planiliza Fish described in 1836 ","title":"Liza carinata"},{"id":"53600583","text":"Maxime Crochemore (born 1947) is a French computer scientist known for his numerous contributions to algorithms on strings.

In 2015, the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Leading transgender activists include Lohana Berkins, Diana Sacayán, Mariela Muñoz, María Belén Correa, Marlene Wayar, Claudia Pía Baudracco, Susy Shock and Lara Bertolini. Currently, Argentine trans activists are pushing for anti-discrimination and employment quota laws, as well as to stop killings of trans people. The \\"Day of the Promotion of the Rights of Trans People\\" is celebrated in the city of Buenos Aires and in Santa Fe Province on March 18, in memory of activist Claudia Pía Baudracco.  History  Caras y Caretas in 1902, describing the detention of an indigenous \\"man-woman\\" in Viedma, Río Negro In 1997, Asociación de Lucha por la Identidad Travesti-Transsexual was created to defend the rights of transgender people. One of its first victories came in 2006 when the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had stated that transgender people did not have a legal right to organize and campaign for their rights. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that a 17-year-old had the legal right to go through the sex change process and have her legal documents changed to reflect the operation. In 2009, Marcela Romero won the legal right to have her identity changed, and was given an honorary title by the government. She was awarded by the Honorable Congress woman of the year. Romero remains one of the leading advocates for the human rights of transgender people in Argentina. In 2012, senators unanimously approved the \\"Gender Law\\". In mid-2018, the Santa Fe Province cities of Rosario and Santa Fe announced the incorporation of several trans people to the Historical Reparation program, which gives pensions to victims of the last military dictatorship. Newspaper Página/12 considered that \\"the action, unprecedented at a national level and throughout Latin America, establishes a new standard in public policies.\\" On June 18, 2018, a Buenos Aires court sentenced Gabriel David Marino to life imprisonment for the murder of transgender activist Diana Sacayán. For the first time in history, the Argentine Justice acknowledged that the murder was \\"a hate crime against the travesti identity\\", known as \\"travesticide\\" or \\"transvesticide\\" (Spanish: travesticidio; a portmanteau of \\"travesti\\" and \\"homicide\\"). The ruling was widely celebrated by LGBT activists and has been considered \\"one more example of the [social] changes underway in Argentina.\\" On March 1, 2019, trans activist Lara María Bertolini was allowed to change her official sex to the transfeminine non-binary label \\"travesti femininity\\" through a judicial ruling that was considered a landmark for the travesti movement. Buenos Aires judge Myriam Cataldi felt that the Gender Identity Law applied to Bertolini's case, citing the law's definition of \\"gender identity\\" as: \\"the internal and individual experience of gender as each person feels it, which may or may not correspond to the sex assigned at birth, including the personal experience of the body.\\" On March 19, 2019, Neuquén Province announced a pension for trans people who are older than forty years and do not have registered employment. They will receive a monthly economic contribution as part of a Historical Reparation program, which \\"recognizes the systematic violation of their rights\\".  Gender Identity Law  The Ley de Género (Gender Law) grants adults sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy as a part of their public or private health care plans. The law also allows for changes to gender, image, or birth name on civil registries without the approval of a doctor or a judge. In 2013 a six-year-old girl named Luana, who was designated male at birth, became the first transgender child in Argentina to have her new name officially changed on her identity documents. She is believed to be the youngest to benefit from the country's Gender Identity Law. The law made Argentina the \\"only country that allows people to change their gender identities without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality\\". In 2015, the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Trans employment quota in the public sector On 4 September 2020, President Alberto Fernández signed a Necessity and Urgency Decree (Decreto 721/2020) establishing a 1% employment quota for trans and travesti people in the national public sector. The measure had been previously debated in the Chamber of Deputies as various prospective bills. The decree mandates that at any given point, at least 1% of all public sector workers in the national government must be transgender, as understood in the 2012 Gender Identity Law. The initiative had previously been proposed by Argentine trans and travesti activists such as Diana Sacayán, whose efforts led to the promotion of such laws at the provincial level in Buenos Aires Province in 2015.
