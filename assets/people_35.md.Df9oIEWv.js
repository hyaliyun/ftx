It is a sequel to his 1986 novel Paradise Postponed. Plot synopsis Leslie Titmuss returns to Rapstone village and will do whatever it takes to fit in with the highest levels of society. Married to his second wife, Jenny, he seeks to buy his first wife's country house. These plans are hampered by a real estate development that Leslie, due to his free market politics, can hardly oppose publicly. Reception In a 1990 book review in Kirkus Reviews the review summarized; \\"Mortimer is a writer of great charm, a master of light and shade who has done the next-to-impossible and produced a dull gray novel, devoid of subtlety. In Paradise Postponed, he kept a large cast effortlessly afloat, but here he drives his two principals grimly forward, while giving short shrift to everybody else. Too bad.\\" In reviewing the 2011 reissue, Robert Plunket of the New York Times called it \\"a classic comedy of political manners\\" and \\"a delightful book, funny, wise and ultimately very sad. If Mr. Mortimer doesn't quite turn the whole thing into the tour de force it almost is, it is not through lack of effort.\\" Adaptation Thames TV adapted the book for a television series released in 1991, starring Kristin Scott Thomas and David Threlfall.

He was also a teacher and author. He became President of the Royal Society of Chemistry and received the highest honours his scientific colleagues could bestow. He was awarded Durham University's first Master's Degree in science and subsequently became its first Doctor of Science. He was the founding Principal of the Northern Polytechnic Institute in London. He later practiced as an analytical and consulting chemist in North East England and served as the Public Analyst for Newcastle upon Tyne, for the county of Northumberland and for several of the major industrial towns of the North East. He was a hereditary Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne. On his death he was described as \\"the Father of Tyneside Chemistry\\". Early life and education Dunn was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1858 to Thomas Dunn,England and Wales Civil Registration, 1858 Births a Newcastle ironmonger and auctioneerWard's Northumberland and Durham Directory, Robert Ward, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1867, p33 and his wife Ann Chicken, the daughter of a labourer at William Armstrong's Newcastle factory.England and Wales Civil Registration, 1851 Marriages He attended the Percy Street Academy in Newcastle, popularly known as Dr Bruce's School, from about the age of 8.

In 1874, at the age of 16, Dunn became a student at the three-year-old College of Physical Science in Newcastle,C E Whiting, The University of Durham 1832‚Äì1932, The Sheldon Press, London, 1932, p195 which was then part of the University of Durham, and is now part of Newcastle University. Specialising in chemistry, at the early age of 19 he became a Bachelor of Science, one of the University's first. In 1881 he was awarded Durham's first Master's Degree in Science,C E Whiting, The University of Durham 1832‚Äì1932, The Sheldon Press, London, 1932, p196 and in 1888 he became the University's first Doctor of Science. Early career In 1877 Dunn became a Demonstrator in Chemistry at the College of Physical Science. He was then made the College's Professor of Chemistry in 1882 at the young age of 24. In 1884 he was appointed Science teacher at the newly-opened private Gateshead High School for Boys. Three years later he became the school's Head Teacher. While still holding that position he became Inspector of Science Schools and Classes for Durham County Council. In 1894 Dunn was appointed Head of the new Technical College in Plymouth, more properly known as the Jubilee Memorial Science, Art and Technical School, where he remained for only one year. Northern Polytechnic Institute Dunn was appointed the founding Principal of the Northern Polytechnic Institute in Holloway, London, and Head of its Chemistry Department, in 1895. The Institute was opened with aid from the City of London Parochial Foundation and substantial donations from the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. Under the terms of its Royal Charter its objective was: > \\"to promote the industrial skill, general knowledge, health, and wellbeing > of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes of Islington and to > provide for the inhabitants of Islington and the neighbouring parts of North > London, and especially for the Industrial Classes, the means of acquiring a > sound General, Scientific, Technical, and Commercial Education at small > cost.\\"London Metropolitan University Special Collections, > https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1432-npi Dunn's task in his first year ‚Äì as founding principal of the Institute (which has since become the main campus of the London Metropolitan University) ‚Äì was to prepare for its opening and to employ staff, and to enrol as many students as possible so that it might be a success from the moment the doors were opened in October 1896. The result was 1000 students enrolled in the first year, to be taught by 34 staff. All the students were at elementary level and most attended evening classes while working during the day. Courses ranged from English, mathematics, chemistry and physics to more vocational classes such as machine construction, plumbing, dress-making, and millinery. The Northern Polytechnic Institute went from strength to strength. New buildings began to be erected during Dunn's time in charge there, with the Great Hall being opened in 1897, and other large additions completed in 1902. In January 1900 at the prize-giving, Dunn was able to report that the Institute had grown very rapidly and was still growing, the number of students by then being two thousand. \\"There is no doubt\\", Dunn assured his audience, \\"that England is in no way behind any other country in the world as regards technical education\\".Morning Post, London, 27 January 1900 A year later Dunn was able to record a further rise in student numbers and to report that there was a growing tendency to take advantage of the Institute, especially in the trade and industrial classes.Morning Post, London, 6 December 1900 In 1901, however, after 6 years at the Institute, Dunn left academia in order to practice as an analytical and consulting chemist. At the end of the academic year he left London to return to his roots in Newcastle upon Tyne. Analytical and consulting chemist In the early summer of 1901 Dunn joined \\"Consulting Chemists, Analysts, Assayers and Samplers\\" J and H S Pattinson as a partner with John Pattinson.R C Chirnside and J H Hamence, The 'Practising Chemists', A History of the Society for Analytical Chemistry 1874‚Äì1974, The Society for Analytical Chemistry, London, 1974, pxiii The firm had been founded in the year of Dunn's birth ‚Äì 1858 ‚Äì and set up offices and a laboratory at 75 The Side in Newcastle upon Tyne,Tyne and Wear Archives: DT.PT/1‚Äì28, J and H S Pattinson, Analytical Chemists where they concentrated on coal purity testing and food analysis.Bdaily News, https://api.bdaily.co.uk/articles/2008/12/03/pattinson-scientific- celebrates-150-years-in-business With Dunn as a partner they moved to larger offices and laboratories nearby at 10 Dean Street in Newcastle and vastly extended their operations. (The firm is still in operation elsewhere in Newcastle as Pattinson Scientific Services Limited.) On Pattinson‚Äôs death in 1912, Dunn became Principal of the firm with junior partner Charles Bloxam and took over Pattinson‚Äôs duties as the Public Analyst for the City and County of Newcastle upon Tyne, the County of Northumberland, the County Boroughs of Gateshead, Sunderland, South Shields, Tynemouth, and the Borough of Berwick- upon-Tweed. He also became the Official Gas Examiner and the Official Agriculture Analyst. Dunn remained as the senior partner of J and H S Pattinson until his death in 1939, giving up his public appointments only with the onset of illness in 1937. Membership of professional societies, institutes and associations Dunn was very active in professional organisations, the most significant being his membership of the Royal Society of Chemistry to which he was elected as a member in 1905. A year later he was elected a Member of the Society‚Äôs Council and was to serve on the Council for three periods. In 1917‚Äì18 he served as Vice-President and in 1930 was elected President. He was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, being a Member of its Council from 1918‚Äì21 and an Examiner from 1921 to 1925 and from 1927 to 1932. In 1930 he served as President of the Society of Public Analysts. He was President of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1933‚Äì34 having first joined the Newcastle Chemical Society as early as 1877, which later merged with the SCI. From 1937‚Äì38 he was President of the North of England Gas Managers‚Äô Association. He was also President of the Newcastle Chemical Industry Club, was connected with the British Standards Institution, and was a Member of the Scientific and Industrial Fuel Research Department. He also served on the Council of Armstrong College in Newcastle, the successor to the College of Physical Science. Publications Dunn was co-author with V A Mundella, the man he appointed as Head of the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering at the North London Institute and who later became Dunn's son-in- law, of a much-needed science textbook: General Elementary Science. It was published in 1899 by Methuen Publishing as the first of the Methuen‚Äôs Science Primers series, and was promoted as \\"An Introductory Course for students in schools and technical colleges preparatory to the more formal study of mechanics, physics and chemistry\\". The book was a success, being regarded as an intermediate course in Physics and Chemistry for London Matriculation, and also being adopted by the Admiralty for teaching elementary Science. It went to a second edition nine years later, in 1908, and was still being actively marketed by Methuen in October 1909. (Dunn's co-author, Victor Mundella, later became Principal of Sunderland Technical College.). In 1924 Dunn's second book was published, by Ernest Benn of London. Commissioned by the publishers, Pulverised and Colloidal Fuel is a treatise on the use of powdered fuels to produce power. It was well-reviewed by Dunn's peers, with the author congratulated on his success in bringing under one cover the many sources of information on the subject. The book was published in the United States in the same year, by the Van Nostrand Company of New York City. Dunn also contributed many papers for the journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, and a number of other scientific journals. Personal life In 1884 Dunn married Frances Thomas, the surviving daughter of Newcastle herbal practitioner and medical botanist Josiah Thomas,England and Wales Civil Registration, 1884 Marriages who had been tried for the manslaughter of one of his patients in 1867, but was cleared of all charges.Newcastle Guardian and Tyne Mercury, 2 March 1867 They had one child, Laura.England and Wales Civil Registration, 1885 Births Dunn was an enthusiastic supporter of many organisations. Apart from his long- term membership of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, which he had joined at the age of 14 in 1872, and of which he became a Vice-President, he was a member of Newcastle's Liberal Club and joined the Newcastle branch of Rotary International, serving as its President in 1921‚Äì22 and representing Newcastle Rotarians at the International Conference in Minneapolis in 1928. As \\"a lover of music, and no mean performer on the pianoforte\\" (as one obituarist wrote), he was the local representative of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) in London. He was also President of the North-Eastern Permanent Benefit Building Society (subsequently subsumed into the Newcastle Building Society). He was a Justice of the Peace for Gateshead and was Secretary and Treasurer of the Newcastle Shelter for Stray Cats and Dogs (being a lover of dogs in particular, and being deeply distressed by the mere thought of unnecessary animal suffering). Like his father and grandfather before him, he was a Hereditary Freeman of Newcastle and was a member of the ancient House Carpenters‚Äô Company. (His paternal grandfather had been a Newcastle house carpenter and joiner.)Newcastle Courant, 29 November 1834 Dunn held office as Senior Steward of the Guild. On 3 January 1939 in Newcastle Dunn died at the age of 80 of pneumonia, a complication of the cancer which had been diagnosed two years before.England and Wales Civil Registration, 1939 Deaths Many admiring obituaries were published in newspapers and professional journals. One obituarist described him as \\"the Father of Tyneside Chemistry\\".

It allows to split the dynamics of a system in a relevant and an irrelevant part using projection operators, which allows to find closed equations of motion for the relevant part. It is used e.g. in fluid mechanics or condensed matter physics.  Idea  Macroscopic systems with a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom are usually well described by a small number of relevant variables, e.g. the magnetization in a system of spins. The Mori-Zwanzig formalism allows to find macroscopic equations that only depend on the relevant variables based on microscopic equations of motion of a system, which are usually determined by the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant part appears in the equations as noise. The formalism does not allow to determine what the relevant variables are, these can typiclly be obtained from the properties of the system. The observables describing the system form a Hilbert space. The projection operator then projects the dynamics onto the subspace spanned by the relevant variables..Robert Zwanzig Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 2001, S.144 ff. The irrelevant part of the dynamics then depends on the observables that are orthogonal to the relevant variables. A correlation function is used as a scalar product Hermann Grabert Nonlinear Transport and Dynamics of Fluctuations Journal of Statistical Physics, Vol. 19, No. 5, 1978 , which is why the formalism can also be used for analyzing the dynamics of correlation functions. Jean-Pierre Hansen und Ian R. McDonald, Theory of Simple Liquids: with Applications to Soft Matter 4th ed. (Elsevier Academic Press, Oxford, 2009), S.363 ff.  Derivation  A not explicitly time-dependent observableAn analogous derivation can be found in, e.g., Robert Zwanzig Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 2001, S.149 ff. A obeys the Heisenberg equation of motion : \\\\frac{d}{dt} A = i L A, where the Liouville operator L is defined using the commutator L = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar}[H, \\\\cdot] in the quantum case and using the Poisson bracket L = -i \\\\\\\\{H, \\\\cdot\\\\\\\\} in the classical case. We assume here that the Hamiltonian does not have explicit time-dependence. The derivation can also be generalized towards time-dependent Hamiltonians. M. te Vrugt and R. Wittkowski Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism for far- from-equilibrium systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians Physical Review E 99, 062118 (2019) This equation is formally solved by : A(t) = e^{iLt}A. The projection operator acting on an observable X is defined as : P X = (A,A)^{-1}(X,A)A, where A is the relevant variable (which can also be a vector of various observables), and (\\\\;,\\\\;) is some scalar product of operators. The Mori product, a generalization of the usual correlation function, is typically used for this scalar product. For observables X, Y , it is defined as Hermann Grabert Projection operator techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, Band 95, 1982, S.37 : (X,Y) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\beta} d\\\\alpha \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\bar{\\\\rho} X e^{-\\\\alpha H} Y e^{\\\\alpha H}), where \\\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1} is the inverse temperature, Tr is the trace (corresponding to an integral over phase space in the classical case) and H is the Hamiltonian. \\\\bar{\\\\rho} is the relevant probability operator (or density operator for quantum systems). It is chosen in such a way that it can be written as a function of the relevant variables only, but is a good approximation for the actual density, in particular such that it gives the correct mean values. Hermann Grabert Projection operator techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, Band 95, 1982, S.13 Now, we apply the operator identity : e^{iLt} = e^{i(1-P)Lt} + \\\\int_{0}^{t} ds e^{iL(t-s)}PLe^{i(1-P)Ls} to :(1-P) iLA. Using the projection operator introduced above and the definitions : \\\\Omega = (iLA, A)(A,A)^{-1} (frequency matrix), : F(t)= e^{t(1-P)L}(1-P)iLA (random force) und : K(t)=(iLF(t),A)(A,A)^{-1} (memory function), the result can be written as : \\\\dot{A}(t) = \\\\Omega A(t) + \\\\int_{0}^{t} ds K(s) A(t-s) + F(t). This is an equation of motion for the observable A(t) , which depends on its value at the current time t , the value at previous times (memory term) and the random force (noise, depends on the part of the dynamics that is orthogonal to A(t)).  Markovian approximation  The equation derived above is typically difficult to solve due to the convolution term. Since we are typically interested in slow macroscopic variables changing timescales much larger than the microscopic noise. Expanding the equation to second order in iLA(t), we obtainRobert Zwanzig Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 2001, S.165 ff. : \\\\dot{A}(t) \\\\approx \\\\Omega A(t) + \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} ds K(s) A(t) + F(t) , where : K(t)= - (e^{iLt}(1-P)iLA,(1-P)iLA)(A,A)^{-1} .  Generalizations  For larger deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium, the more general form of the Mori- Zwanzig formalism is used, from which the previous results can be obtained through a linearization. Hermann Grabert Projection operator techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, Band 95, 1982, S.36 In this case, the Hamiltonian has explicit time-dependence. For a detailed derivation of the generalized equations of motion see Hermann Grabert Nonlinear Transport and Dynamics of Fluctuations Journal of Statistical Physics, Vol. 19, No. 5, 1978 and Hermann Grabert Projection operator techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, Band 95, 1982. In this case, the transport equation for a variable : A(t) = a(t) - \\\\delta A(t) , where a(t) is the mean value and \\\\delta A(t) is the fluctuation, be written as (use index notation with summation over repeated indices) Hermann Grabert Projection operator techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, Springer Tracts in Modern Physics, Band 95, 1982, S.18 : \\\\dot{A}_i(t) = v_i(t) + \\\\Omega_{ij}(t) \\\\delta A_j(t) + \\\\int_{0}^{t}ds K_i(t,s) + \\\\phi_{ij} (t,s) \\\\delta A_j(t) + F_i(t,0) , where : v_i(t) = \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)A_i) , : \\\\Omega_{ij}(t) = \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)}{\\\\partial a_j(t)} \\\\dot{A}_i) , : K_i(t,s) = \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\bar{\\\\rho}(s)iL(1-P(s))G(s,t)\\\\dot{A}_i), and : \\\\phi_{ij}(t,s) = \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)}{\\\\partial a_j(t)} iL(1-P(s))G(s,t)\\\\dot{A}_i) - \\\\dot{a}_k(t)\\\\text{Tr}(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)}{\\\\partial a_k(t) \\\\partial a_j(t)}G(s,t)\\\\dot{A}_i) . We have used the time-ordered exponential : G(s,t) = T_- \\\\exp(\\\\int_{s}^{t} du iL(1-P(u))) and the time-dependent projection operator : P(t)X = \\\\text{Tr}(\\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)X) + (A_i - a_i(t))\\\\text{Tr}(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{\\\\rho}(t)}{\\\\partial a_i(t)}X).

Here they erected a two-storey wharehouse. Having experienced difficulty when attempting to land cargoes at low tide, Fenner hit on the idea of an enclosed non-tidal docks for wharfingers created by building a 'canal' across the Isle of Dogs provided with entrance basins at each end and a central arm which would extend north towards the East and West India Dock Company's Timber Pond.

It was the sixteenth launch of a Soyuz-ST-B launch vehicle, and the 22nd launch of a Soyuz-2 series launch vehicle from the Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz at the Guiana Space Centre. After two scheduling delays and a 33-minute logistical delay, the rocket lifted off on 4 April 2019, and successfully delivered to medium Earth orbit the final four satellites in the O3b broadband satellite constellation, which services Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. After four previous Soyuz flights delivered the constellation's first sixteen satellites, the launch increased the constellation's throughput by 26 percent. The flight marked the second occasion in which two Soyuz-2 launch vehicles were launched on the same day, occurring hours after the launch of Progress MS-11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.  Rocket  The launch vehicle used in Soyuz flight VS22 was a Soyuz-ST-B ‚Äì a variant of the Soyuz-2.1b which utilizes a 4.1 √ó 11.4 metre \\"ST\\" payload fairing. The Soyuz-2.1b itself is a variant of the Soyuz-2 family that utilizes a RD-0124 engine for the Blok-I stage, rather than the older RD-0110 engine used on the Soyuz-2.1a. The RD-0124 grants 34 more seconds of specific impulse than its predecessor, improving the rocket's performance. Manufactured at the Progress Rocket Space Centre in Samara, Russia, the rocket's components had been adapted for the warmer climate at the Guiana Space Centre (Kourou). Its boosters and Blok-A first stage had also been equipped with pyrotechnic charges to ensure they would sink to the sea floor upon impact with the ocean. In contrast to the horizontal payload integration performed on Soyuz-2 rockets at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the payload is integrated vertically with the Soyuz-ST-B at Kourou, via a mobile service tower at the Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz (ELS) launch pad.  Payload  Communications satellite services company SES S.A. was the sole customer for Soyuz flight VS22, commissioning a launch of four O3b satellites. O3b is a broadband satellite constellation in non-geostationary orbit, which provides \\"fiber-like, high-performance data connectivity services\\" to Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. Each satellite weighed around , totaling a payload mass of . Flight VS22 is the fifth launch of an O3b satellite cluster ‚Äì previous launches include Soyuz flights VS05 in June 2013, VS08 in July 2014, VS10 in December 2014, and VS18 in March 2018. The launch increased the number of satellites in the constellation from 16 to 20, improving the constellation's bandwidth and performance, although it did not significantly increase the constellation's coverage area of 50¬∞ north and south of the equator. Designed to operate in the Ka band, each of the O3b satellites has a maximum throughput of 10‚Äì20 gigabits per second, and the four satellites launched aboard flight VS22 increased the total throughput of the constellation by 26 percent. The launch completed the \\"first generation\\" of 20 O3b satellites ‚Äì SES plans to succeed the constellation with the O3b mPOWER constellation, which will have a total throughput of up to 10 terabits per second. The satellites carried aboard flight VS22 are the 58‚Äì61st SES satellites to be commissioned for launch by Arianespace. They were also the 156‚Äì159th spacecraft launched by Arianespace to be manufactured by Thales Alenia Space and its predecessors.  Flight  Soyuz flight VS22 was delayed twice from its intended launch date on 26 March 2019; first to 29 March and later to 4 April. The Soyuz-ST-B launch vehicle was rolled out to Kourou's ELS launch pad on 1 April. After a 33-minute delay to allow for further checks on ground systems, it lifted off at 17:03:37 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on 4 April 2019, in an eastward direction over the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket's boosters and first two stages were expended in ten minutes, while the Fregat upper stage's S5.92 engine fired three times to place the Fregat and the O3b satellites aboard into a near-circular medium Earth orbit above the equator, at an altitude of . The lower orbit, roughly twenty times the height of the International Space Station (ISS) and a fourth of the altitude of typical geostationary satellites, allows for decreased latency between the satellites and the ground. The satellites were deployed two at a time, with the first set of satellites deployed at 19:03 UTC, and the second set 22 minutes later at 19:25 UTC. The flight lasted 2 hours and 22 minutes. After the mission, one final burn placed the Fregat into a controlled decaying orbit. Flight VS22 was the 22nd launch of a Soyuz-2 vehicle from Kourou since launches from the complex began in October 2011, and the fourth Soyuz-2 launch by Arianespace in five months. Launch frequency of the Soyuz-2 increased dramatically with the vehicle's usage in the OneWeb satellite programme, which started with Arianespace's previous Soyuz flight. Flight VS22 occurred five-and-a-half hours after the launch of a Soyuz-2.1a rocket from Baikonur that carried the Progress MS spacecraft 441 to the ISS during the Progress MS-11 mission, marking the second time that two Soyuz-2 rockets launched on the same day; the launch of the first four O3b satellites from Kourou, and Resurs-P No.1 from Baikonur, occurred within two hours of each other on 25 June 2013.

After gaining his pilot's licence, Rendall served with Imperial Airways, the Government of colonial Nigeria, the British Overseas Airways Corporation, and British Airways, becoming commander of its Vickers VC10 fleet. For his services during the Second World War, Norway appointed him a Knight of the Order of Saint Olav. He ended his career as an advisor to Air Ceylon. Early life Rendall was born at Chagford, Devon, on 3 January 1914. After leaving Gresham's School he attended the University of Leeds, where he graduated BSc in 1934.University of Leeds Register of Graduates (University of Leeds, 1965), p. 348: \\"Rendall, Athelstan Sigfrid Mellersh, BSc 1934\\" His first job was with the Herts and Essex Aero Club, where he stayed for two years, working as a ground engineer. While there, he gained a pilot's licence, and in 1936 successfully applied to Imperial Airways to join the company as a pilot officer.Captain 'Flaps' Rendell in The Daily Telegraph, 27 July 2006, accessed 7 April 2019 Career Imperial Airways routes in 1935 The Handley Page HP42 The Bristol 175 Britannia A BOAC VC10 In 1936 Rendall's flying career began as a co-pilot in a biplane, the HP 42 Hannibal, flying between Croydon Airport, London, and Paris‚ÄìLe Bourget. After that, he joined the new de Havilland Express route between Khartoum in the Sudan and air fields in West Africa. He was still a junior co-pilot, also serving as radio operator, steward, and engineer, and sometimes joked that his only actual flying activity was done by working the Express's wing flaps, which was how he came to be nicknamed \\"Flaps\\". During this phase of his career he also worked as a charter pilot for the government of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. On 1 April 1940, Imperial Airways was merged into a new company called the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).Phillip E. Sims, Adventurous Empires: The Story of the Short Empire Flying-Boats (2013), p. 219 In the first year of the Second World War, working out of Lagos, Nigeria, Rendall flew General Charles de Gaulle, as part of a campaign by the Allies to control the French African colonies. He was by now flying a Curtiss Commando for BOAC's worldwide service on flights to Gibraltar and Lisbon, and to the besieged Malta. The flights to Malta were at night, due to enemy action. After some eighteen months, he changed from flying the Commando to the Dakota. BOAC had stopped flying to Stockholm, due to the war, but in 1941 it re-established a service, and Rendall found himself flying Dakotas at night over Denmark to bring back vital industrial Swedish ball bearings from Stockholm to Great Britain. Denmark was occupied by German forces at the time, and the Dakotas he was flying were replaced by faster Mosquitos. In the last year of the war, Rendall transferred to fly Avro Yorks and Liberators to Cairo, and then to fly Lancasters to Australia. He also piloted Yorks on the route to Singapore and was promoted to the rank of Flight Captain. After the war, when the Hermes airliner came into service, Rendall was made flight superintendent of the BOAC Hermes fleet. He went on to become one of the earliest pilots to fly the new Bristol Britannia airliner and was again flight superintendent. In 1957 he flew Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on a visit to the Central African Federation, and he also flew Harold Macmillan, then the British prime minister, on a tour of Africa. In the same year he was appointed as deputy manager of his airline's fleet of Britannias.The Aeroplane, Volume 92 (Temple Press, 1957), p. 529 BOAC next posted him to Sydney as flight captain of its fleet of Boeing 707s, and then in 1962 he was transferred to command the Corporation's new Vickers VC10 fleet.White's Aviation, Volumes 17‚Äì18 (1962), p. 48: \\"The British Overseas Airways Corporation has appointed Captain A. S. M. Rendall to command the Corporation's fleet of Vickers VC-10's. Captain Rendall has been lately based at Sydney as Flight Captain for BOAC's Boeing 707 fleet.\\" This was a new British airliner aiming to rival the American machines then dominating long- haul flights. Praising the VC-10 in The Economist in 1964, Rendall said \\"VC-10s land 20 miles per hour slower than any of the other big jets. That's good. Yet they take off the runway sooner and cruise faster\\".The Economist, Volume 213 (1964), p. 233 In 1965, on behalf of BOAC, Rendall accepted the Cumberbatch Trophy for air safety, presented by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as Grand Master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators.B.O.A.C. Review (BOAC Public Relations Department, 1966), pp. 26, 58: \\"By the award of the Cumberbatch Trophy (for air safety) for 1965 to the BOAC fleets. HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, Grand Master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, presented the trophy to Captain ASM Rendall and Mr M W Anderson.\\" In 1966, he commented on some problems BOAC faced when introducing new aircraft, making the point that flight simulators were very valuable for early training, but when a new aircraft first went on sale they were rarely available.Flight International, Volume 89 (1966), p. 1/27 When he retired from British Airways, as the company had become in 1974, Rendall's log book recorded 15,500 hours of flying in fourteen different aircraft types. He then worked for Air Ceylon for three years, as an advisor on its new Hawker Siddeley Trident airliners. Personal life In 1938 Rendall married Marian Emma Morton, and they had six children, four of whom were twins. So that he could drive them all on motoring holidays, Rendall had an extra row of seats added to his car, a Lea-Francis. He was also a keen yachtsman, managing a 60-foot motor yacht for a friend who kept it in the Mediterranean, and going on to have a boat of his own built for sailing. Rendall's eldest son also became a BOAC pilot, and one of his granddaughters joined the Royal Air Force, flying a VC10 with No. 101 Squadron RAF which had previously been flown by her father and her grandfather. Early in 1990, the Rendalls were living at Medstead, near Alton, Hampshire.People and Places, Volume 51, Issue 512, Spring 1990, p. 183 at rnli.org, accessed 7 April 2019 His wife died in May 1990,\\"RENDALL, Marian Emma of Tarkwa Too Boyneswood Road Medstead Alton Hants died 30 May 1990\\", in Probate Index for England and Wales, 1990, entry 9052414998E at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 11 April 2019 and Rendall lived on for a further sixteen years.

She is an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report, contributing to the report's discussion of climate change mitigation pathways.  Education and early life  Steinberger, daughter of Nobel laureates in Physics Jack Steinberger, studied science at the Coll√®ge de Saussure in Switzerland, where she was awarded the de Saussure prize in 1993. Steinberger moved to the United States for her graduate degree, working at Brown University on the cosmic microwave background. She earned her PhD studying ultracold atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She worked in the Centre for ultracold atoms with Thomas Greytak and Daniel Kleppner, developing new ways to trap ultracold hydrogen and deuterium. The comparison of hyperfine splitting in the ground and excited state is expected to test quantum electrodynamics. During graduate school Steinberger was a member of the MIT Social Justice Cooperative.  Research and career  Steinberger was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Lausanne and then the University of Zurich, working alongside Claudia Binder. Steinberger was appointed Senior Researcher at the University of Klagenfurt Institute of Social Ecology in 2007. Her research considers the relationships between the use of resources (energy, materials and emission of greenhouse gases) and performance of societies (wellbeing and economic output). She is interested identifying new development pathways toward a low carbon society. She joined the University of Leeds as an associate professor in ecological economics in 2011. She is a member of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP). Steinberger showed the greenhouse gas emissions of global cities depends on the relation between geophysical and technical factors. She has also investigated the textile chain, food waste and materials use. Steinberger is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) iBUILD (Infrastructure BUsiness models, valuation and Innovation for Local Delivery) iBUILD. Steinberger is the Principal Investigator on the Leverhulme Trust Project \\"Living Well Within Limits\\". The project investigates what the biophysical requirements are for human well-being, and the influence of social provisioning on the levels of resource associated with this. The project also looks to understand how the world's limited resources could be used to preserve human wellbeing. To achieve this, Steinberger believes it is necessary to define what a \\"good\\" life is, understand what the requirements are for wellbeing and the context surrounding international inequality. Steinberger has studied how humanity can maintain a good quality of life without damaging the planet. She argues that to achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals the world must move away from growth and toward an economic model that promotes sustainability and equity. Steinberger and colleagues visualised the relationship between national performance in several environmental sustainability indicators and social thresholds for a 'good life'. She has criticised the BBC's coverage of environmental issues, when environmental analyst Roger Harrabin endorsed the Government of the United Kingdom's actions on climate. Steinberger supports the work of Greta Thunberg and the school strike for climate activists. She was one of 238 academics who called for the European Union to limit economic growth and instead promote stability and wellbeing. Steinberger has been the Lead Author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report for Working Group 3. She was also Lead Author on the Urbanisation knowledge module of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) Global Energy Assessment.

Tufts (April 15, 1879 ‚Äì November 8, 1952) was an American attorney and politician who served as a District Attorney of Middlesex County, Massachusetts from 1917 to 1921. He was removed from office and disbarred for misconduct in office. Early life Tufts was born on April 15, 1879 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. He graduated from Brown University in 1900 and Boston University Law School in 1903.A Souvenir of Massachusetts Legislators 1916 He was admitted to the bar in 1903 and opened a law office in Waltham, Massachusetts. Tufts was a noted football player at Fitchburg High School and Brown. From 1907 to 1909 he was the head football coach at Waltham High School. He was replaced in 1910 by the school's athletic director, Harry A. Dame. Tufts also served for many years as a referee for college football games. In 1909 he served as legal counsel for Hattie Le Blanc, a 16-year-old Acadian maid from West Arichat, Nova Scotia accused of murdering her employer, Clarence F. Glover of East Cambridge. Le Blanc was found not guilty. Political career Tufts began his political career in 1907 as a member of the Waltham Board of Alderman. From 1910 to 1914 he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he served as chairman of the committees on engrossed bills and legal affairs. From 1915 to 1916 he represented the Fifth Middlesex District in the Massachusetts Senate. He served as chairman of the Senate taxation committee and the special legislative taxation committee. In 1916, Tufts was elected District Attorney for Middlesex County, Massachusetts. During his tenure as DA, Tufts personally obtained evidence that led to the conviction of the unsolved murder of a child. He also obtained the convictions of Francisco Feci for the murder of Louis Fred Soulia, Frank S. Ramey for the assault of Mildred Wanamaker, and Charles S. Whittemore, Louis \\"Poco\\" Bennett, and Charles Mortalli for their roles in the armed robbery of the Everett General Electric Plant's payroll. During World War I he was active in seizing Communist literature. He was reelected in 1919. =Removal from office= On January 19, 1921, Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen released a report accusing Tufts of falsely reporting the city of escaped murder Herman L. Barney's surrender because Barney wanted to conceal this information so that those who had aided him while he was in hiding could not be prosecuted. Tufts, Allen alleged, agreed to this to further his own political career, which included a possible campaign for Governor of Massachusetts. He later accused Tufts and attorneys Daniel H. Coakley and William J. Corcoran of extorting money from Paramount Studio executives (including Adolph Zukor, Jesse L. Lasky, and Hiram Abrams) who attended a party at Mishawum Manor, a Woburn, Massachusetts brothel. On May 26, Allen petitioned the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for Tufts' removal. He accused Tufts of 32 allegations of malfensance, misfeasance, and nonfensance. It was the first time since 1861 (when Suffolk County District Attorney George W. Cooley was committed to an asylum) that the Attorney General had peitioned for the removal of a district attorney from office. Tufts hired Melvin Johnson to serve as his counsel during the proccedings. Tufts accused Allen of political animosity over his support for another candidate in the previous election and his opposition to legislation supported by Allen. He claimed that the large amount of money he deposited in his bank around the time of the alleged extortation was a gift from his dying father. On October 1, 1921, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found Tufts guilty of misconduct or breach of duty in the Barney, Mishawum Manor, and a number of other cases and removed him from office. He received notice of the court's decision while refereeing a football game between Princeton and Swarthmore College. On June 19, 1922 he was disbarred.

The Master's Lodge, St John's College, Cambridge Meynnart Wewyck or Maynard Vewicke was a Netherlandish painter, active ca. 1502-1525 in England. Wewyck was employed as an artist at the court of Henry VII of England and, after his death, by his son Henry VIII. He also spent a brief period at the court of James IV of Scotland. Surviving documentation associates Wewyck with portraits of several members of the royal family, and with drawings for the tomb of Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, at Westminster Abbey. New research published in 2019 has identified a portrait of Lady Margaret Beaufort in the Master's Lodge at St John's College, Cambridge as by Wewyck, and also attributes a painting of Henry VII at the Society of Antiquaries of London to his hand. In follow-on work, a group of researchers suggests that four surviving portraits of Henry VIII and two of his mother, Elizabeth of York, should also be attributed to Wewyck.  Career  Wewyck was one of the earliest artists of the Tudor court and his long career working for Henry VII and Henry VIII is well-documented. The richness of this documentation is suggested by the recorded variants of his name. On 19 September 1502 \\"Mynour, the Inglis payntour\\" (that is, the painter to the English court) delivered four portraits of the English royal family to James IV of Scotland at Stirling Castle.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. xxix, 341, 405. These included pictures of Henry, Queen Elizabeth of York, Prince Henry (later Henry VIII), and Princess Margaret, who had been married by proxy to James in January 1502. Wewyck remained at the Scottish court until November 1503, when he returned to England. Lady Margaret Beaufort was the mother of Henry VII and the foundress of St John's College and Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1506, her executors (among them John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester) paid \\"Maynard Waywike Duchman\\" for her likeness; this supports the consensus that the artist was likely Netherlandish.Foister (2003) states \\"probably of Netherlandish origin\\" based on this evidence. In 1510 Wewyck was hired by the executors to devise a \\"table\\" (painting) and \\"patrones\\" (pattern drawings) for Lady Margaret's tomb, to be sculpted by Pietro Torrigiano for Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. Surviving receipts from 1511 and 1512 document payments for this work. One of these records both a typical English variant and Wewyck's own spelling of his name: Wewyck was recorded as resident in the parish of All Hallows the Great in London in 1523. He was still alive in 1525; the accounts of Henry VIII record a half-yearly payment to \\"olde maynerd wewoke paynter\\" in September of that year. Works Henry VII, newly attributed to Meynnart Wewyck, Society of Antiquaries of London. As the first painter of portraits appointed by an English king, Wewyck \\"almost certainly painted the originals\\" of a widely-copied set of similar bust-length portraits of Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Prince Arthur, Prince Henry, and Lady Margaret Beaufort. However, no surviving paintings could be firmly ascribed to the artist before 2019. On 29 March 2019, St John's College, Cambridge announced that new research had identified a portrait of Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII and foundress of the college, as an original work by Wewyck. The portrait was commissioned ca. 1510 (the year after her death) by John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and transferred to St John's in 1534, at the time of Rochester's fall from grace. It now hangs in the Master's Lodge at the college. Art historians Dr Charlotte Bolland of the National Gallery, London and Dr Andrew Chen of St John's published their research in the April 2019 issue of The Burlington Magazine. Their confident attribution to Wewyck draws on \\"new archival, scientific and stylistic evidence\\", including previously unpublished documents, and concludes that the painting is \\"[p]robably the earliest known large-scale portrait of an English woman\\". A copy painted by Rowland Lockey ca. 1598 preserves details obscured by darkened varnish and paint loss on the original. Based on their work with the portrait of Lady Margaret Beaufort, they also attributed a stylistically and structurally similar portrait of Henry VII held by the Society of Antiquaries of London to Wewyck. Dr Chen described the significance of these discoveries: ‚ÄúThese paintings can serve as touchstones for further research into Wewyck‚Äôs work. As perhaps the first Netherlandish painter to find work at the Tudor court, Wewyck stands at the beginning of a process of the transfer of artistic skills that would dominate the production of painted portraiture in England throughout the 16th century.‚Äù That further research occurred rapidly: later in 2019, a group of specialists from the Yale Center for British Art, with support from the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Hamilton Kerr Institute, Cambridge, initiated a research project at the Denver Art Museum.

Pindell withdrew himself from consideration after alleged private corresponsence between Pindell and U.S. Senator J. Hamilton Lewis was leaked to the press.  Business and newspaper activities  Pindell graduated from DePaul University in 1884. After graduation from college, Pindell began working as the city editor of the Wabash Times. Next, he joined the editorial staff of the Chicago Tribune. He later worked as the city editor of the Illinois State Register in Springfield, Illinois. After moving to Peoria, Illinois in 1889, Pindell founded the Peoria Herald, now known as the Journal Star. For a time, he served on the Board of the Associated Press.  Political career  While in Springfield, Pindell was elected City treasurer. He served in the position from 1887 until 1889. Through his role as the owner of a variety of newspapers, Pindell became highly influential politically. In 1912, he became a state leader of Woodrow Wilson's Presidential Campaign.

It is most closely associated with the Lloyd's of London insurance market that comprises numerous competing \\"syndicates\\", and in order to close each accounting year and declare a profit or loss, each syndicate annually \\"reinsures to close\\" its books. In most cases, the liabilities are simply reinsured into the subsequent accounting year of the same syndicate, however, in some circumstances the RITC may be made to a different syndicate or even to a company outside of the Lloyd's market. History At Lloyd's, traditionally each year of each syndicate is a separate enterprise, and the profitability of each year is determined essentially by payments for known liabilities (claims) and money reserved for unknown liabilities that may emerge in the future on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). The estimation of the quantity of IBNR is difficult and can be inaccurate. Capital providers typically \\"joined\\" their syndicate for one calendar year only, and at the end of the year the syndicate as an ongoing trading entity was effectively disbanded. However, usually the syndicate re-formed for the next calendar year with more or less the same capital membership. In this way, a syndicate could have a continuous existence for many years, but each year was accounted for separately. Since some claims can take time to be reported and then paid, the profitability of each syndicate took time to realise. The practice at Lloyd's was to wait three years from the beginning of the year in which the business was written before \\"closing\\" the year and declaring a result. For example, for the 1984 year a syndicate would ordinarily declare its result at 31 December 1986. The syndicate's 1984 members would therefore be paid any profit during 1987 (in proportion to their share of the total capacity of the syndicate); conversely, they would have to reimburse the syndicate during 1987 for their share of any 1984 loss. For the estimated future claims liabilities, the syndicate bought an RITC; the premium for the reinsurance was equal to the amount of the reserve. In other words, rather than placing the reserve in a bank to earn interest, the syndicate transferred its liabilities for future claims to a reinsurer, thus allowing the year to be closed and the profit or loss to be declared. For example, the members of syndicate number '1' in 1985 reinsured the future liabilities of the members of syndicate '1' in 1984. The membership might be the same, or it might have changed. Disadvantages A capital provider for a syndicate with a long history of RITC transactions could ‚Äì and often did ‚Äì become liable for losses on insurance policies written many years or even decades previously. If the reserves had been accurately estimated and the appropriate RITC premium paid every year, then this would not present an issue. However, it became apparent during the asbestosis crisis at Lloyd's in the 1990s that in many cases this had not been possible: a huge surge in asbestos and pollution related losses was not foreseen or adequately reserved for. Therefore, the amounts of money transferred from earlier years by successive RITC premiums to cover these losses were grossly insufficient, and the later members had to pay the shortfall. Similarly, within a stock company, an initial reserve for future claims liabilities is set aside immediately, in year one. Any deterioration in that initial reserve in subsequent years will result in a reduced profit in the later years, and a consequently reduced dividend and/or share price for shareholders in those later years, whether or not those shareholders in the later year are the same as the shareholders in year one. Arguably, Lloyd's practice of using reserves in year three to establish the RITC premiums should have resulted in a more equitable handling of losses such as asbestosis than would the stock company approach. Nevertheless, the difficulties in correctly estimating losses such as these overwhelmed even Lloyd's extended process.

In 1955 he published the first measurements of light emission by semiconductor diodes made from crystals of gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium antimonide (GaSb), and indium phosphide (InP). GaAs, GaSb, and InP are examples of III-V semiconductors. The III-V semiconductors absorb and emit light much more strongly than silicon, which is the best-known semiconductor. Braunstein's devices are the forerunners of contemporary LED lighting and semiconductor lasers, which typically employ III-V semiconductors. The 2000 and 2014 Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded for further advances in closely related fields. Braunstein was raised in New York City. He earned a doctorate in physics from Syracuse University in 1954. He then joined the research laboratory of the RCA Corporation, which was among the most active industrial laboratories at the time. In the following decade at RCA Laboratories he published broadly on semiconductor physics and technology. Beyond his seminal work with light emission from III-V semiconductors, in 1964 he exploited newly invented lasers to publish the first paper on two-photon absorption in semiconductors. Typically, only individual photons (particles of light) with some minimum energy are absorbed by a given semiconductor. For very high intensity beams of light, two photons, each with half that minimum energy, can be absorbed simultaneously. He also published highly cited foundation papers on the electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of III-V semiconductors, silicon, and germanium. Several papers by Braunstein and his colleagues are used as original references. In 1964 Braunstein became a professor of physics at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he remained for the rest of his career. His research there continued his RCA work with optoelectronic properties of semiconductors as well as contributions related to the optical properties of highly transparent materials such as tungstate glasses. Some of Braunstein's work was theoretical, including the proposal that neutral atoms could be scattered by a sufficiently intense standing wave of light. Since light is an electromagnetic wave, it had long been known that charged particles like electrons would be scattered. The effect with neutral atoms is much weaker, but was finally observed nearly 20 years after the proposal of Braunstein and his co-authors. Braunstein was selected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1964. See also *Light-emitting diode#History *List of Syracuse University people References Further reading .

Early life and career  Rodrigues was part of the Portuguese royal household as wet nurse, then governess to Prince Manuel (born 1469) before he ascended the throne as King Manuel I of Portugal. Manuel I later entrusted Rodrigues with making several trips to Castile to arrange marriages for members of the royal family. She was successful in negotiating terms for Manuel I's marriage to Isabella of Aragon around 1496, and seems to have received a financial reward for her efforts. She evidently remained closely tied to the royal family for many years, as she also served as governess for Manuel I's second son, Prince Luis (1506-1555). Rodrigues was known to be the mistress of Frei Jo√£o Manuel, Bishop of Ceuta and Guarda, with whom she had two children: Jo√£o Manuel (c. 1468-1500), who became mayor of Santar√©m and later High Chamberlain to King Manuel I, and Nunho Manuel (c. 1469‚Äì?), Lord of Salvaterra de Magos. There is evidence to suggest she is the subject of \\"Justa fue mi perdici√≥n,\\" a poem, and later a song, popular in Portugal in the 15th and 16th centuries, that was originally written by her longtime partner Jo√£o Manuel. According to an anecdote from an 18th century Portuguese genealogist, Frei Jo√£o Manuel repented of his youthful excesses later in life by saying \\"Justa fue mi perdi√ßi√≥n,\\" which is a play on words that can be interpreted in several ways, including, \\"Justa (the woman) was my downfall.\\"  Religious life and legacy  Rodrigues founded the Convent of Jesus of Set√∫bal, receiving approval from Pope Innocent VIII on June 15, 1489 by papal bull. In 1490, she received royal approval to begin construction by building the crypt. King John II of Portugal initially sponsored the project and commissioned the architect Diogo de Boitaca to design the building. The community became part of a reform movement within the Order of Saint Clare to restore more rigorous restrictions on the ownership of property. Sometime after 1492, Rodrigues' convent became the first in Portugal to follow the stricter Rule of St. Clare as interpreted by Saint Colette of Corbie. Upon her death in 1514, Rodrigues was buried at the Convent of Jesus of Set√∫bal.

History The Cleveland Council was founded in October 1963 by Louis Rosenblum, a NASA scientist; Herbert Caron, a psychologist; and Daniel Litt, a Reform movement rabbi. Abe Silverstein, Director of the NASA Lewis Research Center (now the John Glenn Research Center), served as the inaugural honorary board chairman. The Cleveland Council's goals were to \\"galvanize\\" American Jewish organizations to undertake a public campaign to pressure the USSR to grant rights to its Jewish citizens, including the right to emigrate, and to inspire the American Jewish community to create an organization dedicated to the liberation of Soviet Jewry from antisemitic oppression.

The founding of the Cleveland Council was controversial because much of the American Jewish establishment believed that effectively pressuring the Soviet Union to cease antisemitic treatment of Jews was not only hopeless, but might prove counterproductive, might, that is, lead the Russian authorities to treat Jews even worse. Soviet Jews in the 1960s were deprived of the freedom to practice their religion by Soviet policies such as bans of baking matzah for the celebration of the Passover holiday and circumcision. The Cleveland Council rapidly became well- known, staging large rallies and innovative protests at events featuring touring Soviet sports and theatrical groups and publishing how-to guides to publicizing the plight of Soviet Jewry that circulated nationally.

History The group first formed as a freelance unit on 17 February 1938 at a sanatorium for Red Army officers in the village of Gnyozdovo (near Smolensk). By order of Marshal of the Soviet Union Klement Voroshilov on 9 January 1939, the group was formally introducted as the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the Belarusian Special Military District. In 1940, the ensemble followed the example of the military district headquarters, and was transferred to Minsk from Smolensk. During the World War II (known as the Great Patriotic War in Russia and Belarus), the ensemble served on the frontlines to regularly perform 4-5 performances a day for frontline troops, which resulted in over 40 artists being awarded with honorary medals such as the Order of Glory. On the 1945 Victory Day (9 May), the team performed in the liberated Soviet city of K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad). In 1949, it became known as the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the Belarusian Military District, which served Soviet Army troops in the Belarusian SSR. In the postwar period, the team grew and progressed in various ways, performing for soldiers in the garrisons on Belarusian territory, as well as performing abroad which included a 1982 trip to the Polish People's Republic and a 1986 trip to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In 1990, the ensemble conducted a European tour which included France, Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, Spain and other countries in a sign of a thaw in East-West relations. In March 1992, the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble was renamed to its current name. In 1998, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the ensemble, the ensemble was given the honorary title of being an \\"Academic Ensemble\\", and on 1 September 2009, the ensemble became an official state institution.

With over 25,000 acres in a remote corner of the national forest, the cluster provides protection for black bear, clean water, backcountry hiking, and scenic beauty. Description The Barbours Creek/Shawvers Run Wilderness Cluster contains wilderness areas, and wildlands recognized by the Wilderness Society as ‚ÄúMountain Treasures‚Äù, areas that are worthy of protection from logging and road construction. The areas in the cluster are: *Wilderness Areas **Barbours Creek Wilderness **Shawvers Run Wilderness *Wildareas in the Jefferson National Forest recognized by the Wilderness Society as ‚ÄúMountain Treasures‚Äù **Hoop hole **Barbours Creek Wilderness Addition **Potts Arm *Toms Knob, a wildarea in the George Washington National Forest recognized by the Wilderness Society as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. Location and access 1983 Map of the north portion of the Jefferson National Forest in southwest Virginia The cluster is about six miles north of New Castle. Roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Biological significance The land form, climate, soils and geology of the Appalachian highlands, as well as its evolutionary history, have created one of the most diverse collection of plants and animals in the deciduous forests of the temperate world. At one time the American chestnut was a dominant part of the forest, but it was almost eliminated during the first three decades of the twentieth century by a chestnut blight fungus. Now the area is dominated by different species of oak. Geologic history Extending along the western boundary of Virginia, the Ridge and Valley province is composed of long, relatively level-crested, ridges with highest elevations reaching over 3600 feet. The province marks the eastern boundary in the Paleozoic era of an older land surface on the east. It was uplifted and eroded during the Paleozoic with extensive folding and thrust-faulting. Resistant quartzite, conglomerates and sandstones form the ridge caps while less resistant shales and limestones eroded to form the intervening valleys. The area is part of the James River drainage. Shawvers Run is a tributary of Potts Creek, which flows into the James River. Barbours Creek flows into Craig Creek, a tributary of the James River. Toms Knob Toms Knob is a wildarea that extends into both the James River District of the George Washington National Forest and the Eastern Divide District of the Jefferson National Forest. A review by the wilderness society of areas in the George Washington National Forest recognized the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. Named after a series of rock outcrops on the crest of Potts Mountain, the knob offers good views of the Potts Creek Valley and Peters Mountain on the west. The Potts Mountain Jeep Road, running along the crest of Potts Mountain, separates the area from the Barbours Creek Wilderness. The highest elevation is about 3800 feet on the crest of Potts Mountain; the lowest elvation is 1750 feet in Shanty Hollow on the northeast corner of the area. The area includes a small Special Biological Area on the crest of the ridge, as well as small areas of potential old-growth trees. There are a few short trails in the Shanty Hollow area, in the northeastern tip of the area. Trails include: *Childrens Forest, Forest Service Trail 626, 0.3 miles *Childrens Forest Long Loop, FS Trail 627, 2.6 miles *Childrens Forest Horse, FS Trail 628, 3.3 miles Black bear American black bear - FWS The cluster's large area provides essential habitat for the black bear population, an umbrella species contributing to the biological diversity of the Appalachians. The area gives bear a refuge from human activities, and the availability of critical food in the form of acorns from oaks, as well as spring and summer foods such as blueberries, blackberries, pokeweed and huckleberries. Bears require space for escape cover and winter dens. Without the forest lands in the Appalachians, the black bear population would be threatened. Steel Bridge Recreation Area The recreation area, on Potts Creek, is at the north end of Shawvers Run Wilderness. Visitors on hot summer days can wade in the cold water of Potts Creek or enjoy fishing in pools beneath rock overhangs along the banks of Potts Creek. There are 20 primitive campsites with tables, fireplaces, hand-pumped water and pit toilets. The area is open year-around.

Amongst the major companies taking part were Path√©, Gaumont and √âclair of France, Cines and Ambrosio Film of Italy, Messter Film of Germany, Hepworth Pictures of Britain and Nordisk of Denmark.Thorsen p.71-72 Vitagraph an American producer and member of the MPCC, but who had extensive distribution and production interests in Europe, also attended. It was called mainly in response to the formation of the MPCC, a cartel of the leading film producers in the United States, organised by Thomas Edison. For the major European producers, this threatened their traditionally strong position in America. The formation of the MPCC in late 1908, encouraged those European producers excluded from the pact to seek a similar arrangement in Europe to protect their interests. One of their major objectives was to tackle the perceived overproduction of films which were flooding the market, one manner in which was to cease the traditional practice of selling films outright and instead to rent them through distribution agencies for a limited period of time. This reduced the films in circulation.Thorsen p.72 Another move was an attempt to secure the rights to an exclusive deal with Eastman Kodak to supply raw film stock, and the date of the congress had been arranged so that George Eastman could attend. He was interested in becoming a monopoly supplier, similar to his deal with the MPCC in America. However this arrangement, which excluded any European producers not part of the Congress, was ruled to be illegal under French law. Similarly a move to create a single fixed price for films also eventually failed.Thorsen p.72 In April, a follow up meeting was held in Paris at which the proposed Association was fatally undermined as Path√©, the world's biggest company and also one of the members of the MPCC through its Path√© Exchange subsidiary in America, chose to abandon the European Association. Path√© followed this up by an attempt to undercut the prices of its European rivals and drive them out of business.Thorsen p.73 Ultimately, increasing American domination of the American and then European film markets came about not from the MPCC cartel, but from a group of independent producers such as Fox Film, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Metro Pictures and First National.

In the painting, three figures in mourning standing over a burial pit; their shadows cast over the person who has passed. =Nacimiento del √Ångel (Birth of the Angel)= In the painting Birth of the Angel (1993), Vigil drew circular, planetary shapes that appear to recede in space, representing stages of birth for an angel. In the foreground stands an angel in white clothing that transforms into wings. Her fingers are spread to appear as if preparing to ascend to Heaven through the dark background filled with stars. =Did I Ever Tell You I Love You?= The angelic theme recurs in Did I Ever Tell You I Love You?, oil on canvas (1992). Below the moon and stars in the sky, two figures are depicted: an older man and a woman, both of which are rendered as angels. The older man is on his knees, mourning over the death of his wife. An angel hovers over him in the air, its hands reaching towards the man. The background is painted with a scene of a cemetery with six tombstones in a field. =Ang√©lico Sonido= Inspired and similar to Renaissance painter Fra Angelico, Vigil's Ang√©lico Sonido use of color differs from her other angelic themes in her artwork. Two men are depicted in this painting. They both wear black boater hats with their heads down, covering their eyes. The man on the left has his mouth open, revealing his top teeth. The man in the middle has his head lowered, covering his eyes even more than the man on the left, holding what appears to be a guitar. On the far right is a woman with wings (angel), who also holds and plays what appears to be a mandolin. The angel, as in most of her work, acts as a protecting force that motivates the two men. =Nunca= In Nunca, the piece is simple compared to her other works. All the audience sees is a person, a fire, and an angel. Bernadette Vigil's depiction of angels emphasizes the role an heavenly being plays, to protect, guide, and look over people even though they are not with them physically. The angel in Nunca hovers over the human from above and acts as a guide and protective force. Both the angel and the human are in the same position, knees bent with their hands up. =El Jardin= This wet-fresco mural of a Northern New Mexico scene, framed by two ears of blue corn depicts the local landscape, sun, moon, seeds blowing in the sky, and freshly picked vegetables laid before the viewer. According to the City of Santa Fe Arts Commission the mural took three months to complete. Publications Vigil created the cover art for Bless Me, Ultima, a coming-of-age novel written by Rudolfo Anaya, originally published in 1972. Vigil authored the book, Mastery of Awareness: Living the Agreements, published in 2001 by Simon & Schuster/Bear & Company.

Early life Maria was the daughter of the Veere schepen and burgomaster Pieter van ReigersbergAs Nellen speculates, Pieter van Reigersberch probably was a partisan of William the Silent, because that great noble was Marquis of Veere and Flushing and therefore had a say in the appointment of the magistrates of the city of Veere. and Maria Nicolai (also known as Mayken Claesdr.). Her parents fled to Boulogne sur Mer during the troubled times of the reign of Governor General Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester over the Dutch Republic and may only have returned to Veere after her birth, so that her birthplace is a matter of speculation.Nellen. As most women at the time, she did not receive a formal education, though she was able to read and write. Her family was rich and she therefore was a desirable marriage partner. She married the up-and-coming lawyer Hugo de Groot (better known as Grotius), who had just been appointed advocaat-fiscaal (prosecutor) at the Hof van Holland on 2 July 1608 in VeereKnappert, p. 1181. The couple settled in The Hague where Grotius made a swift career under the mentorship of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the Land's Advocate of Holland. In 1613 he was appointed pensionary of the city of Rotterdam with as main task the representation of that city in the States of Holland and West Friesland and the States General of the Netherlands. During this period their first seven children were born: Cornelia (26 April 1611) and Cornelis (2 February 1613) in The Hague; Pieter (24 February 1614; died 18 June 1614); another Pieter (28 March 1615), Fran√ßoise (17 August 1616; died 3 May 1617), Maria (16 April 1617), and Diederik (10 October 1618; a month and a half after Grotius' arrest) in RotterdamKnappert, pp. 1182-1183 Grotius' trial, incarceration and escape Grotius was arrested on 29 August 1618, together with van Oldenbarnevelt, Rombout Hogerbeets, the pensionary of Leiden, and Gilles van Ledenberg, the secretary of the States of Utrecht, on suspicion of treason, on the orders of stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange. They were held incommunicado for eight months, during which time Maria was not allowed to visit her husband in his cell in the Binnenhof, not even when he was taken severely ill. Eventually, Grotius was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 May 1619 by a court of 24 delegated judges of the States General. He was to serve his sentence in Loevestein Castle, together with Hogerbeets, who received the same sentence. Maria immediately started to pester the States General with petitions to obtain better living conditions for her husband. She was eventually able to get permission to live at the castle for extended periods of time with her children and servants. She also obtained permission for Grotius to receive books to help him in his research. These books were transported in a chest. On 22 March 1621 Maria helped Grotius into that chest, while she faked his body in his bed with his upper clothes. The chest was transported to Gorinchem, escorted by Maria's maid Elsje van Houwening; Maria stayed behind and was locked up herself for a while. Grotius traveled to Paris and was followed by his wife, after she had been released. Life in exile In Paris Grotius expressed his gratitude for his wife's role in his escape with the Latin poem Silva ad Thuanum in which he made it known that the ruse with the chest had been invented by Maria. Grotius soon unleashed a torrent of pamphlets and larger publications in which he defended Oldenbarnevelt and himself (the best-known is his Apologia or Verantwoordingh, published in Latin and Dutch in Paris in 1622). In the next decade he became an icon of the faction that would grow into the Dutch States Party. On 31 October 1626 another daughter, Fran√ßoise, was born in Paris, who died shortly after.Knappert, p. 1184 Because Grotius could not safely visit the Dutch Republic, Maria was often called upon to manage his affairs there. She took care of the contacts with his Dutch publishers, and also started several lawsuits to undo the forfeiture of his assets (and hers, because her considerable wealth was in their community property that had been seized in its entirety). For her own property she was successful in 1625 (after the death of Maurice and the appointment of his half-brother Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange as the new stadtholder), while the forfeiture of Grotius' assets was lifted in 1630. She also sued Rotterdam for Grotius' arrears in pay, because the city government had stopped his salary after his conviction. From the correspondence with her husband during these absences it becomes clear that Maria was in charge of the finances in the family.She left an extensive correspondence, not only with her husband, but also with her friends and business contacts, that was published in 1902; Cf. Grotius was appointed ambassador of Christina, Queen of Sweden to France in 1635. Maria then began to live in great style, living in the ambassadorial residence with many servants, and hosting sumptious parties for fellow diplomats. On one of her voyages to The Hague in this period she used a carriage with six horses, which caused much jealousy among the Hague inhabitants, to Maria's secret pleasure. She also visited the Queen Regent of France, Anne of Austria, regularly on her own. Maria had her own income from her possessions in the Republic. She invested (not always wisely) on her own. In short, she was an independent woman. After Grotius death in 1645 in Rostock Maria did not travel to Delft for his funeral, but remained for a while in Paris, where she started upon the project of publishing Grotius' collected works (continued after her own death by her sons). She eventually returned to The Hague, where she died on 19 April 1653. From her last will it becomes clear that she died a rich woman, who had given her daughter a large dowry, and left her three surviving sons large bequests. She was buried with her husband in the Nieuwe Kerk (Delft).

It was nominated as a distinctive symbol of Virginia's importance as a major entry point to the Mesabi Range, and of the region's dependence on rail transport to deliver goods and workers and ship out ore. The Virginia Depot occupies a prominent site at the west end of Chestnut Street, the artery running through Virginia's historic downtown. Immediately behind the depot is Silver Lake.

In the city, he trained as a draftsman and studied under Ernst Keller at the Zurich Kunstgewerbeschule. Ballmer began professional work as a designer for Hoffmann-La Roche in 1926. In his years at the company, Ballmer became acquainted with a number of avant-garde contemporaries, including Hannes Meyer. \\"Working people chose Communists\\" (1935) In 1928, Ballmer enrolled in the Bauhaus, then under the direction of Meyer. At the school, he studied photography under Walter Peterhans. Ballmer left the Bauhaus in 1930, motivated by his left-leaning political beliefs. Ballmer is best known for his political poster designs, produced directly after his departure from the school. The works are characterized by their use of red and black linocut silhouettes and leftist messages. In 1931, Ballmer joined the faculty of the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule Basel, where he taught photography and design. Ballmer remained associated with the school until his death in 1965. After 1930, Ballmer additionally worked for a number of corporate clients; among the work he produced in this capacity is the logo for the Basel municipal authority. In the mid 1940s, Ballmer and his contemporary, Max Bill, pioneered a new style of graphic design characterized by the use of photography, sans serif typefaces, and logical arrangement of elements. The work produced by the two designers in this period proved foundational to the later emergence of the International Typographic Style. Th√©o Ballmer died in 1965.

It is also known as ‚Äúsexual shame‚Äù. It is linked with the negative social stigma and cultural expectations that are held towards sex as well as the historical religious opposition of all immoral sexual acts. Participation in sexual intercourse does not need to occur to experience sexual guilt, however, self sexual pleasure or sexual activities with others are major causes. Sexual guilt can also be felt by an individual who feels guilty about the idea of sex. Sexual guilt can be derived from the negative pressures placed upon individuals throughout a lifetime of parental messages or religious teachings surrounding sexual activity and expression. Sexual guilt can severely impact the affected individual and deteriorate the relationships of those close to them. It has been linked to cases of sexual dysfunction, clinical depression and other mental illnesses. Sexual guilt can also cause physical impacts and illnesses. If the individual feels shame or guilt towards sexual participation they may be less likely to seek protective and contraceptive measures or seek medical attention if they encounter symptoms from sexual intercourse. Within the modern era of sexual expressiveness and instant sexual gratification, sexual education plays an important role in reducing the impacts and risk of sexual guilt as its incidence increases. Past historical research into the cause of sexual guilt has shown to require more study.  Causes of sexual guilt  Participation in sexual activity or intercourse does not need to take place in order for someone to encounter sexual guilt. Sexual guilt can come from participating in sexual acts, thinking about participating in sexual acts or from critically judging sexual acts and attitudes of yourself or others. = Internal = Sexual guilt can originate from: * Feeling guilty about having sexual desires that do not fit within the individual's established set of values or morals. * Viewing pornography can trigger sexual guilt in individuals who feel guilty or embarrassed about taking part in sexual activity or viewing it. * Masturbating or self pleasure can be seen as an act that isn't moral or dutiful as it serves no procreative purpose and is only an act of self pleasure. *Having an interest in kinks or sexual acts which aren't seen as traditionally 'normal' e.g. BDSM, bondage, anal sex, and many other varieties of sex. = Past experiences = Studies have suggested that sexual guilt can be a predictor for individuals' past relationships, sexual attitudes and experiences such as * The individual's first sexual encounter and the loss of virginity. * Suspicion of, or thoughts of, cheating within a relationship can cause sexual guilt within the individual and their partner. * Dissatisfaction of sexual intercourse that do not meet the individual's sexual expectations. **E.g. a study of hook-up culture in colleges led researchers to find \\"penetrative sex hookups increased psychological distress for females, but not for males.\\" = External Influences = Sexual guilt can be caused by \\"messages about approved or disapproved attitudes toward sexual issues\\" that individuals face from external sources such as family, friends, and religious groups. cultural ‚Äònorms‚Äô or identifying as a non-binary sexual orientation. * Not identifying under the traditional heterosexual sexual orientation can be highly problematic for individuals within religious groups or cultures whose teachings and beliefs oppose these sexual orientations. ** This can also cause anxiety and internal conflict as the individual has to \\"come out\\" to their family, friends and groups which may not agree with their decision. ***sexual activity performed outside of wedlock is illegal in some Muslim countries, e.g. Pakistan, Iran, or Morocco. ***Participation or thoughts within any sexual acts which may be illegal can cause a high degree of sexual guilt. In western countries it is illegal if sex is non consensual sex, Incest or the individual is not of the legal age. Image from ancient mural at Pompeii of Couple performing oral sex  Types of sexual guilt There are two main psychologically recognised types of sexual guilt ‚Äì ‚Äúlatent‚Äù guilt and ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù guilt. Each type of guilt can be found in different scenarios and can cause different effects upon the individual. = Latent guilt = Latent guilt is an intrinsic feeling of shame or guilt that comes from the negative association of sexual activity or desire as a base or animal instinct. Individuals with Latent guilt may believe that sexual activity shows a weakness that breaks down the individual‚Äôs strength of character. People who encounter this form of sexual guilt do not have to physically participate in sexual activities to feel it. Individuals can feel shame towards their own inner desire, or they may possess a lowered libido, inability to climax and which could impact their relationships. = Morning after guilt = ‚ÄúMorning after guilt‚Äù is derived from the feeling of guilt, sin or shame felt by the individual after they have committed an act that is not in line with their own internal values or within the expectations of people in a relationship or within a certain group, nationality, culture or religion. This type of sexual guilt can most commonly be found within individuals who regret performing an act of sexual activity e.g. cheating within a relationship, partaking in premarital sex, or having sex with someone who the individual regrets performing the action with. As the colloquial name suggests, it is commonly experienced the ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù, or post-coitus. Erotic scene painted scene on pottery in Louvre  Sociocultural impacts  Ancient religions and cultures shape how society behaves today. The sexual attitudes of religions in the past can be seen as having an effect upon the sexual attitudes and pressures felt in the modern-day. Each religion looks at sexual activity independently and hold different rules and moral expectations while many have overlapping values and ideas about the role sex should play. = Religion = Religious beliefs and writings often set expectations upon people to behave and interact in a certain way. Marriage between a male and female is seen in multiple religions as the only type of relationship in which sexual activity should occur; this can place pressure upon people within non- heterosexual relationships. The Catholic Church has a traditional view towards sexual activity, teaching followers that such activity should be done within the confines of marriage as a \\"noble and worthy\\"Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 49: AAS 58 (1966), 1070 act between a man and a woman. The Church considers other sexual acts such as homosexuality and masturbation, as well as the use of contraceptives, to be sinful. Religions such as Judaism consider restraining from sex to be an immoral act, whereas Islam looks as sex as an act that should be responsibly acted upon through marriage. Sexual pleasure is emphasized within marriage when care and love is present.. However, homosexuality is often strictly demonized within these religions, with some believing it should be punishable by death. Hinduism is a religion that has a strong binding to sexual pleasure, or kama; however, this pleasure is thought to be a responsibility of marriage, and is to be avoided until the age of 25, in favor of virtuous living and intellectual, financial and spiritual development. The Kama Sutra is a text thought to be of sacred religious meaning in relation to sex, though it primarily aims to show the three pillars of Hinduism - dharma, artha and kama. Vatsyayana's text is supposed to signify the significance of sexual activity in relation to the priorities of virtuous living and financial gain, Indra Sinha. A research paper was done by Mark. P Gunderson and James Leslie McCary in which 373 college students completed a 173 item questionnaire to determine whether sexual guilt or religion was a better indicator of the individuals' \\"level of sex information obtained, sexual attitudes held and sexual behaviour expressed\\". They found that > \\"Sexual guilt is a far better and more powerful predictor of level of sex > information obtained, sexual attitudes held, and sexual behaviour expressed > than religion. The conclusion is that religion is an intervening variable > with sexual guilt such that the more frequently students attend church, the > more likely they are to have high sexual guilt which interferes with their > sexuality.\\" = Cultural impacts = Social and cultural attitudes and expectations upon members of their community can be felt by the individual and cause sexual guilt, embarrassment, anxiety or even sexual abstinence. Some of these values and behaviours may have been derived from sexual myths and legends which have amalgamated into societal expectations and social stigmas towards acts and forms of sex. Sexual orientation and identification is a major cause of sexual guilt, anxiety and feelings of non-inclusivity for people with a non- heterosexual sexual orientation. Each country and territory has its own LGBT laws and rights which are based on the cultural values and beliefs of that region. In some cultures it is illegal to be in a same-sex relationship, which is punishable by imprisonment or death. Some of the laws and rights surrounding sex have been shaped by myths and legends which may support more traditional or spiritual forms of sex. Some myths and art show evidence for the presence of LGBT themes in mythology and ancient cultures.Image of Aztec God of homosexuality Xochipilli. Research into the effects of sexual myths upon the sexual guilt and levels of sexual activity of college men and women was undertaken by Donald.L Mosher upon 88 anonymous male and female students. It concluded that > \\"The level of sex experience was not correlated with belief in sex myths. > Sex guilt was negatively correlated with level of sex experience and > positively correlated with belief in sex myths. High‚Äêsex‚Äêguilt males > endorsed myths portraying sex as dangerous, and high‚Äêsex‚Äêguilt females > regarded virginity as important. It was concluded that structured sex > education and values clarification are needed to complement and amend > traditional socialization into hetero‚Äêsexuality.\\" >  Effects of sexual guilt  Individuals who experience sexual guilt can experience a range of effects that can have a severe and highly detrimental influence upon their wellbeing and the health and wellbeing of partners and close relationships. These can be seen as Psychological or mentally impacting or have physical manifestations and effects. = Psychological effects = Individuals who experience sexual guilt or who have experienced sexual guilt previously can be affected mentally by the challenges which this attitude can lead to. Possessing sexual guilt can lead individuals who are sexually active to be hyper aware or critical of their sexual performance which could lead to sexual dysfunction, depression, performance anxiety, and other illnesses. These mental effects can have compounding physical and behavioral impacts such as a fear of sex or loss of sexual desire in which the individual may abstain from sex completely. Individuals who feel a shame towards sexual acts can also be sexually inactive. Sexually inactive individuals can also feel a reluctance, disinterest or anxiety towards sexual acts due to the pressures from religion, media and people around them which can depict sex as a pursuit of the animalistic urges from the id. \\"People can also feel sexual guilt about the nature of the erotic fantasies\\"/sexual fantasies. Individuals who have symptoms may require professional psychological advice in order to work through the effects of sexual guilt. = Physical effects = Sexual guilt may leave the affected individual in a state of crippling anxiety in which they do not want to seek help or practice safe sexual practices. Freud linked the feeling of guilt, and its related emotion of anxiety. People who are less informed or practiced about safe sex practices are more likely to transfer sexually transmitted diseases, be involved in an unwanted pregnancy. Someone suffering from sexual guilt is less likely to seek medical assistance due to a feeling of shame or anxiety, this can then lead to more severe symptoms or infection.

The gang consists of Balerzo and his six accomplices, who started exporting cocaine illegally in 1946. Balerzo lived in New York, expanding his smuggling business and owned a mansion on Long Island. Barrio King, led by Gerson G√°lvez Calle, is based in Callaro and is known as Peru's largest drug ring. The criminal organisation had control over shipping centers to facilitate drug trafficking and was responsible for the many deaths in Peru. Abimael Guzma√°n, former leader of Shining Path  Prominent Individuals  * Abimael Guzm√°n is the former leader of Shining Path, partaking in activities against the Peruvian government. * David Bazan Arevalo was the mayor of Tocache, Peru. He was investigated as a member of a drug trafficking operation, organising the production and trading of narco-trafficking. * Andr√©s A. Sober√≥n was the boss of Huanauco's cocaine industry. Sober√≥n led cocaine makers during anti-cocaine law in 1947, and sent operatives and chemists into Bolivia. * Gerson G√°lvez Calle, also known as Caracol or Snail, led the drug trafficking organisation group called Barrio King. He was also called the new Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n by the Peruvian media for being capable of competing against Mexico drug trafficking organisations. Calle was released 12 years into a 15-year prison sentence, and has been a wanted man for murder, robbery, and drug trafficking.  Activities  = Drug Trafficking =  Cocaine  Coca is an easy and profitable crop that farmers can grow with limited amounts of land. Cocaine started in eastern Peru in 1948 to 1949, and has been rapidly expanding domestic cocaine production, making it the world's second largest cocaine producer, after Colombia. Cocaine began as a major product for the Americans at the beginning of the Cold War, and the production of cocaine from Peru emerged during anti-communist regimes. Throughout the late 1940s, the cocaine industry was legal with minimal production from run down factories, however, by 1950, cocaine was being smuggled out of eastern Peru, and cities in Peru such as Uchiza District, Tingo Mar√≠a and Pucallpa. In 1949, Time nicknamed cocaine as \\"Peru's White Goddess.\\" Initially, coca was not the main problem for Peru; however, advancements in technology and science turned it into a drug, by processing coca into cocaine for various purposes, such as medicine or wine. During the mid-1950s, cocaine export was pushed to La Paz, Bolivia. By the 1970s, the lack of supervision over cocaine trade enabled the growth of criminal networks centered on its trafficking. With little police presence, Santa Rosa became an ideal route through which to smuggle cocaine to Brazil or Colombia. Weak state influence further allowed cocaine establishments to build coca fields, pits and labs. Most cocaine labs were situated in the jungle between the Putumayo and the River Amazon, and Caballococha became a gathering location for drug traffickers and producers.  Norco/Narco Trafficking  In 1986, the term \\"narco terrorism\\" was used in Peru as the relationship between drug traffickers and revolutionists. Peru is becoming a narco-trader for four continents. David Bazan Arevalo was investigated as an alleged member of a drug trafficking organisation. He has been indicted for being a member of a criminal organisation that trafficked drugs from coca-producing valley of Alto Huallaga to Colombia during the 1980s and 1990s. Along with his cousin Miguel Arevalo Ramirez, they transported 600 kilograms of cocaine paste each week from Colombia between 1987 and 1992. = Violence =  Sexual assault  Peru is one of the many countries that followed the Marry-your-rapist law, which refers to as the exemption from punishment for a rapist by marrying their victims. The case of Peruvian ex-soldiers 'systematically' raping nine female farmers between 1984 and 1995 during the Shining Path guerrilla war was presented to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2003, and the gang rape led to five of the women being pregnant.  Terrorism  The absence of government authority meant that the officials were underestimating Sendero Luminoso. Sendero Luminoso members communicate to the public through violent acts, such as going after essential power plants including water supplies or power grids. Rather than gaining support from the general public, destroying supply systems acts as no more than messages and symbols. The organisation was also initially involved in education at a university, in the training school department. In 1975, Sendero Luminoso appealed to double the school budget but the request was denied. As a result of their request being denied, Sendero Luminoso turned towards vandalism. In 1980, Sendero Luminoso declared war against the Peruvian government by burning ballot boxes that was going to be used in the first democratic election in Peru. The Shining Path operating in the Huallaga River region since the 1980s was financed and supplied weapons by David Bazan Arevalo. The criminal organisation took 71 hostages and attacked oil installations in Peru, as well as ambushing a police patrol and killing eight officials. Arevalo was part of a 2007 terrorist attack that resulted in the murder of a public prosecutor and three police officers in Tocache, which is known as one of the most crime-plagued regions of Peru. = Conservation criminology =  Wildlife markets  The species diversity covers twenty times more land area, home to at least three endemic bird species and primate species in Andean forests. Wild animals in Peru are used for various reasons, including biomedical research, jewellery, and souvenirs. Pets are also products for sale involving live species such as parrots, monkeys, and tortoises found in Peru traded to Amazonas. The wild parrot trade in Peru, such as the Macaw, is localised in inter cities or cross-border trading between two countries. Parrots are poached because they are easy to capture and are abundant. Abundant populations of bears and monkeys in Peru are also poached for biomedical research; around 4,000 primates were trafficked for malaria research into Colombia. The Ministry of Production, which is responsible for protecting endangered species have been caught illegally facilitating shark fin trade. Peru has become the third largest exporter of shark fin in the world, where the majority of shark fins are trafficked to China, as there is a high demand for shark fins in Asian markets.  Deforestation  Birds, amphibians, and ferns are examples of the biodiversity in eastern Peru which help constitute floristic assemblage. Cocaine cultivation attributes to the deforestation, mainly in the Huallaga Valley, and therefore, large groups of plant species are threatened by deforestation, and remaining forests are likely to lose species diversity. Peru has one of the highest export of Swietenia macrophylla, driven by international demand. Lists of trees that do not actually need to be cut down or do not exist are given to authorities provided by criminal organisations, resulting in illegal loggers a permit by the authorities. Peruvian timber is exported to many countries, with the majority to countries such as China, the United States, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rice, and involves tax evasion. The main port for timber exports in Peru is Callao. The Organismo de Supervision de los Recursos Forestales y de Fauna Silvestre was established as an anti-corruption organisation to prevent illegal deforestation activities in Peru, however, that has not stopped the act of illegal logging. According to the Center for International Environmental Law, more than 90 percent of timber sold in Peru was illegally obtained.  Efforts to Reduce Organized Crimes  = Political decentralization = Armed forces and police in Peru cooperated together in capturing any Sendero Luminoso members and punished the captured criminal organisation followers with violence such as torture, execution or interrogations involving abuse. Through interrogations, the police were able to investigate Sendero Luminoso better. In 2001, the La Comisi√≥n de la Verdad y Reconciliaci√≥n (CVR) was established to conduct analysis and studies of human violations by investigating assassinations, sexual violence, and torture of Peruvian civilians. The project was able to collect more than 16,000 testimonies from victims and witnesses, and aired on radios and national television as an act to raise awareness about violence and human rights. The Peruvian government expanded their focus in Mantaro river in 2012, as the valley is known to be a trafficking route for cocaine and other drugs, to investigate the Shining plans to extend their control over narco-trafficking routes in La Convenci√≥n. In February 2012, the Peruvian government captured Artemio, the leader of a faction in Sendero Luminoso in the Upper Huallaga Valley, which led to the dismantling of the military and weaponry in Sendero Luminoso. The increase of drug usage in United States and Western Europe led to more drug production for Peruvian farmers selling at a higher price in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the U.S drug policy towards Peru was used as a plan to prevent cocaine production for their people, which brought devastating results to the economy in Peru. Under the pressure of the U.S drug policy, the Peruvian government proceeded towards the removal of cocaine production and focused on substituting the drug with other crops. As drug production in Peru decreased, Peruvian farmers lost their jobs. On July 26, 2017, David Baz√°n Ar√©valo was arrested by Peru's counter-narcotics police. Lima office of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Peruvian Counternarcotics Directorate (Dirreci√≥n Nacional Antidrogas- DIRANDRO) arrested David Bazan Arevalo, targeting drug traffickers who financed narco-terrorist groups. The cocaine boom in the late 1990s came to an end when the Peruvian Air Force and DEA carried out tighter protection networks. Balarezo was arrested in 1949 while he was on a boat to Italy, and took less than a month to receive a five- year sentence and $10,000 fine. 13 kilos of pure cocaine smuggled by Balarezo was found in New York, with $154,000 worth per kilo. = Social initiatives = Artemio was arrested to counter terrorism, which enabled the state security forces to enter regions to take action against terrorism. From 2005 to 2011, the Control y Reducci√≥n del Cultivo de la Coca en el Alto Huallaga was engaged in regional coca eradication campaigns. Armed civilians in Peru organise their own protection and security, such as the Comit√©s de Autodefensa (CADS), which coordinated the community for self-defence. Community conservation of ecosystems and species by local people manage and enforce their own regulations, however, socio-political problems sometimes hinder creation of reserves for private land protection. Full cooperation from the majority of the community conservation is needed to from community leaders, which is two-thirds of the whole congregation. A two-year ban was promoted to restrict hunting of rodents such as the Agouti, and the use of slingshots toys by children was banned to recover bird and arboreal mammal populations. Local Peruvians in communal organisations have provided environmental education and have controlled and reduced land invasion, from threats of climate change and to promote a harmonious relationship with nature. Loggers in Peru are required legitimate permit by the Organismo de Supervision de los Recursos Forestales y de Fauna Silvestre organisation if they wish to declare timber locations to cut down trees; however, the process is sometimes corrupt, involving compensation, and bribery.

Development The fantasy game was created by Glenn Holliday and Chris Peterson and launched in 1982. It was an open- ended game that, in 1984, was human moderated with computer assistance. Gameplay Realms of Sword and Thunder was a play-by-mail game that was both computer- and human-moderated by Empire Games of Denver, Colorado, combining both roleplaying and tactical economics. The game's setting is 5th century England. Through the game, players encounter \\"all the myths and legends of antiquity\\" including unicorns, dragons, centaurs, and sorcerers. The player first choses one of eleven races for their home community, and then one of seven professions for their leader (berserker, knight, druid, priest, sorcerer, witch doctor, or thief). The game was two-pronged: the leader wandered the countryside, exploring new lands and experiencing adventures, while the player tried to increase the prosperity of the home community by teaching the townspeople new crafts and skills such as making armor, weapons and boats. Once the townspeople had mastered a new skill, the new product was then available for use and trade. Reception In the April 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 72), Michael Gray described his experience as a leader who was a witch doctor, and called the PBM game \\"intriguing\\". He concluded \\"I feel like I have gotten my money's worth so far.\\" Mike Scheid reviewed the game in the Nov/Dec 1984 issue of Paper Mayhem. He included as positives the \\"wide open\\" style of play that allowed great freedom of action, a useful newsletter, and a modified \\"Excalibur\\" contest. A negative was the relatively high cost. Scheid concluded that \\"the good far outweighed the bad\\" in this game, noting it was nearly as good as \\"the best role-playing campaigns\\" he had seen, and better than many. Jim Gould reviewed Realms of Sword and Thunder in The Space Gamer No. 73.

Background  An agreement between petitioners, American Express and a subsidiary, and respondents, merchants who accept American Express cards, require[d] all of their disputes to be resolved by arbitration and provide[d] that there ‚Äúshall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.‚Äù Respondents nonetheless filed a class action, claiming that petitioners violated ¬ß1 of the Sherman Act and seeking treble damages for the class under ¬ß4 of the Clayton Act. Petitioners moved to compel individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), but respondents countered that the cost of expert analysis necessary to prove the antitrust claims would greatly exceed the maximum recovery for an individual plaintiff. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that because of the prohibitive costs respondents would face if they had to arbitrate, the class-action waiver was unenforceable and arbitration could not proceed. The Circuit stood by its reversal when this Court remanded in light of Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to class arbitration absent an agreement to do so..  Issue  Is American Express Company's arbitration clause prohibiting class action suits enforceable, even though it would compel arbitration of antitrust claims?  Holding  The prohibitively high cost of arbitration is not a sufficient reason for a court to overrule an arbitration clause that forbids class action suits. Federal law does not guarantee that a claim will be resolved affordably. The fact that it can be more expensive to litigate individual arbitrations than they are worth does not negate the right to pursue a statutory remedy. Therefore, no exception to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) can be applied.  Dissent  Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer joined, wrote in her dissent that: The purpose of the FAA is to resolve disputes and facilitate compensation of injuries. By barring any means of sharing or shrinking arbitration costs, the arbitration clause in the American Express form contract functions to confer immunity from potentially meritorious federal claims, which runs counter to the purpose of the FAA (‚ÄúNo rational actor would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands‚Äù). The contract also violates the Sherman Act by depriving parties of a chance to challenge allegedly monopolistic conduct.  Significance  This case, combined with AT&T; Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,. has led to a fear that businesses will adopt arbitration en masse, which will effectively prohibit effective antitrust enforcement.. A 2019 Harvard Law Review stated that: \\"The Court‚Äôs [Italian Colors] decision makes it likely that many federal statutes will no longer be enforced privately in certain contexts, further weakening a judicially created principle that was already difficult to apply. Thus, it is now up to Congress to determine whether, and in what contexts, it favors contractual freedom in arbitration agreements over private enforcement of federal statutes.\\"  References  External links * 2013 in United States case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Am.

She lives and works in Macei√≥ the capital of Alagoas in Brazil. The style of her work was performance and sculpture art. She also explored her body with her performances. Her art emerged at the end of a military dictatorship that lasted from 1964‚Äì1985. She used their experiences during the dictatorship in her artwork to show how they felt trapped. Using textiles Ara√∫jo demonstrates the limit of the body through the play between repression and freedom. However, sculptures and performances were not her only interest she has also explored photography and video.  Education  Martha Ara√∫jo studied education at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and graduated in the year of 1970. She earned a degree in pedagogy at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. She earned her master's degree in education from Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio de Janeiro. She was able to work under Haroldo Barroso, a sculptor, at the Museu do Ing√° in Niter√≥i throughout 1984 and 1987. In 1986 she went on to study at the Escola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage in Rio de Janeiro.  Artwork  =H√°bito/Habitante, 1985= Ara√∫jo had two solo exhibitions where her performance of H√°bito/Habitante was performed by participants. Ara√∫jo had a series of photographs that made up H√°bito/Habitante. The performers used textile (cloth) in the shape of a half- moon stuck to a wall, another large cloth that two or more people can participate as a whole and the participants in capacete (helmet). The performers are inside a piece of cloth and are move around to free themselves from repression. They try to separate from each other, so they need to work together as a whole to be able to escape. Capacete is a performance from the H√°bito/Habitante series. In the Capacete performance the performers have helmets made out of cloth that are tied together. =Quardo Dobr√°vel Espa√ßo Real,1985= Quardo Dobr√°vel Espa√ßo Real, are metal plates stitched together that can be manipulated by the movement of the performer. It takes the shape of the performer when it is moving. This sculpture can be seen as plastic art because it can create a new shape. =Para um corpo nas suas impossibilidades, 1985= In this art piece she uses a ramp, a body suit with Velcro, and herself to stick herself or others to show how they feel free. They jump onto the ramp and are stuck there experiencing repression and freedom because once a person is stuck it is hard to detach themselves until they fight for freedom.

She was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and received a MoD degree in geology from Trinity College Dublin. As a child she remembers ‚Äúalways loving rocks‚Äù and when she learned geology was a profession she recalls thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do that‚Äù. She studied Natural Sciences and graduated in 1976, at a time when, as she points out, ‚Äúgeology was really evolving. Morrice has two daughters, Hannah and Clare. Susan Morrice was based in Denver. In the words of Susan Morrice, \\"My attraction to geology was nature. As a young girl in Ireland, dashing about the rocks, playing in the waves... I was just fascinated.\\"  Career  After graduating from Trinity College, Morrice began working for American-Canadian Stratigraphic where she was given the opportunity to travel the world surveying and networking with other geologists in the industry. When talking about this time of her life, she recalls how ‚Äúthe concept of plate tectonics was just taking hold, [geology] is a science where you can keep asking questions, and I loved being a part of the process‚Äù. She joined Knight Royalty as a frontier specialist. This job included mapping and more community-based interactions. In the early 1990s, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) asked her and Roger Slatt to head the international convention of the AAPG. This led to the birth of the International Pavilion which gives a platform for oil companies to access new contracts in different countries. She founded Belize Natural Energy (BNE) with Mike Usher and located their first oil well in a sandstone reservoir. She is currently the chairwoman of BNE.  Belize Natural Energy (BNE)  As a young geologist, Morrice was invited to go to Belize to look into the oil potential. Although she was seeking for new job opportunities, she enjoyed working with everyone in Belize and knew there was a good chance in finding oil in Belize. She and a Belizean man, Mike Usher, explored for many years shooting seismic and by drilling but were unsuccessful. Morrice spent four years researching and found a university seminar that she felt could help her learn more. She attended a 12-day Educo seminar in 2002. Immediately after that, she went to Belize to set up BNE. Soon after trying to start this in Belize, she realized that it was a difficult sell as there were 50 dry holes. Together, Usher and Morrice went to Ireland to talk to others who took the Educo course and were willing to help in Belize. After receiving funding, for the drilling, from Irish investors, Usher abruptly became ill and passed away in June of 2004. They only had enough income for two wells, and in 2005 the first well was a success and was named it \\"Mike Usher #1\\". After the success of the first well, they drilled five more wells which were all successful and carried on to build BNE. Since starting the company, BNE has drilled more than 62 wells, producing over 10 million barrels of oil.  Awards and Achievements  Susan Morrice was the first woman to ever receive the Norman Foster Outstanding Explorer award by the AAPG. * Susan Morrice and BNE won the GetEnergy award, beating 43 other countries. * Susan Morrice was awarded the AAPG Presidential Award for Exemplary service in recognition of her work in geoscience. * Susan Morrice received the 2018 Outstanding explorer award.

Early life  Florence O'Denishawn, from a 1918 publication. Florence Andrews was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the daughter of a banker. She studied dance with Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis in their \\"Denishawn\\" school in California. When she became a professional dancer, she wanted to be billed as \\"Florence of Denishawn\\", but the name became \\"Florence O'Denishawn\\" in a printing error, and she continued working under that version.  Career  O'Denishawn's stage credits included Hitchy- Koo (1918-1920), Ziegfeld Follies of 1921, Rose Briar (1922), Music Box Revue (1923), and Honeymoon Lane (1926). Of her appearance in Music Box Revue, critic George Jean Nathan noted that her \\"umbilical revelations are so familiar by this time that one wishes she would put on a dress.\\" She was cast in two silent films, Lawful Larceny (1923) and Monsieur Beaucaire (1924), in the latter dancing with Rudolph Valentino. In 1925, she headlined a vaudeville shows in New York and Baltimore, with dancers Nelson Snow and Charles Columbus. She toured with Snow and Columbus in 1927 and 1930 O'Denishawn posed for photographer NIckolas Muray, and for sculptor Harriet Whitney Frishmuth. She posed for two bronze statues by Frishmuth, named \\"Papillon\\" and \\"Scherzo\\", which were commissioned by Wilbur Foshay for Foshay Tower. O'Denishawn gave a celebrity endorsement to a brand of footcare plasters. In 1926, she performed at a benefit show for the Episcopal Actors' Guild. In 1927 she performed in another benefit show, dancing at a midnight cabaret to raise funds for the Association for the Aid of Crippled Children. She danced for a cause again in 1930, at a variety show to benefit the Bide-A-Wee Home for Animals. O'Denishawn embarked upon the study of aviation in 1927, saying \\"there is nothing that can beat an aeroplane for grace.\\" From the late 1930s into the 1950s, O'Denishawn worked in shops, running her own store in Greenwich Village, and as head of the lingerie department at Porter's department store on Madison Avenue.  Opinions  O'Denishawn spoke about \\"prudery\\" and artistic expression, saying \\"There is no mental health in a nation that is afraid to trust itself in the presence of the nude.\\" In 1928, O'Denishawn decried popular dances like the Charleston or the Black Bottom with blatant racism, saying \\"Dances that are admittedly of a barbaric origin ‚Äî the shimmy, Charleston, and others ‚Äî are proving an insidious evil in the way of depriving our American women of their natural grace and movement,\\" further explaining that \\"Negro anatomy is not the same as ours. The pose of the knees, the modelling of the hips, the line of the feet makes those dances right for the Negro\\" but not for white dancers.

The theorem is named after √âlie Cartan, Warren Ambrose, and his PhD student Noel Hicks.Mathematics Genealogy Project, entry for Noel Justin Hicks Cartan proved the local version. Ambrose proved a global version that allows for isometries between general Riemannian manifolds with varying curvature, in 1956. This was further generalized by Hicks to general manifolds with affine connections in their tangent bundles, in 1959. A statement and proof of the theorem can be found in  Introduction  Let M,N be connected, complete Riemannian manifolds. Let x\\\\in M,y\\\\in N, and let : I:T_xM\\\\rightarrow T_yN be a linear isometry. For sufficiently small r>0, the exponential maps : \\\\exp_x:B_r(x)\\\\subset T_xM\\\\rightarrow M, \\\\exp_y:B_r(y)\\\\subset T_yN\\\\rightarrow N are local diffeomorphisms. One then defines a diffeomorphism f:B_r(x)\\\\rightarrow B_r(y) by : f=\\\\exp_y\\\\circ I\\\\circ \\\\exp_x^{-1}. For a geodesic \\\\gamma:\\\\left[0,T\\\\right]\\\\rightarrow B_r(x)\\\\subset M with \\\\gamma(0)=x, f maps it to a geodesic f(\\\\gamma):\\\\left[0,T\\\\right]\\\\rightarrow B_r(y)\\\\subset N with f(\\\\gamma)(0)=y,. Let P_\\\\gamma(t)be the parallel transport along \\\\gamma (defined by the Levi-Civita connection), and P_{f(\\\\gamma)(t)} be the parallel transport along f(\\\\gamma). We then define : I_\\\\gamma(t)=P_{f(\\\\gamma)(t)}\\\\circ I\\\\circ P_{\\\\gamma(t)}^{-1}:T_{\\\\gamma(t)}M\\\\rightarrow T_{f(\\\\gamma(t))}N for t\\\\in\\\\left[0,T\\\\right].  Cartan's theorem  The original theorem proven by Cartan is the local version of the Cartan‚ÄìAmbrose‚ÄìHicks theorem. It states that f is a (local) isometry if for all geodesics \\\\gamma:\\\\left[0,T\\\\right]\\\\rightarrow B_r(x)\\\\subset M with \\\\gamma(0)=x and all t\\\\in [0, T], X,Y,Z\\\\in T_{\\\\gamma(t)}M, we have I_{\\\\gamma}(t)(R(X,Y,Z))=\\\\overline{R}(I_{\\\\gamma}(t)(X), I_\\\\gamma(t)(Y), I_{\\\\gamma}(t)(Z)), where R,\\\\overline{R} are Riemann curvature tensors of M,N. Note that f generally does not have to be a diffeomorphism, but only a locally isometric covering map. However, f must be a global isometry if N is simply connected.  Cartan‚ÄìAmbrose‚ÄìHicks theorem  Theorem: For Riemann curvature tensors R,\\\\overline{R} and all broken geodesics (a broken geodesic is a curve that is piecewise geodesic) \\\\gamma:\\\\left[0,T\\\\right]\\\\rightarrow M with \\\\gamma(0)=x, : I_\\\\gamma(t)(R(X,Y,Z))=\\\\overline{R}(I_\\\\gamma(t)(X), I_\\\\gamma(t)(Y), I_\\\\gamma(t)(Z)) for all t\\\\in [0, T], X,Y,Z\\\\in T_{\\\\gamma(t)}M. Then, if two broken geodesics beginning in xhave the same endpoint, then the corresponding broken geodesics (mapped by I_\\\\gamma) in N also have the same end point. So there exists a map : F:M\\\\rightarrow N by mapping the broken geodesic endpoints in Mto the corresponding geodesic endpoints in N. The map F:M\\\\rightarrow N is a locally isometric covering map. If N is also simply connected, then F is an isometry.  Locally symmetric spaces  A Riemannian manifold is called locally symmetric if its Riemann curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport: : abla R=0. A simply connected Riemannian manifold is locally symmetric if it is a symmetric space. From the Cartan‚ÄìAmbrose‚ÄìHicks theorem, we have: Theorem: Let M,N be connected, complete, locally symmetric Riemannian manifolds, and let M be simply connected. Let their Riemann curvature tensors be R,\\\\overline{R}. Let x\\\\in M,y\\\\in N and : I:T_xM\\\\rightarrow T_yN be a linear isometry with I(R(X,Y,Z))=\\\\overline{R}(I(X),I(Y),I(Z)). Then there exists a locally isometric covering map : F:M\\\\rightarrow N with F(x)=y and D_xF=I. Corollary: Any complete locally symmetric space is of the form M/\\\\gamma for a symmetric space Mand \\\\gamma\\\\subset Isom(M) is a discrete subgroup of isometries of M.  Classification of space forms As an application of the Cartan‚ÄìAmbrose‚ÄìHicks theorem, any simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature \\\\in\\\\\\\\{+1, 0, -1\\\\\\\\} is respectively isometric to the n-sphere S^n, the n-Euclidean space E^n, and the n-hyperbolic space \\\\mathbb H^n.

He was chosen by the 64-member Republican State Executive Committee meeting in Austin on June 3, 2017. He was defeated in his re-election attempt by Allen West on July 20, 2020. Early life and education Dickey moved to Texas with his family when he was in elementary school and attended Polytechnic High School in Fort Worth where he graduated valedictorian of his class. Dickey then attended Stanford University, where he received bachelor's degrees in political science and English and later Baylor University, where he received an Master of Business Administration. Dickey is a shareholder and board member of iManaging General Agency Holdings, LLC, the holding company of an insurance firm, iMGA, LLC. He has previously worked in the insurance industry for Kemper Insurance, Great American Insurance, and Republic Group. Career =Travis County Republican Party= On March 4, 2014, Dickey was elected Travis County Republican Party chairman, in an uncontested Republican primary. He succeeded Rosemary Edwards, who served in that position from 2008 until Dickey's election. Dickey choose to run for reelection as Travis County chair in 2016, but he was defeated in the March 1, 2016 election, 26,619 to 20,543 (56.4% to 43.6%) by Robert Morrow. Travis County Republican Party leaders immediately wanted to remove Morrow because he would wear a court jester's hat to county party meetings, speculated on famous assassinations and conspiracy theories, promoted his book on the Clintons he co-authored with Roger Stone, and turned over all operations of the county to his vice-chairman. The defeat to Morrow lead to Dickey temporarily losing the Travis County chairmanship from March 1 to September 20, 2016. Dickey was re-elected as the Travis County chair after Morrow was disqualified and forced out of office after Morrow announced a write-in candidacy for U.S. President against Donald Trump. After Morrow's disqualification and forced removal, Dickey defeated, 62‚Äì26, the political consultant Brendan Steinhauser of Austin, who managed the successful John Cornyn Senate re-election campaign in 2014. Steinhauser said he could not say he would vote for Trump. Dickey made it clear that Trump was not his original choice but he would vote for him. =Texas Republican Party= On May 20, 2017, Tom Mechler of Amarillo, Texas resigned as state party chairman. Mechler cited time constraints and business and family matters for the resignation. Having worked in 2016 to unify the Donald Trump and Ted Cruz factions in the Texas GOP, Mechler called for party unity and outreach in his departing statement. While still holding the position of Travis County chair, Dickey decided to run for state party chair in the spring of 2017. Candidates who ran against Dickey for the position of state party chairman were Richard Scott \\"Rick\\" Figueroa of Brenham, Texas and Mark Ramsey, a state committee member from Spring in Harris County. Figueroa was Mechler's choice for party chair. On June 3, 2017, the 62-member State Republican Executive Committee and the vice chair narrowly chose Dickey to succeed Mechler as state chair. Dickey polled 32 votes to 31 for Rick Figueroa, a wealth management executive in Houston. Matt Mackowiak of Austin was elected to replace Dickey as Travis County Republican Party chairman and finish one year of Dickey's unexpired term. Dickey chose to run for reelection in 2018 as Texas state party chair. He faced Cindy Asche, a precinct chair in Collin County, Texas, north of Dallas. Asche loaned herself almost $200,000 to finance her campaign. On June 15, 2018, at the Texas Republican convention in San Antonio, Dickey received 22 votes to Asche's 9 votes among the 31 Texas Senate districts. Asche of Frisco, Texas, a nurse and the chaplain for the Texas Federation of Republican Women, demanded that all of the delegates to the state convention vote on the state party chairman contest. Dickey won the vote of the full convention with 5,680 votes to Asche's 3,009 votes, 65.4% to 34.6%. Asche ran a negative campaign focusing on the complaints of former state party employees and a 2004 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against Dickey as a result of his past partnership at a hedge fund that lost $20 million in 2001 for the Art Institute of Chicago. The SEC charged Dickey with violating securities registration provisions, antifraud provisions, and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws. Dickey paid a fine to the SEC without admitting guilt.SEC v. Conrad P. Seghers and James R. Dickey, Civil Action No. 3:04 CV 1320-K (N.D. Tex.), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, September 25, 2006. The SEC charged Dickey with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. In July 2019, Dickey announced he would be running for reelection at the July 2020 state convention in Houston. He was challenged by former Congressman Allen West.WBAP Morning News ‚Äì Retired Colonel Allen West Says He Is Looking to Run for GOP Chair, WBAP 820 AM, Dallas, Texas, July 8, 2019. After President Donald Trump proposed to move the 2020 Republican National Convention from North Carolina amid Coronavirus restrictions, Dickey volunteered Texas as a potential venue, saying, \\"Texans know how to and can safely have a big event like that as we reopen Texas.\\" Dickey later mentioned Fort Worth, San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston as possible locations if the convention were hosted in Texas. National Republicans decided to move the national convention to Jacksonville, Florida, instead of Texas. On July 9, 2020, the Texas Republican Party, with support of Dickey and the SREC, a 64-member body that serves as the governing board to the state party, sued Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, the City of Houston, and Houston First corporation. The lawsuit seeks to allow the state party to hold their state convention at the George R. Brown convention center, demanding specific performance of the lease between the state party and the Houston First, the management team of the Brown convention center.Pollock, Cassandra.

She received her B.S. in chemistry from Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1995. She completed her Ph.D. with David G. Lynn at the University of Chicago in 2000, and conducted postdoctoral research with Roger Y. Tsien and Susan S. Taylor at the University of California, San Diego.  Academic career  Following her postdoc at UCSD, Zhang joined the faculty in the Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2003. At Johns Hopkins, she was a member of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. In 2013, she was promoted to full professor in the departments of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience and Department of Oncology, and Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. In 2015, Zhang relocated her lab to UCSD, where she is a professor in the departments of Pharmacology, Bioengineering, and Chemistry and Biochemistry. She is a member of the Moores Cancer Center. Zhang is also director and cofounder of the Bio-Optical Probe Advancement Center at UCSD. Zhang is an editorial board member for Cell Chemical Biology.  Research  The Zhang group is interested in developing genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based biosensors for kinases, similar to those developed for calcium imaging. Genetically encoded biosensors utilize a kinase-specific substrate fused to fluorescent proteins and a phosphoamino acid binding domain, which change FRET ratio or fluorescence intensity based on kinase activity. Zhang and her lab have used this method to study several kinases, including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and mechanistic target of rapamycin, among others. The Zhang group has also worked on super-resolution imaging techniques, including photochromic stochastic optical fluctuation imaging (pcSOFI), a variant of super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging, and fluorescence fluctuation increase by contact imaging (FLINC), which has been used to generate super-resolution kinase biosensors Zhang, along with the help from Johns Hopkins Laboratories, is also credited for the creation of a new technique referred to as CAESAR. This technique was designed to experimentally identify substrates for unique kinases. It results in high- quality KSRs.

Overview Meals in Japan traditionally begin with the word . Similar to \\"bon app√©tit\\" or saying grace, it expresses gratitude for all who played a role in providing the food and acknowledges that living organisms have given their life to human beings as DƒÅna. Upon finishing a meal, the Japanese use the polite phrase . In response, the preparer often says . Not finishing one's meal is not considered impolite in Japan, but rather is taken as a signal to the host that one does not wish to be served another helping. Conversely, finishing one's meal completely, especially the rice, indicates that one is satisfied and therefore does not wish to be served any more. Children are especially encouraged to eat every last grain of rice. (See also mottainai as Buddhist philosophy.) It is impolite to pick out certain ingredients and leave the rest. One should chew with the mouth closed. It is acceptable to lift soup and rice bowls to the mouth so one does not spill food. Miso soup is drunk directly from its (small) bowl; larger soups and those with chunky ingredients may come with a spoon. Of course hashi (\\"chopsticks\\") are always provided. Noodles from hot soup are often blown on (once lifted from the soup) to cool them before eating; and it is appropriate to slurp certain foods, especially ramen or soba noodles. However, slurping is not practiced universally, and Western-style noodles (pasta) should not be slurped. Rice is generally eaten plain or sometimes with nori (very thin sheets of dried seaweed, perhaps shredded or cut into strips) or furikake (a seasoning). More substantial additives may also be provided: a raw egg, natt≈ç (sticky fermented soy beans), a small piece of cooked fish, or tsukemono (preserved vegetables). The egg and natt≈ç are often served at breakfast; both are meant to be mixed into the rice. Less commonly, dishes feature rice with ingredients mixed in, either during the cooking (takikomi gohan, \\"cooked in rice\\") or after the rice has been cooked (maze gohan, Ê∑∑„Åú„ÅîÈ£Ø, \\"mixed rice\\").Spring maze gohan: Green pea rice, Asparagus rice, 20 Apr 2009 by maki Pouring soy sauce over white rice is not a Japanese custom, nor is it good form to pour soy sauce directly over sashimi or sushi: soy sauce is a condiment to be used with discretion, just enough to enhance, but not overwhelm, the flavor of the food to which it is added. At each diner's seat, a small dish is provided for holding the sauce and dipping in a bit of food. To pour an excessive amount of soy sauce into this dish is considered greedy and wasteful (see mottainai). Put in a little, and add more as needed. Sushi etiquette dictates that when eating nigiri-zushi, one dips the topping-side of the sushi piece into the soy sauce, thus protecting the rice from soaking up too much sauce. Leaving stray grains of rice floating in the sauce is considered uncouth, but can be hard to avoid for those who have difficulty manipulating chopsticks. It is also uncouth to mix wasabi (green horseradish) into the soy sauce dish. Instead, put a dab of wasabi on the sushi piece after it has been dipped. In sushi-only restaurants, it is perfectly acceptable to use fingers instead of chopsticks to eat the nigiri-zushi. It is uncommon for Japanese people to eat or drink while walking in public, and this is just one point of etiquette where it is wise to err on the side of conservatism. Drink vending machines in Japan generally have a recycling bin for used bottles and cans, so one can consume the drink there; and in summer months one may see groups drinking near a vending machine. Some consider it rude to eat in public, but this is not a universally held aversion. Many Japanese restaurants provide diners with single-use wooden/bamboo chopsticks that must be snapped apart near their tops (which are thicker than the bottoms). As a result, the attachment area may produce small splinters. Never rub chopsticks against each other to remove splinters: this is considered extremely rude, implying that one thinks the utensils are cheap. At the beginning of the meal, use the smooth bottom ends to pick up food from serving dishes if no other utensils have been provided for that purpose. Then eat, holding food between the bottoms of the hashi. If you later want to use your hashi to take more food from serving dishes, use the top ends to do so in order to avoid 'contaminating' the food on the tray. At the end of the meal, it is good manners to return single-use chopsticks part way into their original paper wrapper; this covers the soiled sticks while indicating that the package has been used. In Japanese restaurants, customers are given a rolled hand towel called oshibori. It is considered rude to use the towel to wipe the face or neck; however, some people, usually men, do this at more informal restaurants. Nonwoven towelettes are replacing the cloth oshibori. In any situation, an uncertain diner can observe what others are doing; and for non-Japanese people to ask how to do something properly is generally received with appreciation for the acknowledgment of cultural differences and expression of interest in learning Japanese ways. When using toothpicks, it is good etiquette to cover one's mouth with the other hand. Blowing one's nose in public is considered rude, especially at a restaurant; cloth handkerchiefs should never be used for this purpose. Conversely, sniffling is considered acceptable, as an alternative to nose-blowing. When sneezing, it is polite to cover one's nose with a hand. =Tables and sitting= Many restaurants and homes in Japan are equipped with Western-style chairs and tables. However, traditional Japanese low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, are also very common. Tatami mats, which are made of straw, can be easily damaged and are hard to clean, thus shoes or any type of footwear are always taken off when stepping on tatami floors. When dining in a traditional tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels on the floor with legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels. When dining out in a restaurant, the customers are guided to their seats by the host. The honored or eldest guest will usually be seated at the center of the table farthest from the entrance. In the home, the most important guest is also seated farthest away from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma, or alcove, in the room, the guest is seated in front of it. The host sits next to or closest to the entrance. =Itadakimasu and Gochis≈çsama= In Japan, it is customary to say itadakimasu (\\"I [humbly] receive\\") before starting to eat a meal. When saying itadakimasu, both hands are put together in front of the chest or on the lap. Itadakimasu is preceded by complimenting the appearance of food. The Japanese attach as much importance to the aesthetic arrangement of the food as its actual taste. Before touching the food, it is polite to compliment the host on his artistry. It is also a polite custom to wait for the eldest guest at the table to start eating before the other diners start. Another customary and important etiquette is to say go-chis≈ç-sama deshita (\\"It was a feast\\") to the host after the meal and the restaurant staff when leaving. =Hot towels= Before eating, most dining places provide either a hot or cold towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for cleaning hands before eating (and not after). It is rude to use them to wash the face or any part of the body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use their o-shibori to wipe their faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori and place it on the table. It is impolite to use o-shibori towels to wipe any spills on the table. =Soy sauce= Soy sauce (sh≈çyu) is not usually poured over most foods at the table; a dipping dish is usually provided. Soy sauce is, however, meant to be poured directly onto t≈çfu and grated daikon dishes, and in the raw egg when preparing tamago kake gohan (\\"egg on rice\\"). =Chopsticks and bowls= alt= The proper usage of chopsticks (hashi) is the most important table etiquette in Japan. There are many traditions and perceptions surrounding the use of . Chopsticks are never left sticking vertically into rice, as this behaviour, which is called Tate-bashi („Åü„Å¶ÁÆ∏; „Åü„Å¶„Å∞„Åó), resembles incense sticks (which are usually placed vertically in sand during offerings to the dead). This may easily offend some Japanese people. Using chopsticks to spear food is also frowned upon and it is considered very bad manners to bite chopsticks. Other important perceptions to remember include the following: * Hold chopsticks towards their end, and not in the middle or the front third. * Chopsticks not in use should be laid down in front of the meal with the tip to the left. This is also the correct position in which to place chopsticks after the meal's conclusion. * Do not pass food with chopsticks directly to somebody else's chopsticks. This technique, which is called Hiroi-bashi (Êãæ„ÅÑÁÆ∏; „Å≤„Çç„ÅÑ„Å∞„Åó), is only used at funerals, where the bones of the cremated body of the dead person are passed from person to person in this manner. When passing food to someone else during a meal (a questionable practice in public), one should pick up the food with one's own chopsticks, reversing the chopsticks to use the end which were not in direct contact with the handlers mouth, and place it on a small plate, allowing the recipient to retrieve it (with the recipient's own chopsticks). If no other utensils are available while sharing plates of food, the ends of the chopsticks are used to retrieve the shared food. Mismatched chopsticks are not to be used. * Do not move chopsticks around in the air too much and play with them. * Do not move around plates or bowls with chopsticks. * Do not hover or wave chopsticks over the dishes set on a table (which often is done by mistake to choose which food to eat first). This behaviour, in Japanese called Mayoi-bashi (Ëø∑„ÅÑÁÆ∏; „Åæ„Çà„ÅÑ„Å∞„Åó), is perceived as inappropriate, as this portrays the personality of impatience and greedy in the context of Japanese dining etiquette. To avoid, it is important to decide which food to eat before using chopsticks to move the food onto a plate. * To separate a piece of food into two pieces, exert controlled pressure on the chopsticks while moving them apart from each other. * Do not place chopsticks so that they point at someone else. This is perceived as a symbolic threat. * To make sure that any sauce or liquid attached to the food does not drip from the food or chopsticks, food which has been dipped into a soy sauce or similar kind should not be carried with chopsticks; this taboo is called Namida-bashi (Ê∂ôÁÆ∏; „Å™„Åø„Å†„Å∞„Åó). It is considered to be immature and unclean when the sauce or liquid from the food is dripped on the table. * Put the chopsticks onto the table before talking and do not use the chopsticks to gesture or point during conversation. Chopsticks should, after being picked up with one hand, be held firm while considering three key points, that the thumb is placed just like how a pencil is held, ensure the thumb is touched with the upper part of the chopstick. Another part of the chopstick, the lower part is stood still and rest in the index finger. Make sure that arm is relaxed so it forms a gentle curve. The traditional perception supposes a diner to hold the chopsticks (hashi) in the right hand and with the left hand pick up the bowl so that it is close to the mouth, but should not touch it by the mouth except when drinking soup. Eating with the chopsticks in the left hand or without a hand picking up the bowl (except for larger types of dishes which are normally not supposed to be picked up) is traditionally perceived as improper table manners. However, that perception has started to fade away in modern time. The Japanese customarily slurp noodle soup dishes like ramen, udon, and soba. When slurping noodles quickly, the soup supposedly clings to the noodles, making the dish more flavourful. =Communal dish= When taking food from a communal dish, unless they are family or very close friends, one should turn the chopsticks around to grab the food; it is considered more sanitary. Alternatively, one could have a separate set of chopsticks for communal dishes. =Eat what is given= It is customary to eat rice to the last grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, and it is not customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, try to move all dishes back to the same position they were at the start of the meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host. However, this can be set aside for a diner with allergies such as a peanut allergy, or a religious prohibition against certain foods like pork. =Drinking= Even in informal situations, drinking alcohol starts with a toast (kanpai, ‰πæÊùØ) when everyone is ready. Do not start drinking until everybody is served and has finished the toast. It is not customary to pour oneself a drink; rather, people are expected to keep each other's drinks topped up. When someone moves to pour one's drink, one should hold one's glass with both hands and thank the pourer.  Japanese dining etiquette  = Basic dining etiquette = If a series of small foods are served, it is important to fully finish off one dish prior to moving on to the next one. However, it is not considered to be compulsory to complete the entire dishes, especially the broth from ramen or similar kinds. Before starting to eat a meal, saying itadakimasu, a polite phrase meaning \\"I receive this food\\", is a way to show gratitude towards the person that prepared the meal. This can be done in a praying motion, which is gathering both hands together, or more simply, by bowing the head. Upon finishing the meal, gratitude is expressed again by saying gochis≈ç sama deshita, meaning \\"it was quite a feast\\". The dishes or plates should be placed back to their original position after the meal. = Distinctive characteristics = Japanese dining etiquette has distinctive characteristics in general, as follows. * Chopsticks are used in every meal. * When eating, plates are picked up and held at chest-level except when the size of a plate is too large to do so. * When drinking soup, the soup is drunk up from the bowl that is held straight, as an alternative to scooping the soup with a spoon. * Finishing what is on a plate is viewed as a polite act. * It is prohibited to rest an elbow on a table. An Oshibori or hot towel is placed above a traditional Japanese plate. = Oshibori = Oshibori, or also known as a wet towel, is a small white hand towel that had previously been soaked in clean water and wrung out to have it in a damped condition. In Japan, it is served in most of the dining places in the form that it is folded and rolled up. Either a hot or cold towel is served depending on the season. As for the dining etiquette, use the provided Oshibori to clean both hands, before starting a meal. It is only used to wipe out hands and therefore it should not be used to wipe face or used for other purposes, as it is considered impolite. = Drinking = When it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in Japan, there are several points to keep in mind. The person who first pours the alcoholic drink in the glasses of others, the person should be holding the bottle of the alcoholic drink with both hands simultaneously. The person who receives the pouring must hold the cup firmly, and politely ask whether or not the person who just served would want to have poured back after the pouring has finished. When drinking with a group, hold on from drinking until each glass is filled up. To celebrate drinking with the group, shout out the word Kanpai (lit. cheers) while raising the glass at the same time, this word is shouted with the group simultaneously. When hosts empty their glasses, others should attempt to do the same thing as well. = Common mistakes = If a Japanese food contains clams, it is common to find empty clam shells placed in different bowls after one finishes the meal. However, this is regarded as an impolite deed in Japan, the empty clam shells should be placed inside the bowl where the food was originally served. A deed of leaving chopsticks on the table after a meal occurs frequently. However, in Japan, it may signal that the meal has not been finished, and therefore it is suggested to place the chopsticks sideways across the plate or bowl when the meal is finished. Talking too much when dining is not very appropriate, and maintaining some silence while eating a meal is valued, hence avoid forcing unnecessary conversation when eating with someone.  Religion  In the 6th and 7th century of Japan, many influences arrived in Japan through Korea, which included the import of Buddhism. Across the different types of pre-existing religions such as Confucian and Shinto, Buddhism had become the main religion during the 6th century. Today, Buddhism is the firm roots of the vital dining etiquette that is universally practised in Japan.Visoƒçnik, N. (2004). Food and Identity in Japan. University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Behind the phase that is used to show a gratitude for whoever that was involved in making the meal to take place (i.e. farmers, fishermen, parents, etc), itadakimasu, the traditional Japanese Buddhist foundation is associated, the meaning of the phases is focused on the origin of the food rather than on the coming feast. The belief from Buddhism that every object has a spirit to be recognised is applied on the phrase, manifesting both gratitude and honour to pay respect to the lives used to make the food, such as cook, animals, farmers, and plants. A picture showing the Five Reflections (‰∫îË¶≥„ÅÆÂÅà) displayed on a wall at Hanazono University cafeteria. However, the way of saying itadakimasu is different at Buddhist temples in Japan. Monks and nuns in a Buddhist temple are subject to say two or more of different verses before a meal, depending on the customary practices at each temple. The Five Reflections (‰∫îË¶≥„ÅÆÂÅà) or Five Remembrances are one of the verses that are said to express gratitude towards the meal. The English translation of the Five Reflections (or \\"Gokan-no-Ge) are as follows: # Look through the food. Think about how nature and people‚Äôs hard labour have accumulated to take part in the creation of the food. # Reflect upon your behaviour towards others. Consider whether your virtue and previous actions deserve the meal in front of you. # Contemplate whether your own spirit is truthful and purified. A mind that is full of the three greatest evils (greed, anger and ignorance) will make a disturbance when trying to genuinely appreciate or savour the food. # Remind that good food is better than medicine. Consuming a good food is a way to rejuvenate tiredness, it is not a way to fulfil sensory pleasure. # Eat with gratitude while appreciating all beings, remind of the Bodhisattva vows to bring others with enlightenment.  Food and etiquette  alt= = Ramen = When eating ramen or similar types, it is acceptable to make slurping sounds as it is the way to express appreciation for the meal and to strengthen the flavour of ramen. Noodles are cooled and hence enhances the flavour during the slurping process. However, making eating sounds of munching and burping are not very favourable as it may displease people around. The general Japanese ramen etiquette postulates that ramen should be eaten by using both chopsticks and spoon. The noodles and toppings on ramen should be eaten with chopsticks while the soup should be drunk with a spoon. alt= = Sushi = Sushi is one of the most famous dishes of Japan, which comes with many different varieties, and therefore there is a certain dining etiquette to follow. It is allowed to eat sushi with bare hands, however, sashimi is eaten with chopsticks. When shoyu (lit. soy sauce) is served together with nigiri-sushi (lit. sushi with a fish topping), pick up the sushi and dip the part of the fish topping into the shoyu, not the part of rice. Having rice to absorb shoyu too much would change the original taste of the nigiri-sushi, and trying to dip rice into the shoyu may also cause the whole sushi to fall apart, consequently dropping rice on to the shoyu plate. An appearance of rice floating around on the shoyu plate is not considered as a taboo in Japanese culture; however, it may leave a bad impression by doing so. In a case when shoyu has to be poured into a bowl, pour only a tiny amount since pouring a large portion may waste an unnecessary amount of shoyu, which is one of the serious taboos in Japan. = Bent≈ç = A typical home made Bent≈ç lunch box. It usually contains rice and a variety of side dishes that go well with rice. Bent≈ç, boxed meals in Japan, are very common and constitute an important ritual during lunch. The preparation of these meals begins around the time children reach nursery school. The parents of these children take special care when preparing meals for their children. They arrange the food in the order by which it will be consumed. A bent≈ç may appear decorative, but it should be consumed in its entirety. A bent≈ç is judged by how well it is prepared. Parents are almost expected to \\"show off\\" their accomplishment in making the lunch. They are preparing for their child, but the results are observed by the other children and the nursery school, and this leads to a sort of competition between parents. Because the appearance of food is important in Japan, the parents must be sure to arrange the bent≈ç in an attractive way. A parent may prepare a leaf cut-out in fall or cut an orange into the shape of a flower if the season is summer. It is not uncommon to see seven different courses within a bent≈ç. Parents are also encouraged to prepare what the children will enjoy eating. If the child does not like what the parent has prepared, then he/she will most likely not consume it, going against the rule that ‚Äúit must be consumed in its entirety.‚Äù  See also  * Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining * Etiquette in Japan * Table manners  References   Further reading   *  External links  * Complete guide to Japanese dining etiquette * An essential guide to Japanese dining etiquette * Dining Etiquette From Around The World * Japanese food etiquette * A Guide To Dining Etiquette Around The World Etiquette by region Japanese culture Japanese cuisine Dining etiquette ","title":"Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining"},{"id":"60439613","text":"C√©cile B. Evans (born 1983) is an Belgian-American artist who lives and works in London. Evans is known for her use of video, installation, sculpture and performance, focusing on the value of emotion in contemporary society and its rebellion as it comes into contact with physical, ideological, and technological structures. Early life Evans attended New York University for acting in method acting and experimental theatre. She worked as an actress until she started making art. As an actress, Evans also worked as a makeup artist in various department stores, along with bartending, waitressing, and being a secret food critic. She moved from New York to Paris to Berlin throughout her adulthood, and has now settled in London. Career Evans has been active in many solo and group exhibitions over the years, and is well known for her pieces \\"Hyperlinks or it Didn‚Äôt Happen\\" (2014) and \\"What the Heart Wants\\" (2016). They have been shown as installations and screened. Evans' first large project, \\"Hyperlinks or it Didn‚Äôt Happen\\" has been exhibited at the Projections New York Film Festival, Seventeen Gallery, Santa Barbara Museum of Contemporary Art, Artspace, Sydney Biennale, and GARAGE Museum. \\"How Happy a Thing Can Be\\" (2014), another video made the same year, was co-commissioned by Wysing Arts Centre and RADAR/Loughborough University. It has been exhibited in Art Basel, Kunsthalle Wien, Whitney Museum, Ural Industrial Biennial, and CentroCentro (ARCO). Evans' project, \\"What the Heart Wants\\" was included in the Berlin Bienniale, Artspace, the GARAGE Museum, and Kunsthalle Winterthur. Evans' work, Amos‚Äô World (2018) has been exhibited at places such as Mumok, Tramway, Ch√¢teau Shatto, and Madre Museum. Evans has also been the recipient of a number or art awards, including the Frieze Art Fair's Emdash Award (2012), Palais de Tokyo/Orange's Push Your Art Prize (2013), Schering Stiftung (2016), illy Present Future Prize (2016), and is shortlisted for the Jarman Award (2019).  Works  * \\"What the Heart Wants\\" (2016) is video installation that looks at what it could mean to be human, and who or what will be considered human, in the future. * \\"Hyperlinks or it Didn't Happen\\" (2014) is a video about a group of digital beings that search for their meaning. *\\"How Happy a Thing Can Be\\" (2014) is a short video that follows a screwdriver, scissors and comb as their emotional limits are pushed. *\\"Sprung a Leak\\" (2016) is an automated play performed by three robots and three humans as they cope with emotionally charged information leaking from a system that surrounds them. *\\"Amos' World\\" (2018) is a mock tv series and video installation about an architect, his ‚Äúsocially progressive housing estate‚Äù, and the inhabitants who are quickly alienated by the building. Chris Sharratt writes that it \\"is not a didactic unpicking of modernist thinking and aesthetics. Instead, the exhibition acts as an allegory for a recurring concern in Evans‚Äôs work: 'how digital technology impacts the human condition.'... a tale of individual hubris brought to heel by collective resistance, of lost souls finding networked ways to turn solitary grievances into communal action.\\".  \\"What the Heart Wants\\" (2016)  ‚ÄúWhat the Heart Wants‚Äù (2016) was first exhibited in November 2016 and was also Evans first museum exhibition. It is Evans‚Äô most extensive piece to date. She examines a future timeline in which technology is the basis of society and the lines between humanity and robot have become extremely blurred, as well as how they shape each other. The main character, HYPER, narrates what it means to be a person over the course of the 41- minute film. Unlimited power has been given to a company that has control over personal information, and has taken the form of a woman (HYPER). She has become ‚Äúhuman‚Äù, and struggles with the subjective nature of the world. Evans uses topics such as stem cell research, dress codes, terrorism, systemic oppression, and other large organizational structures to discuss this idea. The film also shows both the progress and problems that have arisen in society as time has passed, and based on the choices people and organizational systems have made. The film follows other obscure characters, such as a large collection of ears, pair of lovers, an immortal cell, and a robot, as they explore what it means to be a human. Some characters from past works of Evans‚Äô appear as well (AGNES, PHIL, Invisible Woman). Collections Evans' work is held in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Castello di Rivoli, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

She is an American clinical cardiologist and professor emerita at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Education In 1951 she graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College in New York. She received her doctor of medicine degree from Harvard Medical School in 1954 as one of their first female graduates, and began her postgraduate work at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, where she became the first woman to be chief resident in the cardiology department. After her residency, she moved to Emory University, where she started as an instructor and eventually was named full professor of medicine in 1971. Research career Wenger has been a leader in the cardiology field as she has authored and co-authored more than 1,300 scientific and review articles and book chapters. Over the course of her career, Wenger became one of the first doctors to focus on heart disease in women, since this disease was initially thought to primarily affect men. In 1993 Wenger co-wrote a landmark review article that demonstrated that cardiovascular disease does similarly affect women since, at the time, women were more likely than men to die from the disease. She also helped write the 2007 Guidelines for Preventing Cardiovascular Disease in Women. She has devoted the rest of her career to understand how heart disease, specifically coronary artery disease, affects women as well as advocating for the need to disaggregate study results and report gender-specific analyses from clinical trials. Wenger was editor of the American Journal of Geriatric Cardiology for 15 years and was also a founder of the Society of Geriatric Cardiology, which is now the Council on the Cardiac Care of Older Adults at the American College of Cardiology.  Personal life  She is married to Dr. Julius Wenger, a gastroenterologist; she has three daughters.

Her interest in acting developed while she was in high school at Ward‚ÄìBelmont College in Nashville, and she went on to attend a dramatic school in New York. Career Romano's initial professional acting experience came in a stage production of Don Juan. She initially focused on dramatic roles, but in 1924 she had her first comedic role in the farce The Whole Town's Talking. Her Broadway credits included The Love Call (1927) and The Warrior's Husband (1932). After being a leading woman on stage for years, Romano made her screen debut in the film Titans for Universal Pictures. That work led to her signing a long-term contract with Universal in 1925.

Her daughter, Fay Weldon, and father, Edgar Jepson, were both novelists. Personal life Margaret Jepson was born in 1907, the daughter of mystery/detective author and critic Edgar Jepson and Frieda Jepson, a concert pianist who was the daughter of the musician Henry Holmes. Margaret's brother was the writer Selwyn Jepson. She attended London City College and Ealing Technical College Library School and the Slade School of Art. In 1928 she married a young doctor, Frank Thornton Birkinshaw, who was a veteran of World War I. In 1929 their daughter Jane was born, followed by another daughter in 1931, whom Margaret named Franklin Birkinshaw, but who is better known as feminist writer Fay Weldon. In 1930 the Birkinshaws emigrated to New Zealand, where Frank found a position at a practice in Christchurch. Margaret and Frank split up, later divorcing in 1936. She returned alone to London on a cargo ship, planning to send for her children as soon as possible. When her husband threatened to take his daughters to South Africa, she returned to New Zealand to collect them. She began writing romance novels and stories that were published as serials in order to support her daughters. World War II forced her to find other work. She took a variety of jobs, such as painting ladies' powder-boxes. Along with her mother, who joined her in 1942, she worked in her own small ad agency, writing copy and working in film. She also secretly scratched away at her \\"magnum opus\\", a treatise on morality and aesthetics that according to her daughter's autobiography ran to \\"thousands of overwritten pages, which would get in a hopeless muddle on the kitchen table\\". In 1946, when the war was over, Margaret, Frieda, and Margaret's daughters returned to England on the MV Rangatini. Margaret and the children moved to West Cornwall. Her obituary in The Times states that she considered this to be one of the worst mistakes of her life, because it led to her daughter Jane being introduced to the printer Guido Morris, who she later married. In the 1960s, her daughter Jane was abandoned by her husband, Guido Morris, suffered from mental illness and later died from brain cancer in 1969 at the age of 40, leaving behind three children. Margaret took over the care of her grandchildren. In 2000, Jepson broke her hip, after which she moved into a residential home, then a nursing home where she died. Jepson features as a character in her daughter Fay Weldon's novel Chalcot Crescent (2010). Career Jepson authored her first novel with her father, Edgar Jepson, in 1932 (Miss Amagee in Africa) before writing her first solo novel, Via Panama, which was published in 1934. Although praised by both George Bernard Shaw and HG Wells, it caused an uproar at the time and was a source of embarrassment to her husband. Her second novel was Velvet and Steel. She also wrote serialised novels under the pseudonym Pearl Bellairs. According to her daughter Fay Weldon, Margaret's father stated that she was a better writer than either him or his son Selwyn, citing her novel Via Panama as proof.

Biography His father, Claude, was a journalist. He arrived in Paris in 1839; studying art with Hendrik Scheffer and Th√©odore Rousseau. Later, after buying a house in Barbizon, he worked with Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, who was his next-door neighbor. He also shared Millet's interest in Ukiyo-e (Japanese prints) and collected them at his Paris apartment. He and his wife would become the godparents for Millet's daughter Anne-Marie and care for him when he entered his final illness. After his death, Charles wrote the catalogue for the sale of his paintings at the H√¥tel Drouot. His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1846, where he presented a \\"Portrait of the Author\\" (Self-portrait?). In 1849, he exhibited a \\"Souvenir of the Pyrenees\\" and, in 1855, a \\"Forest Interior\\". He was a friend of Edgar Degas, who was a neighbor of his in Paris, and frequented the meetings of his friends; including Mary Cassatt, Albert Bartholom√© and Fran√ßois Antoine L√©on Fleury He also provided art criticism and commentary for the journal Le Si√®cle, where his father was Managing Director.

The museum was founded in 2006 by a Ukrainian couple who worked in the plumbing business and is currently housed in a building within the Kyiv Fortress. In 2016, the Guinness Book of Records recognized it as \\"the largest collection of souvenir toilet bowls in the world\\". Background The museum was created by Nikolay and Marina Bogdanenko, a Ukrainian couple who had previously worked in the plumbing supply business and wanted to teach people about the enduring importance of hygiene. It opened in 2006 with items that the Bogdanenkos had collected from around the world, many while on vacation. In 2013 Bogdanenko published a 521-page book on the history of hygiene and toiletry, World History (of Toilets). Today, the museum draws an estimated 1,000 visitors per month and is housed in the Kyiv Fortress, a building which dates to the 19th Century. Organization The museum covers the toilet from prehistoric times to the present day and related topics, including the dressing room and clothes worn to clean toilets. Exhibits are arranged sequentially, dividing history into Primitive Society, Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, XVII-XX century, Modernity, and Art Water Closets. The museum has replicas of some of the first toilet seats and explains the invention of toilet paper more than 2,000 years ago in China. A display shows visitors waste disposal methods from medieval castles and why medieval toilets were called wardrobes.

Korean bread\\") consist of Korean-style bread, buns, pastries, cakes, and snacks. Korean bread did not enter Korean diets or become a mainstream staple until the late 1980s. To a large extent, bread was not part of Korean cuisine, other than some types of traditional steamed bread that were made of mixed rice flour and wheat. Korean breads were first introduced to the mainstream market in the 1980s with the establishment of the bakery chain Paris Crosissant. The items that were introduced to the Korean market aimed to introduce a French-inspired type of bread that would simultaneously satisfy a Korean taste palette. Hence, the type of bread and buns that were created were a fusion of Western technique and Korean flavours. Western fused breads are a growing phenomena across Asia and as new Asian bakery chains grew in their home countries, they have simultaneously entered international markets.  Characteristics  Asian style buns are soft, springy and sweet. Other than some softer bread varieties like the Croissant or brioche, Asian breads differ greatly from most traditional European breads, which characteristically have a harder crust and a dry, salty crumb. In Western-style baking, bread has zero fat and the main components are flour, salt, and water. Asian style bread, on the other hand, are high in fat and sugar, which together give the bread its unique soft texture.Typical white bread found in South Korean bakeries Korean baked breads are very soft and typically drizzled with condensed milk. Commonly baked goods take the form of a stuffed bun with the most typical filling being red-bean. Many resemble items found in a French bakery, however most feature Asian flavours fused with Western baking techniques. Mi Young Lee, the East Coast Manager of the South Korea based bakery chain, Tous Les Jours, notes bread sold in Korean bakeries resembled items found in a French bakery but feature Asian flavours, \\"the result is a fascinating array of pastries, both sweet and savoury, that appeal to both Eastern and Western palettes.‚Äù Chains like Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours are at the forefront of developing new flavours and variations in Korean bread and have been introducing items that harness traditional Korean flavours like red bean, green matcha and sesame.  Varieties  A Korean bakery typically offers over 300 different items. Many are sweet, much like a brioche, and rarely do Korean bakeries offer dense, multigrain loaves you would expect to find at European or Western bakeries. The most common and popular items include ‚Äúgyeran bbang‚Äù (egg bread) and ‚Äúsoboro‚Äù buns (a type of streusel). ‚ÄòEgg bread‚Äô is a sweet and savoury oblong muffin with a whole egg baked on top. \\"Bungeoppang‚Äô\\" are fish-shaped waffles, filled with sweet red bean paste. Similar to the bungeo-ppang is ‚Äògukhwappang‚Äô, which are the same make but are in the shape of chrysanthemum-flowers. \\"Bungeo-ppang\\" (Î∂ïÏñ¥Îπµ; \\"carp bread\\") and ‚Äúgyeran bbang‚Äù (\\"Í≥ÑÎûÄÎπµ\\", egg bread) are staple items you will find sold in South Korea at street food markets.Bungeo-ppang (Î∂ïÏñ¥Îπµ; \\"carp bread\\") Soboro, or Korean streusel bread, is a kind of bread cookie that is topped on a pastry bread giving it a hard, crusty top. Soboro streusel varieties can also be found filled with sweet potato, red bean or strawberry jam. There are many cream cheese-filled breads including mocha cream cheese bread, walnut cream cheese bread, almond cream cheese bread, cream cheese rye bread and red bean cream cheese bread. There are also custard-filled varieties including condensed milk bread, custard-filled bread and melon cream bread. Varieties of bread with traditional Korean dessert ingredients include walnut red bean bread, glutinous rice bread, pumpkin bread or chestnut bread. Choco pies is a very famous Korean snack, which resembles chocolate, marshmallow filled cookie. Most traditional bakeries in Korea sell hand-made choco pies but commercial varieties can also be bought at grocery stores. Sora-ppang (ÏÜåÎùº Îπµ; \\"sora bread\\") is in the shape of a shell and filled with a mocha filling. Hwangnam Bread (Ìô©ÎÇ®Îπµ), also referred to as Gyeongju bread (Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎπµ), is a traditional Korean bun filled with red bean paste. Mochi Bread (Î™®Ï∞å Îπµ) is a Japanese-inspired sweet bread filled with a variety of fillings like cheese, chocolate and matcha. The introduction of sweet style breads to the Korean food market has further led to a shift in traditional breakfast menus. Nowadays, honey-butter toast and egg buns are common meals you will find being offered for breakfast in cafes. = Traditional bread gallery = File:Korean.cuisine-Gyeongju.bread-01.jpgGyeongju Bread File:Chalbori-ppang 2.jpgChalbori-ppang (Ï∞∞Î≥¥Î¶¨Îπµ) Glutinous Bakery Bread File:Tongyeong-kkulppang 2.jpgKkulppang (ÍøÄÎπµ) Honey Bread  Modern bread gallery  File:Shakoy doughnut.jpgTwisted Doughnut File:Bean-jam-bun,anpan,katori- city,japan.JPGRed Bean Bun File:Sausage rolls in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.jpgHot Dog Buns File:LOTTE - CHOCO PIE.jpgChoco Pie File:Gyeranppang (egg bread) (Seoul street food).jpgGyeranppang (Í≥ÑÎûÄÎπµ; \\"egg bread\\") = Cafe culture = Korean Honey Butter Toast (ÌóàÎãàÎ∏åÎ†àÎìú) Cafe culture in South Korea only truly began to accelerate in the 1980s when modern coffee houses began to emerge. Today there are now over 20,000 cafe shops in South Korea, of which there are 1,008 Starbucks alone. At any cafe you can expect to see people residing there for hours working, meeting friends or studying. Most cafes offer customers access to free wifi and power to charge technological devices, hence they have become popular destinations among young people. The trend is an effect of Koreans embracing the Western-style coffee shop experience. Traditional Korean breakfast consisted of rice, kimchi and soup. But modernisation of Korean cuisine as a result of Western influence has meant toast and cereals have had an increasing presence in the Korean diet. One feature of this is the invention of \\"honey butter toast\\". \\"Honey toast\\" is a large, fluffy white bread that has been coated in butter, honey and caramel and topped with whipped cream, syrup, nuts and sometimes fruit. Injelomi toast is baked white bread that is stuffed with glutinous rice and variations may top it with garlic cheese, citron or honey and ice cream. These are two breakfast menu items typically at South Korean cafes.  History  Globalization has resulted in a shift in the Korean diet and eating culture. Foods like kimchi and bap (\\"rice\\") are more commonly being replaced with bread and meat. Traditionally bread had not been a part of the Korean cuisine or diet as it has been the staple in Western and European countries. Some types of steamed breads made of a mix of wheat and rice flour have been a part of Korean and Asian diets, however these were introduced from Central Asian in the 13th century. In most East Asian countries, rice is still the staple food item and bread is typically reserved as a breakfast food, snack and on some occasions, a dessert. Modernization of Korean cuisine grew in the 1980s and the 1990s. The gradual opening of South Korean markets internationally over this period allowed for even greater amounts of grain-based products to enter the diets of Koreans along with other foods. This changed the basic diet of Koreans greatly in the past several decades. Rice consumption has decreased markedly: according to statistics compiled by the National Statistical Office, per capita annual rice consumption has decreased from 106.5 kg in 1995 to 61 kg in 2016. This steady decline reflects the increased prominence of other foods such as instant foods, processed meats and the increasing use of bread and noodles in meals. Bread in Korea also signifies a social change as more and more young people are choosing the convenience and affordability of bread over other traditional snacks. Health trends in Korea and the country's increasing on-the-go lifestyle has resulted in an increase in the consumption of staple breads and rolls. Products that can be consumed quickly and easily, like energy and cereal bars, show strong growth in intake in South Korea as a result of the population's busy lifestyle. The popularity of bread and growth of the baked goods market are also a result of the convenience of bread. In family households, working mothers will typically make toast for breakfast because it is easier and faster to prepare than a Korean style breakfast. The bread and bakery products market is expected to grow annually by 3.3% (CAGR 2019-2023). Moreover, reports by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs show sales of unhealthy products like doughnuts and pies had decreased. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, in 2016 the total production capacity in the baking industry stood at 2.1 trillion won, which was an 11.8% increase from 1.9 trillion won four years ago. Amongst baked goods produced individual bread products like red bean pastries have had the highest level of production at 48.1%, followed by cakes (34.5%), sliced loaf bread (8.7%) and doughnuts (3.8%). The industry saw total sales grow 49.6% from 3.9 trillion won in 2012 to 5.9 trillion won in 2016, an average annual increase of 10.6%. In relation to Asia-Pacific region, the bread & rolls market grew by 6.1% in 2014 to reach a value of $20,215.5 million. In 2019, the bread & rolls market in Asian-Pacific is forecast to have a value of $27,731.7 million, an increase of 37.2% since 2014. Overall, South Korea has seen rapid expansion of dessert caf√©s and unpackaged baked goods from specialist coffee shops and small bakery specialists. Baked goods, artisanal bread, cake and pastries continue to show strong performance as a growing supplementary food item.  Franchises  240x240px Franchises Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours are leaders in the Korean baked goods market. The first Paris Baguette Korea opened in South Korea in 1988 by the SPC Group. As of 2018, Paris Baguette had over 3,316 stores in South Korea and has launched 185 stores internationally in countries such as China, Vietnam, Singapore and France. Paris Baguette is still the largest chain in South Korea and holds 80% of the market share. Subsidiaries of SPC Group, such as Samlip General Food, include the largest manufacturers of packaged baked goods in South Korea. The diverse product range and growing expansion of the company is a tribute to its growing success. Paris Baguette was also ranked number one for brand recognition and brand power. Tous Les Jours was established by the CJ Group in 1996 and has over 1300 locations in Asia and the USA. Tous Les Jours accounts for about one-fifth of the market share. The popularity of baked goods in Korea and Korean peoples affinity for all things trendy, has allowed for some foreign bakeries to enter the market. French chains like Brioche Doree and Gontran Cherrier, as well as New York-based Magnolia Bakery are among the overseas chains entering the local market. Brioche Doree opened in 2013 in South Korea using ingredients directly shipped from France. Despite being relatively more expensive than its competitors, people still frequent their stores for the authenticity of their products. Tous les Jours, founded in 1996The remainder of the market not operated by conglomerates are local, independent bakeries known as \\"ÎèôÎÑ§ÎπµÏßë; dongneh ppangchib; 'town bakeries'\\". Bakeries selling Asian style breads can be found all over the world and some of largest chains today include Grupo Bimbo, BreadTalk Group and Yamazaki Baking. The Chinese market is fast becoming the largest consumers of baked goods since foreign bakeries entered the market in the 1990s. Since then, businesses trying to reach success in China, like in other Asian markets, have aimed to strike a balance between making breads that look like Western baked goods but are filled with cream and are sweet and buttery in flavour. In another area, the market is trying to reach consumers that are more health conscious and thus certain bakeries like Brioche Doree produce breads that have less oil and less sugar but still have cream and cheese filling to meet consumers' requirements and taste preferences.

It is a site upon 'Sydney's Coastal Walks' with scenic views between two rocky headlands. The bay is renowned for various reef and coral and as a result is a popular snorkeling area with an abundance of marine life. It is also known for small aluminium boats known as dinghies or colloquially as \\"tinnies\\" with an abundance being found upon wooden racks upon the dry sand belonging to members of Gordon's Bay Amateur Fishing Club. Geography The bay is located in between two large cliff faces with rocky outcrops on both the north and south ends. There is a small patch of sand leading from the footpath into the water and the two rocky platforms either side of the waters entry. It is only accessible through the coastal walkway linking many of Sydney's iconic Eastern Suburbs beaches. With a steep decline, the bay presents itself as a secluded area being labelled by some as a hidden oasis. On the north end, raised board walks cover the wetland undergrowth which thrives due to the conditions created by a nearby natural spring. Upon the descent of the walk, there are the wooden beams that support many boats for storage otherwise known as ‚Äútinnies‚Äù by the locals. Surrounded by many trees and shrubbery, the bay has a lot of shade often making itself a relaxing place for beach goers with an abundance of flora and fauna. The water is home to many aquatic creatures as well as underwater vegetation that thrives under the calm conditions of the beach. The bay has been divided up into five distinct areas of vegetation that differentiate from each other in several ways. These are, area 1 the southern area which contains forest/scrub vegetation, area 2 the Swamp area of reeds and water, area 3 the Cleared Gordon's Bay Fishing Club Area of grass and small shrubs, area 4 the Heath Area and area 5 CliffBrook Parade with weeds and exotic species. All of these areas contain either weeds, native or exotic and each area consists of at least 5 different species of vegetation. As for fauna, the bay has one species of frog, eight reptile species, forty-two bird species with thirty-six native and six introduced as well as three introduced mammals and two native mammal species. Gordon's Bay underwater geography is similar to that of other oceanic communities within the Sydney beaches area. The bay's deepest point is containing mostly semi-mobile marine sands that are dynamic and ever-changing. There are several outcrops of reef spread out throughout the bay that are predominantly used to house kelp communities. As a result, due to the shallow nature of the beach, the bay is home for many shallow marine life species. With the prime conditions of shallow coastal waters, these kinds of fish and sea vegetation thrive in an optimal environment resulting in a diverse and vibrant array of underwater activity. As for Urban development, the bay is surrounded by a number of residential buildings, most of which consist of one, two and three storeys. There are also a number of four to fie storey flats that surround the bay. This mass of housing development which presents itself within the bay is reflective of the enclosed nature of the area. The diversity of the buildings provides a conflicting image of colours that showcase a notion of randomness and lack of cohesion. However, with a mixture of both modern and federation buildings of many different colour scales, Gordon's Bay is a hotspot for scenic living with stunning views of the secluded beach. History Indigenous Australians were the first humans to occupy Gordon's Bay before colonization from white settlers. Although there is little to no information about them connected to Gordon's Bay specifically, there is evidence for Aboriginal occupation of nearby beaches such as Bronte and Tamarama to the North. The Eastern Sydney Indigenous people otherwise known as Eora Darug participated in fishing, collecting and hunting around those two beaches making it possible the same was done at Gordon's Bay.http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/data/assets/pdf_file/0020/8660/ABriefAboriginalHistory.pdf However, due to massive disruption from white settlement with both disease, violence and attempts to assimilate Aboriginal peoples to Western culture, the indigenous population in the Eastern Suburbs has decreased significantly. The European name of Gordon's Bay was attributed in the mid 1800s to Governor Surveyor, Lewis Gordon. Using his powers as this role in the New South Wales government, he granted this land to himself until it was resold in 1859 to John Thompson an investor in the area at the time. At the time of its selling it was renamed Cliff-Brook and amassed to 14 acres. When Thompson became Randwick's mayor in 1873, he renamed the bay again to Thompson Bay after himself and build a mansion on the northern end of the bay. Before its deconstruction in 1921, the original Cliff-Brook mansion was designed in the 1870s to be reminiscent of Victorian Italianate architecture. The building was made from sandstone, timber and brick with large verandas and was a prime example of Italian styled architecture of the period. With large gardens surrounding the mansion, horse stables and quarters for staff to the north of the property, the mansions was reminiscent of a villa, a celebration of Victorian Italianate architecture. In 1905, the property grew to be even larger with Gordon's Bay high water mark, Battery Street, Moore Street and Beach Street being attributed as land to the estate. Currently the reconstructed Cliff-Brook home still stands on the northern end where Sir Denison Miller the original Commonwealth Bank governor again sold the majority of the area for ¬£3,000 to the local council. In 1976 the National Trust deemed Cliffbrook the most significant and outstanding building in the Coogee Gordon's Bay area. Despite this though, the area was demolished in order to make room for six individual plots for housing that are still standing to this day. In 1964 the local fishing club named Gordon's Bay Fishing club was formally established. After difficulty acquiring the lease for an unused boat shed on the beachfront, the club was founded for the purposes of social fishing and building a sense of community. While the building has remained mostly in shape, the structure has undergone repairs after major storms such as the one of 1974 which left damage to the walkway, rear wall and structural components of the building. Nearby the Bay there is a little boat shed constructed sometime around the early 20th century which is still in use today as a club house. Conditions Gordon's Bay is not patrolled by Surf Life Saving Australia or lifeguards alike due to it having relatively calm conditions. The bay is a reflective beach positioned between two large cliff faces which allows the it to be generally sheltered by storms and waves. However, 2015 was an exception, when many of the boats on the racks were destroyed due to a large storm that blew through the natural sea wall. Boats were torn apart, smashed together and crushed as the violent ocean conditions and breezes devastated the beach. A large part of the ramp made from hardwood was destroyed however the concrete clubhouse dating back to the early 20th century was unscathed. As a reflective beach, the sand and gravel exposed is steep leading into the water creating low energy waves with minimal risk to the beach goer's safety. Despite its calm and relaxing conditions for the most part, the boat storage launching function of the bay results in a significantly lower population of swimmers as opposed to its northern and southern neighbours. However, danger presents itself in a different form to most traditional beaches, with seaweed many rocks on both Northern and Southern ends creating slipping hazards on hard surfaces. Instead beach goers shouldn't be wary of waves, tides and currents but rather other hazards. As for surfing conditions, just outside the bay to the left there is a catch able break over the rocks and on the right a ride able reef. Marine hazards of sharks and Pacific man o' war (known as blue bottles in Australia) are uncommon however are still displayed with signage. As a result, those desiring to swim are encouraged to observe the conditions and view appropriate information such as live weather feeds to be informed for their safety when they choose to enter the water. Fishing Gordon's Bay, much like the surrounding areas is known for its abundance of marine life, with fishing boats and plentiful areas to rock fish. The Gordon's Bay fishing club is the official hub for fishing activity in the area, with many active members in the community that participate in fishing events and practices very frequently. Often fishermen are seen launching boats from the bay to begin ocean fishing or on the Southern rock face casting from the rocks. However, there are many safety issues and concerns with fishing as the Randwick coastline is renowned as a dangerous rock fishing area. Laws, such as the life jacket law, are enforced with fines to protect fishers from currents sweeping off the rocks. The Bay is part of the Bronte-Coogee aquatic reserve which consists of several beaches and bays. Due to a drop off on its rocky cliff face, aquatic life is very prominent in the area with a wide range of species. It is also very accessible to patrons willing to fish with a large variety of species to catch. However, there isn't complete freedom for fishermen and fisherwomen as restrictions are in place to ensure that overfishing of endangered species does not occur. An example of one fish with protection is the blue groper (Achoerodus viridis) which is a well-renowned and sought after fish in the Eastern Suburbs. As Gordon's Bay, like all Bronte-Coogee Aquatic Reserves, is a part of the NSW recreational fishing jurisdiction and it must adhere to its rules. Line fishing is permitted but not for blue groper as mentioned previously. Spearfishing is not permitted in Gordon's Bay however collecting crustaceans is. Species such as blacklip abalone, eastern and southern rock lobsters. There are strict rules on the gathering of marine invertebrates such as anemone, barnacles, chitons, cockles, crabs, mussels, octopi, oysters, pipis, sea urchins, sea stars, snails, worms and the collection of sea shells. With this in mind, it is important that those intending to fish follow the regulations for the better preservation of the bays flora and fauna. Tourism As Gordon's Bay is positioned between two of Sydney's hot spots, Clovelly and Coogee, it is with increasing popularity that people are visiting the beaches. Although it was popular as a nude beach in the 1970s, Gordon's Bay is now a place for families relax and enjoy the refreshing breezes and hot sun during Australia's summer. With many places to snorkel such as the Gordon's Bay Underwater Trail ‚Äî a self-guided 45-minute journey showcasing the aquatic flora and fauna. The Gordon's Bay Underwater Trail is a 600-meter underwater trail marked by a chain attached to drums filled with concrete placed at 20-meter intervals along the seabed. Steel plaques along the route provide information about underwater ecology and local aquatic wildlife. The deepest point is 14 meters and along the way you're likely to spot eastern footballer fish and morwong.https://www.hellosydneykids.com.au/gordons-bay/ Recreational activities of fishing and scuba diving with local clubs make the most of their use of the area. Being located along the coastal walk, many visitors pass by exercising through walking, jogging and recreational sightseeing. Down upon the rocks there are many places for beach goers to sunbathe and relax, most popularly on the south end. Gordon's Bay is known to be a recreational hub within Sydney's east due to its high accessibility. The main use in the area for angling is the boat launch pads. Due to the bay being so accessible it is a popular scuba diving location for learner and novice divers with little to no experience diving. The bay is accessible by parking on the north end near Clovelly beach.

Oral skills are used to enhance the clarity of speech for effective communication. Communication is the transmission of messages and the correct interpretation of information between people. The production speech is insisted by the respiration of air from the lungs that initiates the vibrations in the vocal cords. The cartilages in the larynx adjust the shape, position and tension of the vocal cords. Speech enhancers are used to improve the clarity and pronunciation of speech for correct interpretation of speech. The articulation of voice enhances the resonance of speech and enables people to speak intelligibly. Speaking at a moderate pace and using clear pronunciation improves the phonation of sounds. The term \\"phonation\\" means the process to produce intelligible sounds for the correct interpretation of speech. Speaking in a moderate tone enables the audience to process the information word for word.  Speech production  Speech is produced from the vibrations in the vocal cords. The lungs, vocal cords and larynx play an important role in speech production. The lungs draws in air to produce vibrations in the vocal cords. The movement and shape of the vocal fords determines the pitch of sounds. The larynx consists of nine cartilages that assists the vocal cords to produce sound. Producing clear speech is important for effective communication. 323x323px =Lungs= The lungs pump air to the vocal folds initiating air pressure. This creates vibrations in the vocal cords to produce sound. During breathing and speaking, air is exhaled out of the lungs. The pressure of the air opens the vocal cords. The expanding of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles builds high pressure in the thoracic cavity. This causes unbalanced air pressure between the inside and the outside of the body. Thus, the air pressure reaches equilibrium when the air is exhaled. = Vocal cords = Vibrations in the vocal cords is achieved by the accelerated movements of the opening and closing of the glottis. Sound is produced from this movement as air is expired from the lungs. The size of the opening of the glottis can determine the pitch of sounds. A larger opening of the glottis produces a low pitch tone and a smaller opening of the glottis produces a high pitch tone. The contraction and relaxation of the vocal cords also impacts the pitch of sound. The length and the force of the vocal cords impacts the vibrations of the vocal cords. The longer and relaxed the vocal cord are, the slower they vibrate and in turn produces a lower pitch sound. = Larynx = The larynx (voice box) is located in the throat . The larynx produces an open airway when breathing and a mechanism for sound production. The larynx is contains the vocal cords and nine cartilages (gristle) that are connected by membranes and ligaments. The large cartilage ring (thyroid cartilage) is located at the upper part of the larynx. The large cartilage is composed of two bands that forms an Adams Apple . The cricoid cartilage is located below the cartilage and it is attached to the trachea. Six thinner cartilages form part of the lateral and posterior walls of the larynx. The arytenoid cartilages are vital for sound production as the arytenoid cartilages anchor the vocal cords. The muscles in the cartilage adjust the shape, position and tension of the vocal cords. The interior of the larynx has a mucus-coated lining. The layer of cilia on the mucus lining enables the vocal cords to push out foreign substances such as dust mites and mucus particles out of the larynx. Clearing the throat of foreign particles helps to produces crisp and clear sound that is intelligible and effective for communication. The vocal ligaments are buried under the mucus lining of cilia. The vocal ligaments are attached to cartilages and the mucus lining is folded to form the vocal folds. From a bird‚Äôs eye view, both sides of the vocal folds produces a ‚ÄòV‚Äô shape. The vocal folds vibrates in a ‚ÄòV‚Äô shape and produces sounds when air passes between the lungs and the glottis. The vestibular cords are mucosal folds that sit above the vocal cords. The mucus produced by the vestibular cords assists in lubricating the vocal cords and prevents any food or liquid entering the breathing passages.  Clarity in speaking  Clarity in speaking is achieved by utilising oral skills. Oral skills strengthen a speakers ability to produce clear and crisp sounds. Using a variety of different oral skills the tonal modulation and articulation of voice. These oral skills include speaking in a moderate pace to produce intelligible speech that can be understood word for word. Having clear pronunciation of words to enhances the diction of speech. = Articulation = The human mouth utilises the lips, tongue and jaws for articulation. The articulation of vowels and phrases produces clear speech that is intelligible. The resonance of speech is produced by the pharynx and some sinuses of the cranium. These sinuses contain air-filled cavities that are lined with mucus membranes. Any blockage of theses cavities such as a cold, blocked nose or a sore throat can affect the quality of speech as not enough air is being released from these cavities. The volume of sound is determined by the intensity of the airflow. A greater force of airflow produces a louder sound as there are more vibrations. A louder voice can improve the intelligibility of speech when speaking to a larger audience. Speakers alter their articulation and their volume when speaking in different environments in order for others to understand them. = Moderate pace = A moderate pace of speech enables a person to speak intelligibly. The moderate pace in speech enables a listener to process and understand the information. This helps to break down large and complex information to smaller parts. Pausing during speaking emphasises the information and this enables the audience to interpret the information correctly. Speaking at approximately 120-150 words per minute (wpm) is a moderate pace for an audience to comprehend information. A varying speaking rate can engage the interest and attention of the audience. A fast tempo creates a mood of tension and swiftness. The message conveyed to the audience can be interpreted as an urgent or a light-hearted message. A slow tempo is used to convey complex and crucial information as the audience needs more time to process the ideas and information. = Pronunciation = The correct pronunciation of vowels is aided by the soft plate, tongue, lips and cheeks. These structures aid to ‚Äòshape‚Äô sound into vowels and consonants. The correct pronunciation of words enables the listener to correctly interpret the information. The movement of the mouth and lips affects the pronunciation words. The tongue plays a key role in the pronunciation of vowels and consonants. The tongue moves in several different positions to correctly produce these sounds. The tip of the tongue moves towards the top of the gum ridge to produce words starting with the letter ‚ÄòL‚Äô. The tongue will push back away from the teeth to produce words starting with letter ‚ÄòR‚Äô. Words are pronounced by syllables. This breaks down words into smaller parts which enables the audience to comprehend the word. Syllables can also be emphasised to clearly pronounce words correctly. To pronounce a noun that is two-syllables long, the first syllable is emphasised. To pronounce a verb that is two-syllables long, the second syllable is emphasised. Stressing on important words in sentences can empahsise the meaning and clarity of sentences. = Tone = The tone of voice in speaking is modulated to convey expression and emotion. This enables the responder to recognise emotion that is appropriate of the circumstance and this enables the audience to process information immediately and correctly. The pitch of one‚Äôs voice can impact the clarity of speech. A monotonous tone of voice can cause the listener to misinterpret information as it is harder to focus to a monotonous tone. A verbose tone of voice highlights technical language that is inwardly focused. A verbose tone of voice is used to convey factual information. An informal tone is used to express non-technical information. Inflections in speech is the variation of rise and fall of the volume of tone. Inflection in speech is vital for intonation for intelligible speaking. Intonation of the voice engages the attention and concentration of the listener. Inflections in speech can impact the relative importance of information. Breathing plays an important role in the production of inflections in speech. Diaphragmatic breathing controls the amount of air the body inhales and exhales and influences the rise and fall of the volume of tone. = Verbal fillers = Verbal fillers are commonly used when a speaker recalls or is confused by what they are saying. \\"Um\\", \\"Err\\" and \\"Hmm\\", are commonly used verbal fillers. The repetition of phrases in sentences is a verbal filler. that These unintentional pauses can affect the clarity of speech as it creates gaps in the speaker's sentences. Verbal fillers can disrupt the flow of speech and can distract the attention of the audience. This can impact the audience understanding and ability to process information. A pause in a sentence is effective to use than verbal fillers as it does not distract the audience with an unprecedented gap in the information. Pauses enables the audience to reflect on key ideas that has been spoken about. Mumbling and not opening the mouth wide enough when speaking can produce unclear speech that is not intelligible.  Speech Perception 313x313px The human ears detect vibrations from sounds and converts this information to the brain via nerve impulses. These vibrations are transferred to specialised parts of the ears .The external, middle and inner ear play an important role in the transformation of sound and energy. The techniques used in oral skills to produce clear speech impacts the correct interpretation of information. = External ear = The external ear (outer ear) consists of the pinnae and meatus and the outer layer of the eardrum (tympanic membrane). The pinnae helps to restrict sound waves entering the ears. Sound from the external environment is transmitted as a wave in the auditory canal (meatus). This is then transmitted to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The sound waves sets up vibrations in the tympanic membrane. The pars tensa is an active vibrating area that responds to sound waves. The tympanic membrane regularly grows and can automatically self-repair after injury. = Middle ear = The middle ear is a cavity that is filled with air. The tympanic membrane separates the middle ear from the external ear. The middle ear is joined to the throat via the Eustachian tube. The Eustachian tube adjusts the air pressure around the sides of the tympanic membrane by drawing in air from the mouth. The sound in the tympanic membrane is converted into vibrations (kinetic energy) via the three interconnecting ear ossicles to the oval window of the inner ear. The middle ear is connected to the perilymph (fluid) of the inner ear via the oval window. The oval window has the ability to hold fluid in the cochlea. = Inner ear = The inner ear is composed of bony canals (bony labyrinth). It is divided into three parts: vestibule, semicircular canals and the cochlea. These vestibule and the semicircular parts play a key role in the sensors for balancing. The cochlea plays an important part in hearing. Vibrations from the oval window of the inner ear is transferred to the perilymph in the upper canal via a pressure wave. The Reissner's membrane transfers the vibrations to the endolymph of the middle canal. The Basilar membrane then vibrates and triggers the hair cells of the organ of Corti. The kinetic energy is converted to electrochemical energy as the auditory nerve transmits the information to the brain where sound is interpreted.

Louis Vuitton (4 August 1821 ‚Äì 27 February 1892) and Clemence-Emilie Vuitton, who succeeded his father after his death as the head of the brand Louis Vuitton which is now a brand under the umbrella of the parent company LVMH. Georges is commonly known for his creation of the widely used LV monogram canvas print, created in homage to his father and to also combat counterfeits. He is also known for making the Louis Vuitton available to purchase internationally. His son Gaston Louis Vuitton (1883‚Äì 1970) took over the brand after his death in 1936, becoming the third generation of Vuitton men to head the brand  Early life  When the French designer Louis Vuitton (son of Trunk maker Xavier Vuitton and Corrine Gaillard from the Jura region of Eastern France) was 35 years old, his wife Clemence-Emilie Vuitton gave birth to their first son and child Georges Ferreol Vuitton on 13 July 1857 in Asni√®res-sur-Seine where the brand Louis Vuitton was based, until the end of the Franco-Prussian War when the original Vuitton main trunk manufacturing workshop was completely destroyed forcing the young family to move to Paris in 1871 where Georges subsequently lived. Georges was the only child of Louis and Clemence-Emilie Vuitton and quickly began learning the trade his Father practiced- Trunk making for Louis Vuitton. Louis and Clemence-Emilie Georges to school in Jersey to learn to speak English as Louis was not comfortable speaking English to his wealthy clients.. After Louis Vuitton died aged 70 years old on 27 February 1892, and then his son Georges took over as the head of the luxury trunk and bag making business and was the first Vuitton man to bring the brand out of France and onto the global stage by showing it off at the Chicago World Fair in 1893.  Career  Throughout Georges Ferr√©ol Vuitton's life as the head of Louis Vuitton, he created and changed many aspects of the brand aiding it in becoming as successful as it is today as one of the most popular French luxury brands, and one of the most successful companies owned by parent company LVMH. Georges was the first to bring the brand to the global scene., created the LV monogram canvas, the Car trunk, innovated locks to become the Tumbler lock, started the Le Voyage book series and began giving VIP trunk Vuitton gifts to their most loyal of customers = LV Monogram Canvas = Due to the popularity of the brand, many counterfeit products sprung up around France being sold for much cheaper prices reflecting the poor quality with which they were made. Due to this in 1896, in response Georges decides to create a complicated pattern that would cover his trunks and decrease the amount of counterfeits being made due to the difficult nature of creating the pattern. This resulted in the creation of the LV monogram canvas both a push back on fakes and a homage to his father Louis Vuitton. This canvas is covered with diamonds, the LV logo, flowers and quatrefoils and other shapes that have become a key part of the brands image. Despite its creation in 1896, it was not until 1905 that the patent for the LV monogram canvas was permitted.Georges' father Louis Vuitton, founder of the luxury brand. = 1897‚Äì Car Trunk = The LV monogram canvas developed by Georges Vuitton. Both a tribute to his father and the brand and to curb the production of fakes.A large part of Georges Ferr√©ol Vuitton's life was his love of automobiles and traveling in them, and it became an essential point of the Louis Vuitton trunk's and how the brand strategised the innovation and creation of them. Georges saw the many trunks were being made without the idea of them being put into automobiles in mind and he wanted to innovate and change this. He decided that a traveller should be able to travel in a car with the same amount that one would be able to bring on a boat or a train so he ventured to create a more sturdy and space efficient trunk than was previously manufactured. Georges' solution was to use new materials he had not previously used to create their trunks including a black water proof cloth that coated every trunk to ensure durability, furthermore Louis Vuitton decided to bevel each closure of the trunk making the new trunks not as susceptible the issues that rain and dust presented. Georges understood that in traveling in a car, the trunks need to be stacked on top of each other to use space efficiently, so he revolutionized the creation of trunks by squaring the edges and with flat tops and bottoms, making them perfect for stacking rather than the typical rounded edges that was common for the time. In doing so Vuitton bought the frame of an automobile (car chassis) so that he could create his own car and he entrusted this mission to multiple different bodybuilders of cars such as Labourdette, Rothschild and Janteaud. He commissioned them to create an automobile that he could then use to match and design his own car trunks. In the year of 1897, Georges Ferr√©ol Vuitton presented the first prototype of the new trunk that he had created- the Car trunk. He presented his prototype and ideas at multiple automobile trade shows. During George Ferr√©ol's reign over Louis Vuitton, he also created many other trunks such as the 'Perfect Trunk' for men's changing rooms, and the Louis Vuitton Aero Trunk in 1921 to accompany the creation of Helicopter prototypes by his twin sons Jean and Pierre. = The Tumbler Lock = In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most travellers used trunks which were the main produce of Louis Vuitton.. Unfortunately trunks mostly had an easy lock to pick by burglars who recognized the expensive Louis Vuitton trunks and what may possibly be kept inside by its wealthy owner. To combat this Georges and his father Louis in 1886 decided to innovate the lock and create a brand new one. After many years Georges was finally able to patent a lock that was so difficult to pick him and Louis Vuitton invited Harry Houdini to attempt to escape from a Louis Vuitton trunk which had been made with the new lock. Despite Houdini not accepting the challenge, the lock is still effective at its job and the same patented lock is used by Louis Vuitton today in all its trunks. The new lock was coined the revolutionary new 'Tumbler Lock' and contains two spring buckles = VIP Gifts ‚Äì Trunk Vuitton = As with most luxury brands, Louis Vuitton does not offer discount prices or rebates to its customers at all, whether they be new or regular customers. Rather than doing this Georges and his eldest son Gaston-Louis chose to be more generous by gifting loyal and continuing customers with mini Louis Vuitton trunks.. The trunks could not be bought or ordered but were gifts given at the choosing of Georges and were delivered to the client's home. The trunks were covered in the typical LV monogram canvas and began in around 1910. Inside the canvases, Vuitton would put a bouquet of fresh flowers inside. The inside of the trunk would contain a zinc tray so as to prevent any damage from water or moisture from the flowers. Receiving these gifts was considered an honor as they were exclusive and could not be bought. After the flowers died Georges allowed the recipient of the gift to choose how the trunk be recycled- whether it be for sewing material or as a cigarette box he did not care. Louis Vuitton no longer practices this as the brand has a much larger clientele then it did previously and continuing to do this would be expensive. Flower trunks however are still available as part of their hard-sided collection which can be purchased in- store. = Louis Vuitton Book- Le Voyage = During George's tenure at the helm of Louis Vuitton, he began what is now a large part of Louis Vuitton's marketing: Le Voyage books. George created the first travel book published by Louis Vuitton, which has now turned into a 30 city strong collection of travel guides including San Francisco, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Cape Town, Berlin and Amsterdam, and a matching mobile app has also been created. Georges' book was published only in French in 1901 and centered on Paris, with 3 original editions existing each at a length of 294 pages. It is incredibly rare, and has dimensions of 165mm x 255mm, and has a preface written by French Journalist and Anarchist, √âmile Gautier, it's caption translated into English being \\"From the most remote times to the present day\\". The cover of the book was illustrated and signed by French painter and illustrator Charles Henri Pille (1844‚Äì1897) depicting a nineteenth-century love of the Middle Ages, and showing Vuitton as trunk makers.This Champs-Elyse√©s store was opened under the reign of Georges Vuitton. Coco Chanel was a patron of the store.  Personal and Family life  Despite a busy work life heading the now global luxury leather goods brand Louis Vuitton, Georges Vuitton married Josephine Patrelle (1863 -1964) and they were married until his death in 1936. Their children (in chronological order) were Marie Louise, Gaston Louis, the twins Jean and Pierre, and their youngest son Marcel Vuitton. In 1893, a year after founder Louis Vuitton died, Georges and a relative Henry traveled to the United States by boat passing through Ellis Island immigration to travel to the Chicago World Fair to show off their luxury leather goods, making it the first time that Louis Vuitton products were to be displayed and sold outside of France. Records show that Georges and Henry travelled multiple times to the United States passing through the Ellis Island Immigration stop entering the country again in 1897. Whilst he was still alive, Georges' middle children who are twins, Jean and Pierre took their love of flying to a new level by creating 3 prototypes for helicopters., naming them Vuitton-Hubert, Vuitton II and Vuitton III all after their father's famous family name. The helicopters were never formally used but were a display of the Vuitton family's creativity  Death  On 26 October in 1936 in Asni√®res-sur-Seine in France, Georges Ferr√©ol Vuitton died at the age of 79 years old. His wife, Josephine Vuitton (n√©e Patrelle) outlived him and died many years later in 1964 in France. All their children outlived them, with Gaston, the eldest of their sons, taking over the brand after his father's death in 1936, until his own death in 1970 ending the three-generation lead of the Louis Vuitton brand by Vuitton men.

Africa has a population of over 1.2 billion people spread throughout 52 countries.Worldometers.info. (2019). Population of Africa). Retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/africa-population/ The large size and extreme diversity of the continent leads to enormous diversity among the marriage ceremonies and traditions that take place. Marriage ceremonies throughout Africa vary greatly depending on the faith of the individuals. The World Book Encyclopedia states that 40% of Africans identify as Christian while 45% are Muslim.World Book, Inc.,. (2018). The World Book encyclopedia It is common practice in Africa to combine practices of major religions with local religious traditions.Riggs, T. (2006). Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations. P. 1. This is evident in marriage ceremonies where both Islamic and Christian marriages will also follow traditional practices adopted from tribal communities or smaller religions. The wedding is an exceptionally respected tradition within Africa due to their deeply rooted appreciation for the notion of family. Many African communities believe marriage is primarily about procreation and providing for children as this is seen as the foundation of society. They are often encouraged against marrying for love or sexual attraction. Diversity of African weddings Due to the sheer size and diversity of Africa, wedding customs vary greatly not just between countries but between local communities. There is a growing trend among African communities where wedding ceremonies and marriage processes are blending traditional customs with modern practices. This is evident throughout many locations within Africa, where Catholic and Islamic followers will participate in traditional customs as well as ones typical to their religion. The diversity of traditional beliefs throughout the country leads to enormous diversity among African communities. Despite this, there are also many similarities between African weddings and the customs that surround them. Ceremony and traditions The various marriage ceremonies performed in Africa begin with the initial introduction between the groom and bride. The Yoruba call this ‚ÄòMo mi i mo e‚Äô (know me and let me know you) while the Igbo call it ‚ÄòIkutu aka n‚Äôulo‚Äô (Knock on the door). The family is typically involved within this process. Within many African communities, such as Nigerian ethnic groups, the engagement is where the traditional practices are performed.Solanke, S., Ayodabo, S. (2017). Contemporary Marriage Processes in Nigeria: Willing Love, Perilous Business, Post-Marriage Problems. Modern Research Studies: An International Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 4. 339-361 It consists of an elaborate ceremony with heavy involvement from both families. The families dress in traditional and often colourful attire. It is common for the families to choose a colour to abide to in their dress code. The ceremony is typically held at the Bride's house. It is here that payment from the groom's family to the bride's is made and wedding rings are exchanged. Traditional customs relevant to the specific community are performed during this engagement ceremony, while the more modern marital customs will be performed at the religious wedding ceremony. The wedding will consist of more modern marital customs relevant to the religion of the participants families. Examples of this include the exchange of marital vows and modern wedding attire being worn by the bride and groom. African weddings often consist of modern Islamic/Christian ceremonies whilst intertwining traditional African beliefs and practices. An example of this is the common practice of bridewealth in Africa, particularly among the Zulu people. Bridewealth is when a groom's family pays the bride's family in traditional forms such as livestock, food and clothing to confirm the marriage. In modern practice, the payment is typically in forms of cash. To many Africans, bridewealth is considered to be a crucial part of a marriage ceremony and the marriage will not be acknowledged until the bridewealth has been paid.Posel, D., & Rudwick, S. (2014). Marriage and Bridewealth (Ilobolo) in Contemporary Zulu Society. African Studies Review, 57, pp 51-72 doi:10.1017/asr.2014.47 While this is not a custom of Islamic or Christian marriage, many Africans adopt the traditional practice into their communities creating a strong link between their primary religion and their traditional and cultural beliefs. Enormous economic growth within the continent has caused the bridewealth payment to inflate so significantly that many couples are now straying from the tradition, instead opting for other forms of marriage.Jean-Baptiste, R., & Burrill, E. (2019). LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND FAMILIES IN AFRICA. In Achebe N. & Robertson C. (Eds.), Holding the World Together: African Women in Changing Perspective (pp. 275-293). Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press. The amount of bridewealth that a family is able to pay serves as an icon of her family's social status and indicates how much the family will be able to support the groom's. Bridewealth is seen as a form of ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù for the bride's family, as they know that if economic hardship entails they are able to rely on the groom's family to care of them. Some academics believe bridewealth leads to marriage stability, as the bride's family will put pressure on the daughter to remain in the marriage if the payment made was of significant value.Ogbu, J. (1978). African Bridewealth and Women's Status. American Ethnologist, 5(2), 241-262. In contrast to this practice, other African communities such as many Moroccan ethnic groups participate in a marital custom known as ‚Äúdowry‚Äù. This is where the bride inherits gifts from her family with the purpose of using them within her new home. Examples of traditional marriage customs within Africa can be seen when analyzing the Yoruba people of Nigeria. The Yoruba integrate many traditional Yoruba marriage customs (such as arranged marriages and bridewealth) into their Christian and Islamic ceremonies.Ogoma, D. (2014). Reflection on an African Traditional Marriage System. Journal of Social Sciences and Public Affairs, 4(1), 94-104. Marriage to this ethnic group is seen to be the foundation of their society rather than a bond between two people expressing love for one another. They are taught from a young age that marriage is about responsibility and providing to their society by having children. Children are taught through folktales that families built on love and attraction risk damaging the foundation of their community. It is cemented into their culture that marriage is about procreation and providing the child with an environment in which they can thrive. It is of traditional belief that the child does not know when he is ready to marry, therefore the parents will make the decision for them. The Yoruba teach proverbs such as ‚Äú‚ÄúBi omode ba to loko, aa fun loko, bi o ba to l‚Äôada, aa fun l‚Äôada‚Äù which translates to ‚Äúwhen a child is ripe for hoe, he is given a hoe, if he is ripe for cutlass, he is given cutlass‚Äù. When the parents believe the child is ‚Äúripe‚Äù for marriage, they will begin the process of seeking out a wife, often without the child knowing. The wife will also be sent a school where she is educated on her roles as a wife and importance of marriage. The traditional beliefs of the Yoruba share some similarities with traditional Catholic marriages, such as the wife being expected to remain a virgin until she is married. Marriage to the Yoruba was not focused on love but rather on structure and order. Some African academics have argued that this is a strong foundation for a society and that it is the woman's role to attend to household duties. This standpoint is particularly polarizing and has not been backed up by scientific data. The West African people of Ghana participate in marital customs that differ greatly from many other African countries. Generally, the woman would not live with her husband and would remain living with her parents.Omari, T. (1960). Changing Attitudes of Students in West African Society toward Marriage and Family Relationships. The British Journal of Sociology, 11(3), 197-210. doi:10.2307/586746 The married couple would have fairly minimal interaction with one another, to such an extent that the wife would often refer to her husband as the father of her sons name. This form of relationship emphasizes the importance of marriage towards social stability and minimizes the significance of the bond between the husband and wife. Due to Africa's expansive diversity, marriages within the continent are not limited to previously mentioned forms of marriage. Throughout the continent many individuals are electing for non-traditional forms of marriage that do not abide to traditional African marriage customs or more modern religious customs. This includes marriages performed in front of a registrar, bypassing the religious and traditional aspects of marriage entirely and instead opting for a simplified process which still provides the legal benefits of marriage. Some African couples are opting to bypass the legal marriage status entirely and alternatively having irregular unions as a symbol of their love and connection. Some academics believe this may not be a choice, but rather the outcome of current living conditions within the continent.Mitchell, P. (1954). The Survey of African Marriage and Family Life. Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, 24(2), 149-156. Many Africans are unable to produce the money required to fund a traditional wedding and pay dowry. They may perform their own simplified ceremonies as a response to their economic conditions. Other Africans are unable to participate in tribal or community centric ceremonies as they are required to move far from their community for employment. These irregular unions are performed when travelling back to their community was unrealistic or unachievable. The significance of marriage forming the foundation of a community is made obsolete if the couple were no longer a part of this community. Changing attitudes among Africans Africa is going through a rapid state of change and development, both in an economic sense and a social sense. Alongside this comes a shift in attitude towards marriage and relationships. Studies performed on students within Ghana showed strong evidence suggesting that young people within Africa are drawn towards civil or religious marriages as opposed to traditional marriages. The study revealed that men were more likely to want a traditional marriage than women. Polygamy is heavily integrated into traditional Ghanaian marriage. The study also revealed that 73% of young people surveyed believe that polygamy is an outdated process. The results also show that 87% of students believe love is the most important factor of marriage, despite that in traditional Ghanaian culture, marriage and love share a relatively loose connection. Within Ghana, it is common for the maternal uncle to pay dowry. 90% of surveyed students disagreed with this practice, believing the father should pay the dowry and pay for the costs of the child (such as education). A large majority of these students defended their answer by stating that everyone has a father while not everyone has an uncle. The researchers believe this may be due to a lack of support from their uncles with only 22% of students stating that their uncle had helped them throughout their education. The results show a dramatic shift away from traditional beliefs within African communities, with young people holding more progressive attitudes towards relationships and marriage. The rapid economic advancement of Africa is having an enormous impact on the youth and the attitudes they hold towards marriage. Clothing Nigerian wedding attire To most African populations, clothing is a significant part of the engagement ceremony and the religious marriage ceremony. The wedding attire worn during these ceremonies depends heavily on the ethnic group being examined. Traditional African clothing is typically vibrant and colourful. These forms of attire are worn to integrate traditional African dress with modernized religious weddings. Catholic African communities most commonly dress in western wedding attire (white dress for women and a suit for men) for the religious ceremony and will utilize their communities‚Äô traditional attire for other phases of the marriage process.

The type locality was collected off Imasaki, Okago, Hachijo-jima Island, Izu Islands at a depth of .  Description and feeding  It reaches a length of 1.6 cm, and contains 28 tail rings, 14 dorsal fin rays, 9 pectoral fin rays, and 4 subdorsal rings. It is the size of a jellybean, and its coloration is made for hiding in algae- covered reefs, clinging to soft corals while feeding on plankton. It has a pair of wing-like protrusions on its neck; unlike other species, it contains only one pair instead of two, and is the only seahorse in the world known to have a bony ridge running down its back. Taxonomic history In 2013, after completing his PhD on the biology of the Bargibant's and Denise's pygmy seahorses, Richard Smith went to a fish biology conference in Okinawa in 2013, after which he photographed the Japanese pygmy seahorse on several dives off of Hachijo-jima, one of the Izu Islands about 180 miles from Tokyo. There he found about a dozen specimens. The species description was published by Short and colleagues in a 2018 issue of ZooKeys; it was based on one female holotype, a male and a female paratype, and two photographs of additional specimens. The holotype and one paratype were deposited at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington; the other paratype was deposited at the Kagoshima University Museum. Short and colleagues proposed Japanese pygmy seahorse as the English and Japanese common names for the species. The specific epithet comes from its colloquial Japanese name: Japan Pig or Japapigu.

He was sometimes referred to as Goffredo Tedesco (Goffredo the German).  Biography  Little is known about his early life, except that he was born in Cologne. He wandered about through numerous Italian cities, including Naples and Genoa; arriving in Rome around 1615. There, he became an assistant to Agostino Tassi, a harsh master who attacked him with blows from a club and was briefly imprisoned in 1616, when Wals filed a complaint. The following year, he lived with the newly arrived Massimo Stanzione, in the Roman quarter of Trastevere. From 1620 to 1622, Claude Lorrain was an occasional student of his. In 1623, he was back in Genoa with Antonio Travi as his student. Most of his works were in small format, often circular and painted on copper. His interest in composition and lighting is very marked and often bears resemblance to the works of Filippo Napoletano, who was in turn a follower of Adam Elsheimer. Few works of his have come down to us. His Catalogue raisonn√© contains only twenty-five works that have been definitely identified as painted by him. In comparison, it is known that, in 1634, the Belgian-born merchant, Gaspard De Roomer (c.1600-1674) of Naples, owned sixty of his landscapes and fourteen drawings.

She is known for using unusual media such as fabric and lace to create her pieces.  Biography  Alicia Creus was born in 1939 in La Plata, Argentina. She grew up writing poetry and sculpting. This would have a huge effect on the rest of her work. Many of her pieces were based on poetry, or included verses in the art. In 1976, the president of Argentina was overthrown during a right-wing military coup. In the ensuing years, thousands of people would be \\"disappeared\\" by the government. To flee the unrest, Creus left the country and moved to New York City. She studied art at multiple schools in New York, before becoming a professor of painting at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro in 1991.  Education  While in Argentina, Creus attended the Escuela Nacional Normal de San Fernando and the Universidad de Buenos Aires. After moving to New York, she studied painting at the New York Studio School in Greenwich and The Art Student's League in New York.  Artwork  At first, Creus focused her efforts into poetry and writing. After she moved to New York in the late 70s, she became interested in the study of color and began painting organic subjects like flowers and fruits. The New York Times likened her pieces in the \\"Beyond the Surface\\" exhibition to paintings done by Matisse in Morocco and Nice. In the 1990s, she changed her style again and began using fabric to create her paintings. Many records of her work are of these fabric and textile pieces. She frequently implements poetry and verses from other poets in her pieces. = The Vel√°zquez Series = The Vel√°zquez Series is a collection of two of Creus' works, where she aimed to recreate parts of the influential 17th century painting \\"Las Meninas\\" by Diego Vel√°zquez. She focuses on two figures central to Vel√°zquez's original painting: the Infanta princess and the Dwarf Marib√°rbola. In the first work, \\"The Desires of Marib√°rbola\\", Creus uses embroidery, fabric, and lace to recreate the image of the old court dwarf. In the background of the piece, embroidered a quote from Argentinian poet Alfonsina Storni as a message from the dwarf to Diego Vel√°zquez: ‚ÄúEsp√≠ritu divino, que de mi nada sabes... No podrias tomarme en tus manos suaves, y decirme en voz baja, desdichada cr√≠ature?‚Äù Translated to English, the quote says ‚ÄúDivine spirit who knows nothing about me... Couldn‚Äôt you hold me in your soft hands, and whisper to me, unfortunate creature?‚Äù The second work, \\"The Princess and her Keeper\\", she uses similar materials including linen, artificial flowers, and other fabrics to create the image of the Princess. In the original painting, the princess was the then 5-year-old Margeret Theresa, daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. In Creus' rendition, the princess symbolizes the \\"wishes of all girls to become princesses\\". She embroidered a verse from Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o: \\"The princess is sad, what ails the princess. Sighs escape from her strawberry mouth.\\" = The Dark Series = The alternate title of Creus' \\"Dark Series\\" is \\"a Oscuridad es otro Sol\\", or \\"Darkness is another Sun\\". This was based on the title of a series of stories by Olga Orozco, an Argentinean poet. This series of artworks are entirely black and white. Creus used handmade black paper and created figures using white crayon and layers of fabrics. Creus combined multiple pieces of paper asymmetrically to form a whole image from its component parts.

Trujillo began dancing at an early age. She studied ballet under Tamara Grigorieva until joining the Elsa Vallarino dance group. Trujillo also studied music at the Kolischer Conservatory. In 1962, Trujillo moved to New York to study modern dance from Martha Graham and Jose Limon. In 1964, she completed her academic training at the Schola Cantorum in Paris. Trujillo then joined the Karin Waehner company, and began choreographing dances. she began experimenting with music, dance, and painting to create a multidisciplinary act. By 1966, Trujillo was back in Uruguay. During this period, he found her work censored by the government of Jorge Pacheco Areco, which did not appreciate modern dance. In 1972, Trujillo left the country, spending time in Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Venezuela and Spain. In 1985, after the end of the military dictatorship, she returned to Uruguay. In the 1990s, Trujillo switched from dance to theatre work, teaching at University of Music . She received up a degree from the Eutonia of Buenos Aires, where she would later teach.

It aimed to show the experiences of Uruguayan women by using their testimonies and archives. Moreover, Trujillo's activism extends to the evolution of dance and freedom of expression, something that was heavily censored in Uruguay due to the dictatorship.

Vargas also traveled to other countries where she would practice and pursue her art career. Her main areas of study for art were performance and photography. She traveled to countries such as the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Puerto Rico.  Biography  Eugenia Vargas is a Chilean born in Chillan, Chile (1949). She expanded her education from Chile to the United States of America. Vargas continued her studies at the Montana Institute of Arts, where she would later have her own solo exhibition. Vargas also traveled to Mexico and other Latin American countries to display her artwork in other exhibitions. While in Mexico, her art and message were not well received. Members of the Consejo Mexicano de Fotografia did not acknowledge her work as photographs. After living in Mexico and displaying her art in several exhibitions throughout many Latin American countries she moved back to Chile in 2008. She currently resides in Miami, Florida as if 2018.  Career  Vargas career began with her first solo exhibition in Montana at the University Center Gallery. Her main forms of art are installations, photographs, videos, and performance where she discusses topics such as birth, life, feminism and environmentalism. Vargas uses the human body (nude) and other organic materials to create these pieces and is inspired by her personal connections to these issues that she witness growing up. Many of her works are done in a series for the sole purpose that it helps her organize and create the a narrative to get her point across. Her work has been displayed at the Hammer at UCLA, in Santa Cruz, various museums in California and Miami. As well as many exhibitions across Latin America, even Australia.  Artwork  = Las Chicas Buenas No Disparan, 2006 = This artwork is a series of photographs containing a woman in red with a gun. Being one of her most recent works her goal was to play with the way that women were depicted by creating new stereotypes of them. This work of art comes after a previous series she had created which also had a woman in red. As well as bringing light the play of stereotypes she also used weapons to evoke the conversation of the challenges and issues that guns have evoked. By combining both weapons and women she is able to create the discussion of the threat that women continuously deal with when it comes to violence. By placing the women in red articulates this sense of empowerment with the gun adding to it. = Untitled, Digital C-Print = This series is inspired from the story \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and other essays written by Tracy Williams. The essays spoke about the importance of fairytales and how they caution people through these made-up stories, about bigger issues. By placing her female subject in red to reference back to the Little Red Riding hood. Vargas's goal here is to bring light to the issues of cannibalism, abjection, and sexuality. Those same issues that she is displaying throughout the series were issues seen in the fairytale of the Little Red Riding Hood.  Collections  Vargas' work has been held at the Hammer at UCLA (2017).

Jernigan (1952 ‚Äì June 5, 1991) was an American multimedia artist, graphic designer, and set designer, instrumental in the avant-garde art scenes of Provincetown and New York City in the late 1970s and 1980s. She is best known for her vivid collages of found objects she described as \\"rejectamenta\\", presented in diagrams to absurd effect. Jernigan is also known for having designed the covers and jackets of dozens of music albums and books as a colleague of Paul Bacon. Biography Born in Miami in 1952, Jernigan graduated from Miami Palmetto High School in 1969 before attending the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and first worked as a set and costume designer in Provincetown, Massachusetts before 1975. She was described by realist painter and friend Lisbeth Firmin as an influential figure in the town's arts scene, being extensively involved in its theatre and the Provincetown Art Association. Alec Wilkinson would describe her in a 1994 reflection on her time in Provincetown as witty, withdrawn, and modest in promoting her work. She kept a large macaw named Jack, and spent much of her evenings trying new studies of landscape painting and still lifes. Maintaining contact with Firmin and others who moved there, Jernigan moved back to New York in 1980, where she would take up work as a set designer for a dance company, and designed and illustrated dozens of covers for books and albums. She met Philip Glass in 1981 on a flight from Amsterdam to New York, and during their relationship would go on to design several of his album covers including The Photographer, Dance (Nos. 1-5), and In the Upper Room, among others. Within a few years she had moved in with Glass in his rowhouse in the East Village, helping to raise his children from his first marriage, Juliet and Zachary. Although identified as his third wife, the couple would spend the majority of their relationship as cohabitants, before marrying in 1991. Jernigan died the same year of liver cancer at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, following a prolonged period of illness, having only been correctly diagnosed within weeks of her death. Following her death, a memorial fund for granting awards to dance choreographers and creators was set up in her name; her work would largely remain in storage in her Manhattan basement studio through the 1990s until the posthumous collection of her work Evidence: the Art of Candy Jernigan, was released in 1999. Sponsorship for performing arts projects, as well as exhibition of her work has been in recent years managed by The Candy Jernigan Foundation for the Arts, under Philip Glass's Aurora Music Foundation. * Art career Early sketch by Jernigan when she was art director of Provincetown Magazine for \\"beautifying\\" the Pilgrim Monument, along with her pseudonym \\"Cindy Jeroniga\\", 1977 While in Provincetown, Jernigan would serve as a set designer, and board member for the Provincetown Art Association and Museum and Provincetown Theater Company, as well as art director for Provincetown Magazine. One of the earliest exhibitions of her work was at the East End Gallery in 1977, operated by fellow artist Allegra Printz. Moving to New York city in 1980, Jernigan went to on establish herself as a book designer over the next decade of her career, working for noted book designer Paul Bacon, introduced to her by Laurie Dolphin. In her own artwork Jernigan would work with several different mediums, including watercolors, oil painting, pastels, and mixed media such as Xerox art. A contributing member of the International Society of Copier Artists, her work was featured in multiple issues of its quarterly, including its first \\"bookworks\\" edition, an annual issue made up of separate booklets by different artists. Among her most notable works in mixed media were her \\"trash archivist\\" works, with several comprising New York City garbage including wrappers, packaging, and drug paraphernalia such as needles, vials, and caps. Jernigan would dub such objects \\"rejectaments\\" or \\"rejectamenta\\", items which have lost purpose or are disposable, with her work described contemporarily by a reporter for The Morning Call as \\"a glorification of the insignificant... rather to serve as evidence of our being. [Jernigan] creates unwanted relics of a society that wishes to be remembered on a much grander scale and not in the ordinary sense of its most basic ideas.\\" These found object works include Found Dope, Found Dope II, and Box O' Roaches, the latter being several of the insects mounted on velvet, in a 1989 New York Magazine interview, Jernigan would characterize the piece‚Äì \\"I wanted them to look regal\\". Another example of the use of bugs in her work was her 1985 piece, Dead Bug Book; upon returning to her and Glass's summer cottage in Cape Breton, Jernigan found the house to be overrun with bug corpses, and rather than throwing them out took the time to collect and draw them for her work. Following her diagnosis with liver cancer, she spent her last weeks developing a seldom-exhibited series of pieces, called Vessels, painting more than 80 watercolor on paper paintings in a span of 2 weeks. The series, features Greco-Roman vases and other simpler containers placed on colorful stages expressing different tones and characteristics about the spaces the objects occupied. Candy Jernigan's work has been featured in the Dance Theater Workshop in 1985 and 1989, at the Bronx Museum and Lumen Travo in 1987, and posthumously in McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, Provincetown Art Association and Museum in 2002, and at the Greene Naftali Gallery in 2014. Her work is included in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.

It was recorded between 2007 and 2016 at The Stone in New York City, and was released in March 2019 by Intakt Records in Switzerland. Frith performed in 80 concerts at The Stone between 2006 and 2016 and Intakt called this collection \\"A decade-long adventure in improvisation\\". The titles of the songs are derived from The New York Times headlines on the day of each performance. The box set's liner notes are a 24-page booklet written by Frith, which includes an interview with Frith conducted by one of the performers, Theresa Wong. Remarking on this collection, Wong said: > I was struck by the musicality. What I mean by that is: there's this > presence of songs and song forms ‚Äì the music can be harmonic and melodic, > there's noise, there's rhythm, a joyfulness, an exploration, a sensuality of > sounds, but always underlining that is a musicality that feels to me like > songs. Reception Reviewing All Is Always Now in NZZ am Sonntag, the weekend edition of the Swiss newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Manfred Papst referred to Frith as a \\"wild guy\\" (wilder Kerl) who loves to experiment with noise and sound. He called the selection of concerts from The Stone featured on this triple-CD \\"a sensation\\", and was surprised at just how many different styles of music Frith and his collaborators play. Writing in The New York City Jazz Record, Mark Keresman described the sounds in the box set as an assortment of \\"jubilant [and] whimsical noise\\", \\"droning\\" and \\"song-like tapestries\\". The found and homemade instruments Frith and Tewari use on their tracks produce \\"a roughhewn, amiably dissonant collage of sonic shards (dis)assembled for the sheer joy of it\\". Keresman said some of the pieces sound like \\"the soundtrack to a movie thriller yet to be made\\". On \\"Evidence\\" Frith and Anderson produce notes that \\"build and release tension\\" like \\"an Ennio Morricone film score\\". Georges Tonla Briquet remarked on the Belgian jazz website, JazzHalo that the only thread linking the collection's diverse tracks is that the music is completely unrehearsed and improvised. He said while there is plenty of noise and unusual sounds, there are many quiet and delicate sections. He found it \\"claustrophobic\\" at times, but also \\"surprisingly transparent\\". Briquet added that the album is long and even \\"seasoned fans\\" may find it a little excessive.

He earned a PhD in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University before studying under Linus Pauling at California Institute of Technology and becoming a professor at Dartmouth College. After World War II, he joined the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis where he continued his work with X-ray diffraction and retired in 1978. Chemistry studies Lindsay Helmholz was born in Chicago on November 11, 1909, the son of Henry Helmholz and his wife Isabel Lindsay. He had two brothers, Henry Frederic and August Carl Helmholz, and a sister, Margaret. He entered Cornell University in 1926, and graduated two years later. He then went to Johns Hopkins University, where he submitted his PhD thesis on \\"Lattice energies of rubidium bromide and sodium chloride and electron affinities of their halogens\\" in 1933, writing under the supervision of Joseph E. Mayer. He was one of the few students of Mayer who was an experimental rather than a theoretical chemist. He investigated the Born‚ÄìHaber cycle in order to determine the electron affinity of fluorine. Helmholz was a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow from 1934 to 1936, and he studied crystallography at the California Institute of Technology, working under Linus Pauling. After his fellowship ended, he became an instructor there. Pauling attempted to secured Helmholz a more permanent position, at Duke University. He wrote to Paul Gross at Duke, describing Helmholz as \\"one of our best men.\\" Unsuccessful in this attempt, he then wrote to Elden B. Hartshorn at Dartmouth College: This approach was ultimately successful, and Helmholz moved to Dartmouth College in 1941 as an assistant professor. He created his own X-ray apparatus in order to continue his research into crystallography. World War II and later career During World War II, Helmholz worked on the Manhattan Project at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. He was part of the committee that oversaw the RaLa Experiments, and worked out the chemical procedures for separating of lanthanum-140 from barium chloride. He was also involved with the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor in which the nuclear fuel is dissolved in water. Helmholz conducted experiments with various compounds to find a suitable salt for use in this reactor. His experiments narrowed the choice to uranium sulfate and uranium nitrate, and the former was ultimately chosen because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. After the war ended, Joseph W. Kennedy, the wartime head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Division at Los Alamos, became the head of the chemistry department at Washington University in St. Louis, and he recruited Helmholz, who was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1945. Helmhoz brought his X-ray diffractometer with his from Dartmouth, and resumed his research into X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. He became an associate professor in 1948, and a professor in 1957. A 1952 paper with his student Max Wolfsberg on \\"The spectra and electronic structure of the tetrahedral ions , , and \\" is today considered to represent \\"the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way chemists approached the electronic structure of transition metal complexes\\", and a decade ahead of its time. Helmholz was acting chair of the department from 1963 to 1964, and again from 1976 to 1978. He retired in 1978, and died on March 17, 1993.

Location  The Boulevard Poniatowski starts at the Quai de Bercy and goes through Porte de Charenton, before ending at Porte Dor√©e and Avenue Dumesnil, where it is continued by Boulevard Soult. Boulevard Poniatowski was accessible through the Petite Ceinture bus line. It can now be reached through the tramway Line 3, the M√©tro Line 8 (Porte Dor√©e and Porte de Charenton stations), as well as RATP bus lines 29, 46, 87, 109 and 111.  History  The French war department had completed the Thiers wallincluding fortifications, a dry moat, a Rue Militaire and a large bermaround 1840. In 1859, the military engineering service gave conditional control to the Paris city council. The expansion of the land area of Paris in 1860, by annexing bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything without was not. The Thiers wall, with its accompanying berm and moat, led to a profound disruption and complication of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs. Paris city council started upgrading and conversion of some sections of the Rue Militaire into boulevards in 1861, with the (yet unnamed) Boulevard Poniatowski one of the first stretches to open. In 1864, the boulevard was named after Polish-born J√≥zef Poniatowski (1763‚Äì1813), 1st Duke of Dalmatia and Marshal of France. Each section of the upgraded Rue Militaire was then named for a marshal of the First French Empire (1804‚Äì1814) who served under Napoleon I, leading to the entire ring being collectively called the Boulevards of the Marshals. The Boulevards of the Marshals concept was almost fully realized by 1932, though the final three sections, closing the ring, would not be completed until 2005. Of the 22 boulevards, 19 have been named for Poniatowski or one of his fellow First Empire marshals.

The erosion of the outcrop resulted in a set of openings in the rocks wide enough to be exploited by humans. Several archaeological studies have been conducted within the cave, which give insights into the duration of Neanderthal presence on the Iberian Peninsula and to the presence of carnivorous animals during the Paleolithic. The cave consists of a narrow passage about 13 metres long and one metre wide, with a chamber at the end that is about two metres wide. First officially explored in 1965‚Äì66 by the Portuguese Speleological Society, it was surveyed in 1976 by the Grupo para o Estudio do Paleolitico Portugues (Group for the Study of the Portuguese Palaeolithic) and at the end of the 1980s by Prof. Jo√£o Zilh√£o. About half of the accessible area of the cave has been studied. The stratigraphic profile carried out by Zilh√£o identified six layers to a depth of about 1.4 metres. The upper layer (Layer A), which was only observed at the end of the cave, is indicative of probable use for funerals. Layer 1 contained a mixture of modern and Pleistocene items while Layer 2 contained artifacts of the Upper Paleolithic associated with animal remains. Layer 3 also had animal remains but with distinct colouration, possibly caused by manganese oxides. There were few archaeological materials in Layer 4 and Layer 5 was archaeologically sterile. The limestone outcrop in which the cave is situated Zilh√£o's research using radiocarbon dating looked for evidence of Neanderthals during the late Aurignacian period (37000-33000 Before the Present). He believed his excavations established a secure terminus ante quem of 34500 years BP for the demise of Neanderthals in the area, although more recent research by Zilh√£o and others suggests it was earlier than that. This has important implications for the interpretation of the anatomy of the Lapedo child, a complete skeleton found by Zilh√£o near Leiria in Portugal and believed to be the result of interbreeding between a Neanderthal and a modern human. The dating of the last of the region's Neanderthals to five millennia before the child was borne counters suggestions that Neanderthals could have survived in southwest Iberia until as late as the Last Glacial Maximum (26500 BP). Crossbreeding between immediate ancestors has to be ruled out and the Neanderthal features of the child must represent admixture at the time of contact. Zilhao also considered that his findings had implications for the idea that Neanderthals remained in the Gibraltar area until ca.32-28000 BP. He believed that, as hunter-gatherers living at low population densities, residual Neanderthals could not have survived for several millennia as a separate biological entity. Work by Maria Jo√£o Valente analysed the fauna of Layers 1 and 2 associated with the Upper Paleolithic. She noted that the cave contained bones of humans, together with those of wolves, bears, and hyenas, the Iberian lynx and other small carnivores and birds of prey, and their prey such as rabbits. She hypothesised that there would have been competition between humans and animals for use of the cave and noted that the consecutive use of caves by human communities and carnivores had been identified elsewhere. However, an alternative interpretation was that human groups could have carried animal bones into the caves.

Image copyrighted by the CPRE Ethel Haythornthwaite (1894‚Äì1986) was an English environmental campaigner, and a pioneer of the countryside movement. She founded the group that would go on to become the Friends of the Peak District, aimed at protecting the countryside of the Peak District from development. She forefronted the appeal to save the 747-acre Longshaw Estate from development, and helped acquire land around Sheffield that became its green belt. She was appointed to the UK government‚Äôs National Parks Committee, and helped to make the successful case for the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act of 1949, which led to the founding of the Peak District National Park in 1951. She also helped make green belts part of government policy in 1955. Early life Born Ethel Mary Bassett Ward, she was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Thomas W. Ward, who built his family a large mansion on Endcliffe Vale Road in Sheffield, Yorkshire. Haythornthwaite grew up in a life of privilege. During the First World War, she married Henry Burrows Gallimore (in February 1916, when she was 22). In May 1917 Captain Gallimore was killed in the fighting in France. Devastated by his death, she became ill, and her family encouraged her to take restorative walks in the countryside. Countryside protection Gallimore soon became enamoured of the rural beauty surrounding the city of Sheffield, and decided to apply herself to protecting the countryside from development and urban sprawl. In 1924 she founded the Sheffield Association for the Protection of Rural Scenery, also known as the Sheffield Association for the Protection of Local Countryside, which in 1927 became the Peak District and South Yorkshire branch of the CPRE (Council for the Preservation of Rural England, later renamed Campaign to Protect Rural England). She was to be secretary of the branch for 56 years from its inception. In 1928 Gallimore spearheaded an urgent appeal to the Yorkshire public, which helped Peak District and South Yorkshire CPRE to raise the funds to buy the 747-acre Longshaw Estate, which was threatened with development. The Estate was gifted to the National Trust in 1931. In 1932 she helped acquire a further 448 acres of threatened land at Blacka Moor. In 1938 this became part of Sheffield's Green Belt (the first to be created in England). She also was instrumental in the purchase and protection of other rural areas including Whirlow Moor, Dore Moor, Dovedale, and many other surrounding rural areas. In 1937 she married Lt Colonel Gerald Graham George Haythornthwaite (1912‚Äì1995), another passionate campaigner for the countryside, who worked with her on many of her later projects. Haythornthwaite wrote, at the start of World War 2 when many of her fellow CPRE administrators were away on active service: \\"Unquestionably, CPRE and all its branches should strive their best to hold on. If not, much more of England‚Äôs beauty will be lost for those who return after the war. I believe our aims are too profoundly important to let go. Those who see what rural England means to the English should work to save it.\\" Haythornthwaite spent most of 1942 in London, \\"leading the national organisation in the crucial early debates on how the post-war reconstruction of the country should be achieved by democratic planning\\". In 1945, Haythornthwaite was appointed to the UK government‚Äôs National Parks Committee, and her hard work there helped to deliver the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. Much to her delight, and in no small part due to her endeavours, in 1951 the Peak District National Park became the UK's first national park. In 1955 Haythornthwaite helped form national government policy on Green Belts. She stressed their importance to city dwellers: \\"My childhood impressions of the city were a gloomy, noisy, shapeless phenomenon. But outside the city ‚Äì there one began to live. The escape into clean air, the gradual return to nature ‚Äì with this came satisfaction, peace, freedom, solitude, excitement. One grew to become conscious of its profounder value, something beyond health and high spirits ‚Äì something to worship.\\" Haythornthwaite died in 1986; her second husband Gerald died in 1995. Legacy In his introduction to the 2001 book Protecting the Beautiful Frame by Melvyn Jones, Sir Chris Bonington wrote ‚ÄúWhatever else is forgotten, the Branch [Peak District and South Yorkshire branch of the CPRE] will go down in history as a major force in environmental conservation because of the achievement of its two ‚Äògrand purposes‚Äô: the designation of a national park in the Peak District and the creation of a permanent Sheffield Green Belt. But there were so many more equally successful campaigns in the wider countryside and urban fringe that the reader gasps with admiration. And at the head of this crusading society for so long, the tireless, single-minded, and selfless Ethel and Gerald Haythornthwaite were without parallel. We shall not see the likes of Ethel and Gerald again.‚Äù In celebration of Britain's first National Park, the Friends of the Peak District launched the Peak District Boundary Walk on 17 June 2017. The route broadly follows the park's boundary, as envisaged by Ethel and Gerald. As part of the 2018 Heritage Open Days in Sheffield, two talks were given about Haythornthwaite's life and work. On 7 April 2019 Haythornthwaite and her important work in the Peak District and around Sheffield was featured in the BBC1 television programme Countryfile.

An enhanced CD version was released next year. It was the first Polish RTS game and has been since described as a cult classic in Poland. It was followed by Polanie II in 2003. The planned third game, Polanie 3, eventually turned into an unrelated action RPG Two Worlds. A canceled remake of the original has been in development during the 2010s.  Gameplay  The game offered 25 missions, based around the plot of fictional Polan tribal leader Mirek, who returns from an expedition to his hometown only to find it in ruins. Throughout the game, Mirek will try to rebuild his country, defeat enemies, and conquer new lands. The game has fantasy elements, including magic and spell-wielding units. The game economy is based around a single resource, milk, produced by cows which roam regenerating grasslands (therefore unlike some other games, the resources in Polanie can never be exhausted). Military units are expensive to produce, and battles often involve only a few units on each side.  Development and release  Polanie was designed by a team of several young Poles headed by Miros≈Çaw Dymek, developed by MDF and released by Hurtownia Oprogramowania USER. When they were designing the game, Dymek and the developer team were students at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w. They did not expect to profit from game sales, but instead saw the game as an entry in their portfolio. The game was released on floppy disk. An enhanced edition in 1997 was released on CD-ROM, adding new missions (five new scenarios in addition to the one from the base game) and new units. The game was released in Polish, Czech (as Osadnici) and German (as VICTORY). An unofficial English mod called Slaves for the floppy disk version of the game was rumored to exist at one time.  Reception  The game received the award for Best Debut during the 1996 Play-Box trade show in Katowice. Reviews praised innovative and amusing elements, such as the presence of animals like cows and bears. The plot of the game was also positively reviewed, and described as interesting, particular due to the fact some missions instead of regular build and conquer required the player to complete specific objectives, such as leading a cow to a sacrificial altar. Several reviewers criticized the simplistic and underwhelming graphics. The lack of multiplayer functionality was also criticized. Legacy While the game sold only 6,000 copies, it was considered a surprisingly good record for that time and place, and the game has been since been described as a cult classic in Poland. There, the game has been frequently compared to the international hit Warcraft from 1994, and while reviewers noted it is not strictly better, Polish fans appreciated the game lore tying it to Polish prehistory and Slavic mythology. In 2003, a sequel, Polanie II for Windows environment, was released. A real-time strategy like its predecessor, it was distributed in English as KnightShift. A second sequel, Polanie 3 or KnightShift 2: Curse of Souls, was announced in 2004. A playable demo was already available in 2004, with plans for a release in 2005. It was to be a role-playing video game, abandoning its real-time strategy roots, for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. The game was never released under that title. The project however did develop into a high fantasy action role-playing game Two Worlds, released in 2007, which itself got a sequel, Two Worlds II, in 2011. While the developer team traced the game's continuity to the 1996 game, very few fans realized the connection between those titles. In 2014, a remake of the original game for Android, iPhone and PC, tentatively titled Polanie Remake, was announced, with a planned release date of 2016 for the 20th anniversary of the original game. It was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2018.

His name, spelled Rosse, first occurs in the Records of the Privy Council in 1674. On the 4th of June, the Council authorised the Lord Chancellor to give orders to parties of that troop of horse of his Majesty's guards, under his command, to apprehend a considerable number of ministers, among whom Ross is included, and offer a reward of a thousand merks to such as should apprehend him.

It was first published in hardback in the United Kingdom in April 2019. It was published in Germany in February 2019 as Die ewigen Toten (). Background The sixth story in the David Hunter series is the first to be set wholly within London. Previous to this, the settings for the stories have been Norfolk, Devon, the Outer Hebrides, Essex and Tennessee. The author, Simon Beckett, was determined to place Hunter in a more urban environment. As the David Hunter series is popular in Europe (especially in Germany), Beckett's novels have been published on the continent before his home country of the United Kingdom. The Scent of Death (Die ewigen Toten) was published in February 2019 and went straight to the number one slot on Germany's book chart. Translation rights have also been granted for the book to be published in Italian, Polish and Russian. Plot David Hunter is asked by the police to come to an abandoned and derelict hospital (St Jude‚Äôs) in London. A mummified corpse has been found in a loft space and Hunter's expertise is brought to bear on the case. After a ceiling collapses, a hidden room is revealed which has a further two bodies in it. After making sure that the building is safe, a cadaver dog is brought in to search for more bodies. Those they have found were put into the room after the hospital was closed and were walled up inside with strange torture and burn marks on their bodies. As in other cases, Hunter becomes too involved in the people either directly involved with, or on the fringes of the case. One of the people trying to save the hospital is a barrister who asks Hunter for too much information and is killed in a very suspicious hit-and-run which also wounds a fellow forensic officer on the case. Besides all of this, Hunter has to contend with his girlfriend taking a 3-month job abroad and the spectre of Grace Strachan, a female killer from the second book, still causing him to be jittery as she could be back to get him. Critical reception Barry Forshaw, writing in the Financial Times, praised the book for its \\"avoidance of too much extraneous forensic detail,\\" and described Beckett as being \\"back on form.\\" Marcel Berlins, writing in The Times, said that the novel was \\"arguably the best\\" out of the six written in the series and also described it as \\"a superbly strong read.\\" References External links *Publisher's webpage Dr David Hunter (series) 2019 British novels Novels set in London Bantam Books books ","title":"The Scent of Death"},{"id":"60442436","title":"Sunday (Jessica Mauboy song)"},{"id":"60442457","text":"Proshino () is a rural locality (a village) in Pelymskoye Rural Settlement, Kochyovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Intuitively, it means that any timed propositional temporal logic-formula, or timed automaton or signal automaton using only the constraints of K can not distinguish both vectors. The set of region allows to create the region automaton, which is a directed graph in which each node is a region, and each edge r\\\\to r' ensure that r' is a possible future of r. Taking a product of this region automaton and of a timed automaton \\\\mathcal A which accepts a language L creates a finite automaton or a B√ºchi automaton which accepts untimed L. In particular, it allows to reduce the emptiness problem for \\\\mathcal A to the emptiness problem for a finite or B√ºchi automaton. This technique is used for example by the software UPPAAL.  Definition  Let C=\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\dots,x_d\\\\\\\\} a set of clocks. For each x\\\\in\\\\mathbb N let c_x\\\\in\\\\mathbb N. Intuitively, this number represents an upper bound on the values to which the clock x can be compared. The definition of a region over the clocks of C uses those numbers c_x's. Three equivalent definitions are now given. Given a clock assignment u, [ u] denotes the region in which u belongs. The set of regions is denoted by \\\\mathcal R. = Equivalence of clocks assignment = The first definition allow to easily test whether two assignments belong to the same region. A region may be defined as an equivalence class for some equivalence relation. Two clocks assignments u_1 and u_2 are equivalent if they satisfy the following constraints: * u_1(x)\\\\sim c iff u_2(x)\\\\sim c, for each x\\\\in C and 0\\\\le c\\\\le c_x an integer, and ~ being one of the following relation =, < or ‚â§. * \\\\\\\\{ u_1(x)\\\\\\\\}\\\\sim \\\\\\\\{ u_1(y)\\\\\\\\} iff \\\\\\\\{ u_2(x)\\\\\\\\}\\\\sim \\\\\\\\{ u_2(y)\\\\\\\\}, for each x,y\\\\in C, u_1(x)\\\\le c_x, u_1(y)\\\\le c_y, \\\\\\\\{r\\\\\\\\} being the fractional part of the real r, and ~ being one of the following relation =, < or ‚â§. The first kind of constraints ensures that u_1 and u_2 satisfies the same constraints. Indeed, if u_1(x)=0.5 and u_2(x)=1, then only the second assignment satisfies x=1. On the other hand, if u_1(x)=0.5 and u_2(x)=0.6, both assignment satisfies exactly the same set of constraint, since the constraints use only integral constants. The second kind of constraints ensures that the future of two assignments satisfy the same constraints. For example, let u_1=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mapsto 0.5, y\\\\mapsto 0.6\\\\\\\\} and u_2=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mapsto 0.5, y\\\\mapsto 0.4\\\\\\\\}. Then, the constraint y=1\\\\land x< 1 is eventually satisfied by the future of u_1 without clock reset, but not by the future of u_2 without clock reset. = Explicit definition of a region = While the previous definition allow to test whether two assignments belong to the same region, it does not allow to easily represents a region as a data structure. The third definition given below allow to give a canonical encoding of a region. A region can be explicitly defined as a zone, using a set S of equations and inequations satisfying the following constraints: * for each x\\\\in C, S contains either: ** x=c for some integer 0\\\\le c\\\\le c_x ** x\\\\in(c,c+1) for some integer 0\\\\le c< c_x, ** x> c_x, * furthermore, for each pair of clocks x,y\\\\in C, where S contains constraints of the form x\\\\in (c,c+1) and y\\\\in (c',c'+1), then S contains an (in) equality of the form \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}\\\\sim \\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} with \\\\sim being either =, < or ‚â§. Since, when c and c' are fixed, the last constraint is equivalent to x\\\\sim y+c-c'. This definition allow to encode a region as a data structure. It suffices, for each clock, to state to which interval it belongs and to recall the order of the fractional part of the clocks which belong in an open interval of length 1. It follows that the size of this structure is O\\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\log(c_k)+C\\\\log(C)\\\\right) with C the number of clocks. = Timed bisimulation = Let us now give a third definition of regions. While this definition is more abstract, it is also the reason why regions are used in model checking. Intuitively, this definition states that two clock assignments belong to the same region if the differences between them are such that no timed automaton can notice them. Given any run r starting with a clock assignment u, for any other assignment u' in the same region, there is a run r', going through the same locations, reading the same letters, where the only difference is that the time waited between two successive transition may be different, and thus the successive clock variations are different. The formal definition is now given. Given a set of clock C, two assignments two clocks assignments u_1 and u_2 belongs to the same region if for each timed automaton \\\\mathcal A in which the guards never compare a clock x to a number greater than c_x, given any location \\\\ell of \\\\mathcal A, there is a timed bisimulation between the extended states (\\\\ell, u_1) and (\\\\ell, u_2). More precisely, this bisimulation preserves letters and locations but not the exact clock assignments.  Operation on regions  Some operations are now defined over regions: Resetting some of its clock, and letting time pass. = Resetting clocks = Given a region \\\\alpha defined by a set of (in)equations S, and a set of clocks C'\\\\subseteq C, the region similar to \\\\alpha in which the clocks of C' are restarted is now defined. This region is denoted by \\\\alpha[C'\\\\mapsto 0], it is defined by the following constraints: * each constraints of S not containing the clock x, * the constraints x=0 for x\\\\in C'. The set of assignments defined by \\\\alpha[C'\\\\mapsto 0] is exactly the set of assignments u[C'\\\\mapsto0] for u\\\\in\\\\alpha. = Time-successor = Given a region \\\\alpha, the regions which can be attained without resetting a clock are called the time-successors of \\\\alpha. Two equivalent definitions are now given.  Definition  A clock region \\\\alpha' is a time-successor of another clock region \\\\alpha if for each assignment u\\\\in\\\\alpha, there exists some positive real t_{ u,\\\\alpha'}>0 such that u+t_{ u,\\\\alpha'}\\\\in\\\\alpha'. Note that it does not mean that \\\\alpha+t_{ u,\\\\alpha'}=\\\\alpha'. For example, the region \\\\alpha defined by the set of constraint \\\\\\\\{0< x< 1, 0< y<1, x< y\\\\\\\\} has the time-successor \\\\alpha' defined by the set of constraint \\\\\\\\{0< x< 1, y=1\\\\\\\\}. Indeed, for each u\\\\in\\\\alpha, it suffices to take t_{ u,\\\\alpha'}=1- u(y). However, there exists no real t such that \\\\alpha+t=\\\\alpha' or even such that \\\\alpha+t\\\\subseteq\\\\alpha'; indeed, \\\\alpha defines a triangle while \\\\alpha' defines a segment.  Computable definition  The second definition now given allow to explicitly compute the set of time-successor of a region, given by its set of constraints. Given a region \\\\alpha defined as a set of constraints S, let us define its set of time-successors. In order to do so, the following variables are required. Let T\\\\subseteq S the set of constraints of S of the form x_i=c_i. Let Y\\\\subseteq C the set of clocks y such that S contains the constraint y>c_y. Let Z\\\\subseteq C\\\\setminus Y the set of clocks \\\\\\\\{z\\\\\\\\} such that there are no constraints of the form \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}<\\\\\\\\{z\\\\\\\\} in S. If T is empty, \\\\alpha is its own time successor. If Y=C, then \\\\alpha is the only time-successor of \\\\alpha. Otherwise, there is a least time-successor of \\\\alpha not equal to \\\\alpha. The least time-successor, if T is non-empty, contains: * the constraints of S\\\\setminus T * x_i>c_i, * \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{x_j\\\\\\\\}, and * for each y such that y>c_y does not belong to S, the constraint x_i< y. If T is empty, the least time-successor is defined by the following constraints: * the constraints of S not using the clocks of Z, * the constraint z=c+1, for each constraint c< z< c+1 in S, with z\\\\in Z.  Properties  There are at most C!2^{C}\\\\prod_{x\\\\in C}(2c_x+2) regions, where C is the number of clocks.  Region automaton  Given a timed automaton \\\\mathcal A, its region automaton is a finite automaton or a B√ºchi automaton which accepts untimed L. This automaton is similar to \\\\mathcal A, where clocks are replaced by region. Intuitively, the region automaton is contructude as a product of \\\\mathcal A and of the region graph. This region graph is defined first. = Region graph = The region graph is a rooted directed graph which models the set of possible clock valuations during a run of a timed-autoamton. It is defined as follows: * its nodes are regions, * its root is the initial region \\\\alpha_0, defined by the set of constraints \\\\\\\\{x=0\\\\mid x\\\\in C\\\\\\\\}, * the set of edges are (\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha'[C'\\\\mapsto 0]), for \\\\alpha' a time-successor of \\\\alpha. = Region automaton = Let \\\\mathcal A=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,L_0,C,F,E\\\\rangle a timed automaton. For each clock x\\\\in C, let c_x the greatest number c such that there exists a guard of the form x\\\\sim c in \\\\mathcal A. The region automaton of \\\\mathcal A, denoted by R(\\\\mathcal A) is a finite or B√ºchi automaton which is essentially a product of \\\\mathcal A and of the region graph defined above. That is, each state of the region automaton is a pair containing a loctaion of \\\\mathcal A and a region. Since two clocks assignment belonging to the same region satisfies the same guard, each region contains enough information to decide which transitions can be taken. Formally, the region automaton is defined as follows: * its alphabet is \\\\Sigma, * its set of states is L\\\\times\\\\mathcal R, * its set of states is L_0\\\\times\\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_0\\\\\\\\} with \\\\alpha_0 the initial region, * its set of accepting states is F\\\\times\\\\mathcal R, * its transition relation \\\\delta contains ((\\\\ell,\\\\alpha),a,(\\\\ell',\\\\alpha'[C'\\\\mapsto0])), for (\\\\ell,a,g,C',\\\\ell')\\\\in E, such that \\\\gamma\\\\models\\\\alpha' and \\\\alpha' is a time-successor of \\\\alpha. Given any run r=(\\\\ell_0, u_0)\\\\xrightarrow[t_1]{\\\\sigma_1}(\\\\ell_1, u_1)\\\\dots of \\\\mathcal A, the sequence (\\\\ell_0,[ u_0])\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\sigma_1}(\\\\ell_1,[ u_1])\\\\dots is denoted [r], it is a run of R(\\\\mathcal A) and is accepting if and only if r is accepting. It follows that L(R(\\\\mathcal A))=\\\\operatorname{Untime}(L(\\\\mathcal A)). In particular, \\\\mathcal A accepts a timed-word if and only if R(\\\\mathcal A) accepts a word. Furthermore, an accepting run of \\\\mathcal A can be computed from an accepting run of R(\\\\mathcal A).

Pr√©sentation  The French Institute of Estonia The French Institute of Estonia is part of the French cultural network. Since its creation, it is located at Kuninga, 4 in the heart of the old town of Tallinn. The Institute was inaugurated on 14 May 1992 by Roland Dumas, French Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, in the presence of Jaan Minitski, Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs, M√§rt Kubo, Minister of Culture and Rein Loik, Minister of National Education of the Republic of Estonia.  Objectives of the French Institute  = Promotion of french and francophone literature = An online media library is available to the public since 2014: Cultureth√®que. This digital portal provides access to many resources in French throughout Estonia. The Institute works closely with translators and publishing houses wishing to translate and publish French literature. Translators can submit an application for a grant from the Centre national du livre that will allow them to stay in France to carry out a translation project. = French Language = The teaching of French as a foreign language represents an important part of the Institute's activity; there are nearly 1000 registrations each year. The French Institute offers language courses for all levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), from A1 to C2. The Institute is an accredited official examination centre where it is possible to pass and obtain a French language certification such as DELF-DALF. The teaching of French at the Institute is certified by the Estonian Ministry of Education. The Institute is in relation with all Estonian school that teach French. For Tallinn, this includes : * The Vanalinna Hariduskolleegium (VHK) * The European School of Tallinn * The Gustav Adolf School = Academic and scientific cooperation = The Institute helps Estonian students and researchers when they are conducting research in France. A space is dedicated to Campus France, in the premises of the IFE; it is an information centre for higher education and French courses in France. A permanence is held every week. = Digital cooperation = The creation of a post of cooperation officer for digital innovation in 2016 has made it possible to implement a strategy to promote French expertise in the field of digital and bring together decision-makers and civil society of the two countries. This strategy has 3 objectives: * Raise awareness among the Estonian public of French expertise on promising digital issues in both countries (holding public events, publishing online content, activity on social networks) * Facilitate cooperation between French and Estonian decision-makers (organisation of delegation visits, events with local institutions) * Bring civil societies closer together and facilitate their cooperation  Directors of the French Institute of Estonia  * 1991-1995 : B√©atrice Boillot * 1995-1999 : Catherine Suard * 1999-2003 : Genevi√©ve Ichard * 2003-2007 : Jean-Louis Pelletan * 2007-2011 : Denis Duclos * 2011-2015 : Bernard Paqueteau * 2015- : Anne Chounet-Cambas  See also  * Lyc√©e fran√ßais de Tallinn  References  = External links = * Site web de l'Institut fran√ßais d'Estonie * Cultureth√®que, la m√©diath√®que num√©rique * Ecole europ√©enne de Tallinn, qui ouvre une section fran√ßaise en septembre 2018.

Cliff was elected Bishop in 2015, and consecrated after moving to Brandon in 2016. Cliff, a singer, who played trumpet as a youth, but switched to voice as a student at the University of Western Ontario, has performed at charity fundraising events as a member of a vocal trio of three Anglican priests since the 1990s, the \\"Three Cantors.\\" The group includes Dean Peter Wall and Archdeacon David Pickett. Cliff, who was raised in the Pentecostal Church, where the music \\"grabs you by the soul and shakes you,\\" has said that he discovered his vocation through music when one of his music professors took him to a cathedral. He joined the choir and not long afterward spoke to the dean of the cathedral about attending a seminary. Cliff earned his master of divinity degree in 1992. Cliff attended his local primary school, Wyoming Public, before skipping Grade 8 and attending Lambton Central Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Petrolia from 1979 to 1984.

Born in Isleworth, then in Middlesex, Field grew up in Maidstone in Kent. He joined the National Secular Society, and at one of its local meetings became aware of the Democratic Federation. He joined the organisation, of which he remained a largely inactive member for many years, even joining its successor, the British Socialist Party. He became involved in debating societies, and in 1888 was the founding secretary of the town's Central Debating Society, which he launched with two debates on socialism.Bruce Aubry, \\"Field, Arthur George\\", In the run-up to the 1888 Maidstone by-election, Field worked with George Bateman, Will Parnell and Henry Hyde Champion to found the Maidstone Labour Electoral Association (LEA). The Liberal Party candidate, John Barker, agreed to support a maximum eight hour working day, and on this basis, Field and the LEA supported him. The organisation remained active, and supported a Liberal candidate in the 1889 town council election. Field worked as a photographer, and decided to found a union for the trade. He took advice from Tom Mann, and launched the union at a meeting in London in 1890, but it attracted only fifty members, and was dissolved the following year. Field instead encouraged photographers to join the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, but the union would not agree to take on only qualified photographers, and Field later suggested that photographers join the National Union of Shop Assistants. Having worked with Mann and Champion, Field was active in the London dock strike of 1889, and was elected to the executive of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union, representing the Medway area. Field took little part in the local branches of the union, and by mid-1892, they had all closed. In 1890, Field organised a conference to found a Kent Independent Labour Party. This affiliated to the Legal Eight Hours and International League, and was chaired by Edward Aveling. It sponsored W. C. Steadman as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Mid Kent at the 1892 UK general election, although he was not elected. Field also helped Joseph Burgess found a Labour Club in Leicester. Field attended the 1893 Congress of the Socialist International as a representative of the party. In 1893, he attended the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), representing both Bromley and Leicester. While the Leicester branch had no activity, and Field had no ongoing relationship with it, he was elected to the ILP's first National Administrative Council, as a representative of the Midlands. On the council, Field was a lone voice in support of Champion, and lost his seat at the 1894 conference. He remained active in the ILP, as secretary of otherwise unorganised areas of Kent, and as photographer of its 1897 conference, but remained a supporter of Champion and therefore marginalised in the party. Field served as secretary of the Maidstone and District Trades Council for much of the 1890s until 1902, when he was elected as president. In his new role, he led it to back independent labour candidates, but was accused of working with the Conservative Party to do so, and he resigned in protest in 1903. Instead, he moved to Battersea, where he became the secretary of the South and East of England Trades and Labour Councils. He tried to affiliate this organisation to the Labour Representation Committee, and soon faced a rival in the form of the Federation of Metropolitan Trades and Labour Councils, leading Field to abandon his federation. Inspired by the Young Turks, in 1908 Field became interested in Islam, and by 1914 he was the founding secretary of the Anglo-Ottoman Society. He was invited to speak on the subject by the City of London ILP, and this inspired him to rejoin the party. Along with the other leaders of the Anglo- Ottoman Society, in 1917 he founded the Workers' Welfare League of India. This support for the Indian independence movement led him to become the London representative of the Free Press of India and Indian National Newspapers, and he developed a friendship with Shapurji Saklatvala. Field supported the British Socialist Party's formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), becoming a founder member. Within the party, he worked with Saklatvala and Mann, along with S. A. Dange and M. N. Roy. However, in 1927, the CPGB criticised Saklatvala for initiating his children as Parsis, and Field resigned in sympathy, thereafter writing anti-communist articles for the Indian press.

She was the founder of the Raoul Wallenberg Academy. She also presented Sommar i P1 in 2014 on Swedish Radio. She was the mother-in-law of Kofi Annan. Work Nina Lagergren was the founder of the Raoul Wallenberg Academy, which she ran along with her parents Fredrik Elias August von Dardel and Maria Sofia \\"Maj\\" Wising and her brother Guy von Dardel. In 2000, Lagergren was awarded the Wallenberg Medal, which was presented to her by the University of Michigan. Lagergren was the presenter of an episode of Sommar i P1 at Sveriges Radio on 4 August 2014 where she told about her life and her work to find out what had happened to her half-brother. On 8 March 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio announced that Wallenberg and his driver had been murdered on their way to Debrecen, suggesting that they had been killed by the Arrow Cross Party or the Gestapo. Sweden's foreign minister, √ñsten Und√©n, and its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Staffan S√∂derblom, wrongly assumed that they were dead. In April 1945, W. Averell Harriman, then of the US State Department, offered the Swedish government help in inquiring about Wallenberg's fate, but the offer was declined. S√∂derblom met with Vyacheslav Molotov and Stalin in Moscow on 15 June 1946. S√∂derblom, still believing Wallenberg to be dead, ignored talk of an exchange for Russian defectors in Sweden. In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov was charged by the Russian government with investigating Wallenberg's fate. He concluded that Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka. He may have been a victim of the C-2 poison (carbylamine-choline-chloride) tested at the poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services. Some former prisoners claimed to have seen Wallenberg after his reported death in 1947. In February 1949, former German Colonel Theodor von Dufving, a prisoner of war, provided statements concerning Wallenberg. While in the transit camp in Kirov, while being moved to Vorkuta, Dufving encountered a prisoner dressed in civilian clothes with his own special guard. The prisoner claimed that he was a Swedish diplomat and said he was there \\"through a great error\\". Lagergren continued to work with this information throughout her life, searching for details about his fate. In October 2016, Wallenberg was declared dead by Sweden's Tax Agency.

In 2019, she appeared as Grete Graumann in Franz Schreker's Der ferne Klang at the Oper Frankfurt, where the opera had received its world premiere in 1912 as the composer's breakthrough. In a staging by Damiano Michieletto, she portrayed the main character at three stages of life: as a young girl whose lover, the composer Fritz sung by Ian Koziara, leaves her in search of a distant sound, as a queen of the demimonde, and as an old woman who is finally reunited with her lover, only to have him die in her arms. A reviewer noted her sensitive acting in all stages of the main character's life, with a brilliantly high register and at the same time a lyrical warm timbre (\\"in der H√∂he strahlenden wie lyrisch warmem Sopran\\").

He lectured in mathematics at Trinity College and worked for the U.S. Department of Defense on the research and development of ship design and construction.  Early life and career Theilheimer was born in Gunzenhausen, Germany on 18 June 1909, the youngest of six children, to Gustav Theilheimer and Rosa Theilheimer (n√©e Waldmann). Gustav was a cattle dealer and hops buyer for breweries. Feodor went to Realschule in Gunzenhausen and Oberrealschule in Nuremberg. He attended the University of Erlangen where he studied mathematics and physics. From 1928 to 1931 he studied at the Telshe Yeshiva in Lithuania. In 1931 he attended the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. In 1932 he started studying mathematics at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin and received his PhD in 1936 with the thesis Ein Beitrag zur Theorie der charakteristischen Invarianten (A contribution to the theory of characteristic invariants). He was one of the last Jews to graduate from that university. Some of the mathematicians working in Berlin while Theilheimer was there were Ludwig Bieberbach, Alfred Brauer, Georg Feigl, Erhard Schmidt, Richard von Mises, and Issai Schur, his thesis advisor. He taught in Berlin for one year but as it became increasingly difficult to teach as a Jew in Germany under the Nazi regime, he emigrated to the USA in 1937. In the USA it was difficult to find work as a German immigrant and from 1937 to 1941 he tutored Jewish refugees in St Louis. In 1941 he joined Brown University and lectured a course entitled Program of Advanced Research and Instruction in Mechanics. In 1942 he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Trinity College and was promoted to assistant professor in 1946. In 1948 he moved to Washington, DC where he worked for the U.S. Department of Defense as a mathematician on the research and development of ship design and construction. Theilheimer attended several meetings of the Mathematical Association of America over the period 1947 to 1955 and presented papers at these meetings. Works He completed his thesis on invariant theory in 1936 despite the challenges of being a non-Aryan. Most of his later career was in aerodynamics and ship modeling for example on the use of high speed computers to ease the drawing of ship lines. For this work he received the David W Taylor Award for Scientific Achievement. He worked on Fast Fourier transform algorithms and how to quickly factor matrices to a product of zeros.  Private life  In 1948 Theilheimer married Henriette \\"Henny\\" Rubel and they had one daughter, Rachel born in 1950 in Silver Spring, Maryland. They lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Theilheimer retired in 1977 but still taught mathematics courses at the University of Maryland until 1983. Theilheimer died on 24 December 2000 in Chevy Chase.

The C801B trains are also the first of its kind to reuse the retro AC third rail shoes compared to the newer Light Rail lines around the world that utilises the APM 300 system that have been built with DC third rail instead of AC. Overview As the aging first generation trains drew near to its deadline service of 20 years, the LTA has decided that the first generation trains are due for replacement instead of a refurbishment. This is in part of their renewal programme for the next 10 years for the BPLRT, including rail replacement and signalling upgrades. The LTA then awarded the project to Bombardier Transportation, the manufacturer of the BPLRT train cars, to procure 19 replacement train cars for the BPLRT. However, instead of using back the same technology for the train line, the LTA opted for Bombardier's latest technology on the INNOVIA system - INNOVIA APM 300. It is said to be much more reliable in many ways, including a much more robust braking and propulsion system, a higher reliability air conditioning system and many more. But with the BPLRT line utilising the same third rail technology as the APM 100, modification works on the APM 300 cars were done to work with AC third rail power supply.

Harrison Boulevard extends approximately one mile from its southern beginning at West Hays Street to its northern boundary at Hill Road. The east boundary extends to Washington School at 15th and Ridenbaugh Streets, and it includes three residential properties at 15th Street, but the district narrows around Harrison Boulevard as it proceeds north. The west boundary extends as far as 20th Street at the south end of the district, and it narrows to Harrison Boulevard as the district proceeds north. With Many architectural styles are represented in the district, including Bungalow, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Classical Revival. Many residences were designed by Boise's prominent architectural firms, including Tourtellotte & Co., Tourtellotte & Hummel, Wayland & Fennell, and Nisbet & Paradice. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History President Harrison visited Boise on May 8, 1891, less than one year after Idaho had become the 43rd state. Harrison was well received, and Harrison Boulevard was named in his honor. At 100 feet, the boulevard was at the time the widest street in Boise. The newly platted Brumback Addition included the south end of Harrison Boulevard, and homesites were advertised on the boulevard during President Harrison's visit. By 1895 the Lemp Addition and the Locust Grove Addition, north of the Brumback Addition, also included Harrison Boulevard. In 1916 Harrison Boulevard was paved and landscaped, and street lights were installed. Signs marking the Harrison Boulevard Historic District were installed in 2001 in memory of Ambrose Baltes, a former resident of the district and homeless program volunteer.

She was a member of the Madison Common Council between 2007 and 2013. In 2019, Rhodes-Conway was elected Mayor of Madison, Wisconsin. She is the first openly gay person elected to that office. Early life and career Satya Rhodes-Conway was born in 1971, in Espa√±ola, New Mexico, and raised in Ithaca, New York. She attended Smith College to study biology and earned a master's degree in ecology from the University of California, Irvine. Rhodes-Conway moved to Madison, Wisconsin, around 2000. She worked as a senior associate with the University of Wisconsin's Center on Wisconsin Strategy, and served on several municipal committees, among them the Eken Park Neighborhood Association as treasurer, as chair of the Long Range Metro Transit Ad Hoc Planning Committee, and a subcommittee member of the Commission on the Environment. Rhodes-Conway became managing director of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Mayor's Innovation Project in 2005. Political career Rhodes-Conway has been endorsed by the Green Party of the United States, the Progressive Dane party and the Democratic Party in bids for political office. She began campaigning for Brian Benford's open seat on the Madison Common Council in December 2006, and was one of nine new alders elected to the Madison Common Council in 2007. Rhodes- Conway announced in November 2012 that she would not run for reelection, Alt URL and stepped down from the position upon the end of her third term in April 2013. She was succeeded in office by Larry Palm. =2019 mayoral campaign= Rhodes-Conway announced that she would run for the mayorship in May 2018. She and incumbent mayor Paul Soglin were the top two finishers in a primary held on February 19, 2019. The 2019 mayoral primary was Madison's most expensive, as six candidates raised a total of $453,365; $83,331 of that total was raised by Rhodes-Conway's campaign. Rhodes-Conway finished second, 323 votes behind Soglin, to advance to the general election. During the primary, Rhodes- Conway's support came largely from the Isthmus and neighboring wards. Debates between Rhodes-Conway and Soglin covered a number of topics, including affordable housing, the municipal economy, public safety, and policing. Rhodes-Conway won support from Wisconsin State Assemblywoman Terese Berceau and Dane County Executive Joe Parisi. She was subsequently endorsed by the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board, The Capital Times, and The Daily Cardinal. Throughout the campaign, Rhodes-Conway raised more money than Soglin, and spent more on expenditures. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele spent $47,000 on mailings supportive of Rhodes-Conway's mayoral bid, an amount described by the Wisconsin State Journal as \\"unusual, if not unprecedented,\\" due to its origin outside of Dane County. Rhodes-Conway defeated Soglin in the April 2, 2019 election, earning victory with over 61 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was approximately 36 percent. Rhodes-Conway's electoral victory was driven by large margins in the Isthmus, Near East Side, and West Side. She managed to flip wards in the Far East Side and West Side, parts of the city that previously voted for Soglin. In a ward near Capitol Square, Rhodes-Conway won by a 68.5-point margin. She is the second woman to be elected mayor of Madison and the first openly gay person elected to the office. Alt URL Lori Lightfoot was elected Mayor of Chicago on the same day Rhodes-Conway won Madison's mayoral election. Former Mayor of Houston Annise Parker stated that both victories \\"leave us well-positioned to make 2019 the year of the lesbian mayor.\\" =Mayoralty= Rhodes-Conway was inaugurated as mayor of Madison on April 16, 2019. On her first day as mayor, she held a joint press conference with Dane County Executive Joe Parisi to announce a maintenance and reconstruction agreement for Buckeye Road. = Controversy over response to 2020 protests = Starting in May 2020, protests spread across the United States in response to the death of George Floyd. Protests in Madison began on May 30. Initially, Rhodes-Conway seemed supportive of the demonstrations, stating \\"George Floyd should be alive tonight and the fact that he isn‚Äôt, is an American tragedy...I also want to say that I completely agree with the protestors that were around the capitol square and right here in front of this building earlier today. I agree with their message, I agree with their right to protest and I agree with how determinedly and peacefully they protested today.‚Äù However, after protesters were tear-gassed by police on the first night of demonstrations, tensions escalated. Alice Herman, writing for Tone Madison, recounted that \\"As protesters‚Äîchanting ‚Äúhands up, don‚Äôt shoot,‚Äù and repeating George Floyd‚Äôs name‚Äîadvanced from the campus end of State Street toward the Capitol, cops formed barricades across the street, repeatedly deploying tear gas to route the advancing protesters into side streets. The tear gas set off panicked stampedes, which were the most frightening and dangerous moments of the day.\\" Multiple Madison alders (Rebecca Kemble, Donna Moreland, Max Prestigiacomo, Arvina Martin, Marsha Rummel, Tag Evers, and Grant Foster) released a statement condemning the tear-gassing of protesters, writing ‚ÄúWhat we witnessed on the news last night was a gross and unnecessary display of force that deepens community divide and mistrust of the city and other bodies of government...Instead of kneeling with protesters, MPD led a militarized police effort that escalated the situation with pepper spray, gassing, injuries, and harmful trauma to youth and others in the downtown area last night.‚Äù The next day, Rhodes-Conway declared a state of emergency and imposed a 9:30 pm curfew on the isthmus area of the city, stating \\"I want to be clear that this is in response to a number of people endangering themselves and others by shattering glass, destroying property, and engaging in widespread, systematic looting of local businesses.\\" Despite the mayor's focus on property damage, many State Street businesses released statements in support of the protests, including A Room of One's Own Bookstore, writing \\"We are proud of those who rioted last night & who kept George Floyd's name on a live news feed for an entire day & disallowed the march to become a two minute segment on the evening news. We are proud to be part of a community that flushed teargas out of protester's eyes at 1 am & that came together at 7 am sweep up glass & board up windows. We believe this is all tandem necessary work. The looting & rioting last night, on any night, in any city, could never cause the same kind of damage the police have caused Black communities for centuries. Windows & merchandise will never, under any circumstance, be more important than human lives.\\" On June 3, Rhodes-Conway released a password- protected video, intended only for consumption by Madison Police Department members; however, the video was leaked to the public. In the video, Rhodes- Conway stated \\"You must be exhausted. I know I am, and you're facing a much more difficult situation than I am. It must be absolutely infuriating to stand in heavy gear outside while listening to people constantly insult your chosen profession...You are not what the protesters say you are. I know that...I was so focused on the task of addressing the concerns of our community that I didn‚Äôt remember that you need and deserve both recognition and appreciation.\\" The video was apparently leaked by a member of the \\"We Stand With The Madison Police Department\\" Facebook group. Angry that Rhodes-Conway would not take a public stance in support of police, they accompanied it with this message: \\"If you know your police are doing well get out there (and) say it publicly. Stop kowtowing.\\" After the video was leaked, Rhodes-Conway likewise came under fire from supporters of the protests, who were disturbed by the dissonance between her public statements and her private one. Rhodes-Conway apologized for the statements made in the leaked video, saying \\"Black lives matter. I believe deeply in this and yet I failed to center this in my message to the police department...I realize I may have done irreparable harm with my actions, and I realize too that I may have permanently lost any trust I had.\\" Personal life Satya Rhodes-Conway's mother, Anne Rhodes, is an artist. Her father, Bob Conway, is a manager of art collections. Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and her mother subsequently came out as a lesbian. Satya Rhodes-Conway and Amy Klusmeier have been partners since 2009.

Description Halab√≥s is one of the easiest and most common way of preparing crustacean dishes in the Philippines. Traditionally, it only requires boiling whole unshelled shrimp, crab, or other crustaceans in water and a little salt for one to three minutes until they turn reddish-pink. Nothing else is added, and the ingredients are allowed to stew in their own juices. However, modern versions generally use carbonated lemon drinks like Sprite instead of water. Spices may also be added like chilis and garlic. Butter may also be added. Halab√≥s dishes are usually prefixed by \\"halab√≥s na\\".

Fenice President and Chief Operating Officer Scott Coleman announced that Karen Lopez would take over as publisher of the Katy Times.  History  The Katy Times was first published in 1913 by John C. Adams under its original name, The Brookshire Times. At the time, the newspaper mostly covered news in the city of Brookshire, Texas and not Katy, Texas as Brookshire was much older and larger than Katy. However, as Katy was experiencing rapid growth, the two cities soon began to share news. In September 1914, ownership of the newspaper transferred to Adolph Baylis Anderson and his wife, Pat Anderson, when they bought the newspaper. Upon the death of Pat Anderson in 1934, Mary Anne Ernstes was hired to help out Mr. Anderson. Ernstes became publisher in 1944 and eventually bought the newspaper in 1949 when Mr. Anderson died. The paper was moved to Ernstes' hometown of Katy in the late 1950s. In April 1973, The Brookshire Times was sold to Tri- County Newspapers and titled The Times.

Biography L√©on Hollaenderski was born in the town of Vishtinets, and studied at the University of K√∂nigsberg in Prussia. He was appointed an interpreter at the tribunal of Suwalki, and in 1835 founded there the first printing and lithographic establishment in the government, as well as three bookstores. When his bookkeeper revealed to the police that he owned Polish patriotic publications, Hollaenderski's property was confiscated and he was forced to flee. He arrived in Paris with his wife in 1843, where he joined the intellectual circles of the Great Emigration. Through the recommendation of Fran√ßois Arago he obtained a position in one of the railroad offices, and employed his leisure time in literary pursuits, which gave him in later years considerable reputation as a philosopher, moralist, historian, and bibliographer. In exile, Hollaenderski was active in efforts to bring about rapprochement between Poles and Jews, and maintained underground contacts with revolutionary Jews in Poland. He broke with the Polish independence movement after √©migr√© groups held Galician Jews partly to blame for the crushing of the Krak√≥w uprising of 1846, and in July 1837 withdrew in protest from a committee established by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski to foster pro-Polish attitudes among Jews. Nonetheless, during the Greater Poland uprising of 1848, Hollaenderski issued appeals to Poles (2 April 1848) and Polish Jews (6 April 1848), calling for co-operation between the two groups. The latter appeal called on the \\"teachers of Israel\\" to preach patriotism to the Jews and to prove that they are not indifferent to Poland's fate, assuring them that their \\"faithful participation in Poland's victory will bring eternal happiness to entire Jewry.\\" Publications Inspired by the writings of Joachim Lelewel, Hollaenderski released Les isra√©lites de Pologne in 1846, the first extensive history in book form of the Jews in Poland in a western language, with a foreword by radical Polish √©migr√© Jan Czy≈Ñski. A translation of the study appeared in German that same year, with an epilogue by Zecharias Frankel; the work was published in English as The History of the Israelites of Poland in 1865. As family poet of the Rothschild family in France, Hollaenderski composed an epithalamium on the occasion of the marriage of Alphonse de Rothschild to his cousin Leonora de Rothschild in 1857, and poems in honour of the bar mitzvah of Edmond James de Rothschild, the wedding of Gustave de Rothschild to C√©cile Anspach in 1858, and the death of James Mayer de Rothschild in 1868. His other published works include C√©line la ni√®ce de l'abb√© (1832); Trilogie philosophique et populaire, a romance in which are faithfully depicted the Polish customs of that time; Dix-huit si√®cles de prejug√©s chr√©tiens; Dictionnaire universel fran√ßais-h√©breu; L'exemple, an essay on morals; and \\"Isra√´l et sa vocation,\\" published in ' (Paris, 1863‚Äì64). Besides these works, Hollaenderski was the author of the poems \\"M√©ditations d'un proscrit polonais\\", \\"La libert√© de franc-ma√ßons\\", and \\"Lamentation de juifs polonais sous Nicolas 1er.\\" He also translated into French Abraham ibn Ezra's treatise on chess, Ma'adanne melekh, under the title of D√©lices royales ou le jeu des √©checs; M√©moire de Kilinsky from the Polish; and the third part of Berakhot (Paris, 1871).
