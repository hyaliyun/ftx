The yellowtail trumpeter is native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, ranging from Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia along the north coast to Bowen, Queensland, and along the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Taxonomy The yellowtail trumpeter is one of three species in the genus Amniataba, which is one of fifteen genera in the grunter family, Terapontidae. The grunters are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidei. Despite its common name, the yellowtail trumpeter has no relation to the 'true' trumpeters of the family Latridae. The species was first described by Richardson in 1844 as Terapon caudavittatus, before he republished the species under the names Datnia caudavittata, Amphitherapon caudavittatus, and the currently accepted binomial name of Amniataba caudavittata. Castelnau redescribed it once again as Therapon bostockii in 1873. All names except Amniataba caudavittata are invalid under the ICZN rules. Description The yellowtail trumpeter can grow to a maximum length of 28 cm, but it is usually around 15 cm. The body is deep in profile and is compressed laterally. The upper jaw is slightly longer than the lower. The first gill arch has 6 to 8 gill rakers on the upper limb and 12 or 13 on the lower. The dorsal fin has 12 or 13 spines and 8 to 10 soft rays; the spinous part of the dorsal fin is curved, with the fifth spine being the longest, and the final spine the shortest. The anal fin has 3 spines and 8 or 9 soft rays, with the second anal-fin spine longer than the third, but shorter than the longest anal-fin rays. The pored scales in the lateral line number 46 to 54 with 7 to 9 rows of scales above the lateral line and 17 to 19 below it. The upper body is grey and spotted, and the lower has only light pigmentation. Some individuals have 5 or 6 incomplete vertical bars extending from around the dorsal fin to the level of the pectoral fins. The fins are generally yellow in colour, with varied dusting and blotching. The spinous dorsal fin has irregular spotting and a faint duskiness distally, but does not exhibit a distinct patch of dark pigmentation. The soft dorsal fin is dusky at the base. The spinous portion of anal fin is also slightly dusky. The caudal fin is spotted basally, with a distinct black blotch across each lobe. Habitat The species is known to tolerate a very wide range of salinites, from fresh river waters to hypersaline waters found in some areas of Shark Bay. It often inhabits estuarine waters along the Western Australian coast, as well as sand and seagrass beds in inshore and offshore waters of the continental shelf. Biology The yellowtail trumpeter is a seasonal inhabitant of many estuaries in Western Australia, with the species most abundant in summer due to substantial recruitment of juveniles following the spawning period in early summer. During colder months, it tends to move into deeper offshore waters to avoid the large influxes of fresh water entering the estuaries from upland river systems. Evidence suggests that the yellowtail trumpeter naturally hybridises with another species of freshwater terapontid, Leiopotherapon unicolor, on occasion. =Diet= The fish is a benthic omnivore, preying mainly on algae, crustaceans, and polychaetes. Its diet changes with age; older fish eat more polychaetes. =Life cycle= The fish usually reaches sexual maturity at the end of its second year, with some larger fish maturing after only one year. The fish spawn in estuaries. The population of the Swan River in Western Australia spawns in the upper reaches of the estuary between November and January, producing an average of 310,000 eggs in a season. The spawning period is associated with a lull in the freshwater influx of the river, resulting in fairly stable salinity and temperature regimes. The mature, unfertilised eggs of the yellowtail trumpeter are small and spherical, having an average diameter of 560 Œºm. The larva is pelagic and characterized by an elongate body, which becomes deeper and more laterally compressed during development. The species grows seasonally, with growth only occurring in the warmer months of the year. The yellowtail trumpeter can live over 3 years. Importance to humans The yellowtail trumpeter is of minor commercial importance throughout its range, caught with handlines, seines, and other inshore fishing gear. It is not considered particularly good as food, and is considered a nuisance by many recreational fishermen who target bream in local estuaries.

The gene is also called torpedo and Ellipse. The gene is located at 3-26 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. It is named faint little ball because when the gene is mutated the embryo forms a ball of dorsal hypoderm. flb is necessary for several processes to occur during embryonic development, specifically in central nervous system development. It is expressed as quickly as 4 hours after fertilization of the egg. The peak of expression of the flb gene is between 4‚Äì8 hours into development. In all processes that are facilitated by flb the same signal transduction pathway is used. Drosophila EGF receptor is involved in the development of embryos as well as larvae/pupae's wings, eyes, legs and ovaries.  Interactions  Whether looking at development in embryos or larvae/pupae, DER relies on several ligands to carry out its function. These are called SPITZ, ARGOS and Gurken. The efficiency of DER corresponds with the sum of these three ligands. As of yet the exact purpose of these ligands in the pathway of DER is unknown, but when expression of these ligands is altered from normal, aberrant phenotypes of the embryos can be observed. When DER is over utilized in the cell because of increases in ligand, phenotypic abnormalities can be visualized such as hyperplasia of the head midline structures. The flb gene also has interactions with the proteins Rhomboid and Star. Rhomboid is a protease that cleaves ligands such as Spitz so that they can come into contact with receptors such as DER and begin activate a signal trasduction pathway. The dentricle belts are visible during the development of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila EGF receptor homolog plays a role in the correct development of these dentricle belts.  Function  Expression of the flb gene can be seen as early as four hours into the development of Drosophila melanogaster. At four hours the gene is facilitating the retraction of the germ band as well as structuring the beginnings of the CNS. At six hours the gene is used to differentiate epidermal cells to secrete denticle belts which begin segmentation of the larva. At nine hours the gene is used for the differentiation of midline glial cells. When this gene is mutated or any of its interactions are altered phenotypes such as fused commissures can be seen as a result of improper segregation.  Mutation  When the flb gene is mutated, several phenotypic abnormalities during development can be viewed. The first is that the embryo will form a ball of dorsal hypoderm. This is because flb is responsible for the formation of the ventral cuticle. Without the complete formation of the ventral cuticle only dorsal structures will be present. Since flb plays a role in the formation of the CNS and the eye, head structures will be underdeveloped or not present at all. Another function of the gene is to retract the germ band. This will not occur if the flb is mutated. There are other hypomorphic alleles that also contribute to the retraction of the germ-band, which allow for a spectrum of severity in the phenotype of embryos but they will not recover the Wild Type phenotype completely. This gene is necessary for the development of embryos and if it is not expressed in the appropriate way, it is lethal to the embryo.

School programs =Breakthrough Schools= In 2007, NASSP received a grant from MetLife Foundation and merged two programs, Breakthrough High Schools and Bridge Builders, to form Breakthrough Schools. Previously, the Breakthrough High Schools program recognized schools that were defying the odds and succeeding despite predictors of low student achievement. The Bridge Builders program recognized middle level and high school principals who had implemented proven strategies to create connections between their faculty and surrounding communities. From 2008 to 2014, Breakthrough Schools program annually recognized 10 US middle and high schools that serve large numbers of students living in poverty and are high achieving or dramatically improving student achievement. retrieved 6/01/2011 Although the program was paused in 2015 and 2016, in 2017, NASSP reevaluated the 39 Breakthrough Schools recognized between 2011 and 2014 and found that 26 of the schools had continuously sustained their student achievement, and redesignated them as Breakthrough Schools. Winners are chosen based on a school's documented success in implementing strategies aligned with the three core areas of NASSP's school improvement model, the Breaking Ranks Framework. The core areas include collaborative leadership; personalization; and curriculum, instruction, and assessment. More specifically, nominated schools must demonstrate continuous growth on state assessments (and improved graduation rates among high schools), efforts to reduce the achievement gap, and have a student body consisting of 40% or more eligible for free or reduced price meals. Additional factors impacting consideration include equity of student participation in challenging courses, personal learning plans for all students, school/community connections, and leadership development/mentoring. From 2008 to 2014, selected schools received a $5,000 grant and were featured in the association's monthly magazine, Principal Leadership. Principals of Breakthrough Schools participated in professional development activities and the annual NASSP conference. In 2017, all schools received a plaque and banner, four of the principals were selected to attend the National Principals Conference, and another six principals participated in the McKinsey Management Program for School Leaders. =Principal of the year= 2019, Dr. Lucas Clamp, River Bluff High School, Lexington, South Carolinahttps://www.nassp.org/recognition/principal-of-the-year/national- principal-of-the-year-winners/ 2018, Dr. Akil E.

As of 2013, the municipality has a population of 5,843 inhabitants. It is also the seat of the judicial district of Almaz√°n, and ecclesiastically it belongs to the Diocese of Osma, a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Burgos. Connected via the Autov√≠a A-15 and Carretera nacional N-111, it is situated by road northeast of Madrid. The town lies on the east bank of the Duero river. History Church of San Miguel, built in the 12th century In the early 10th century, fortifications were built along the Duero at Soria and Almaz√°n. In 1068, Almaz√°n was conquered by the Christians of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n, but soon after was recovered for al-√Åndalus. In 1128, it was repopulated by Alfonso I, although after his death in 1134, the town fell into Castilian hands and was granted by Alfonso VII of Le√≥n to the bishops of Sig√ºenza. In 1158, Sancho III of Castile created the Almaz√°n la Orden de Caballer√≠a de Calatrava. The Church of San Miguel was built in the 12th century. In the late 13th century, civil war broke out, involving Sancho IV of Castile, who claimed the throne of Castile, and Alfonso de la Cerda, a liberal. In 1305, after various conflicts, Almaz√°n was returned to the Castilian crown, and then in 1375, a peace agreement was signed between Pedro IV of Aragon, King of Aragon, and Henry II, king of Castile. Almaz√°n was divided into two townships, and the town became ruled by the Mayor, assisted by six aldermen, three class gentlemen and three good men of the town. It was visited by important figures in the Catholic Church several times over the years. On March 12, 1648, the playwright Tirso de Molina died in the convent of the Merced and presumably lies in the convent cemetery. During the Spanish War of Independence, on July 10, 1810, the town was taken by French General R√©gis Barth√©lemy Mouton-Duvernet, but with the fall of the ancien regime, it became a constitutional municipality of the region of Castilla la Vieja. The 1842 census recorded 484 households and 2400 residents in Almaz√°n. In the 1850s, mid-nineteenth century, the population grew significantly after Fuentelcarro and Tejerizas were merged into the municipality. In the 1981 census, the population again grew markedly after the incorporation of Cobertelada into the municipality, with the localities of Alm√°ntiga, Balluncar, Covarrubias and Lodares del Monte.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, featuring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan of Cimmeria created by Robert E. Howard. It was first published in the magazine Worlds of Fantasy in 1968 as \\"Conan and the Cenotaph\\". Plot summary Conan is a mercenary serving in the army of the empire of Turan. Having attained the rank of captain, he has been chosen by King Yildiz to lead a calvary of soldiers and deliver a letter of friendship to King Shu of Kusan, a minor kingdom in the east. Shu sends Conan back to Turan with a formal letter of acceptance and provides him with a high noble of his own court, Duke Feng, to act as a guide and escort. However, unknown to both Conan and King Shu, Feng is a member of an isolationist political party known as the Golden Pheasant, which is against all contact between Kusan and the nations of the west. Determined to prevent Conan from delivering the letter of treaty back to Turan, Feng employs a ruse against Conan with a tale concerning the nearby tomb of a king which is supposed to contain a hoard of treasure. He tells Conan that if he should help him receive the treasure while his men are asleep, Feng will share half of what they find, to which Conan, although suspicious, agrees. When they reach the site indicated by Feng, Conan sees a large burial mound with a black monolith of stone towering up into the night sky, the top of which is obscured by mist. As Conan ascends the mound and prepares to dig, he finds himself being pulled inexorably toward the monolith by an invisible force. Unable to break free Conan is hurled against the monolith and held fast. The duplicitous Feng then explains his true identity and purpose, and that the monolith is composed of a magnetic stone which exerted a force of attraction upon Conan's metal armor. Taking the letter of treaty from Conan, Feng begins to play musical notes on a flute. Responding to the strange piping, a monster in the form of a giant amoeba begins to slither down from the top of the shaft toward Conan. Struggling to escape, Conan eventually manages to cut the leather straps of his armour with a rusted dagger and tears himself free before the amoeba could devour him with its acidic pseudopods. Pouncing on Feng, Conan grabs him, retrieves the letter, and hurls him against the monolith, knocking him unconscious as he falls victim to the amorphous creature. Conan then sets fire to the monster, bringing an end to the \\"curse\\" once and for all. Adaptation Adapted in Savage Sword of Conan #33 by Roy Thomas, Gene Colan and Pablo Marcos.

Following the Reconquista, Barcones belonged to the extensive Alfoz (municipality) of Atienza and later to the Senorio de Paredes.

The carapace is approximately twice as long as it is high, and in the male, which has a rounded pseudorostrum, rather smooth. The female has two to six small serrations in the middle of the dorsal ridge of the carapace, and a sharply leading pseudorostrum. Both males and females are strongly pigmented. The male has ‚Äî like all members of the family Bodotriidae ‚Äî five pairs of pleopods. Their colour is whitish to straw- coloured.  Habitat  I. trispinosa are usually found in fine sand beaches, such as those formed by silt deposits. They prefer shallower depths, but may be found as deep as 150 m. During summer nights the males emerge from sand, swarming to the surface, frequently attracted by light. They are found from Norway to the Moroccan coast, around the Canary Islands and in the Mediterranean Sea.  References   Further reading  * Hayward, P.J. & Ryland, J.S., (1991).

Lake Hugo features approximately of shoreline and covers over , or . Its normal pool elevation is above sea level and its normal storage capacity is . At flood stage its elevation is at above sea level and it is capable of storing of flood waters. The lake's primary functions are to provide flood control, water storage, and recreational opportunities.\\"Hugo Lake\\", Oklahoma Water Atlas, Oklahoma Water Resources Board, available via http://www.owrb.ok.giv/news/publications/wa/lakes/Hugo.php. The nearest major cities to Lake Hugo are Fort Smith, Arkansas (101 miles), Dallas, Texas (114 miles) and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma(151 miles).  History  Authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1946 and Flood Control Act of 1962 construction on the dam began in October 1967. The US Army Corps of Engineers completed the project in January 1974 at a cost of approximately $37,000,000. The US Army Corps of Engineers established Kiamichi Park on the lake just west of the dam site in 1974. The park was cut in half part of it still belonging to the US Army Corps of Engineers and the other was leased to the State in 2002 it was renamed Hugo Lake State Park. The park currently covers .  Recreation  The south of the lake nearest to the dam are clear of obstructions and provide recreational opportunities for watersports such as boating and water skiing. The state park provides cabins, hiking trails, and a 56-slip marina. The north end of the lake is not cleared and contains dead tree stumps in the water. These stumps provide cover for the fish and ideal conditions for anglers. Hugo Lake features excellent crappie fishing and populations of bass and catfish. In addition fishing there is also hunting and animal trapping at Hugo Lake. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation administers at the lake, and the US Army Corps of Engineers manage 8,000. These areas are home to white tail deer, waterfowl, mink, fox, and beaver. Controversy over water sales In recent years Hugo Lake has been in the middle of a controversy regarding out-of-state water sales between Texas and Oklahoma. The city of Hugo had sought to sell water to the growing suburbs of Dallas that need new sources of water to pay debts related to the lake. Irving, Texas has entered negotiations with the Hugo to obtain a supply of fresh water by building a pipeline and purchasing excess water from Hugo Lake. In 2002 the Oklahoma state legislature passed a moratorium on water sales outside the state. Hugo sued the state in federal court citing that the state's moratorium is unconstitutional. Hugo Lake State Park Hugo Lake State Park On Hugo Lake the Hugo Lake State Park offers boating and fishing opportunities. The park offers 16 two bedroom resort cabins, 10 primitive cabins, a 56-slip full service marina with store, pavilions, picnic sites with grills and tables, and pontoon boat rentals. Hiking, biking, and nature trails are also on site. Tent camping is also available.

(2014). Elysia crispata M√∂rch, 1863. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=420572 on 2014-11-08 The lettuce slug resembles a nudibranch, but it is not closely related to that clade of gastropods; it is classified as a sacoglossan. Description This species is called the lettuce slug because it is often green in color, and it always has a very frilly edge to its parapodia. This makes the slug resemble the curly kinds of lettuce, such as the lollo rosso variety. The maximum length of this species is about 5 cm and 3 cm in width. The lettuce slug is extremely variable in color: it can also be blue, or very pale with red lines or yellow lines. Distribution This species lives in the tropical parts of the western Atlantic, and the Caribbean faunal zone. They are found in more coastal and tropical reef areas where the water is shallow and clear. Diet E. crispata can be either heterotrophic or autotrophic throughout their lifespan. As juveniles, food is consumed and digested quickly, with little chloroplast retention. Upon reaching maturity, kleptoplasty becomes an important energy source. The primary food source of E. crispata is relatively unknown, although some individuals have been known to consume a diversity of algal species such as Vaucheria litorea, Caulerpa verticillata, Caulerpa racemosa, Halimeda discoidea, Halimeda incrassate, Halimeda monile, and Penicillus capitatus; C. verticillata being suitable for a limited amount of time. This diversity in food sources is a different characteristic compared to other Sacoglossan‚Äôs who are specialized for one species of algae, and gives E. crispata a survival advantage when food is depleted or sparse. Chloroplasts within their parapodia (fleshy dorsal protrusions) continue to produce energy products through carbon fixation throughout their life and have been found to function efficiently for a little over a month. =Kleptoplasty= Also known as chloroplast symbiosis, kleptoplasty is the energy-providing mechanism that gives the Sacoglossan‚Äôs the nickname, ‚Äúsolar-powered sea slugs‚Äù, and E. crispata the name, ‚Äúlettuce sea slug.‚Äù As algal food is being digested, the chloroplasts are absorbed into the cells lining the digestive tract and up into their parapodia. How many chloroplasts the slug sequesters and the length of retention depends on the individual species of slug. Chloroplast retention in E. crispata tends to last around 40 days. Given the variation in their diet, chloroplasts from different algal species have been found to be taken up into the same cells, functioning normally alongside the other. E. crispata is closely related to E. chlorotica, both having a long-term chloroplast retention ability, where other species within the same genus tend to have more short-term retention. This ability makes it possible to withstand long periods of time without food. In the absence of food, E. crispata will invest energy trying to find food rather than slowing down and conserving energy. Although it hasn‚Äôt been exclusively studied for this organism, one possibility of the mechanism behind long-term retention is due to the amount of extracellular components which prolong chloroplast activity, depending on the species of algae eaten. As E. crispata continues to consume food, the chloroplasts ingested will continuously replace older chloroplasts while food is available. Their long-term retention is an evolutionary adaption which allows a greater chance of survival during drastic environmental changes. Reproduction Very little is known of the mating behaviors of E. crispata. Typically the egg mass is laid on flat, upright algae, and embryo development takes about 15 days. Eggs are very small, between 106-113 micrometres, and eggs vary in average size by location. Newly hatched E. crispata demonstrate a dispersal dimorphism, not to be confused with poecilogony. Babies can either undergo intracapsular metamorphosis, or post-hatching metamorphosis, giving E. crispata variation in their dispersal strategy. This allows some clutches to remain stationary to that habitat, or allowing them to swim to a new habitat before metamorphosing. Some species of Sacoglossan such as Elysia tuca, invest extra energy to create extra-cellular yolk which is weaved into their egg mass, providing a greater abundance of nutrients for larval growth, which in turn produces larger progeny. E. crispata, however, does not produce extra- cellular yolk, which affects the size of the eggs. References External links * Rosenberg, G., F. Moretzsohn, and E. F. Garc√≠a. 2009.

It commands and supports United States Army assigned units, attached units, and augmentation forces and employs these forces in support of the commander. USARJ maintains and strengthens the credibility of deterrent power in the Pacific through maintenance of defense facilities, war reserves and operational project stocks. USARJ is headquartered at Camp Zama. As the Army Component Command to United States Forces Japan (USFJ) and as a Major Subordinate Command of United States Army Pacific (USARPAC) , United States Army Japan (USARJ)/I Corps (Forward) is responsible to provide support of Article V (Defense of Japan) and VI (ensuring regional stability) of the Mutual Security Treaty (MST). It serves as a forward stationed Army command and control headquarters; supports regional security cooperation activities with the Japan Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) for the purpose of contributing to the security of Japan and maintenance of peace and security in the Far East; provides communities of excellence and installation operations that support Soldiers, Civilians, and their Families.

Sams United States Army Health Clinic Japan ** Public Health Activity - Japan History United States Army Japan (USARJ) can be traced back to the U.S. Army Forces Far East (AFFE), which was formed in Manila in July 1941. Commanded by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the headquarters (HQ) moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1942. After the war, the headquarters first moved to Tokyo, then to Yokohama in 1953, and finally to its present location on Camp Zama in October 1953. Reorganization of U.S. forces in the Pacific in January 1953 established AFFE as the major Army command in the Far East. AFFE moved to Camp Zama, 35 miles southwest of Tokyo, in October 1953 into a new headquarters building designed by Antonin Raymond. On 20 November 1954, AFFE was combined with the Eighth US Army to become AFFE/Eighth US Army. In 1955, the Eighth US Army moved its headquarters to Yongsan Garrison, Seoul, Korea, and the Camp Zama command element was designated AFFE/Eighth US Army (Rear). The name, U.S. Army Japan (USARJ), first appeared on 1 July 1957 in a reorganization of US forces in the Pacific. On 1 July 1957, a U.S. Forces reorganization in the Pacific designated USARJ as one of the major subordinate commands of U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) in Hawaii. Reorganized again on 1 September 1968, USARJ employed a new structure to maximize operational efficiency while keeping its existing missions and functions. The reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control on 15 May 1972, resulted in the realignment of the Army's Pacific commands with HQ USARJ absorbing elements for Okinawa, adjusting the command chain. IX Corps was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with this command to become HQ USARJ/IX Corps. On 1 July 1974, a USARJ reorganization established three subordinate commands: U.S. Army Garrison, Honshu (USAGH); U.S. Army Garrison, Okinawa (USAGO); and the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Japan, (MEDDAC- JAPAN). With the discontinuance of USARPAC, USARJ was designated a major Army command on 1 January 1975, reporting directly to Department of the Army. In August 1990, USARPAC was reestablished and USARJ became a major subordinate command of that headquarters as well as continuing as the Army Component Command of U.S. Forces, Japan (USFJ). In 1994, IX Corps was replaced by 9th Theater Army Area Command and on 8 November 1999, was redesignated 9th Theater Support Command (TSC). There were several minor reorganizations and redesignations over the next decade so that by 11 September 2001, USARJ consisted of logistics bases in Japan and Okinawa. In September 2007, the 9th TSC was inactivated and on 19 December 2007, I Corps (Forward) was activated in Japan in line with the Army's transformation efforts. USARJ remains headquartered at Camp Zama, where it engages in numerous bilateral activities with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and performs duties as United States Forces Japan's Army Component Command. On 11 March 2011, a devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck the northeast coast of Japan. Within minutes, USARJ began humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in support of the JGSDF during Operation Tomodachi, Japan's largest-ever bilateral operation. USARJ supported the affected people after operations officially ended by providing equipment and maintenance support to the JGSDF until September.

Following the initial journey by Truchanas in 1954 and the complete journey in 1958Gee, H.M. (1978) The Wild Rivers pp161-171 in The South West Book through the splits, the photographs taken by Truchanas were destroyed in the 1967 Tasmanian fires. Southwell and others in the 1970s tended to free float on an inflatable water mattress through the splits to alleviate some of the issues arising from using fixed structure boats travelling through.

Its vision is the world's amphibians safe in nature, and its mission is ensuring the global survival of amphibians, focusing on those that cannot be safeguarded in nature. Amphibian Ark staff coordinate ex situ amphibian programs implemented by partners around the world, with the first emphasis on programs within the range countries of the species, and with an obligation to couple ex situ conservation measures with protection or restoration of species in their natural habitats. An AArk Steering Committee, with Executive Co- Chairs from each of the three principal partners, provide guidance on the activities of the AArk and ensure communication with stakeholders. A number of dedicated positions coordinate implementation within the AArk initiative; assist AArk partners in priority taxahttp://www.amphibianark.org/conservation_planning_workshops.htm identifying and regions for ex situ conservation work; lead development and implementation of training programs for building capacity of individuals and institutions; and develop communications strategies, newsletters and other messages, and materials to promote understanding and action on behalf of amphibian conservation. Advisory Committees have been formed to consult on species-specific issues, for example, reintroduction, gene banking, and veterinary, legal, and ethical concerns. Members of the AArk are WAZA members and WAZA affiliates, members of regional or national zoo associations, Species360, AArk approved private partners and AArk approved museums, universities and wildlife agencies. Although action to save critical species from immediate extinction will be to send them to facilities with space and expertise, the goal is to enable the range countries currently lacking facilities and expertise to care for their own species.

He taught at the Gewerbeschule (vocational school) in Basel and was after his habilitation, a professor of mathematics at the University of Basel for one year.Biographical information are taken from obituary of Henri Veillon and from History of the physics department of Basel University (pp. 3 and 4). From 1863 to 1906 he was a full professor of physics at Basel (successor of Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann). In 1874 he became director of the institute of physics at the newly founded ‚ÄúBernoullianum‚Äù in Basel, and from 1874 to 1879 he was president of the Swiss Academy of Sciences.The information on the Swiss Academy of Sciences is contained in the following list of presidents. Hagenbach-Bischoff was involved in the popularisation of science, and at the ‚ÄúBernoullianum‚Äù he gave more than 100 popular talks,See Veillon, page 53. such as one in 1896 on the newly discovered X rays.See Domman, p. 59 and Figure 24 after p. 447.

Economy The town is known for the spicy sausage produced there. The area is mainly reliant on livestock, agriculture, food industry (chacinera), hospitality, forestry and local services. Folk culture It is known for its unique celebration of the D√≠a de San Juan. During this festival, some women called \\"m√≥ndidas\\" dress in traditional costume wearing huge \\"cesta√±os\\" (a kind of basket filling stones for stability, and containing a roulade and several rolls), decorated with flowers and three \\"arbujuelos\\" (tree branches covered with unleavened bread colored with saffron). On the night of San Juan, known as the Paso del Fuego, a bonfire next to the shrine of the Virgen de la Pe√±a is lit and when it has burnt to embers, the locals remove their shoes and walk barefoot on the lighted embers. It is very possible that these festivals are residue of a pagan pre-Christian holiday, and that the name of m√≥ndida comes from Maenad. The event is classified as being of ethnological interest by the Castile and Leon government. In 2011, a scientific study of firewalking sparked global interest. In this study, the scientists showed evidence of synchronization between the heartbeats of practitioners and spectators at the firewalking ritual.Konvalinka, I., Xygalatas, D., Bulbulia, J., Schjoedt, U., Jegind√∏, E-M., Wallot, S., Van Orden, G. & Roepstorff, A. 2011. \\"Synchronized arousal between performers and related spectators in a fire-walking ritual\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108‚Äô‚Äô(20): p8514-8519.Xygalatas, D., Konvalinka, I., Roepstorff, A., & Bulbulia, J. 2011\\"Quantifying collective effervescence: Heart-rate dynamics at a fire- walking ritual\\",Communicative & Integrative Biology 4(6): p735-738.Ermita de la Virgen de la Pe√±a.

The creek is long, and forms part of The Broadwater estuary catchment area. Course and catchment The creek is formed from two small unnamed streams that converge to the west of Southport. Both of these tributaries have been substantially modified to provide storm water drainage for the suburb of Ashmore, and consist mainly of concrete lined channels. The northern tributary does have some areas of natural channel, with pool-and-riffle channel morphology. These areas provide a significant habitat for the vulnerable Wallum froglet. From the confluence of the two tributaries, the creek flows in a north-easterly direction bordering the Southport State High School, before passing under the Gold Coast Highway to reach the Broadwater at Len Fox Park, between Southport and Labrador. The drainage basin of the creek lies between that of the Biggera Creek to the north, and that of the Nerang River to the south and west. Catchment group The Loders Creek was the first for which a formal community catchment management group was established on the Gold Coast. Since their formation in 1994, the group which aims to enhance the creek and its environs has created a nature trail and butterfly garden. They have also produced educational resources about the creek, carried out restoration work, and completed wildlife surveys in the catchment. Flora and fauna Although degraded by the removal of native vegetation along its length for flood control, the creek does contain areas of freshwater and tidal wetlands, with some dry eucalyptus forest in the catchment. Wildlife includes native species such as bandicoots, koala, and lace monitor.

It lies at the mouth of the Elorn River which divides the Breton provinces of Cornouaille and L√©on, east of Brest. The name is from Lan Terneo and can mean \\"(religious) enclosure of St T√©n√©nan ()\\": allegedly a Welshman who also had in the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales and in Somerset, and who moved to Brittany in the 7th century. Lann means a religious sacred place. The town has been founded by Saint Arnoc, some times called Ternoc and confusion can occur with Saint T√©n√©nan. Some sources point Saint Arnoc and Saint T√©n√©nan as the same person. It was an important centre of the flax and linen industries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Landerneau is also the hometown of √âdouard Leclerc, a businessman and entrepreneur who founded the French supermarket chain E.Leclerc in 1948. His first store applies a hard competition with other supermarket chains with local made products and lower prices. Leclerc's new methods of sales are still applied in all supermarkets and hypermarkets and marks an evolution in the market's history. The town is actually the heart of the agricultural market in northwest Brittany with several agribusiness companies headquarters located in the town. A picturesque feature of the town centre is the sixteenth-century house-lined bridge (the Pont de Rohan) across the Elorn. The Pont de Rohan was the most downstream crossing of the Elorn River until 1930 and the construction of the Pont Albert Louppe near Brest. The town is also known for its moon, La Lune de Landerneau (the Moon of Landerneau). This nickname is supposed from a noble visiting Versailles court and was not impressed by the luxury of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. He was contemplating the moon with others in the Versailles gardens when he said \\"the Landerneau's moon is bigger\\", that made the assembly laugh. The Breton noble made reference to a big silver metal disc on top of the Saint Houardon Church, well known in the surroundings as \\"the moon of Landerneau\\". International relations Landerneau is twinned with the towns of Caernarfon in Gwynedd in Wales and H√ºnfeld in Germany.  Music festival  Each year in August a music festival called \\"F√™te du bruit dans Landerneau\\" takes place in Landerneau. \\"F√™te du bruit dans Landerneau\\" means \\"festival of noise in Landerneau\\". When spoken it sounds identical to \\"faites du bruit dans Landerneau\\" which means \\"make some noise in Landerneau\\". This is a play on words based on the homophones \\"f√™te\\" and \\"faites\\". It also a play on words based on a French expression \\"Cela va faire du bruit dans Landerneau\\" meaning \\"That gonna make some noise in Landerneau\\". The origins of the expression is not clear. The first theory is from a 1796 theater drama, \\"Alexandre Duval's Les Heritiers\\", after a famous sailor declared dead is back to his hometown, Landerneau. \\"His death will make some noise in Landerneau\\" text said. The second theory is from the \\"Bagne de Brest\\" (Brest's Prison between 1749 and 1848). When a prisoner escapes, the prison's cannons were fired to alarm the area of the evasion. The noise of the canons could be heard from Landeneau, 22 kilometers (14 miles) away. Population Inhabitants of Landerneau are called in French Landern√©ens. At the census of 1999, the town had a population of about and at the census of 2010, the town had a population of about 15 272 (an increase of 7%). It the 6th biggest city of Finist√®re Departement and the 617th nationwide.

Magruder (October 19, 1911, Fort Riley, Kansas - January 19, 1982, Marathon, Florida) was an aircraft designer best known for his design of the Glenn L. Martin Company's B-26 Marauder. Early life Magruder was born into a military family; his father was Brigadier General Marshall Magruder. His early life was a succession of moves from one post to another due to his father's career. This would take him to Manila, Yokohama, Hawaii, and several other posts. Because of his father's career he had to attend four different high schools. However he still won appointments to both Annapolis and West Point. Magruder chose to attend the Naval Academy in Annapolis which he entered in 1930. He studied less -- and partied more -- than most, but still remained in the upper part of his class. He pole-vaulted for the track team, was a member of the swim team, and once won $350 in bets by running five miles (8 km) in 29 minutes and 37 seconds.Peyton \\"Marauder\\" Magruder, creator of Martin B-26 Marauder, Glenn L. Martin Co He resigned during his senior year of 1934 partially due to a scandal which has now become a part of Naval Academy lore, and partially in order to apply for enlistment in the Army's aviation school. At that time the Army would not give up slots for Navy officers and cadets because the Navy had its own air school. In order to improve his chances of acceptance Magruder signed up with one of the National Guard's air units, and enrolled in the Aeronautical Engineering curriculum at the University of Alabama. However, before completion of his one year at Alabama he was engaged to be married and looking for work. Early career Magruder soon obtained a position at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, through an encounter with Adm. Ernest J. King, who was then chief of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. Magruder's family had been neighbors with King in Newport, Rhode Island while Adm. King and his father studied at the Naval War College. Magruder stayed at the NAF for two years, before moving in 1937 to a job at Glenn L. Martin Company, now Lockheed-Martin. Design of the B-26 Glenn L. Martin assigned the then 27-year-old aeronautical engineer the title of Project Engineer, and the task of designing Model 179 according to Army Air Corps specifications issued in January 1939.Martin B-26 This model would later become known as the B-26 Marauder.B-26 - Brief History & Specs Design of the Model 179 was completed in June 1939. On July 5, 1939, the Model 179 was submitted to a review board and was rated the highest of those submitted. On August 10, 1939, the Army issued a contract for 201 Model 179s under the designation B-26. Later life Peyton M. Magruder would later in life be President for International Chemical Corporation.MS424 Letter Magruder to Mallon References * http://www.usna.com/Classes/1934/SeaStories/The%20Funchal%20Madeira%20Caper.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20070714211839/http://www.glenncourt.com/family/jmc_08.shtml * Obituary: Peyton Magruder, 70, war-plane designer 1911 births 1982 deaths People from Fort Riley, Kansas People from Marathon, Florida ","title":"Peyton M.

The community consists essentially of the villages of Nolton and Roch and a number of hamlets including Cuffern and Druidston. The western part of the community is in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Its population (2001) was 746, increasing to 825 at the 2011 census. Geography Nolton Haven The 5 miles (8 km) coastline of the community consists of picturesque cliffs and dunes, and is followed by the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. At the north end is the 2 mile (3 km) long Newgale beach, which is popular for bathing and surfing. The whole coast is underlain with coal measures and was a centre of industry from medieval times until 1905. Nolton Haven, on the border between the two parishes, was a port from which the local anthracite was shipped. The area is now a popular destination for holidaymakers and second- home owners. The community is on the linguistic boundary that existed along the northern edge of the community, which was particularly prominent here where it followed the Brandybrook valley: the community had been predominantly English-speaking for 900 years, but the adjoining parishes of Brawdy and Hayscastle to the north are more Welsh-speaking. Deep in the Brandybrook valley, Roch Mill is the last remaining of five water mills along little more than two miles of river. Adjacent to Roch Bridge it has been restored and includes a working water wheel. Starting at Roch Bridge a footpath follows the Brandybrook valley east through ancient Eweston Wood, past New Mill and Tucking (woollen) Mill, both now derelict with the buildings gradually submerging into the undergrowth. The water course (leat) that brought water to the two mills can clearly be seen and, joins the two in series; having been used by Tucking Mill the water then flowed on to New Mill before returning to the Brandybrook river. The path divides with the right path following and crossing the river and back to Roch Bridge via Woodhawk Farm. The left branch continues onto a minor lane and the ford at Stoopers Mill. Local Government Nolton and Roch has its own elected community council and is part of the electoral ward of Camrose for the purposes of elections to Pembrokeshire County Council. Nolton Nolton is a village and parish on the coast of St Brides Bay, 5.5 miles (9 km) west of Haverfordwest. The name was originally old-tun and the dedication of the church to St Madoc suggests that the place was a pre-existing Welsh settlement appropriated by English immigrants around the time of the Norman conquest. Census population of Nolton parish 186 (1801): 245 (1851): 160 (1901): 108 (1951): 176 (1981) % Welsh speakers 14 (1891): 5 (1931): 8 (1971) Roch Roch Castle Roch () is a village and parish 2 miles (3.5 km) northeast of Nolton and 5.5 miles (9 km) northwest of Haverfordwest. The name is a rare example of a purely Norman French name: it was la Roche in 1271, and means \\"the rock\\". The Welsh name has the same meaning. The village stands on a prominent ridge of Precambrian rhyolite. Roch Castle stands on top of the most prominent outcrop of this, and is visible for miles around. The church of St Mary is 100 m southeast of the castle. Nearby is Cuffern Manor which is an historic house. Roch parish includes the hamlets of Cuffern and Druidston.

As of 2016 the municipality has a population of 426 inhabitants. The town of Miranda del Casta√±ar is labeled \\"Historic-Artistic Grouping\\" for being part of the Spanish national system of heritage listing. The town is set on a mountainside and is encircled by a medieval wall with four gates. To the south and the east stand the Gates of Saint Postigo and Saint Genesius respectively. To the west stands the Gate of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cuesta (Our Lady of the slope), the town's patron saint whose festivity is celebrated on either 8 or 9 September. Finally, the Town Gate stands in the north. The most noteworthy monument is the Castle of Miranda del Casta√±ar. The current castle was rebuilt in the early 14th century over the remains of an older castle dating from the 12th. There is a coat of arms belonging to the House of Zu√±iga engraved in the westernmost part of the castle. Some parts well preserved are the castle wall, a parapet walk, and some footbridges. The Castle is eyewitness to a past splendor time. The town was founded in the 12th century by the Sovereign Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and was reinforced by the repopulating carried out by the king Alfonso IX of Le√≥n in the 13th century. Currently, the castle belongs to the town council, but it first belonged to the Duchess of Alba, who also owns the title of Countess of Miranda del Casta√±ar and donated the castle to the town council in 1954.

Opened in Bronzeville, it became the first black art museum in the United StatesKnupfer, p. 2. and has been an important center for the development Chicago's African American artists. Of more than 100 community art centers established by the WPA, this is the only one that remains open. The center was awarded Chicago Landmark status in 1994. Named a \\"National Treasure\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2017, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History Eleanor Roosevelt at the dedication of South Side Community Art Center (May 7, 1941) Efforts to open a community art center on Chicago's South Side began in 1938. Peter Pollack, a Federal Art Project official, contacted Metz Lochard, an editor at the Chicago Defender, about having the Art Project sponsor exhibitions of African American artists, who often had trouble securing space to display their work. Pollack, an art dealer, owned a gallery on Michigan Avenue in Chicago's Loop and had previously displayed the work of African American artists. Lochard arranged a meeting between Pollack and Pauline Kigh Reed, a social worker with extensive connections in the community, and, according to Reed's recollection, she suggested founding an art center. Reed helped arrange an initial meeting with area artists at the South Side Settlement House at 32nd Street and Wabash Avenue. Businessman Golden Darby, chairman of the board of the Settlement House, became chair of the Sponsoring Committee of the proposed South Side Community Art Center. Darby chaired the first official meeting of the Sponsoring Committee on October 25, 1938 at the offices of the Chicago Urban League. In addition to Darby, Pollack, and other organizers of the Sponsoring Committee, the meeting was attended by members of the Arts Crafts Guild, a group of Chicago-based African American artists organized in 1932 which included Margaret Taylor-Burroughs, Eldzier Cortor, Bernard Goss, Charles White, William Carter, Joseph Kersey, and Archibald Motley, Jr. George G. Thorpe, the State Director of the Federal Art Project of Illinois, informed the group that the FAP's community art center program would provide an administrative staff, faculty, and renovation funds for a center if the community could raise funds for the purchase of a building and the costs of utilities and supplies. The following year was spent organizing and raising funds for the center, with efforts ranging from membership drives and street corner collections (including Margaret Burroughs's famous \\"Mile of Dimes\\" on South Parkway, (now Martin Luther King Drive) to benefit parties and lectures by such luminaries as Augusta Savage. The most successful of these events, the Artists' and Models' Ball held at the Savoy Ballroom on October 23, 1939, became an annual tradition. Among its alumni are Charles White, Bernard Goss, George Neal, Eldzier Cortor, Gordon Parks, Archibald Motley, and Margaret Burroughs. =Building= Completed in 1893, at 3831 S. Michigan Avenue, the Georgian Revival-style building designed by architect L. Gustav Hallberg, originally served as a residence for grain merchant George A. Seaverns, Jr. In 1940, the by then vacant brownstone building was selected as the site for the planned community art center and was purchased for about $8,000 with funds raised by the community.Cohn, p. 108.Knupfer, p. 67. The building is sometimes referred to as the Comiskey Mansion,Cohn, p. 109. and it was described as the former home of Charles Comiskey by Eleanor Roosevelt in her newspaper column after she took part in the dedication of the South Side Community Art Center. According to UNCAP, the Uncovering New Chicago Archives Project, the house belonging to Comiskey was further south on Michigan Avenue. The community paid for the lease and purchase of the building, for utilities, and for art supplies. The federal government helped to stimulate the establishment of the center via support from the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. They provided administrative funds for staff and faculty and funds for the remodeling of the building. The interior was remodeled in the New Bauhaus-style by Hin Bredendieck and Nathan Lerner and the centre opened unofficially for its first classes on December 15, 1940. The opening was accompanied by an inaugural exhibition of paintings by local black artists including Charles Davis, Charles White, Bernard Goss, William Carter, Eldzier Cortor, Charles Sebree, Archibald Motley, Jr., amongst others. The interracial faculty of art instructors included Davis, White, Goss, Carter, Morris Topchevsky, Si Gordon, Max Kahn, and Todros Geller.Cohn, p. 110. Lessons were free and included oil painting, drawing, composition, water color, sculpture, lithography, poster design, fashion illustration, interior decoration, silk screen, weaving, and hooked rug-making. By March 1941, 13,500 people had attended classes, exhibitions, and events at the center. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated the facility May 7, 1941, in a ceremony that broadcast nationwide on CBS Radio. Landmark status The center earned Chicago Landmark status on June 16, 1994. In 2017, the center was named a \\"National Treasure\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

The sonata was composed in 1783, when Mozart was 27 years old. It was published, with the other two sonatas by Artaria in 1784. A typical performance of this sonata lasts around twenty minutes. The work is one of Mozart's most popular piano sonatas, and has been featured in classical music-related films, such as Sparky's Magic Piano. Mozart's autograph of the sonata is held in the Jagiellonian Library, Krak√≥w. Movements The sonata is in three movements: #Allegro moderato #Andante cantabile in F major #Allegretto =I: Allegro moderato= The first movement typically takes about five to nine minutes to perform. The length of the movement depends largely on whether both repeats (the repeat of the exposition and the repeat of the development and recapitulation) are observed. The movement shows two clear major themes, which have been decorated by the use of ornamentation, as was typical of the time. The movement is in typical sonata form (composed of exposition, development, and recapitulation). The first subject is in tonic key of C major and modulates to the dominant, G major, for the exposition of the second subject. The development is more intense and contains wider modulations. In the recapitulation, the first subject is heard, again in C major. The music then modulates to G major, and then returns to C major for the recapitulation of the second subject in the tonic key.\\"Sonate No. 10, f√ºr das Pianoforte von W.A. Mozart\\", Mozarts Werke (sheet music). =II: Andante cantabile= The second movement takes between five and seven minutes to perform. The very end of the movement which Mozart wrote, an F major coda, was misplaced in the autograph but appears in the 1784 publication. This key is F major, the subdominant of C major. After the exposition is heard twice, the music then modulates to the development in the parallel key of F minor, and its relative key (A-flat major). The movement then modulates to the tonic, for the recapitulation, followed by a short coda. =III: Allegretto= The third movement is the most energetic among the movements of the sonata. Performance times range from three to five minutes. Use of arpeggios is prevalent throughout the piece. Like the second movement, the last few bars were lost in the autograph as well.

Its scientific name, rigida, derives from the fact that it is comparatively stiff. Description It is a shiny, dark semiaquatic snake, usually measuring 14-24 inches (36‚Äì61 cm). Its color can be described as brown to olive-brown. A few dark stripes are present on the snake's back, but hardly noticeable. The bottom of the snake is a cream-yellowish color, with small patterns similar to half moons. It can be described as very stiff, which has earned it the nickname, \\"the stiff snake\\". This snake also has very rough scales, thought to aid in defence against its main food source, crayfish. Diet This subspecies feeds almost entirely on crayfish. However, when their main food source is scarce, they can resort to frogs, salamanders, small fish, and dragonfly larva. This snake, like other crayfish snakes, have an eating habit that is different from typical snakes. As most snakes attack the head of their prey, crayfish snakes will attack the rear of the crayfish, to prevent internal damage from the sharp parts of the crayfish. Taxonomy Close relatives of the glossy crayfish snake are the Gulf crayfish snake (Liodytes rigida sinicola) and the Delta crayfish snake (Liodytes rigida deltae). Geographic range The glossy crayfish snake is found in the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States from eastern Virginia to eastern Texas but is absent from the southern portion of peninsular Florida. Conservation According to the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, in Virginia the range of the glossy crayfish snake is limited to a small geographic region.Glossy crayfish snake. http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/information/?s=030035.

Description Eremophila delisseri is a shrub which grows to a height of less than and has erect, spreading branches which are distinctly grooved. Many parts of the plant, including the branches and leaves, are covered with whitish, branched hairs, giving the plant a greyish-white colour. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, are long, wide, oblong to egg-shaped, wrinkled and are covered with whitish hairs. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 oblong or egg-shaped sepals which are covered with whitish hairs and are long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is lilac coloured except for the inside of the tube which is white with brown spots. The outside of the tube is covered with hairs similar to those on the leaves but the inside of the petal lobes are mostly glabrous. The inside of the tube is filled with long, spidery hairs. Flowering occurs mainly from August to September and is followed by fruits that are dry, oval shaped with a pointed tip, hairy and long. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1866 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (delisseri) is honours Edmund Delisser, a surveyor. Distribution and habitat Eremophila delisseri occurs on the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia. It was previously thought to grow in Western Australia but this may have been because of errors in determining precise location. It grows in calcareous loam. Use in horticulture This species rivals the popular Eremophila nivea as a specimen plant in the garden. It flowers abundantly in spring featuring its lilac-coloured to purple flowers and whitish-grey leaves which curl away from the stem. It can be grown from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. It is drought tolerant and resistant to all but the most severe frosts.

The name \\"Oltcit\\" comes from the region of Oltenia in Romania, with \\"cit\\" being an abbreviation of Citro√´n. The Oltcit logo is also similar to the Citro√´n one, but features only one chevron, as opposed to the two found on Citro√´n's logo, plus the letter \\"O\\". =The 1990s= Daewoo Cielo (1996‚Äì2007) In 1991, as a result of the withdrawal of Citro√´n from the joint venture, the name of the company was changed to Automobile Craiova and production continued under the Oltena brand. In 1994, the company decided to go into partnership (49%-51%) with Korean company Daewoo Heavy Industries (later Daewoo Motors) as Rodae Automobile. After producing the Oltcit between 1981‚Äì1996 (starting 1992 rebadged as Oltena, and as Rodae after 1994), the company started producing the Tico, Cielo and Espero. In 1997, the name was changed to Daewoo Automobile Romania and a new engine and transmission factory was opened by the company, and by 2001 was also producing the Matiz and Nubira II. However, by this time, the main parent company in Korea had collapsed, due to financial problems in South Korea economy and over-expansion in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. In 2002, General Motors bought the bulk of Daewoo Motor in South Korea, but did not buy the plants producing Daewoo cars in Romania, Poland, Ukraine or Uzbekistan. Due to this deal, the Romanian company was not allowed to export their products to neighbouring countries any more, or produce newer models by the new GM Daewoo company. To make matters worse for the company, General Motors started selling the products of the GM Daewoo in 2003, under the Chevrolet brand. =Acquisition by Ford= The first Ford Transit Connect built in Craiova at the presentation event on 8 September 2009 In 2006, the Romanian government bought out Daewoo's 51% in the joint venture for US$ 60 million. A year later, in September 2007, Ford Motor Company was interested to acquire a 72.4 percent stake in the company for 57 million euro and on 21 March 2008 the acquisition contract was signed and Ford officially took over Automobile Craiova (later transferring the fixed assets to Ford Romania). As of May 2009, Ford acquired a majority 95.63% stake in the company. Ford Transit Connect, both the passenger carrying and van models, was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed by low-displacement car engines and a small wagon, the new Ford B-Max. The plant will add a second, as-yet-unnamed small-segment model. In March 2016, it was announced that the Ford EcoSport will be built in Romania, at Craiova plant starting from the autumn of 2017, moving production for the European market from the current plant in Chennai, India. This happens on the background of the growing market for the SUV segment in Europe, and will bring an investment of ‚Ç¨200 million to the factory.

It is low, sprawling shrub with lance-shaped leaves and red, orange or yellow flowers on a long, S-shaped stalk. Description Eremophila decipiens is a low, sprawling shrub with many tangled branches growing to a height of between . The ends of the branches and the leaves are sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately, sometimes densely clustered, sometimes scattered along the stems. They are glabrous, linear to lance-shaped, sometimes with a few irregular teeth on the margins, mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a S-shaped stalk long and at least twice as long as the longest sepal. There are 5 egg-shaped to triangular, slightly overlapping sepals mostly long which are slightly hairy and sticky. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is red, orange or sometimes yellow and lacks spots. The outer surface of the petal tube and lobes are usually glabrous, often sticky while the inside is covered with short hairs. The four stamens extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs from February to December, although in the Esperance region mostly between July and November. The fruits are dry, cylinder-shaped to almost spherical, glabrous with a papery covering and are long.Salmon Gums Hyden Eremophila decipiens is sometimes mistaken for Eremophila glabra but the latter species lacks a long, S-shaped flower stalk. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1921 by Carl Hansen Ostenfeld in Biologiske meddelelser, Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab. The specific epithet is from the Latin decipiens, 'deceiving', 'false', referring to the similarity of this species to E. maculata. Two subspecies are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila decipiens Ostenf. subsp. decipiens that has leaves that are wider than and petals that are glabrous on the outside; *Eremophila decipiens subsp. linearifolia (Moore) Chinnock that has leaves that are narrower than and petals that have glandular hairs on the outside. Eremophila decipiens subsp. linearifolia was first formally described as Eremophila maculata var. linearifolia in 1920 by Spencer Le Marchant Moore. It is much less common than subspecies decipiens. The epithet linearifolia is from Latin, meaning 'long narrow leaved'. Distribution and habitat Eremophila decipiens subsp. decipiens occurs throughout the south-west botanical province but also extends north to Wiluna and east across the Nullarbor Plain to the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. Subspecies linearifolia has a more restricted distribution in the eastern wheatbelt and goldfields. Both subspecies grow in a variety of soil types often in Eucalyptus woodland. Ecology Most species of Eremophila are insect pollinated \\\\- E.decipiens is one of the 40 or so that are pollinated by birds. Conservation status Eremophila decipiens is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Slender fuchsia bush is a hardy garden plant which will grow in most soils in full sun or partial shade and will tolerate harsh drought conditions or severe frosts. Propagation is very difficult from seed but cuttings strike readily when mist is not used. It is long-lived in the garden and some specimens are more than 30 years old. Older specimens respond well to even heavy pruning.

A Hawaiian quilt is a distinctive quilting style of the Hawaiian Islands that uses large radially symmetric applique patterns. Motifs often work stylized botanical designs in bold colors on a white background. Hawaiian quilt applique is made from a single cut on folded fabric. Quilting stitches normally follow the contours of the applique design.  History  Hawaiian quilting derives from the kapa moe, an indigenous bed cover textile. Kapa was constructed from the inner bark of local trees. Traditional kapa was beaten and felted, then dyed in geometric patterns. Quilting may have begun in the Hawaiian islands with the arrival of missionaries and Western fabrics in the 1820s. The climate of Hawaii is unsuitable for cotton cultivation and kapa is unsuitable for quilting so all Hawaiian quilts are constructed from imported material. The earliest written reference comes from Isabella Bird who visited Hawaii in 1870 and wrote a travelogue Six Months in the Sandwich Islands. Flag quilts Another Hawaiian quilt style is the Hawaiian flag quilt, also known as Ku‚Äôu Hae Aloha (\\"My Beloved Flag\\" or \\"Lost Beloved Flag\\") quilts. The typical flag quilt includes four Hawaiian flags surrounding the coat of arms of the Hawaiian Royal Family or crown.Hammond, Joyce D., \\"Hawaiian Flag Quilts: Multivalent Symbols of a Hawaiian Quilt Tradition\\" (1993). Anthropology. Paper 14. http://cedar.wwu.edu/anthropology_facpubs/14 Flag quilts combine pieced work with appliqued motifs, unlike other traditional Hawaiian quilts, which do not use pieced work. Flag quilts may have originated as early as 1843, when Lord George Paulet claimed the Hawaiian Islands for the British and ordered all Hawaiian flags destroyed. Many of these flag quilts date back to the overthrow of the monarchy, when displaying the Hawaiian flag was considered treason. Quilts bearing symbols of the monarchy were a form of silent resistance.http://www.nokaoimagazine.com/Features/Vol12%20No6/Hawaiian_quilts.html File:Ku'u Hae Aloha (My Beloved Flag), Hawaiian cotton quilt from Waimea, before 1918, Honolulu Academy of Arts.jpgKu ªu Hae Aloha (My Beloved Flag), Hawaiian cotton quilt from Waimea, before 1918, Honolulu Museum of Art File:Ua Mau Ke Ea O Ka Aina I ka Pono-Halepualani, Hawaiian quilt, Honolulu Museum of Art 5469.1.JPG Ua Mau Ke Ea O Ka Aina I ka Pono-Halepualani, Hawaiian quilt, silk satin, wool batting, cotton, Honolulu Museum of Art File:Na Kihapai Nani Lua 'Ole O Edena a Me Elenale (The Beautiful Unequaled Gardens of Eden and of Elenale), Hawaiian cotton quilt, before 1918, Honolulu Academy of Arts.jpg Na Kihapai Nani Lua  ªOle O Edena a Me Elenale (The Beautiful Unequaled Gardens of Eden and of Elenale), Hawaiian cotton quilt, before 1918, Honolulu Museum of Art Other styles Queen Liliuokalani Quilt,  ªIolani Palace Hawaiian quilters also made other styles of quilts including embroidering quilts and crazy quilting.

It is a spreading, sticky shrub with wedge-shaped leaves, coloured sepals and usually deep purple flowers. Description Eremophila cuneifolia is a spreading shrub growing to a height of between with hairy branches and with branches and leaves that are thickly covered with sticky, shiny resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and clustered near the ends of the stems, mostly long, about wide, wedge-shaped or heart-shaped but with a distinct small point at the tip. They are thick and stiff and the top surface of the leaves is glabrous while the lower surface is hairy. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on hairy stalks long. There are 5 cream-coloured to pale reddish-purple, slightly overlapping, egg-shaped sepals differing in size from each other but mostly long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is usually deep purple on the outside, sometimes paler, and white inside with purple spots. There are scattered hairs on the outside of the tube and on the lobes but the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering occurs mostly from June to October and is followed by fruits which are oval to cone- shaped, shiny and long.Newman Kennedy Range Form with pale-coloured sepals Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Kraenzlin in 1929 and the description was published in Repertorium Specierum Novarum Regni Vegetabilis Beihefte. The type specimen was collected by the explorer Charles Crossland, near Mount Hale on the upper reaches of the Murchison River, about west north west of Meekatharra. The specific epithet (cuneifolia) is from the Latin words cuneus meaning \\"wedge\\" and folium meaning \\"a leaf\\". Distribution Pinyuru occurs between Leonora, Jigalong and Onslow in the Carnarvon, Little Sandy Desert, Central Ranges, Murchison, Pilbara and Gascoyne biogeographic regions. It grows in a range of soils and habitats, often in association with other Eremophila species and is sometimes the dominant plant species. Conservation status Eremophila cuneifolia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This is one of the most attractive eremophilas in cultivation with its colourful sepals and deep purple flowers. It is not easy to propagate or to maintain, especially in areas like Sydney where the humidity is high. It is usually propagated by grafting onto Myoporum and needs a well-drained soil. Pinyuru is also frost sensitive and for this reason is probably best grown in a container which can be moved as the seasons change.

It is a shrub with many ascending branches making the plant appear broom-like. It has small, hooked leaves and small, though abundant, violet to lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila dichroantha is an erect shrub with many ascending branches which, although glabrous, have many raised glands. It grows to a height of and the ends of the branches and younger leaves are shiny and sticky due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are linear to almost needle-shaped, mostly long, about wide with a curved, hooked tip on the end. The flowers are borne in groups of 3 to 5 in leaf axils on a stalk which is long and sticky when young. There are 5 overlapping, egg-shaped to lance- shaped, brownish sepals which are long. The sepals are glabrous except for the long hairs on their edges, are sticky and remain on the plant long after flowering has finished. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. They are a shade of violet to lilac-coloured, rarely white on the outside and white with violet spots inside the tube. The petal lobes are hairy on the outside and have short, flattened hairs on the inside. The petal tube is mostly glabrous on the outside while the inside of the tube is filled with long, spidery hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to November and is followed by fruit which are oval-shaped, hairy and long.Ravensthorpe Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1904 by Ludwig Diels in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (dichroantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words Œ¥ŒØœáœÅœâœÇ (d√≠khr≈çs) meaning ‚Äútwo-coloured‚Äù and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (√°nthos) meaning ‚Äúflower‚Äù.

She is a national heroine in Cuba. Life The first Cuban war of independence from Spain began in 1868. Women, known as Mambisas, played a significant role in the war, as political agitators, nurses, and fighters. Ana Betancourt, was from a wealthy landholding family and was one of the first to argue for women in Cuban. She was married to the patriot Ignacio Mora de la Pera. In 1869, she addressed the Constitutional Assembly of Cuban patriots at Gu√°imaro in which she linked female emancipation to the abolition of slavery and the struggle against colonialism. Although unused to hardship she lived in the forest with the revolutionaries. On July 9, 1871, she and her husband were taken by surprise by the Spanish forces and captured. She was sentenced to exile in Spain where she lived the rest of her life never seeing de la Pera again. She continued to support the cause of Cuban independence from her exile. At the age of 69 in 1901 she was about to return to her native country but contracted fulminating bronchopneumonia and died before she could begin her journey. Her remains were buried in Spain until 1968. In that year they were set in the pantheon of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, in the Cemetery Col√≥n in Havana. Commemorations She is commemorated in the modern Republic of Cuba by the Order of Anna Betancourt medal, awarded to Cuban women who \\"demonstrate revolutionary and internationalist merit and anti-imperialist fidelity and/or great merit in a field of work that contributes to the national interest.\\" Originally this was the highest award of the Federation of Cuban Women, and the order was officially sanctioned in 1979 as a state award. Notable recipients include the Palestinian poet May Sayegh. The Cuban Ana Betancourt schools for rural girls are named in her honor.

Design and development Designed to Air Ministry Specification 27/24, which called for a single-seat night fighter for use against enemy bomber aircraft, the Bittern design was unusual for its time in that it was a twin-engined shoulder wing monoplane rather than a single-engine biplane. Two prototypes were built. The first was a cantilever wing design with the engines - 214 hp Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx - on the leading edge of the wing. However initial trials showed that the wing was too flexible and so wing struts were added fixed between the bottom of the fuselage and the engine installations. However this added weight and drag with a commensurate effect on performance. The second prototype had the engines suspended from the wings on the struts. The first prototype had two fixed .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns mounted on the fuselage sides. In the second the guns were changed from Vickers to Lewis guns mounted in swiveling barbettes on fuselage. These could be angled from 0-45¬∞ upwards so the fighter could attack bombers from below without having to put the aircraft into a climb. The wingspan of the second prototype was increased by about 5 ft (1.5 m).

The title is an insider nickname for the Central Intelligence Agency. The plot is loosely based on events leading up to the Watergate coverup, centered on Nixon administration attempts to cover up its own illegal activity and that of the CIA dating back to the Kennedy administration. Although all characters are fictional, most are based on real-life political figures, and journalists such as columnist Jack Anderson. Plot summary The protagonist is Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) William \\"Bill\\" Martin, a longtime CIA agent who was appointed DCI by Democratic President Esker Scott Anderson. Anderson, as Vice President, succeeded William Curry, who was killed in a crash of Air Force One in the early 1960s. Martin's friendship with Anderson dates from the 1950s, when he was a lower-level agent and Anderson held a great deal of power as Senate Majority Leader. As Deputy CIA Director, Martin was responsible for planning an undercover invasion of the Dominican Republic by emigres trained and supported by the U.S. However, President Curry, worried about negative repercussions from the invasion, ordered the murder of a priest who led the rebel movement, in order to ensure the invasion's failure. CIA Inspector General, Major-General Antonio Primula, wrote a report blaming Martin, then- DCI Horace McFall and, in part, President Curry for the invasion's failure, and recommending the firing of McFall and Martin. After Curry's death, Anderson appointed Martin as DCI and promised to keep the Primula report secret, in return for Martin's loyalty. Anderson becomes seriously ill during his elected term and declines to run for a second, leaving his Vice President Ed Gilley as the Democratic nominee. Despite Martin's hard work behind the scenes to help elect Gilley, he is defeated by Republican Richard Monckton. Martin sees Monckton, a longtime political enemy of Curry and Anderson, as a threat to himself and the CIA. But Martin retains his position, due mainly to the support of Monckton's National Security Advisor Carl Tessler, a former foreign affairs aide to Governor Thomas J. Forville. Despite his relatively weak position in the new administration, Martin discovers illegal practices of Monckton administration operatives, and uses this knowledge to make a deal with Monckton: he must destroy the Primula Report and assign Martin as ambassador to Jamaica in exchange for Martin's silence on Monckton's illegal activity. Despite Martin's efforts, Monckton's activities are revealed by an investigative reporter, initiating the fall of his administration.

It is an erect shrub with many tangled branches, greyish leaves and flowers which vary in colour, ranging from reddish to yellow or cream. Description Eremophila miniata is an erect shrub or small tree which grows to a height of between and which has thick, brittle, tangled branches with prominently raised leaf scars. The leaves are often crowded at the branch tips and are thick, narrow lance-shaped, slightly sticky, mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk long. There are 5 colourful, overlapping, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, hairy sepals which are mostly long, sometimes longer. The sepals may be green, yellow or orange to purplish-red. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are orange-red to yellow or cream- coloured on the outside and yellow inside sometimes with raised red to orange spots. The petal tube and lobes are hairy inside and outside. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to December and the fruit which follow are dry, oval-shaped with a pointed end, a papery covering, glabrous and about long.Kalgoorlie Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1942 by Charles Gardner from specimens he collected near Cowcowing in the wheatbelt region. The description was published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (miniata) is a Latin word meaning \\"vermilion\\" or \\"bright red\\". Distribution and habitat Kopi poverty bush occurs between Kalgoorlie and Cue in the Avon Wheatbelt, Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Great Victoria Desert, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it grows on sandy hills or in clay flats near salt lakes and drainage lines. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture In a large garden, the two colour forms of this species growing together look attractive and an additional feature is that the colourful sepals often last much longer than the petals. The plant can be propagated from cuttings but, especially in cooler places, grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is more successful. This large shrub or small tree is very hardy and will grow in most soils, including clay and prefers to be in full sun. In nature it is periodically flooded and in the garden is drought hardy but benefits from occasional flooding. It is also moderately frost hardy.

Design and development The Breguet 27 was designed in response to a 1928 request for proposals by the Arm√©e de l'Air. Breguet submitted a large all-metal sesquiplane with an unusual fuselage that ended abruptly, aft of the two open cockpits. The empennage was mounted on a boom behind the fuselage. Construction was largely of steel tubing with non- structural aluminium alloy sheeting and fabric covering for wings and empennage. The prototype exhibited mediocre performance during flight trials. Nonetheless the military placed orders for 85 aircraft in 1930 and 45 in 1932, this latter batch having a more powerful engine fitted. Two high-altitude reconnaissance versions were also built as the Breguet 33, but these did not lead to further production. Operational history Breguet 27s continued in military service through the outbreak of World War II, still equipping three Groupes at the time of the initial German offensive. After they began suffering combat losses, the Army withdrew all remaining examples from service. Codos and Robida, 1932 The two Breguet 33 high-altitude reconnaissance prototypes were used to make significant long-distance flights. The first aircraft was flown from Paris to Hanoi in January 1932 by Paul Codos and Henri Robida in 7 days, 9 hours and 50 minutes, and back again in just 3 days 4 hours and 17 minutes. The second aircraft (christened Jo√© III) was flown by Maryse Hilsz on a tour of Asia, visiting Calcutta, Saigon, Hanoi, and Tokyo before returning to Paris via Saigon, eventually covering around 35,000 km (22,000 mi). Hilsz also won the 1936 Coupe H√©l√©ne Boucher flying a Breguet 27 at an average speed of 277 km/h (172 mph). The French army ordered 85 270s in 1930. In 1932, 45 Breguet 271s, with a more powerful 484 kW (650 hp) engine, and larger useful load were ordered. Older 270s were modified for VIP liaison duties.

One theory says that it might have been founded by the Castilian monarchs as a hamlet in the reconquered territories during the Reconquista. By the mid-14th century, the village had been sold to Medina del Campo by Diego Fern√°ndez de Medina. It was a jurisdictional dominion by the Bishop of √Åvila, Alfonso de Fonseca, until the 19th century. During the 15th century, Do√±a Juana de Portugal (Enrique IV's wife) was imprisoned in the castle of Alaejos. In 1520, the comuneros destroyed a large part of the town. In 1595 it joined Valladolid's Bishopric, even though it kept being part of the Province of Segovia. By year 1785, the Royal Economical Society of Charity (Real Sociedad Caritativo Econ√≥mica) was founded in the town as a part of the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, which promoted several very advanced economic, social and educational activities for the childhood and the youth of the town.

It opened in 1983 and had a prison capacity of 1,256 as of 2006. History Northpoint was originally constructed as a state mental hospital called Kentucky State Hospital. From 1941 to 1946, the U.S. Army controlled the facilities and renamed it Darnell Hospital. It was used to provide care for soldiers suffering from psychiatric illness and to contain German prisoners of war (POWs). In 1946, the hospital was returned to state control for the sum of $1. The facilities were again operated as the Kentucky State Hospital until 1977. From July 1977 through February 1983, the Kentucky Bureau of Social Services operated the facilities as the Danville Youth Development Center, a youth center for juvenile offenders. In January 1983, the Kentucky Department of Corrections received control of the property, and renamed it Northpoint Training Center. It was intended as a minimum- security institution for fewer than 500 inmates, but quickly changed to a medium-security institution with a proposed population of approximately 700 inmates. Status Northpoint consists of and approximately 50 structures. It has a bed capacity of 1,256 inmates, consisting of 1,108 general population medium-security beds, 60 special management beds, and 40 minimum-security beds. General population inmates are housed in six open-bay dormitories. Restricted Housing Unit inmates are housed in single cells in a 60-bed structure separated from the main compound. The perimeter of the secure compound is a double fence high, with razor wire on the bottom and top. The inner perimeter fence has a sensor system that alerts the main control in the event of contact, four armed wall towers, an outside patrol, and a control center. Minimum-Security inmates are housed in two structures outside the secure perimeter. 2009 riot On the evening of August 21, 2009, 60 to 80 inmates were involved in a riot at the facility. Five buildings were set on fire, including the kitchen, medical, visiting, canteen, and a multi-purpose building. By 10:30pm that night, the prison's Corrections Emergency Response Team had subdued the Inmates. Some inmates sustained minor injuries. Damage to the facility was so extensive that some of the 1,200 inmates at the prison were transported to other prisons. The prison had been on lockdown since August 18, when a black inmate and a white inmate were assaulted by 10-15 Hispanic inmates.

During this time, he was actively involved in discussions on SETI, the number of advanced civilizations in Galaxy, and the possibilities interstellar travels. He was skeptical on these issues. In 1961, he published an article in which he was not optimistic about the survival time of species using machines. At the outset, he noted that the current state of mind (primacy of science, developing technology, searching for interstellar communication) is just one of many possibilities and in the future it can be replaced by other interests. Moreover, according to him, the progress of science and technology on Earth was driven by two factors ‚Äì the struggle for domination and the desire for an easy life. The former leads to complete destruction, the latter to biological or psychical degeneration. Von Hoerner assumed that any civilization must disappear after some time and listed 4 possible causes of such a catastrophe: # total destruction of life on the planet # destroying only intelligent beings # mental or physical degeneration # loss of scientific and research interests (related to cause 3.) He estimated the average duration of civilization at 6,500 years. He suggested the succession of technological species on a given planet over a time distance of hundreds of millions of years, and each habitable planet (one in 3 million stars) during its existence \\"produces\\" an average of 4 technological species. With these assumptions, the average distance between civilizations in the Milky Way is 1,000 light-years. Von Hoerner's calculations also show that the probability of establishing first contact with a civilization in the same phase of development as the earthly one is 0.5%. The most likely such contact is with a civilization that will be 12,000 years old and with a 75% probability that it will not be the first civilization on this planet. Hoerner died in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, at age 83. His daughter, Hanna von Hoerner, was also an astrophysicist.

It is located between East 76th and 78th Streets, and between the FDR Drive and a short street called Cherokee Place, on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The park is named for statesman and New York Governor John Jay. In 1902 the city acquired through condemnation a parcel of land at the site of the park and opened a public bath house in 1906. A swimming pool and promenade was built nearby from 1940 to 1942, part of a Work Projects Administration construction program. In 1941 the bath house was renovated to include an auditorium, recreation room, gym, and changing facility which could accommodate 1,002 male and 590 female bathers. In 2010, a substantial upgrade was completed on the bath house, allowing visitors who are disabled to have full access to the facilities. A large playground occupies almost half of the park's total acreage. The remaining half has basketball courts, handball courts, and the pool and bath house.

Its subject is the role of Japanese elites in promoting Japanese imperialism and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; in particular, it examines the role of Crown Prince and Emperor Hirohito in the execution of Japan's Imperial conquest, and his role in postwar Japanese society. According to Professor Charles Sheldon of the University of Cambridge, this book: :is a polemic which, to our knowledge, contradicts all previous scholarly work.... Specialists on Japan have unanimously demolished Bergamini's thesis and his pretensions to careful scholarship.Charles D. Sheldon, \\"Japanese Aggression and the Emperor, 1931-1941, from Contemporary Diaries,\\" Modern Asian Studies 10#1 (1976) pp 1-40; quote on p. 1; online According to Professor Richard Storry at Oxford University, \\"A check of Mr. Bergamini's references reveals the flimsy, gossamer-thin basis of his argument.\\" He concludes, \\"The material that is presented does not supply a foundation on which to build a theory of imperial conspiracy.\\"Richard Storry, \\"Imperial Conspiracy in Japan?\\" Pacific Affairs 45#2 (1972), pp. 272-276, quotes on pp 272, 276. online Professor Alvin Coox reviewing the book in the American Historical Review states: : Most upsetting is the selective, misleading use of sources to buttress a tortured thesis wherein accidents are inconceivable, honest mistakes improbable. The object is to incriminate the emperor personally in every crime and aggression.Alvin D. Coox, American Historical Review 77#4 (1972) p. 1169-1170 online The book concludes that the conventional conclusion of historical analyses ‚Äì that the Imperial household was largely powerless and not culpable or particularly supportive of the imperial adventures, blame for which is assigned to military elites ‚Äì is mistaken. Instead, it asserts that the internal political fighting necessary to gain support for imperialism was a long-premeditated plan supported by all sectors of the elite and especially by members of the imperial family. The reason given as to why the American occupiers allowed the continuation of the institution of the Emperor is that its support was sought for the purposes of fighting Communism and the nearby Soviet Russia. Bergamini draws his conclusion from a variety of sources but gives prominence to his interpretation of various diaries kept by involved figures. Social Troubles Institute The Social Troubles Institute, Social Troubles Research Center or simply Colonization Academy, which Bergamini alleged was founded in 1921, was a think tank dedicated to future conquest plans on the Asian Mainland, and their political implications. It had the patronage of Crown Prince Hirohito and was set up on land that had once been the Imperial Meteorological Observatory. Bergamini describes the Institute as a secret indoctrination center (protected by extensive security measures) for select younger sons, of politicians, Japanese nobility and militarist supporters, who desired to participate in fulfilling the dreams of Imperial conquest harbored among elements of Japan's aristocracy. The first draft of Japanese conquest plans for world domination were traced by Bergamini to the institute. According to Bergamini's theory, graduates of this ultrasecret 'political' think tank, recruited only by special invitation from rightwing circles, continued its 'political' and 'military' practice in the occupation zones in Manchuria. From this 'school' began the political and strategic debate between the Strike North Group (the Army group, pro-war against Soviet Siberia) and the Strike South Group (the Navy group concerned with the Chinese lands and especially Southeast Asia). The Director and principal academic adviser was Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa, with Mitsuru Toyama another 'professor' in the center. Both were adherents to the Black Dragon Society. This center was closed in 1945 by the Allied authorities.

It works by taking a frequency transform, usually a Hadamard transform, of the differences between the pixels in the original block and the corresponding pixels in the block being used for comparison. The transform itself is often of a small block rather than the entire macroblock. For example, in x264, a series of 4√ó4 blocks are transformed rather than doing the more processor- intensive 16√ó16 transform. Comparison to other metrics SATD is slower than the sum of absolute differences (SAD), both due to its increased complexity and the fact that SAD-specific MMX and SSE2 instructions exist, while there are no such instructions for SATD. However, SATD can still be optimized considerably with SIMD instructions on most modern CPUs. The benefit of SATD is that it more accurately models the number of bits required to transmit the residual error signal. As such, it is often used in video compressors, either as a way to drive and estimate rate explicitly, such as in the Theora (since 1.1 alpha2) encoder, as an optional metric used in wide motion searches, such as in the Microsoft VC-1 encoder, or as a metric used in sub-pixel refinement, such as in x264.

The highway runs from PA 61 in Frackville, Schuylkill County northeast to PA 309 in Hazleton, Luzerne County. PA 924 runs through rural areas in the Coal Region, serving Gilberton, Shenandoah, Brandonville, and West Hazleton. The route is mostly a two-lane road with the section between Frackville and Shenandoah a four-lane freeway with an interchange serving Gilberton and another four-lane divided highway section to the west of Hazleton. PA 924 intersects PA 54 in Shenandoah, PA 339 in Brandonville, Interstate 81 (I-81) west of Hazleton, and PA 93 in West Hazleton. PA 924 was designated in 1928 to run from a point between Brandonville and Sheppton northeast to PA 93 in West Hazleton. PA 142 was designated onto the road between U.S. Route 120 (US 120, now PA 61) in Frackville and Ringtown Boulevard north of Shenandoah, where it continued north to Ringtown. PA 924 was extended southwest to PA 142 north of Shenandoah in the 1930s. In 1946, the route was further extended to US 122 (now PA 61) in Frackville, replacing that section of PA 142. PA 924 was extended east to US 309 (now PA 309) in Hazleton in the 1950s. The route was widened to a divided highway between Gilberton and Shenandoah in the 1950s and between Frackville and Gilberton in 1963, with the road moved to a new alignment in Gilberton with an interchange serving the borough. In 1967, PA 924 was realigned to a new divided highway between Humboldt and PA 93 in West Hazleton. Route description PA 924 north of Brandonville PA 924 begins at a junction with PA 61 in the borough of Frackville in Schuylkill County, heading north-northwest on two-lane undivided South Lehigh Avenue, which becomes North Lehigh Avenue a block later. The road passes businesses and homes in the downtown before bending west. The route heads northeast into forests and crosses into the borough of Gilberton, where it becomes a four-lane freeway called Gold Star Highway. PA 924 traverses the Mahantango Mountains, heading east before resuming back to the northeast. The highway passes to the west of a coal mine and comes to a bridge over the Mahanoy Creek and a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line before it has an interchange with Main Street, which serves Gilberton. The route continues northeast near forests and coal mines, passing through a corner of West Mahanoy Township before entering the borough of Shenandoah. Here, PA 924 becomes a four-lane undivided surface road and passes businesses. The road crosses into Mahanoy Township and curves north in the community of Turkey Run, heading through wooded areas. The route crosses back into the borough of Shenandoah and becomes two-lane undivided South Main Street, running past homes and businesses. PA 924 heads into the downtown area and comes to an intersection with PA 54, where the name becomes North Main Street. The road continues past homes and businesses in the northern part of Shenandoah before it curves northwest. PA 924 north in the CDP of Sheppton The route leaves Shenandoah for West Mahanoy Township and becomes Ringtown Boulevard, curving north and east to ascend a forested hill as a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. PA 924 becomes two lanes again and bends to the north, passing to the east of the community of Shenandoah Heights. The road heads into dense forests and turns northeast off Ringtown Boulevard onto an unnamed road, crossing into Union Township and passing to the east of Fetter Pond. The route continues into East Union Township and comes to an intersection with PA 339. At this point, the two routes head north for a concurrency on Main Boulevard and pass through residential areas in the community of Brandonville. PA 339 splits from PA 924 by turning west, with PA 924 continuing along Main Boulevard, curving northeast and running through farmland with some woods and homes. The road crosses the Catawissa Creek and winds northeast through forested areas with some fields, heading east. The route turns north and passes residences in the community of Sheppton as Center Street. PA 924 becomes unnamed and runs through forests with some homes and passes to the east of the community of Oneida, where it curves to the east- northeast through more woodland. PA 924 crosses into Hazle Township in Luzerne County and continues east-northeast through forested areas with some commercial development. The road heads into the Humboldt Industrial Park and widens to four lanes, briefly becoming a divided highway as it crosses a CAN DO Inc. railroad branch line that serves the industrial park. The route becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and runs past more industry as it heads to the south of the Village of Humboldt. PA 924 passes businesses and becomes a four-lane divided highway, coming to an interchange with I-81. Past this interchange, the route passes to the north of the community of Harwood Mines and continues through wooded areas as the four-lane divided CAN DO Expressway. The road passes over Cranberry Creek and Norfolk Southern's Tomhicken Industrial Track railroad line before it bends east and becomes the border between the borough of West Hazleton to the north and the city of Hazleton to the south. PA 924 runs through woods between residential areas to the north and a coal mine to the south before it comes to an intersection with PA 93. Here, the route turns northwest to form a concurrency with PA 93 on four-lane undivided Broad Street, running past homes in West Hazleton. The road turns to the north before PA 924 splits from PA 93 by heading east on two-lane Washington Avenue. The route passes residences and a few businesses, crossing into the city of Hazleton and becoming West 15th Street. PA 924 continues through developed areas of the city and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 309. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, the road between Frackville and Shenandoah was designated as part of Legislative Route 183. PA 924 was designated in 1928 to run from a point between Brandonville and Sheppton northeast to PA 93 in West Hazleton; at this time the entire route was unpaved except for the portion near West Hazleton. The section of the present route between US 120 (now PA 61) in Frackville and Ringtown Boulevard north of Shenandoah was designated as part of PA 142 in 1928; PA 142 continued north from Shenandoah to Ringtown. At this time, the section of PA 142 between Frackville and Sheandoah was paved. By 1930, PA 924 was paved between southwest of Sheppton and the border of Schuylkill and Luzerne counties while the remainder of the route was under construction. At this time, the road between north of Shenandoah and between Brandonville and Sheppton was an unnumbered, unpaved road. In the 1930s, PA 924 was extended southwest to PA 142 (Ringtown Boulevard) north of Shenandoah; at this time the entire route was paved. PA 142 was also widened to a multilane road between Frackville and Gilberton. PA 924 was extended south to US 122 (now PA 61) in Frackville in 1946, replacing that section of PA 142 while the remainder of PA 142 was decommissioned. In the 1950s, PA 924 was extended from PA 29 (now PA 93) in West Hazleton east to US 309 (now PA 309) in Hazleton along 15th Street. In addition, the route was widened to a divided highway between Gilberton and Shenandoah. PA 924 was widened into a divided highway between Frackville and Gilberton in 1963. In Gilberton, the route was shifted east to a new alignment, with an interchange constructed at Main Street. PA 924 previously ran through Gilberton using what is now Old Maizeville Road and Our Lady of Siluva Boulevard; the portions of the former alignment leading the current route have been severed. In 1967, the route was realigned to a new divided highway between Humboldt and PA 93 on the border of Hazleton and West Hazleton, where it turned northwest for a concurrency with PA 93. The route previously followed Main Street through Harwood Mines, Harwood Road, Cranberry Road, and South Broad Street between Humboldt and PA 93 in West Hazleton. A section of the former alignment west of Harwood Mines was severed with the construction of I-81.

It serves as a bypass around the village of Baldwinsville, extending for just over from an intersection with NY 370 in the southeastern part of the village to a junction with NY 48 and NY 690 just north of Baldwinsville in the town of Lysander. The route has a short overlap with NY 31 east of the village. Most of the route is two lanes wide and passes through rural areas around the edge of Baldwinsville, while a part near the Lysander community of Radisson is four lanes wide and serves residential and commercial neighborhoods. A bypass of Baldwinsville had been proposed as early as the 1970s. The earliest concepts for the road called for a long highway connecting NY 690 south of the village to NY 481 in Clay, east of Lysander. After two decades of planning and community input, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) presented four potential alignments for a scaled-back route running from NY 48 to NY 31 in 1994. Although an alignment encircling the village limits was chosen within four years, work on the project was stalled due to a lack of funding. In the meantime, NY 631 was assigned in 1999 to a series of pre-existing local roads that formed a northern bypass of Baldwinsville between NY 48 and NY 31\\\\. The section of the originally planned southern bypass northeast of NY 370 was finally completed in 2001 as an extension of NY 631\\\\. Route description NY 631 begins at an intersection with NY 370 near the eastern edge of Baldwinsville. The route heads northeastward through a residential section of the town of Lysander, paralleling the Baldwinsville village line to an intersection with NY 31 across from an Anheuser-Busch brewery. At this point, NY 631 turns eastward, overlapping with NY 31 for a half-mile (0.8 km) to the southwestern edge of Lysander's Radisson community. The routes split here, with NY 631 heading northward into a commercial district as a four-lane divided highway named Willett Parkway. The commercial properties give way to homes at a junction with the two-lane West Entry Road, where NY 631 turns west to bypass northeast Baldwinsville. While on West Entry Road, the highway crosses mostly undeveloped areas, save for a handful of industrial complexes along the highway. NY 631 northbound on Willett Parkway, just north of NY 31 About from Willett Parkway, NY 631 intersects Sixty Road (unsigned County Route 140 or CR 140) and becomes known as Hencle Boulevard. The route continues on through little more than woods, crossing CSX Transportation's Baldwinsville Subdivision rail line ahead of an intersection with Smokey Hollow Road (CR 229) adjacent to Lysander Park. West of here, the highway continues through undeveloped forests as it curves to the northwest around the far northern extents of Baldwinsville. The woods eventually give way to more open areas ahead of a junction with NY 48 in a rural area northwest of the village. NY 48 and NY 631 briefly overlap to reach an adjacent intersection that serves as the northern terminus of both NY 690 and NY 631. Maintenance of NY 631 varies along the route. From NY 370 to NY 31, as well as on the portions that overlap other state routes, maintenance of NY 631 is performed by NYSDOT. Between CR 140 and NY 48, the roadway is maintained by Onondaga County as CR 95. From NY 31 to CR 140, maintenance is performed by the town of Lysander. The 2017 route log erroneously shows NY 631's southern terminus at NY 31. History =Origins= Plans to construct a bypass of the village of Baldwinsville have existed in some form since at least the mid-1970s. Around that time, NYSDOT developed a proposal for a highway intended to divert traffic away from the Baldwinsville village center and provide access to Radisson, a planned community developed east of Baldwinsville by the New York State Urban Development Corporation. Several alignments of varying endpoints and length were considered by NYSDOT; however, all of the potential routes began south of Baldwinsville at NY 690 and proceeded generally northeastward along the NY 31 corridor to NY 481 in the adjacent town of Clay. The 1988 New York Transportation Bond Act, dubbed \\"Rebuild New York\\", provided funding for the design and planning stages of the project, and NYSDOT began gathering feedback on the project from the community in June 1991. In January 1994, NYSDOT released a new, refined set of plans for the project based on community input that considered four specific alignments for the road. Unlike the original highway proposed 20 years before, the proposed paths, referred to by the state as the Red, Yellow, Purple, and Railroad alternatives, would only run from a point just south of the village center to a location along NY 31 in either eastern Baldwinsville or just east of the village in the town of Lysander. The Red Alternative would begin at NY 48 near the southern village line and head to the northeast, while the Yellow route would start at the junction of NY 48 and Downer Street just across the Seneca River from the village center and proceed to the east. After crossing the Seneca River, the two routes merged to follow a single path north-northeastward across NY 370 to NY 31 in Lysander. The Red and Yellow alternatives were the two most expensive options, with an estimated cost of $15 million and $18 million, respectively. Heading away from NY 370 on NY 631 northbound The other two proposed paths stayed much closer to the village center. Like the Yellow Alternative, the Purple route would begin at the intersection of NY 48 and Downer Street; however, the Purple Alternative went to the northeast instead, meeting NY 370 two blocks southeast of its intersection with NY 31\\\\. At this point, the road would turn north for a short distance to connect to NY 31\\\\. The Railroad Alternative began at the junction of NY 48 and Van Buren Road south of the village and generally paralleled NY 48 northwestward into the village center, where it would end at NY 31 one block to the east of NY 48's junction with NY 31\\\\. The projected price tag on the Railroad Alternative was $14 million, while the Purple Alternative was the least expensive of the four alignments at $11 million. By March 1998, the state had selected the Red Alternative, now projected to cost $20 million. Although the plans to build the road were in place, construction of the highway was delayed for years due to a lack of funding. =Designation and construction= With the bypass project stalled, the state of New York assigned NY 631 in June 1999 to a series of pre- existing, locally maintained roadways between NY 31 and the intersection between NY 48 and NY 690. The new route provided a signed bypass of Baldwinsville, albeit to the north instead of the south. In July 2000, construction finally began on the section of the southern bypass between NY 370 and NY 31\\\\. The $3.1 million highway opened to traffic on October 16, 2001, as part of an extended NY 631. There are currently no plans to build the remainder of the bypass; however, the topic was discussed in August 2012 by officials from the town of Lysander. In 2013, NYSDOT will rehabilitate NY 370's bridge over the Seneca River southeast of the village, partially or completely closing the bridge to traffic for half of the year. The completion of the bypass was one of several ideas proposed by town officials to reduce the impact of the bridge closure on motorists. While the originally chosen Red Alternative called for the highway to intersect NY 48 near the southern village line, the town suggested building the missing segment of the road along the path of the Yellow Alternative to connect to Downer Street instead.
