(Producer) & Hsiung, T. (Director). (2016). The Apology [Film]. Canada: National Film Board of Canada.  Early life  Gil Won-ok was born in 1928 in Pyongyang, North Korea. In 1940, at the age of thirteen, Gil Won-ok boarded a train to a Japanese factory where she was promised work. Instead of being taken to a factory, Gil Won-ok was taken to Harbin, Manchuria, and brought to a comfort station in the winter of 1940 where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Japanese soldiers from the ages of thirteen to eighteen years old. During the years Gil Won-ok spent as a victim of military sexual slavery, she contracted syphilis, which formed tumors in her body, leading to four surgeries. Due to complications, doctors gave Gil Won-ok a hysterectomy which left her sterile. After the war, Gil Won- ok tried to go back home to North Korea, but when she got to the border, it was closed. Gil Won-ok to this day still has been unable to return to her home. In 1998, Gil Won-ok followed the lead of previous comfort women and publicly came out with the sexual violence that was forcefully inflicted upon her for five years of her life. After coming out with the sexual violence that was forced upon her, Gil Won-ok became an activist, advocating for an official apology from Japan for the crimes they committed during World War II. Even though Gil Won-ok was unable to physically have children, she adopted a son after he was left at a gambling house where she worked. He is now a minister. Gil Won-ok currently lives in a home run by The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan called Our Peaceful House, where she resides with other comfort women.  Activist Work  After Gil Won-ok publicly came out with the violent crimes that were inflicted upon her by the Japanese Imperial Army, she vowed to dedicate the rest of her life to demanding an official apology from Japan, as they have failed to take accountability for the crimes that were committed during World War II. Every Wednesday, Gil Won-ok participates in the Wednesday Demonstrations, which have been going on since January 8, 1992, in front of the Japanese Embassy in Korea as an act of protest. Along with participating in the Wednesday Demonstrations, Gil Won-ok travels the world speaking at various location such as the Japanese Women's University, sharing her story while also advocating for an official apology from Japan. Gil Won-ok also participated in the 100 Million Petition Campaign, where the goal was to gather 100 million signatures demanding redress for comfort women. In 2014, Gil Won-ok traveled to Geneva, Switzerland where she delivered 1.5 million signatures to the office of the high commissioner of human rights at The United Nations. = The Butterfly Fund = In 2012, Gil Won-ok and another former comfort woman, Kim Bok-dong, started The Butterfly Fund with the help of The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan as a way to help victims of sexual war crimes around the world. Both women vowed to donate all the funds they have received as compensation for the war crimes that were inflicted on them in order to help women who have been put in similar situations to that of them. Some of the individuals who have been recipients of the fund include victims of the Second Congo War along with rape victims from the Vietnam War whose violence was inflicted on by Koreans.  The Apology  The 2016 film The Apology, directed by Tiffany Hsiung, follows three former comfort women who bring to light their personal experiences spent as victims of wartime sexual slavery, while also with focusing on the ways in which they are demanding an official apology from Japan. The film focuses on Gil Won-ok's personal experience during her time spent as a comfort woman, while also following her through her various travels as an activist. In the film, Gil Won-ok travels to the Japanese Women's University, China, and lastly Switzerland where she presented the United Nations 1.5 million signatures demanding redress to the 200,000 women who were victims of wartime sexual slavery.

Background Agnes's feast day of 21 January was adopted as Holy Day of Obligation in Iceland in 1179 under √ûorl√°kr √û√≥rhallsson.

The small town of Jen≈°tejn was founded with a small, water- protected castle in the first half of the 14th century by Jenc of Janovice (from here the name ‚Äújenc¬¥s stone‚Äú = \\"Jencenstein\\"), a high-ranking official in court yard, in 1336‚Äì1361. Lords of Jen≈°tejn have their family name from the name of the castle. Since 1958 it has been protected as a cultural monument of the Czech Republic. The castle was opened to the public after the reconstruction in 1977. Today is the castle is under the wooden frame, but still open for people. In the castle it is possible to find an exhibition of the Regional Museum of Prague-East about life in the castle with period paintings and a model of the castle. The castle tower surpasses the surrounding plain and is used as a lookout tower over the local landscape. 261x261px  History  The first mention of the Jen≈°tejn Castle dates back to 1341, when it was owned by Jenc of Janovice, probably its builder. It is believed that it was founded sometime in the thirties of the 14th century. Only the lower part of the tower was preserved From this period of the castle, consisting of regular ashlar and adjacent walls. In 1368, the royal chamber notary Pavel of Vla≈°im bought the castle. This branch of the family soon became a family from Jen≈°tejn (they also took over the coat of arms - two vulture heads). Pavel z Vla≈°imi, the brother of Prague Archbishop Jan Oƒçko of Vla≈°im, began to write (in the middle of the 14th century) as Paul of Jen≈°tejn (‚ÄúPaulus de Jenczenstein‚Äù). Pavel of Jen≈°tejn had four childs: Martin, Pavel, Jan and V√°clav and everyone also used a nickname ‚Äúfrom Jen≈°tejn‚Äú. Jan became the third Prague archbishop in 1380 after his uncle Jan Oƒçko of Vla≈°im. before he became the Archbishop of Prague, he spent his youth at Jen≈°tejn and inherited the castle after death of his brother Martin. During his lifetime he made extensive reconstruction of the whole castle. Jan of Jen≈°tejn was an important scholar and one of the most important figures of his timeline and so he needed representative place to show his position. Rebuilding has to reflected the importance and social prestige of its owner. The tower still bears typical features of the royalty castles: in addition to the profiling of the portals, it is the intentional use of the ≈†tauf bossage masonry, mainly for aesthetic function. However, Jan soon got into disputes with V√°clav IV, who attacked the castle and then confiscated it in 1390. The king gave the castle to his favorite, under-chamberlain Sigismund Huller. Jan of Jen≈°tejn was humiliated and forced to abdicate (1396), died in complete poverty and forgetting in 1400 in Rome. today's village flag is inspired by the coat of arms of family of Jen≈°tejn. = Destruction of castle = In the following decades, the castle was owned by many owners (Old≈ôich of ƒåernice of K√°cov, Ctibor ƒåepec of Libi≈°, Jind≈ôich of Aachen, Jan Libick√Ω of Libice and others). Between 1408 and 1414 Prokop Hol√Ω reportedly grew up in the castle. Finally, his last owner was Jan Dob≈ôichovsk√Ω of Dob≈ôichov, who acquired the castle in 1560, but he drunk it, and when he died in 1583, the castle, at that time called the chateau, took the Czech Chamber due fines and added it in 1587 to the estate of Brand√Ωs. Castle lost his sense, was not inhabited and quickly fell into disrepair, so that after ten years, in 1597, the governor of Brand√Ωs Ka≈°par of Mil≈°tejn announced to the chamber that Jind≈ôich Homut of Harasov asked \\"for an old truss with other wood in the abandoned chateau of Je≈°tejn‚Äù (‚Äúo star√Ω krov s jinejm d≈ô√≠v√≠m v pust√©m z√°mku Jen≈°tejnsk√©m‚Äù), but added that ‚Äúover the same castle at the tower, still a piece of brickwork around 15 pairs of rafters is standing, with beams, hambalets‚Ä¶ ‚Äù (‚Äúnad t√Ωm≈æ z√°mkem p≈ôi vƒõ≈æi je≈°tƒõ kus krovu ciheln√©ho okolo 15 p√°r≈Ø krokv√≠ stoj√≠, s tr√°my, p≈ôednicemi, hambalky ...‚Äù), and perhaps at that time he still considered the repair of the building possible. However, no repairs were made, because the 1608's record notes Jen≈°tejn as an \\"old and derelict castle\\". castle without scaffolding In 1640, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was burned down by the Swedish army. After the Thirty Years' War, Jen≈°tejn remained for a long time only burnt, ravaged, and empty grunts, according to the Brand√Ωs urbary from 1651 \\"the Jen≈°tejn fortress ... used to be bricks covered and with few rooms inside. It stands on a rock, around fortress is trench deep fill with water, a wooden bridge was over it, and it is all abandoned and so desolate. (‚Äútvrz Jen≈°tejn ... b√Ωvala cihlami p≈ôikryta a v n√≠ pokoj≈Øv nemnoho.

It was settled until the beginning of the 20th century. However, the families often interfered with the interior of the tower, which greatly damaged it. Their interventions were removed during the modern reconstruction. The material of the crumbling castle was also used by the locals to build their houses, which was in the case of abandoned settlements, churches, castle, etc., which is a common affair. From 2016 until today (2019), the exterior facade of the tower is being preserved under wooden construction.  Type of the castle  Castle in 1795 Castle in 1834 Jen≈°tejn was founded as a water castle in valley on a low sandstone rock. The deep, rock-cut moat could be filled with water from several lakes at Vino≈ô Creek at any time. Today, the moat is backfilled and built up by recent buildings. We do not know the form or position of the barbican. An unusual oval shape excelled in the castle's layout and the 28-meter-high tower is the first visible part of the castle. A castle core has a triangular shape.The oldest building structure is located only in a sub-part of Bergfrit and the adjacent part of the wall, which is lined with smaller stones. Three palace wings surrounded the small courtyard. The north disappeared almost without a trace, because the rock below was largely excavated. From the front palace on the east side stood a part of the courtyard wall with arched entrance to the basement. A small fragment of the portal lining in the same wall illustrates the height of the original entrance. The courtyard and parts of the side walls have been preserved from the third palace. The dominant feature of the preserved part of the castle is a 28-meter-high round tower on which are three coats of arms of the owners carved from sandstone are placed at the entrance. On the second floor of the tower is a chapel on a circular ground plan. A wooden spiral staircase leads through the tower. Remains of the circumferential walls of the former palace are preserved in the courtyard. The tower was raised by Jan of Jen≈°tejn, which can be see in follow-up of narrower upper part to the wider lower one. This was used as a walkway for guards, later it was converted to a covered gallery. The original entrance was on the first floor after a drawbridge, but later a new one was created on the ground floor. The tower was covered with a stone helmet with four dormers, the remains of the roofing can be seen on the old engravings (still visible on 19th century engravings). floor plan in the middle the coat of arms of the family of Jen≈°tejn During the reconstruction of Jan of Jen≈°tejn, a private chapel was built on the second floor of the round tower. The circular ground plan of the chapel is vaulted with a ribbed vault with a small smooth bolt in the middle. There is also a small pentagonal presbytery vaulted with a ribbed vault and the same smooth bolt. The presbytery is illuminated by a narrow window with Gothic arch. There is a stone altar with an archbishop's personal coat of arms under the triumphal arch, which has simple geometrically indicated column base on the side of the presbytery. The bust of Archbishop Jan of Jen≈°tejn (the most important owner of the castle) was added after the modern reconstruction into the chapel space. The bust is a replica of the triforium in St. Vitus Cathedral. In the lower part of the tower are cellars, which probably served as pantry and chambers. There are two more floors above the chapel, the first floor can be entered by a narrow spiral staircase. There is usually a small exhibition. Above this floor is unsheltered floor, accessible from ladder used as view point.  Current Restoration 2016 - 2019  The reconstruction is funded by the Ministry of Culture grant and runs only 6 months in a year. The high cost of renting a classic tubular scaffold, which was not financed by the Ministry of Culture, was problematic. Therefore, a type of the wooden scaffolding was paid by the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. The structure is now the property of the village and after the realization period (3 years), there will be a fine quality timber. The scaffolding also protects neighborhood from the falling parts of the wall, which has been a great danger for the owners of surrounding houses in recent years. Thanks to the scaffolding, a number of mandatory works could be carried out: a restoration works, an operative research by experts from the National Heritage Institute, geodetic research, litological evaluation - (macroscopic stone research by a geologist) and detailed photographic documentation. The construction of the scaffolding started in December 2015 and was completed in March 2016. The restoration work in this period was limited, it was in fact cleaning of the masonry and execution of sample repairs, but mostly restoration and an operative search. The scaffolding also includes a tower roofing. This allows work on the remains of the romantic extension, which has long been thought to be the remnant of the original Gothic tower. Poor condition of the helmet negatively affects the condition of the masonry on the top floor of the tower. = 2017 = The restoration work consists mainly in the careful removal of incoherent masonry seams, filling deep caverns in the upper tower floors.It will also be important to remove unsuitable artificial substitutes for resin-based stone and replenish these places with stonework. = Today (2019) = The exterior face of the tower is being preserved and reconstruction work will continue when the weather conditions will allowed to do so. The ruins of the Jen≈°tejn Castle represent historically valuable structure due to the connection of the royal court and the person of Jan of Jen≈°tejn. The reconstruction of the tower is a great chance to correct ill-performed works of past reconstructions and to stop the degradation of stonework, which in a long-term is not tolerable and poses a danger to the structure.

The Cerberus was a true monitor: a ship with shallow draught, only a few (heavy) guns and decent armor. These characteristics made her very suitable to operate way inland in the Dutch delta. The first ironclad built in the Netherlands The Cerberus was laid down at the Rijkswerf on 30 November 1867. This was shortly before the Ram Turret Guinea was laid down. It made the Cerberus the first purpose-built ironclad that was laid down in the Netherlands. The machinery and boilers for the Cerberus were made by the Nederlandsche Stoombootmaatschappij in Feyenoord (Rotterdam). Construction suffered from the relative backwardness of the Dutch shipbuilding industry. The relatively long construction time was consistent with this. On 14 January 1869 the Cerberus was finally launched. In mid-July 1870 the Cerberus was tested on the IJ_(Amsterdam). The reviews were very positive, but with the industrial interests involved they should not be taken too seriously. = Hastily put into service = Right after the sea-trials the Cerberus was taken into service on 21 July 1870. This was during the tensions caused by the Franco-Prussian war, that could easily spill over into the Netherlands. The first captain of the Cerberus was Lieutenant 1st class H.A. Ridder van Rappard. Up till then, Van Rappard had been commander of the Heiligerlee. This appointment probably had to do with a desire to make the Cerberus effective as soon as possible. Near the end of the season, Cerberus was decommissioned on 31 October 1870. After sailing for only one season, the Cerberus would be 'in preservation' for 10 years in Willemsoord. Construction Faults Generic criticism about the ships of the navy was quite common in the Netherlands. The criticism about the Cerberus was more specific and rather serious: All armored ships built abroad were said to have been carefully and well constructed. To the contrary the Cerberus was said not to suffice at all: Not one of the tower's armor plates fitted well, and in many places 2-3cm of cement had been applied to stop the gaps. The tower rotated only with much effort, while on the foreign ships this went very well. The openings to load coal were made in the same place as on the Heiligerlee, but on the Cerberus the higher boilers were under these openings, instead of the coal bunkers. The ship was furthermore rather leaky. In contrast to such rather blunt statements in the Dutch East Indies press, a Dutch newspaper limited itself to noting that the fault in the Cerberus had been repaired. Still later there was another not very specific message about 'the Cerberus and its many faults'. By noting that 'the art of armoring had to be learned' it kind of confirmed the notes about its armor. An engineer downplayed the defects of all the monitors, but noted that one could not expect a shipyard that was used to work in wood to deliver the 'same neatness in ironwork' as a company that had 25 years of experience. Cerberus in service again 1880 = Back into service after 10 years = In 1880 the Cerberus was commissioned again in Willemsoord. On board, the conscripts stationed nearby would exercise the handling of heavy artillery. In early November 1880 the Cerberus was under the command of Lieutenant 1st class D.G. Brand. From Nieuwediep she was towed to the Rijkswerf, where she arrived on 6 November. On 16 May 1881 the Cerberus went back to Willemsoord, again she was towed. Her commander was Lieutenant von Schmidt auf Altenstadt, and in Willemsoord she would be manned with conscripts, who would be trained in naval affairs. In November von Schmidt auf Altenstadt and a (new?) crew were on board the Ram Turret Guinea. On 2 November the Guinea left the Rijkswerf to be towed to Nieuwediep along the Noordhollandsch_Kanaal. There this crew would transfer to the Cerberus, and bring her back to the Rijkswerf. = The Cerberus is modernized 1882-1884 = In 1882 the Cerberus was mentioned in the naval budget as destined for the defense of the Zuiderzee together with the Draak, Matador, Wesp and Bloedhond. Also in 1882, the Rijkswerf started to modernize the Cerberus. The two muzzle- loaders replaced by one 28cm/L22 Krupp gun, the iron turret armor was replaced by compound armor, and the boilers were replaced. The compound armor for the Cerberus was delivered by Cammell & Co in Sheffield Even while the ship was 10 years old, the decision to renew the tower and replace the boilers of the Cerberus was peculiar, because they had only been used for one season. = Part of a squadron 1885 = On 26 June 1885 the Cerberus would be put into service again at Amsterdam under Lieutenant P.G. Bruch. She would be part of a squadron together with the Stier and Buffel and the gunboats Ulfr, Hefring, Bulgia and Das. In July and August the Cerberus made some trips on the Zuiderzee. In mid August she finally arrived in Nieuwediep to be part of the squadron. In the second week of September she took part in the planned joint exercises with the army near Den Helder. While entering Nieuwediep again on 27 August, she hit the frigate Evertsen, with both suffering some damage On 24 October the Cerberus would decommissioned again, and therefore she left Nieuwediep on 18 October. In service for a prolonged period 1889-1894 = In service again 1889 = In January 1889 the naval department ordered electrical lighting for the Cerberus at the company Smit & Co in Slikkerveer. The Cerberus was to be put into service again on 21 June 1889 under Captain-lt H.J. de Wal The Cerberus would be part of a squadron un Captain Mac Leod, consisting of the Buffel, Stier, Matador and Cerberus and 4 gunboats. In late June the Cerberus steamed to the Zuiderzee with the gunboats Bulgia and Geep. They sailed to Hoorn, and after staying there for some days they left again Willemsoord. In mid July the designed squadron was formed, and on 20 August it left Nieuwediep, the operation was delayed because the Cerberus got a rope in its keel. After the exercises ended on 1 November something new happened with the Cerberus. It had been decided that it would go back to Amsterdam, but would stay in service during the winter. = Exercises 1890 = While the Cerberus was in Amsterdam Captain-Lt de Wal became harbor-master of Den Helder on 1 January 1890. That same day he was replaced by Captain-lt J.R. Eck as commander of the Cerberus. The main plan for 1890 was that the Cerberus would join the big exercises near Willemstad. In early April the Cerberus left the dock in order to be inspected. On 17 April the Cerberus was at anchor before Harlingen. On 21 April she was at Terschelling, from whence she left for Nieuwediep on 24 April, and arrived there the same day. After some shooting exercises near Texel the Cerberus left Nieuwediep for the Zuiderzee on 6 May. It went to Amsterdam, from whence she left for the Zuiderzee on 28 May. On 6 June she was in Amsterdam. On 17 June she left Amsterdam again. In late June 1890 the Cerberus, Bloedhond and Panter and 5 gunboats left Amsterdam for the Zuiderzee. They went to Nieuwediep. While there, they were joined by the Ram Turret Stier, and on 5 August they left for the Zuiderzee. On 24 August the exercises on the Zuiderzee ended, and the Cerberus returned to Amsterdam. On 11 September the Cerberus arrived in Nieuwediep. On 8 October the Cerberus was in the Oosterdok in Amsterdam. In October it became known that the Cerberus would be kept in service for yet another season in Amsterdam. In mid December the Cerberus was tasked with helping to keep the Noordzee Kanaal ice-free. This might have been a good idea, but the monitor's bow was to blunt to break the ice. The final rather sad result was that the warship hindered the commercial traffic. = Exercises in the South 1891 = On 29 March 1891 the Cerberus was inspected by vice-admiral W.F.H. Cramer. On 1 April she left for Willemsoord. After arriving there on the 3rd, she was inspected in the dry dock. On 15 April she left Willemsoord for the Zuiderzee. It had been ordered that by 1 May 1891 J.R. Eck would become commander of the 'Wachtship' in Amsterdam. He would be succeeded on the Cerberus by A.G. Ellis The Cerberus sailed back to Amsterdam, and to all appearances this change of command took place in Amsterdam near 1 May. On 4 May it left Amsterdam under its new commander to exercise on the Zuiderzee. At the end of May 1891 it returned to Amsterdam in order to resupply. On 4 June the Cerberus arrived in Nieuwediep. On 16 June the Cerberus arrived in Terschelling, from whence it left for Nieuwediep on the 18th. On 23 June she left Nieuwediep for exercises on the Zuiderzee. In late June the Cerberus and the Panter arrived in Amsterdam, where they would be part of the squadron welcoming the German emperor in Amsterdam. In July 1891 a squadron was formed, consisting of the Guinea and Buffel, the monitors Draak, Panter and Cerberus, the gunboats Heimdal, Balder, Bulgia, Hydra and Idjen, and some torpedo boats. Under the command of the captain of the Guinea, it would exercise in the south. On 14 July the ram turrets, monitors and torpedo boat Idjen arrived in Hellevoetsluis from Ijmuiden. On 18 July the Heimdal, Balder and Braga arrived in Hellevoetsluis from IJmuiden. The other torpedo boats returned to Willemstad. On 31 July the Buffel, Panter, Cerberus, Heimdall, Braga and Balder arrived in Schiedam. They were to exchange their conscripts, and to return to Hellevoetsluis immediately. On 15 August the Cerberus arrived in Rotterdam together with the Draak, and three smaller ships. On 2 September 1891 the large naval and army exercises near the entrance to the Haringvliet started. During the exercise the Cerberus got stuck and was therefore presumed to have been deleted by a torpedo attack, a rather likely consequence of getting stuck. After the exercise had ended, the Cerberus left for the north on 1 October. On 3 October 1891 the Cerberus arrived in IJmuiden. She continued to Amsterdam, but after docking in Amsterdam she left for Willemsoord. On 13 October she arrived in Nieuwediep. On 15 October she left Nieuwediep for the Zuiderzee. She was destined to reach Stavoren on 18 October. On 21 October she was back in Nieuwediep. On 31 October she reached Amsterdam by way of the Noordhollandsch Kanaal. While in Amsterdam the Cerberus would get new boilers made by 'De Schelde' in Flushing. By 1 January 1892 Commander Ellis would be replaced by Captain-Lt C. Hoffman. = Modernized again = On 1 January Captain-lt C. Hoffman indeed took command of the Cerberus while it was in the Oosterdok in Amsterdam. In early April she left Amsterdam for the Zuiderzee, and on 14 April she returned. Meanwhile the secretary for the navy announced again that she would get new boilers. On 19 April she left Amsterdam for Nieuwediep in order to visit the dry dock there. She arrived on the 20th, and after nothing serious was found she left again for the Zuiderzee on 27 April. On 13 May she arrived in Harlingen, from whence she left on 16 May. On 18 May she arrived in Nieuwediep, from whence she left for the Zuiderzee on 23 May. On 28 May she returned to Amsterdam after 'exercises near the Frisian Isles'. On 13 June the Cerberus arrived in Terschelling. On 13 June the Cerberus arrived in Amsterdam to be laid up On 14 June she was decommissioned and the Tijger put into service, with Hoffman becoming the commander of the latter. In the end the NSBM in Rotterdam got the order to repair the steam engines and to replace the boilers of the Cerberus. Therefore the Cerberus would be brought to Rotterdam. On 5 October the Cerberus left IJmuiden for Rotterdam in company of the tugboat Zuid-Holland. In March 1893 the Cerberus got an electrical night- signal machine type Conz. On 5 May the Cerberus and the accompanying tugboat Zuid-Holland arrived back in IJmuiden from Rotterdam. On 6 May she arrived in Amsterdam. = Engine damage near Urk = On 10 June the Cerberus was put into service again under Captain-lt W.A. Buitendijk. Four days later she was inspected by VA Mac Leod. On 16 June the Cerberus left Amsterdam for the Zuiderzee. She suffered major engine damage near Urk on 23 June. She managed to return to Amsterdam after temporary repairs, but had to be towed into the harbor by two tugboats. By 2 July she was repaired, and on 12 July she left Amsterdam again for the Zuiderzee. On 1 August she arrived in Willemsoord to enter the dry dock. After that a busy schedule of voyages followed. On 3 August she anchored before Vlieland. On 6 August the Cerberus left Harlingen. On 21 August she was back in Amsterdam. On 18 September she left Harlingen again. On 19 September she arrived in Nieuwediep. On 25 September she left again, and on the 26th she arrived in Terschelling. On 13 October she arrived in Nieuwediep, and left again on the 16th. On 1 November 1893 the Cerberus was decommissioned in Amsterdam = More trips 1894 = In early April 1894 the Cerberus entered the dry dock in Amsterdam. She was to be put into service again on 9 June under Captain-Lt G.A. van der Mieden. On 14 June she was inspected by VA Mac-Leod. She arrived in Terschelling on 25 June, and then sailed to Vlieland, from whence she left on 26 June. On 12 July the Cerberus got stuck near Pampus, and on 15 July this was still the case. On 25 July she arrived in Vlieland. The next day she arrived in Nieuwediep. By 21 August Van der Mieden would be replaced by Captain-Lt by P. Heyning.. On 30 July the Cerberus left Nieuwediep, and the next day she passed Vlieland, and sailed to Harlingen. A few days later she arrived in Hoorn. Near 10 August she was loading coal in Hembrug.

A loop-gap resonator (LGR) is an electromagnetic resonator that operates in the radio and microwave frequency ranges. The simplest LGRs are made from a conducting tube with a narrow slit cut along its length. The LGR dimensions are typically much smaller than the free-space wavelength of the electromagnetic fields at the resonant frequency. Therefore, relatively compact LGRs can be designed to operate at frequencies that are too low to be accessed using, for example, cavity resonators. These structures can have very sharp resonances (high quality factors) making them useful for electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments, and precision measurements of electromagnetic material properties (permittivity and permeability). Background Loop-gap resonators (LGRs) can be modelled as lumped-element circuits. The slit along the length of the resonator has an effective capacitance C and the bore of the resonator has effective inductance L. At, or near, the resonance frequency, a circumferential current is established along the inner wall of the resonator. The effective resistance R that limits this current is, in part, determined by the resistivity \\\\rho and electromagnetic skin depth \\\\delta of the conductor used to make the LGR. It is, therefore, possible to model the LGR as an LRC circuit. Since the LGR current is a maximum at the resonant frequency, the equivalent circuit model is a series LRC circuit. This circuit model works well provided the dimensions of the resonator remain small compared to the free-space wavelength of the electromagnetic fields. One advantage of the LGR is that it produces regions of uniform electric and magnetic fields that are isolated from one another. A uniform electric field exists within the slit of the LGR and a uniform magnetic field exists within the bore of the resonator. The uniform magnetic field makes the LGR a good source of microwave magnetic fields in ESR experiments. Furthermore, because the electric and magnetic fields are isolated from one another, one can use the LGR to independently probe the electric and magnetic properties of materials. For example, if the gap of the LGR is filled with a dielectric material, the effective capacitance of the LGR will be modified which will change the frequency f_0 and quality factor Q of the resonance. Measurements of the changes in f_0 and Q can be used to fully determine the complex permittivity of the dielectric material. Likewise, if the bore of the LGR is filled with a magnetic material, the effective inductance of the LGR will be modified and the resulting changes in f_0 and Q can be used to extract the complex permeability of the magnetic material.  Resonant Frequency and Quality Factor  Cross-sectional view of a cylindrical loop-gap resonator with the critical dimensions labelled. =Resonance frequency= The capacitance of the gap of the LGR is given by : C = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{w\\\\, \\\\ell}{t} \\\\,, where \\\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space, w is the thickness of the bore wall, t is the gap width, and \\\\ell is the length of the resonator. The resonator bore acts as a single-turn solenoid with inductance given by : L = \\\\mu_0 \\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\, r_0^2}{\\\\ell} \\\\,, where \\\\mu_0 is the permeability of free space and r_0 is the inner radius of the LGR bore. For a high-Q resonator, the resonant frequency is, to an approximation, given by : f_0 \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{LC}}=\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi r_0}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{t}{\\\\pi w}}\\\\,, where c=1/\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\mu_0} is the vacuum speed of light. Therefore, the resonant frequency of the LGR is determined from is geometry and is, to first approximation, independent of its length. =Quality factor= For a highly underdamped series LRC circuit, the quality factor, which determines the sharpness of the resonance, is given by : Q \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L}{C}}\\\\,. The effective resistance of a LGR can be estimated by considering the length of conductor through which the current travels and the cross-sectional area available to it. The relevant conductor length is the circumference 2\\\\pi r_0 of the conductor's inner surface. The depth that the current penetrates into the inner surface of the LGR bore is determined by the electromagnetic skin depth \\\\delta. Therefore, the cross- sectional area through which charge flows is \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\ell. Combining these results gives an effective resistance : R_\\\\rho \\\\approx \\\\rho\\\\frac{2\\\\pi r_0}{\\\\delta\\\\,\\\\ell}\\\\,, where \\\\rho is the resistivity of the conductor. The effective capacitance, inductance, and resistance then lead to a simple expression for the expected quality factor of the LGR : Q \\\\approx \\\\frac{r_0}{\\\\delta}\\\\,, where, for a good conductor, the electromagnetic skin depth at the resonance frequency is given by : \\\\delta \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\rho}{\\\\mu_0\\\\omega_0}}\\\\,, and \\\\omega_0=2\\\\pi f_0. For an aluminum resonator with r_0 =1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm} and f_0=1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{GHz} the above analysis predicts Q\\\\approx 3900. =Radiative losses= In practice, the measured quality factor a cylindrical LGR, without additional electromagnetic shielding, will be much less than the predicted value of r_0/\\\\delta. The suppression of the quality factor is due to radiative power loss from magnetic field lines that extend out of LGR bore and into free space. An order-of- magnitude estimate of the effective radiation resistance can be made by treating the LGR as a conducting loop. In the limit that the wavelength of the radiation is much larger than the loop radius r_0, the radiation resistance is : R_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{\\\\varepsilon_0}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0 r_0}{c}\\\\right)^4\\\\,, and can be much larger than the resistance R_\\\\rho due to the resistivity of the LGR conductor. The radiative losses can be suppressed by placing the LGR inside a circular waveguide. Provided that the cutoff frequency of the lowest TE11 waveguide mode is well above the resonant frequency of the LGR, the magnetic field lines will be prevented from propagating into free space. The presence of the electromagnetic shield will alter the resonant frequency and quality factor of the LGR, but typically by only a few percent. =Toroidal LGR= Drawing of a toroidal LGR with a section cut out so as to expose the bore and gap of the resonator. Photograph of the two halves of a copper toroidal loop-gap resonator. Also visible are an inductive coupling loop suspended within the resonator bore and a so-called extended split-ring resonator placed in the LGR bore. In some applications requiring high quality factors, the electromagnetic shielding provided by a concentric circular waveguide surrounding a cylindrical LGR can be bulky and awkward to work. A toroidal LGR can be used for high-Q measurements without requiring additional electromagnetic shielding. In the toroidal geometry the two ends of a cylindrical LGR are joined to form a completely closed structure. In this case, the magnetic field is completely confined within the bore of the resonator and there is no radiative power loss. The toroidal LGR consists of two halves that are bolted together along the outer diameter of the structure. Like the cylindrical LGR, the toroidal LGR can be modelled as a series LRC circuit. In general, the effective capacitance, inductance, and resistance of the toroidal LGR will differ from the expressions given above for the cylindrical LGR. However, in limit that the radius of the torus is large compared to the bore radius r_0, the capacitance, inductance, and resistance of the toroidal LGR are approximated by the expressions above if one takes \\\\ell to be equal to the circumference of the torus. The toroidal LGR is particularly convenient when characterizing the electromagnetic properties of liquid samples or particles suspended in a liquid. In these cases, the bore of the toroidal LGR can be partially filled with the liquid sample without requiring a special sample holder. This setup allows one to characterize the magnetic properties of, for example, a ferrofluid. Alternatively, if the liquid sample is nonmagnetic, the entire toroidal LGR can be submerged in the liquid (or gas). In this case, the dielectric properties of the sample only modify the effective capacitance of the resonator and the changes in f_0 and Q can be used to determine the complex permittivity of the sample. Coupling to a LGR Inductive coupling loops are typically used to couple magnetic flux into and out of the LGR. The coupling loops are made by first removing a length of outer conductor and dielectric from a semi-rigid coaxial cable. The exposed centre conductor is then bent into a loop and short-circuited to the outer conductor. The opposite end of the coaxial cable is connected to either a signal generator or a receiver. In the case of a signal generator, an oscillating current is established in the coupling loop. By Faraday's law of induction, this current creates and oscillating magnetic flux which can be coupled into the bore of the LGR. This magnetic flux, in turn, induces circumferential currents along the inner wall of the LGR. The induced current, once again by Faraday's law, creates an approximately uniform oscillating magnetic field in the bore of the LGR. A second coupling loop, connected to a receiver, can be used to detect the magnetic flux produced by the LGR. Alternatively, using a vector network analyzer (VNA), a single coupling loop can be used to both inject a signal into the LGR and measure its response. The VNA can measure the ratio of the forward and reflected voltages (S_{11}, or reflection coefficient) as a function of microwave frequency. Far away from resonance, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient will be close to one since very little power is coupled into the LGR at these frequencies. However, near the resonance frequency f_0, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient will fall below one as power is transferred into the LGR. The coupling between the external circuits and the LGR can be tuned by adjusting the relative positions and orientations of the coupling loop and LGR. At critical coupling, impedance matching is achieved and the reflection coefficient approaches zero. It is also possible to capacitively couple electric fields into and out of the gap of the LGR using suitably-fashioned electrodes at the end of a coaxial cable. Multi-Loop, Multi-Gap LGRs Designs of some multi-loop, multi-gap LGRs. Top: Two-loop, one-gap LGR. Middle: Three-loop, two-gap LGR. Bottom: Five-loop, four-gap LGR. Photograph of an aluminum two-loop, one-gap LGR. Also visible are an inductive coupling loop suspended within the right-hand bore of the resonator and a 2\\\\times 2 array of planar split-ring resonators in the left-hand bore of the resonator. Multi-loop, multi-gap LGRs have also been developed. The simplest of these is the two-loop, one-gap LGR. In this case, magnetic field lines form closed loops by passing through each of the bores of the LGR and the currents on the inner walls propagate in opposite directions - clockwise in one bore and counterclockwise in the other. The equivalent circuit, neglecting losses, is a parallel combination of inductors L and L_0 in series with capacitance C. If L=L_0, then the resonant frequency of the two-loop, one-gap LGR is \\\\sqrt{2} times greater than that of the conventional one-loop, one-gap LGR having the same bore and gap dimensions. It is also worth noting that, since magnetic field lines pass from one bore to the other, radiative power losses are strongly suppressed and the resonator maintains a high quality factor without requiring additional electromagnetic shielding. The multi-loop, multi-gap LGRs with more than two loops have more than one resonant mode. If the central bore is singled out as having inductance L_0, then one of the resonant modes is one in which all of the magnetic flux from each of the external loops of inductance L is shared with the central loop. For this mode, the resonant frequency of an n-loop, (n-1)-gap LGR is given by : f_0 \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{LC}}\\\\,, where it has been assumed that all loops have the same inductance L. LGRs and superconductivity The Meissner effect in a platelet superconducting single crystal. The blue lines represent an applied magnetic field. Magnetic fields penetrate a depth \\\\lambda into the crystal. In a single-crystal superconductor, there is a unique penetration depth for each of the crystallographic directions. Loop-gap resonators have been used to make precise measurements of the electrodynamic properties of unconventional superconductors. Most notably, a LGR was used to reveal the linear temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth, characteristic of a d-wave superconductor, in a single crystal of YBa2Cu3O6.95. In these experiments, a superconducting sample is placed inside the bore of a LGR. The diamagnetic response of the superconductor alters in the inductance of the LGR and, therefore, its resonant frequency. As described below, tracking the change in the resonant frequency as the temperature of the sample is changed allows one to deduce the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth. =Theory= The inductance of the LGR can be expressed as L=\\\\mu_0 V_\\\\mathrm{r}/\\\\ell^2, where V_\\\\mathrm{r} is the volume of the LGR bore. Since the resonant frequency f_0 of the LGR is proportional to L^{-1/2}, a small change in the effective volume of the resonator bore will result in a change in the resonant frequency given by : \\\\delta f_0 = -\\\\frac{f_0}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\delta V_\\\\mathrm{r}}{V_\\\\mathrm{r}}\\\\,. Due to the Meissner effect, when a superconducting sample is place in the bore of a LGR, the magnetic flux is expelled from the interior of the sample to within a penetration depth \\\\lambda of its surface. Therefore, the effective volume of the resonator bore is reduced by an amount equal to the volume from which the magnetic flux has been excluded. This excluded volume is given by : V_\\\\mathrm{ex} \\\\approx ab\\\\left(c-2\\\\lambda_a\\\\right)\\\\,, where a, b, and c are the sample dimensions along the three crystallographic directions and abc is the sample volume V_\\\\mathrm{s}. In the above expression, it has been assumed that the microwave magnetic field is applied parallel to the b-axis of the sample. Since the presence of the superconductor reduces the LGR volume, \\\\delta V_\\\\mathrm{r}=-V_\\\\mathrm{ex} and : \\\\delta f_0 = \\\\frac{f_0}{2 V_\\\\mathrm{r}} \\\\left(V_\\\\mathrm{s}-2ab\\\\lambda_a\\\\right)\\\\,. Solving this expression for the a-axis penetration depth yields : \\\\lambda_a = \\\\frac{c}{2}-\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{r}}{ab}\\\\frac{\\\\delta f_0}{f_0}\\\\,. Generally, it is not possible to use LGR frequency-shift measurements to determine the absolute value of the penetration depth because it would require knowing the sample thickness c very precisely. For example, in fully doped YBa2Cu3O7, \\\\lambda_a\\\\approx 100~\\\\mathrm{nm} at low temperature. Therefore, to use the LGR measurement to determine \\\\lambda_a to within 10%, one would have to know the value of c with an accuracy of 10~\\\\mathrm{nm} which is typically not possible. Instead, the strategy is to track the changes in frequency as the sample temperature varies (while keeping the LGR at a fixed temperature). The absolute penetration depth can be expressed as : \\\\lambda_a(T) = \\\\lambda_a(T_0)+\\\\Delta\\\\lambda_a(T)\\\\,, where T is temperature, T_0 is the experimental base temperature, and \\\\Delta\\\\lambda_a(T) is the change in penetration depth as the sample temperature is increased above the base temperature. One can, therefore, express the change in penetration depth as : \\\\Delta\\\\lambda_a(T) = \\\\lambda_a(T)-\\\\lambda_a(T_0)=-\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{r}}{ab}\\\\frac{1}{f_0}\\\\left[\\\\delta f_0(T)-\\\\delta f_0(T_0)\\\\right]\\\\,. Finally, defining \\\\Delta f_0(T)=\\\\delta f_0(T)-\\\\delta f_0(T_0), one has : \\\\Delta\\\\lambda_a(T) = -\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{r}}{ab}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f_0(T)}{f_0}\\\\,. This final expression shows how the LGR shifts in resonant frequency can be used to determine the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth in a superconducting sample. =Experimental details= In a d-wave superconductor, the penetration depth typically changes by a few √•ngstr√∂ms per degree kelvin, which corresponds to \\\\Delta f_0/f_0\\\\sim 10^{-10} for a 1~\\\\mathrm{mm}^2 platelet sample in a LGR with a bore volume of 1~\\\\mathrm{cm}^3. Measuring such small changes in relative frequency requires an extremely high-Q resonator. The ultrahigh quality factors are obtained by coating the LGR surfaces with a superconducting material, such as a lead-tin alloy. The resonator is then cooled below the superconducting transition temperature of the coating using a bath of superfluid liquid helium. Quality factors of 10^6 have been achieved using copper LGRs coated with lead-tin and cooled to 1~\\\\mathrm{K}. Measuring permittivity and permeability This section describes how LGRs can be used to determine the electromagnetic properties of materials. When there are no materials filling either the gap or bore of the resonator, the impedance Z of the LGR can be expressed as : Z = R+j\\\\omega L +\\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C}\\\\,, where j=\\\\sqrt{-1}. Re-expressed in terms of the resonant frequency \\\\omega_0 and quality factor Q, the impedance is given by : \\\\frac{Z}{QR} = \\\\frac{1}{Q}+j\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0} - \\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{\\\\omega}\\\\right)\\\\,. A measurement of the frequency dependence of the impedance of an empty LGR can be used to determine \\\\omega_0 and Q. The impedance measurement is most easily done using the vector network analyzer (VNA) to measure the reflection coefficient S_{11} from an inductively-coupled LGR. The impedance and reflection coefficient are related by : S_{11} = \\\\frac{Z_0-Z}{Z_0+Z}\\\\,, where Z_0 is the output impedance of the VNA (usually, Z_0=50~\\\\Omega)). =Complex permittivity= Now suppose that the gap of resonator has been completely filled with a dielectric material that has complex relative permittivity \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r}=\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime-j\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. In this case, the effective capacitance becomes \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r}C and the impedance of the LGR is given by : Z_\\\\varepsilon = R+j\\\\omega L +\\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega \\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime-j\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right)C}\\\\,. Separating the real and imaginary terms leads to : Z_\\\\varepsilon = \\\\left[R+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}{\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}\\\\right] +j\\\\left[\\\\omega L-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}\\\\right]\\\\,. This expression shows that a nonzero \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} enhances the effective resistance of the LGR and, therefore, lowers its quality factor. A nonzero \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime}, on the other hand, alters the imaginary part of the impedance and modifies the resonant frequency. Written in terms of the empty-resonator resonant frequency and quality factor, the above impedance can be expressed as : \\\\frac{Z_\\\\varepsilon}{QR} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{Q}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}{\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{\\\\omega}\\\\right] +j\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime}}{\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{\\\\omega}\\\\right]\\\\,. Provided that \\\\omega_0 and Q are known before hand, a measurement of the frequency dependence of Z_\\\\varepsilon can be used to determine \\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime and \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} of the material filling the gap of the LGR. This analysis gives the values of \\\\varepsilon^\\\\prime and \\\\varepsilon^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} at the resonant frequency of the filled LGR. =Complex permeability= Next, suppose that the bore of a LGR is filled with a magnetic material have complex relative permeability \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{r}=\\\\mu^\\\\prime-j\\\\mu^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. In this case, the effective inductance becomes \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{r}L and the impedance of the LGR is given by : Z_\\\\mu = R+j\\\\omega \\\\left(\\\\mu^\\\\prime-j\\\\mu^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\right) L +\\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C}\\\\,. Separating Z_\\\\mu into its real and imaginary components and writing the impedance in terms of \\\\omega_0 and Q of the empty LGR yields : \\\\frac{Z_\\\\mu}{QR} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{Q}+\\\\mu^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}\\\\right]+j \\\\left[\\\\mu^\\\\prime\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{\\\\omega}\\\\right]\\\\,. Once again, \\\\mu^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} contributes additional dissipation which lowers the quality factor of the filled resonator and \\\\mu^\\\\prime shifts the resonant frequency. A measurement of the frequency dependence of Z_\\\\mu can be used to extract the values of \\\\mu^\\\\prime and \\\\mu^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} at the resonant frequency of the filled LGR.

He emigrated to New Zealand and introduced antiseptic surgery there in January 1868. Most of his career was then spent in Australia. He took his own life at the age of 46.  Early life  John Rutherford Ryley was born in Waterford, Ireland, in 1837. His father was William Ryley, a seaman, and his mother Jane Margaret Ryley, (n√©e Rutherford). At the age of 17 he moved to Glasgow, working as a solicitor's clerk before studying medicine at Anderson's University, part of the extramural school of medicine. He was awarded prizes in botany, materia medica and midwifery. Among the lectures he attended were surgical lectures by Joseph Lister who had been appointed Professor of Surgery in 1860. Ryley married Margaret Skirving in Glasgow on 19 July 1858 but she died shortly after delivering a son, William, in 1861 and William was brought up in Glasgow by her parents.\\"Scotland Marriages, 1561‚Äì1910,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTYD-PBQ : 10 February 2018), John Rutherford Ryley and Margaret Skirving, 19 Jul 1858; citing Central District, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland\\"Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564‚Äì1950,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FQJY-WJK : 10 February 2018), John Rutherford Ryley in entry for William Rutherford Ryley, 18 Jun 1861; citing Milton, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland. In 1862, Ryley qualified as a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (LRCSEd) and so became a registered medical practitioner. He later obtained a number of other qualifications: FRCS Edinburgh (1868), LRCP London (1871), MD Pennsylvania (1879) and LRCP Edinburgh (1879). Hokitika township, c. 1870s  Early career  After qualifying, Ryley migrated to New Zealand and his medical career is characterised by travel, as he tended not to stay for long in any one post. He sailed for New Zealand on the Sir William Eyre as the ship's doctor and arrived at Invercargill in May 1863. Here he set up in practice and married Charlotte Robinson. He registered as a doctor in Queenstown and, moving to the west coast, was appointed surgeon-superintendent of Hokitika Hospital, and surgeon to the jail and the Hokitika Lunatic Asylum between 1866‚Äì1869. These had been established to provide care for gold miners during New Zealand's West Coast Gold Rush. Early in 1868 Ryley returned to Britain and passed the examination to become FRCSEd in May 1868. He was appointed assessor for Westland for the New Zealand Medical Board on 15 December 1868.  Antiseptic surgery  In January 1868, while working at Hokitika Hospital, Ryley successfully used Lister's newly described method of antisepsis in three cases and published the results. Lister had published his seminal paper in The Lancet in March 1867,Lister, Joseph, ‚ÄòOn a New Method of Treating Compound Fracture, Abscess, &c.;, with Observations on the Conditions of Suppuration‚Äô, Lancet i, 336‚Äì339 (1867). followed by a series of papers later that year describing the technique in detail with clinical examples. Ryley treated one patient with a large axillary abscess and two miners with compound fractures of the tibia and fibula. He was eager to try Lister's method, particularly because \\"the last two cases of compound fracture treated in an ordinary way in the Hospital over which I preside had terminated fatally\\".Ryley JR. The surgical use of carbolic acid. Australian Medical Journal 1868;13:107‚Äì13 He used the technique of carbolic-soaked bandages and dressings described by Lister and published an account of this in The Lancet in May 1868. He claimed that this was the first successful use of the technique in the colonies, but he had in fact been preceded in this in 1867 by George Hogarth Pringle in Australia. This was however the first time that antiseptic surgical technique had been used in New Zealand. He continued to use the technique routinely describing results in his hospital reports.Ryley JR.

Typhoid Fever in New Zealand and Australia: its Origin and Propagation. British Medical Journal. 1880;2(1018):13‚Äì14. Ryley was succeeded as surgeon in Hokitika by Henry Widenham Maunsell.  Later career  He traveled to Levuka, Fiji in 1870 and there, in addition to medical practice, he became a member of the Fijian Parliament but resigned his seat after less than a year for \\"personal reasons\\". He was then appointed coroner and officer of health for Fiji in 1871 and surgeon to the jail the following year. After less than a year he resigned and moved to Sydney, Australia. From September 1873 to February 1875 he practised in Western Australia, first in Roeboume and then in Champion Bay before moving to Adelaide, South Australia, where he practiced in Redhill and then in Gawler.Ryley JR.

In 1879 he qualified as an M.D. in Pennsylvania and later that year he served in South Africa as a civilian surgeon attached to a field hospital during the Zulu War. Returning to Britain he sat and passed the examination to become a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCPE). Ryley then traveled back to Sydney, Australia. He practised in New South Wales, in a series of hospital posts successively at Temora, Tenterfield, Gulgong and then as a partner in practice at Mudgee.

Inspection at that time revealed that he had a throat scar from an earlier suicide attempt. The medical admission notes record that \\"his wife tells me that he has repeatedly threatened to kill her; he would as soon do it as eat his breakfast\\". At discharge on 26 March 1870, the asylum doctor declared that \\"longer incarceration would be likely to convert a case of slight mental irritability into confirmed lunacy.\\" In February 1884, suffering from stress, he checked into the Post Office Hotel in Sydney, Australia.

Early studies of Jazz and musical collaboration were essential components in his artistic development and led to a variety of performance experiences throughout the Philadelphia area with small instrumental ensembles. While pursuing academic degrees he was exposed to twentieth-century music and the avant-garde, forever changing his musical outlook. In 1976 Joseph began organizing performances of ‚Äúnew‚Äù musical works by small ensembles and in 1977 he co-founded a performing ensemble dedicated exclusively to new performative and inter-media works, eventually becoming The Relache Ensemble (5) Peter Burwasser: ‚ÄúAt Relache Experimental Music with Real Substance.‚Äù The Welcomat.

Pramila Jayapal of Seattle, who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Morales, along with incumbents Lisa Herbold and Kshama Sawant, received national attention when Amazon donated $1.45 million to support opposing candidates via the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce's political action committee, the Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy (CASE). In her campaign, Morales supported a head tax for Seattle corporations, legislation opposed by Amazon and that in 2018 Seattle City Council approved then quickly rescinded. In an email to supporters, Mayor Jenny Durkan called Morales a \\"socialist\\" ‚Äî Morales's political affiliation is Democrat ‚Äî and endorsed District 2 candidate Mark Solomon. Morales completed a two-year term as a Human Rights Commissioner for the City of Seattle in July 2019 and also served on the board of the Rainier Beach Action Coalition.

The Taungoo dynasty had conquered Laos during the reign of Bayinnaung. Setthathirath led the Lan Xang Kingdom into a resistance war against the Burmese but failed. With the collapse of Taungoo Empire, the Laotians soon restored their nation from the Burmese. The Burmese would go on conquer Laos for the second time as Konbaung dynasty, and Lan Xang this time was unable to fend off again. Similar to the first invasion, Burma would go on crippled due to war with the Chinese that saw Lan Xang regained independence for the second time.

The cave is a rare example of a medieval hermitage, cut out of the magnesian limestone river gorge with a domestic area externally and the chapel of the Holy Cross which originally housed the saint's grave. The trustees of the site are the monks of Ampleforth Abbey and in 1989 the Harrogate Museums Service carried out excavations after clearing the site. Robert of Knaresborough The Holy Cross Chapel ruins. Robert of Knaresborough was born Robert Flower or Floure in York to a wealthy family. From childhood he was intent on pursuing a religious vocation and after a short time in a formal abbey setting he became a hermit and lived for much of his life in a cave beside the River Nidd in Knaresborough. Never officially canonized, in 1252 Robert was implicitly recognised as a saint by the Roman Catholic church.Visit HarrogateJournal of Antiquities For consistency Robert Flower is referred to as 'St Robert'. St Robert died on 24 September 1218, at first being buried in the chapel, however his body was later moved to the Trinitarian Priory in Abbey Road. The Hermitage and chapel Around 500 hermitages are recorded however the locations of very few are known. St Robert's Cave is a very rare surviving example of a medieval hermitage, that includes a living area. The assemblage of St Robert's Cave and the Chapel of the Holy Cross is unique.Ancient Monuments Register History William de Stuteville, the Constable of Knaresborough Castle granted St Robert the piece of land on which the cave and chapel were built. King John is said to have visited St Robert at the cave and in 1216 granted him 40 acres of land. The first Royal Maundy ceremony is claimed to have taken place here. The chapel, dedicated to the Holy Cross, is a Grade II Listed Building that is reached via a narrow path and steps from Abbey Road. In 1907 the OS records the Chapel of Our Lady of the CragYorkshire CLIV.12, Revised: 1907, Published: 1909 erroneously as 'St Roberts Chapel'. The aforementioned chapel has been much confused with the Holy Cross Chapel and cave of St Robert of Knaresborough. =The cave= The saint's grave. As a result of the fame of St Robert and reported miracles the cave and chapel were a very popular site of pilgrimage prior to the Reformation. Saint Giles' Chapel or priory is a name also associated with the cave. A rock-cut bench and a set of steps in the domestic area have the cave entrance located between with further steps giving access to the rock cut floor of the cave. The bench outside is cut back into the rock face and is sheltered by the cliff above. The cave has effectively two sections, a domestic one and one for religious use. An alcove and bench have been cut into the back of the second chamber. The caves basic \`L' shaped chamber is nearly 4m long east-west by 3m north- south at its widest, the second forming St Robert's living area. The cave's walls and ceiling (2.2m high) carry many carved niches and initials. One possibly 12th century incised cross with bored terminals exists.Knaresborough hermit's cave, Yorkshire, West Riding Clear tooling marks are present showing that the cave is not entirely natural in origin and it is recorded that the saint himself worked at enlarging the cave. The associated chapel and in particular the cave have long been prone to flooding from the River Nidd despite the presence of an ancient drain that cuts across the site. The use of the cave following the Reformation is not recorded however the various hollows in the cliff wall suggest that lean to structures were present at one time as the nearby Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag site. =The Chapel of the Holy Cross= St Robert's grave and chapel The brother of St Robert was Walter Flower, Mayor of York. To improve the facilities for his famous brother he paid for stonemasons to be employed to build a shelter where St Robert could meet with the poor and pilgrims as well as a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross or Holy Rood. No features survive that provide clear datable evidence. The foundations of the rectangular chapel of the Holy Cross building has a prominent grave recess cut out of it in front of the chapel's former altar. The grave, 2m long by between 0.35m-0.53m wide, was recessed at its sides to allow for a covering slab to be laid flush with the floor level as was the fashion with important burials at that time. A few courses of worked stone remain on the south and east sides, however nothing survives above ground to the west. The Trinitarian Order who acquired the chapel and cave, reburied St Robert at their nearby establishment, the Priory of the Holy Trinity and St Robert, which had been founded prior to 1252. The Scots sacked the priory in 1318 and it was dissolved in 1538.Mauseus Tourist attraction The cave was previously a pilgrimage site. It became a popular tourist attraction after Eugene Aram was hanged in 1759 for the murder of Daniel Clark whose remains were found in the cave. It remains open to the public.

Reportedly, Cushing \\"had respectable talents, was very dressy and quite a beau among the ladies.\\" Cushing resigned on August 9, 1850 and was succeeded by Alexander C. Downey who served until the adoption of a new Constitution in 1852. =Charg√© d'Affaires to Ecuador= On September 28, 1850, he was appointed Charg√© d'Affaires to Ecuador at Quito by President Millard Fillmore, a fellow Whig. He presented his credentials on June 3, 1851. In Ecuador, Cushing's view of the country substantially differed from his predecessor, John Trumbull Van Alen, who was known as \\"callow and impulsive\\" and reportedly \\"lacked experience in diplomacy and knowledge of Ecuadorian politics.\\" Van Alen had \\"decided that Ecuador could be rescued from ruin only by General Flores,\\" the former president of Ecuador, and wrote to Washington that Flores was popular and had been \\"unjustly ousted by a small clique of opportunists.\\" Cushing, however, wrote two years later that \\"Flores was, as a matter of fact, enormously unpopular in Ecuador and that his return would be a disaster.\\" He further wrote that \\"The United States cannot view with indifference such an attempt to interfere with the independence and sovereignty of the Republic.\\" In 1852, Cushing wrote to then U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster in Washington, including to write that \\"two 18 pound balls passed through several rooms of my house\\" in Guayaquil while Flores attacked the city. Also while in office, Cushing \\"slapped in a claim for $40,000 US dollars against the Republic of Ecuador as compensation to the owners and crew of the ship\\" that was pirated on its way to the Galapagos Islands. Cushing's mission was terminated by note on October 12, 1853. He was succeeded by former Wisconsin State Senator Philo White, who was appointed by Democratic President Franklin Pierce. =Later career= After serving his term, he began working as an agent for Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company until his death in 1856 on the Isthmus of Panama, the narrow strip of land that lies between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, linking North and South America that contains the country of Panama. Personal life On October 16, 1833, Cushing was married to Sarah Ross (d. 1843), daughter of Phineas Ross of Warren County. Together, they were the parents of: * Mary Cushing (1834‚Äì1867), who married Eben Hall (1818‚Äì1871). * Sarah Corwin Cushing (b. 1837), who worked as a private secretary to Cushing's friend, William McKee Dunn, a former U.S. Representative from Indiana and the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army. * Daniel H. Cushing (b. 1841), who became Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County, Ohio. After the death of his first wife, he remarried in 1847 to Margaret Hutton of Baltimore, Maryland. She died the following year. Cushing died on May 24, 1856 on the Isthmus of Panama and was buried at Puntas Arenas in Nicaragua. =Descendants= Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of four granddaughters, including Norah Hall, Mary Hall (who died in infancy), Sallie Hall (wife of John D. Ryan of Louisville, Kentucky) and Anna Hall (wife of Dr. John Wilber Hulick of Springfield, Ohio).

She was also a peace activist and supported woman's suffrage. Durley did noteworthy work on the Saturday Mail, a Des Moines weekly publication, but her professional life was mainly given to the Des Moines Daily News, of which her husband, Preston B. Durley and her brother, John J. Hamilton, with herself, were the principal owners. Under the pen name of \\"Judith Jorgenson\\", she conducted a column of stories of real life, \\"Around the Evening Lamp\\", for many years, and it was considered especially creditable. As editor of The News Junior, she became the literary guide and mentor of the children of Iowa, who competed for artistic pictures which hung in hundreds of schoolhouses all over the state. Later, she became editor of the Homemaker Magazine, and still later, associate editor of the National Daily Review of Chicago, afterwards merged in the Women's National Daily of St. Louis in the latter capacity, visiting all parts of the country, interviewing former President Grover Cleveland at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, and other men and women of distinction. According to Printers' Ink Publishing Company, she was \\"one of the two or three most successful newspaper women of the United States\\". Early years and education Ella Adaline Hamilton was born in Harrisville, Pennsylvania, circa 1852. She was the oldest daughter of William Hamilton, a Union soldier and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Logan; d. 1905). She had three siblings: a sister, Mary H. Hamilton, and two brothers, John J. Hamilton and LaMonte Hamilton. She was the granddaughter of another Union soldier, Robert Logan, and of General William Hamilton, who served in the Indian Wars and the War of 1812; and the great-greanddaughter of Hugh Hamilton, a revolutionary soldier, hence she was a member of the order of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Born in a home that was a station of the Underground Railroad, with hiding of fugitive slaves on their way to Canada and freedom-, he was ever an advocate and champion of political, social, and economic liberty. Durley lived in northwestern Pennsylvania for fourteen years. In the spring of 1866, the family removed to Iowa City in Davis County, Iowa, where they made their home for four years. It was in the schoohouse of that locality that Durley acquired sufficient education to permit her to begin to teach at the age of sixteen. The loss of her father, whose ambition for his children was limitless, led her to make the attempt to carry out his oft-expressed wish that she should take a college course. To do so meant hard work and strenuous application as she had to pay her own way. She studied at Iowa State University for eight years; in the spring of 1878, she took the degree of B. A. in Iowa State University, and in 1892, she received the degree of M. A. Career After graduation, Durley became the principal of the high school in Waterloo, Iowa, a position she held for two years. She then went to Europe to continue her studies, more especially in the German language and literature. She spent a year in European travel and study, including a course of lectures in the Victoria Lyceum of Berlin, and an inspection of the school system of Germany and Italy. Upon her return, she lectured widely and these were well received. After a year spent in the Iowa State Library, Durley decided to enter newspaper work. She became associate editor of the Des Moines Mail and Times, which position she held over a year, when an offer caused her to become editor-in-chief of the Northwestern Journal of Education. Her later journalistic work was in connection with the Des Moines Daily News, upon which she served as reporter and editorial and special writer for several years. In 1884, Durley was appointed a member of the State Education Board of Examiners for Iowa, which position she held until 1888, serving most of her time as secretary. In October 1886, she married Preston B. Durley (died 1897), business manager of the Des Moines Daily News. For a year, they homesteaded in South Dakota. Newspaper work was kept up uninterruptedly until the summer of 1890, when her son, John, was born. By 1905, she was associated with her brother, John J. Hamilton, and others in the ownership and publication of the Chicago Daily Review, where she served as writer, an expert in circulation management, and an authority on advertising; it was a national daily newspaper for American women and the American home. Durley wrote two novels, My Soldier Lady and The Standpatters. She was also a convincing public speaker; her lectures on Margaret Fuller and on her travels were very successful. United Sisterhood of Peace Ella Hamilton Durley (1916) The United Sisterhood of Peace was organized at Los Angeles in June, 1916, by Durley, who drew to her aid seven women, who became the Mother Circle. Within a few days each of these ladies had chosen her own circle‚Äîa circle of seven, of which she became the Elder Sister, the first fifty thus coming into the organization becoming the charter membership. Each member pledged herself to secure six other members within a reasonable time, each of whom pleadged herself to perform the same service. All the members promised to work untiringly for unity, peace, and harmony in their own neighborhoods, their own country, and throughout the world. In the same year, a second circle was founded in Chicago. The United Sisterhood of Peace had for its basic principle a belief in the sincerity of women in their declarations against war and in favor of the settlement of international questions by means of mediation through an international tribunal. Believing also that war was not the last word in human wisdom, members of this organization were happy to enter upon a definite constructive plan for universal and enduring peace. Returning European travelers said that throughout the belligerent countries there was a growing consciousness of the utter futility of war. It was the hope of the society to establish a universal peace in seven years: to \\"unify the women of California in 1916, of the United States in 1917, of North America in 1918, of South America in 1919, of Europe in 1920, of Asia in 1921, and the women of Africa and the islands of the sea in 1922‚Äîthe world in seven years:. The motto of the Sisterhood was: \\"We have no prejudices; every woman is our sister and every man our brother.\\" The obligation members assumed was: \\"We pledge ourselves to be faithful members of the United Sisterhood of Peace; to organize and conduct circles in affiliation with the mother circle, and to work untiringly for unity, peace, and harmony in our own neighborhoods, our own country, and throughout the world, always thinking and speaking well of all persons, races, and nations, and forgetting their faults.\\" Membership was promoted by means of numbered cards, signed by the Elder Sister, followed by the members of her circle. To each one a card was given of a higher number, which she, in turn, signed as Elder Sister, and proceeded to fill with her own circle. She also gave to each six cards of a still higher number, so that each would be provided with cards to continue her work. A circle could, if it desire, elect an Elder Brother. One of the first to indicate his approval was that distinguished pacifist, David Starr Jordan, who became an honorary patron of the organization. Henry Ford and William Jennings Bryan wrote expressing their high appreciation of the plan and their belief in its effectiveness. Endless-chain systems came under the ban of the Post Office Department several years prior, but when the Postal Inspector made an investigation of the \\"sisterhood\\" and its aims, he announced that, as there were no profits to be made and as the \\"system will run out everywhere after a time, the postal authorities would not interfere. Affiliations She was the founder of the Des Moines Home for the Aged, the largest institution of the kind in Iowa; and led in the organization of the Deutsche Gesellschaft, a club for German literature and conversation. Prior to 1885, Durley was a member of the Association for Advancement of Women, which in the autumn of that year, was organized into the Des Moines Women's Club. She was a charter member of it and one of the first presidents; it was the strongest women's organization in the State. She was president of the Des Moines Women's Press Club and the Des Moines Federation of Women's Clubs. Durley did church work. She was active in the Friday Morning Club, the Women's City Club, the League of American Penwomen, and the Public Power League. Durley had a hand in naming and launching the cruiser, Des Moines. She organized central Iowa in the work of sending a shipload of Iowa corn to the Russian famine sufferers. In 1894, Durley obtained for Des Moines a fine art loan, this being the first ever held in that city. Durley was a suffragist. As a girl at Iowa City, she became acquainted with Susan B. Anthony and Mary A. Livermore; and as a clubwoman at Des Moines, she became the friend of such women as Julia Ward Howe. Her own home at Des Moines was for years the rendezvous of the Iowa Press and Authors' club, which she organized. Iowa's most eminent men and women of letters, people such as Emerson Hough, Woods Hutchinson, and Alice French (Octave Thanet) met there to exchange experiences. Later years Durley's husband died in January 1896. In 1911, she and her son moved to California, and became residents of Los Angeles. Durley's son died in California in December 1919. She died August 14, 1922, in Redlands, California.

Rivero is currently a Lecturer in Painting and Printmaking at the Yale School of Art and a Visiting Artist at The Cooper Union.  Early life and education  Rivero was born to Dominican parents and raised in Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY. His Dominican- American identity and personal history is central to his work. He received a BFA from the School of Visual Arts (2006), New York, NY, and an MFA in Painting and Printmaking from Yale University School of Art, New Haven, CT (2012). He attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2017.  Work  Rivero is primarily a painter, but also creates drawings, prints, and sculptures. His work engages the deeply personal. His paintings depict spaces and interactions between figures that appear fantastical, dangerous, foreboding, nostalgic, or tender. Figures in his work seem to be spirits, superhuman, or physical representations of psychological states. His paintings often include elements of assemblage, using objects of personal significance, often cherished mementos, or pieces of New York City, for instance, \\"Old cigarette packs salvaged from the Gramercy building where he worked as a doorman, dominoes fresh from a match: Each of his three-dimensional canvases are a layered ‚Äúmemory palette\\" [...].‚Äù In an article for Hyperallergic, Benjamin Sutton describes the figures, symbolism, and mysticism in Rivero's painting titled Homage to the Three Three (PE NYK) (2015), \\"[it] has a ghostly head floating (or painted) on a brick wall. Around the corner flames shoot from a window, while a cluster of numbers apparently tagged on the wall tempt the viewer‚Äôs inner cryptographer. [...] Rivero‚Äôs piece is full of lovely painterly effects, from the thickening series of lines that make up the figure‚Äôs fan-like hair to the precise, Op art-ish grid of brick outlines. The painting is full of opaque symbolism.\\" And in the Brooklyn Rail, Alex Jen describes It Happened on the Corner (2014), on view in Lure of the Dark At Mass MoCA in 2019, \\"a man lies sick on the ground as pairs of scuffed oxfords walk past. The sidewalk is painted to look like board game tiles. A smoke- stained sliver filled with monsters projects out of his belly like a magnified microscope illustration, and combusts at the bottom in a brilliantly painted fire so thick and crusted it looks whittled.\\" Jen continues by describing the symbolism in another painting, Ask About Me (2017), \\"A nervous, coded pictograph of one's personal interiors, little crosses mark graves in the dark among pyramids, faceted gems, and empty cars.\\" Rivero's work aims to capture the supernatural elements of everyday, real experience, intertwining the ways in which reality seem surreal, especially when related to violence, pain, and grief. As described by Paul D'Agostino for L Magazine, Rivero's work, \\"is full of surprises that are not exactly stunning, terrors that aren‚Äôt really scary, notes of humor that aren‚Äôt necessarily funny, fantastical figments that are actually just real, and barely nightmarish murmurs that hum, also, in tones of just-awoken awareness, such that the dream is at once active and over.

Originally written and published in Spanish in 2013, the book was translated into English by Lisa Dillman and published in 2016 by And Other Stories. The book focuses on an underworld fixer who tries to arrange a peaceful exchange of bodies between two rival criminal gangs in a corrupt city that is in the midst of an epidemic.  Setting  The Transmigration of Bodies is set in an unidentified Mexican city. Although the military has a strong presence (including regular street checkpoints), organized crime and violence are rampant. A plague, spread by insects and bodily fluids, is ravaging the city, which has resulted in empty streets as most citizens isolate themselves from the epidemic in their houses. Many public services like running water are non-operational, and the lack of citizens on the streets has led to increased petty crime.  Plot summary  The Redeemer, a fixer who works primarily in the criminal underworld, wakes up with a hangover at his apartment in the Big House. One of his neighbors, Three Times Blonde, asks him for credit for her phone. They go to her apartment to make the exchange, and end up eating and having sex. Another resident of the apartment, an anemic student, hopes to share in their meal, or at least have leftovers, but they shun him. The next morning the Redeemer gets a call from Dolphin Fonseca, a barrio boss. Dolphin wants him to find his son Romeo, who has disappeared after visiting Lover‚Äôs Lane, a street of strip clubs. The Redeemer learns from the bartender √ìscar that Romeo was taken by boys from the Castro family, another rich criminal household. He also learns from Dolphin‚Äôs daughter (the Unruly) that Dolphin has taken Baby Girl, Castro's daughter, to an old house called Las Pericas. When the Redeemer goes to Las Pericas, he finds Baby Girl dead. He calls a nurse, Vicky, to examine Baby Girl‚Äôs body. She concludes that Baby Girl died from the plague, having gone several days without treatment. She also notes that the body has not been ravished after death. They go to meet the Mennonite, an old friend and fellow fixer, who is working for the Castros to retrieve Baby Girl. The Mennonite tells him that Romeo is also dead. When the Redeemer asks the Castro sons about the matter, they say that Romeo, injured by a van, had asked them to take him to their house so he could rest for a few hours. However, he died shortly after they brought him to the house. After examining Romeo‚Äôs body, Vicky concludes that their story is true. The Redeemer and the Mennonite go back to Lover‚Äôs Lane to talk again to √ìscar. They learn that Romeo was at the strip clubs in order to visit his boyfriend, who worked at the ladies‚Äô club. When the Redeemer goes to Las Pericas to pick up Baby Girl‚Äôs body, he finds out from the Unruly that Baby Girl was already coughing blood when she was picked up as hostage. The Redeemer puts Baby Girl's body in his apartment until it can be exchanged for Romeo's body. He is tempted into Three Times Blonde's apartment to enjoy her company, but when he leaves, he is beaten by Three Times Blonde‚Äôs boyfriend, who has heard about her affair via the anemic student. Fortunately, a friend arrives and rescues the Redeemer. The Mennonite calls the Redeemer to tell him that Las Pericas (the old mansion from earlier in the book) has burned down. Meanwhile, the Redeemer goes to a lawyer named Gustavo and finds out that the Castro and Fonseca families are descended from the same father by different wives, and that the two families have been fighting over legal possession of the ancestral house ever since the father's death. The Redeemer returns home and the Fonsecas and Castros arrive to make the corpse exchange. There is no fight, but harsh words are exchanged over the burning of Las Pericas‚Äîeach family blames the other. Both families leave, clearly distraught after seeing the dead bodies of their family members. The Redeemer goes to Three Times Blonde, but she leaves as soon as she notices that the weather has cleared. His landlady asks the Redeemer to try to free the anemic student, who is now in police custody, and he agrees and leaves Big House.  Major characters  * The Redeemer is a fixer who helps negotiate violence-free settlements for conflicts between rival criminals. A former lawyer, he now principally brokers hostage exchanges. Although he loathes many actions of the gangsters, he tries to mediate between gangs to maintain peace. In the novel, he serves as the negotiator for the Fonseca family. * The Fonseca family is a criminal family engaged in various gang activities. They are descended from the same man as the Castro family by his second wife, and have been at odds with the Castros ever since his death. **‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù Fonseca is a crime boss in charge of the Fonseca clan. One of his lungs was shot, causing him to wheeze, and his nose was misshapen while snorting cocaine, leading to his nickname. The Redeemer has been working jobs for him ever since they met many years ago. **Romeo Fonseca is Dolphin‚Äôs son. He routinely visits Lover‚Äôs Lane to see shows and visit his boyfriend, who works as a stripper. *The Mennonite is originally from the countryside, but years ago moved to the city and started work as a fixer. He met the Redeemer on a shared assignment and the two became fast friends. In the novel, he serves as the negotiator for the Castro family. *The Castro family are the chief rivals of the Fonseca family. They are descended from their patriarch's first wife, and have been at enmity with the Fonsecas ever since the two disputed his inheritance. **Baby Girl is the daughter of the Castro family. She is less cutthroat than her brothers and father, and as a result receives less affection from them. *Three Times Blonde is the Redeemer‚Äôs neighbor at the Big House. The femme fatale of the novel, little is revealed about her except that the Redeemer finds her extremely attractive and she has several boyfriends. *Vicki is a nurse and friend of the Redeemer. She has regular employment, but is also tough enough to help the Redeemer in the criminal underworld.  Translation  Lisa Dillman translated this book from Spanish into English. Her translation style incorporates the styles and rhythms of Spanish into the book. Some Mexican idioms and grammatical forms are translated literally, a technique that retains a feel for the original Spanish language. Herrera's characteristic short descriptions are also maintained in the English translation. Stylized spellings and witty one-liners recall the gum-shoe prose of Raymond Chandler. In keeping Herrera's style and format, Dillman allows for a fast paced book with imagery that does not detract from the plot. Despite the complements on the translation, Herrera insists that translating a work will always result in slight variations and adaptations from the original meaning.  Themes  = Romeo and Juliet = Critics have drawn similarities between Transmigration of Bodies and Romeo and Juliet. The Los Angeles Times's Dustin Illingworth has stated that the feuding families of the Castros and Fonsecas are similar to the Capulets and Montagues. The complicating factor in The Transmigration of Bodies comes from the plague-ridden setting, because not only do the families have a longstanding grudge, but the entire city has been thrown into an atmosphere of deeper mistrust by the epidemic. According to Aaron Bady of the Boston Review, it is the Redeemer's role to bring the aggrieved parties together in weeping for their lost children and not violence; or, as Friar Laurence says in Romeo and Juliet, to \\"with their death bury their parents‚Äô strife.\\" = Mexico's Drug War = Herrera credits some of his ideas within this book as stemming from Mexico's war on drugs, which occurred after a movement by the same name in the United States. Though the Mexican government is attempting to stop drug trafficking by the cartels, gang members pay off many individuals to continue profiting. This increase in drug trafficking since the 1980s has resulted in increases in homicides, torture, and missing people. As the LA Times notes, the novel paints a vivid picture of the violence within Mexican cities, particularly by the gangs and cartels. In an Ecuadorian newspaper article, Herrera discusses how literature casts light on contemporary issues by reflecting on the world from an outside perspective, such as reflecting on this violence in his novels. Herrera discusses topics like violence in this manner to share his opinions on these difficult topics. = Disease = The streets of the city are deserted because of the plague. The entire population is in a panic. During one scene in the novel, a peddler blowing bubbles is attacked when citizens realize that the bubbles contain his saliva and therefore may be spreading the plague. This reinforces the ideas of violence and Herrera has stated that this scene and the reaction of citizens to the plague is inspired by the 2009 swine flu pandemic in Mexico City. Rien Fertel of Kenyon Review mentions that this breakdown of society occurs only four days after the plague has hit the city, leading to mistrust among the population. The Redeemer's efforts to complete his job are complicated by the disease's spread and the general atmosphere of paranoia throughout the city.  Reception  Transmigration of Bodies has been met with generally positive reviews as well as some criticisms. The Guardian praised the novel for its impact and the powerful images of contemporary Mexico it depicts. The Los Angeles Times complemented Herrera's writing style, but expressed criticism for the \\"occasional sense of flatness\\" that did not fit with the violent depictions and themes. Despite any criticisms, the book has received several prestigious literary awards. = Awards = * English Pen Award 2015 * Oxford- Weidenfeld Translation Prize shortlist 2017 *Dublin Literary Award longlist 2018  Trilogy  The Transmigration of Bodies is book two in a trilogy by Yuri Herrera.

As its name suggests, it is located in the Poblacion village of Makati and was formerly known as Casa Hacienda Park. The park is the largest of three public parks in Makati's old downtown area situated at the site of a former plantation house. It is operated by the Department of Environmental Services Parks and Green Division of the City Government of Makati. Together with the Makati Poblacion Linear Park, the park has revitalized around of Makati Poblacion's waterfront between the Makati-Mandaluyong Bridge and Rockwell Center. Description The Poblacion Linear Park with Rockwell Center in the background The Makati Poblacion Park is in size and stretches along the Pasig River from Zamora Street by the Poblacion Covered Court and ends up across from the Poblacion Fire Sub-Station. The roughly three-block riverside park bordered by J. P. Rizal Avenue to the south sits in the historic Heritage District of Makati located just across from the Museo ng Makati. This neo-classical building with oyster shell window shutters built in 1918 at a plaza known as Plaza Trece de Agosto (now an extension of J.P. Rizal Avenue) served as Makati's presidencia or municipal hall until 1961. The San Pedro Macati Church stands about to the south at the opposite end of Dolores M. Rivera Street (former Don Pedro P. Roxas Street) at another plaza known as Plaza Cristo Rey. The park is also near the barangay hall of Poblacion. Poblacion Park features an amphitheater, children's playground, stone benches, gazeboes, multipurpose sheds and solar lamp posts. The adjacent Poblacion Covered Court is a basketball court that also serves as a venue for local gatherings. A extension of the park eastwards to Rockwell Center was inaugurated in June 2016 by the then-Mayor of Makati Romulo Pe√±a. This extension called Poblacion Linear Park and designated as an Environmental Preservation Area was built by the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission on more than 3 meters of existing easement along the Pasig River at a cost of . History The land for the park was acquired by the city of Makati after World War II as a donation from Ayala y Compa√±√≠a. It was the site of a large bahay na bato that served as an administrative building for the then vast Jesuit hacienda of San Pedro de Macati. Ownership of the estate was transferred several times after the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines in the late 18th century. It passed on to the Marquess of Villamediana, Don Jos√© Col, Don Manuel G√≥mez, and then to Don Sime√≥n Bernardino V√©lez. It was in 1851 when Don Jos√© Bonifacio Roxas purchased it for 50,000 Spanish dollars and made it the commercial base of Casa Roxas, the precursor of Ayala y Compa√±√≠a (now Ayala Corporation). The casa hacienda was located in the then village of Buenavista that sat on an elevated plateau overlooking the Pasig River. It was accessible from the river via stone steps or hagdang bato located just beside the plantation house. The Zobel de Ayala family managed their estate here from their headquarters at the casa hacienda until post-independence when the house was demolished and the site turned into an open space.

The TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC) signed a Political Agreement on 17 July. On 4 August, a Constitutional Declaration, which followed up on the 17 July agreement, was completed. The agreements provided for the transfer of power to a new body known as the Sovereignty Council and to other transitional state bodies.  Structure and Members  Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\") is formally the deputy leader but seen as the de facto real leader. On 20 August 2019, the Sovereignty Council was established, officially dissolving the TMC and transferring power to the new council. Leadership Hemetti, formally the deputy leader of the Council, is the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, and as such, is seen by The Washington Post as holding more real power in the Council than al-Burhan. The RSF is the immediate successor organisation to the Janjaweed militia. The Council's media spokesman is Major General Shams Ad-din Shanto.

Negotiations and power transfer =April‚ÄìJune negotiations with civil society= Major General Shanto, in a press conference on 14 April, stated that the Council was inviting the opposition and protestors to name a civilian government (except for the Ministries of Defense and Interior) and a prime minister to lead it, which the junta would then \\"implement\\". On 12 June, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance prepared a list of eight civilian members for a 15-member transitional governmental council to replace the TMC, including three women, in addition to Abdalla Hamdok, who was Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa from 2011 to October 2018, as prime minister. Planned power transfer to Sovereignty Council On 5 July 2019, the TMC and the FFC agreed on a Sudanese transition to democracy deal, including an 11-member sovereign council with five military members, five civilian members, and one civilian chosen by consensus; a civilian cabinet; a legislative council; an investigation into the Khartoum massacre and related events; and a legal team to formalise the plan.

On 12 July, Gamal Omar of the TMC reported the fourth coup attempt, stating that twelve army and National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) officers had attempted a coup d'√©tat against the TMC, without naming the alleged conspirators.

He won the award in 1956, 1957, and in 1958 he tied with another horse. He was inducted into three halls of fame, the most prominent being the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2011. War Paint was known for his bucking ability and his buck-off record, which was close to 90 percent. Early life War Paint was foaled c. 1945 in the Klamath marsh on the Klamath Indian Reservation in Northern Klamath County, Oregon. He was raised by a Klamath Tribe member named Orrie Sommers. War Paint's sire was a big-boned Paint stallion who was registered as a Quarter Horse. The tribe could not break him. His dam was a wild and grumpy old Pinto mare who they drove in a team. The tribe never tried to break War Paint's dam. Sommers gave the foal a Klamath name that means \\"painted horse\\". Sommers brought War Paint up as a bucking horse, as he raised many bucking horses. When War Paint was three years old, Hank and Bob Christensen of Christensen Brothers, stock contractors, bought him from Sommers. Bucking career War Paint bucked at the highest professional level which was the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA), renamed to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1975. Christensen Brothers first tried out War Paint, who weighed , in bareback bronc riding competition. However, they soon moved him to saddle bronc riding competition, where he excelled. In the 1950s he became known worldwide for his bucking ability. There was a certain rodeo historian who wrote that many bronc riders would say after \\"seeing the paint go was‚Äì'That spotted horse is the one I want'‚Äìbut generally, after a seat on him, they'd be out there checking their eyesight the next time they got a chance to see him go\\"! War Paint was an elite prospect of the Christensen Brothers from the beginning. It did not take long for the spotted horse to develop a reputation. His first jump out of the chute was potent, and he followed it up with a high, forceful kick. No cowboy could get past the second jump for his first few years of bucking. Bronc rider Manual Enos is known as the first to make a qualified ride on the horse. One pickup man named Denny Jones, who worked at the Pendleton Round-Up in Oregon, compared the horse to ProRodeo Hall of Fame horses Midnight and Five Minutes to Midnight. \\"War Paint was still buckin' when he was 20 years old\\", claims Jones. War Paint performed many times at the Ellensburg Rodeo, where the crowd always appreciated him. World champion saddle bronc rider and hall of famer Deb Copenhaver elaborated, \\"That pinto is a sure day-money horse. He just bucks hard and keeps trying.\\" = Bucking Horse of the Year = In 1956, saddle bronc world champion and hall of famer Casey Tibbs suggested an award for bucking horses. War Paint was voted the inaugural RCA \\"Bucking Horse of the Year\\" in 1956. The award presentation took place at the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado, in January, 1957. Any horses that had bucked in 1956 were eligible to win even though the award ceremony took place the following year in 1957. The Rodeo Sports News presented the winner with a silver mounted bucking horse halter, which was decorative but also functional. War Paint won the award again the next year in 1957. The award ceremony was again held in January of the following year, 1958. Stock contractors Beutler Brothers furnished all of the bucking horses for the National Western Stock Show's rodeo. The Christensen Brothers still brought War Paint to the ceremony to be presented for the award. The arena was packed with publicity personnel. Match of Champions The 1957 World Champion Saddle Bronc rider, Alvin Nelson, attended the 1958 award ceremony. Nelson and War Paint had never met up. An exhibition ride was slated for the presentation. The chute gate opened, and War Paint jumped out in his typical high jump. Nelson was bucked off in two seconds. The Rodeo Sports News attempted to cover over Nelson's reputation by printing a story several months later that claimed War Paint had also bucked off Tibbs in the same manner. Alvin Nelson was only 23 years old at the time. Casey and Deb Copenhaver had both tried the horse before. As seasoned bronc riders, they tried to help Nelson by adjusting the amount of rein. They made an error, and the measurement was too long. That is what actually resulted in a buck-off for Nelson. With War Paint, as Tibbs once said, \\"He was a horse that allows you no mistakes\\". Thus, War Paint showed again why he won the title. In 1958 War Paint and a horse named Joker, owned by Harry Knight & Company, tied for the award. Harry Knight was a ProRodeo Hall of Fame and Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame stock contractor. =Outs= An out is a trip out of the bucking chute. A qualified ride is 8 seconds long. Some cowboys who rode War Paint for a qualified ride include Manual Enos who got the first qualified ride on him. Enos rode War Paint a few times. Enos, for example, rode War Paint for a qualified ride in Prineville, Oregon, in 1955 and once in Redmond, California, in 1959. Others who rode him include Kenny McLena in Ellensburg, Washington; Cecil Bedford in Prineville, Oregon, in 1952; Tuffy Federer in Eugene, Oregon, in 1953; hall of famer Bud Linderman in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in 1953; Bill Ward in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in 1954; Les Johnson in Redmond, Oregon, 1957; Jackie Wright in Roseburg, Oregon, in 1957; Les Johnson at the NFR in Dallas, Texas, in 1959; and Kenny McLena at the Pendleton Round-Up in 1962. Some notable cowboys who tried War Paint without success are Dick Pasco in Ellensburg, Washington in 1952; hall of famer Bill Linderman in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in 1953; Bill Ward in Prineville, Oregon, in 1954; Jim Nunes in Red Bluff, Oregon, in 1955; Bob Bailey in Prineville, Oregon, in 1955; Arlo Curtiss in Clovis, California; Joe Chase at the Pendleton Round-Up in 1957; J.D. McKenna in Red Bluff, California, in 1957; Ted Tufares in Lebanon, Oregon, in 1958; Dean Reeves at the Pendleton Round-Up in 1959; Tom Tescher at Red Bluff, California, in 1959, Don L. Jackson in Porterville, California, in 1964; Gene McBeth in St. Paul, Oregon, in 1966; Jim Bothum in Eugene, Oregon, in 1966; Casey Tibbs, and Deb Copenhaver. = End of career = In 1958, War Paint was approximately 11 years of age. The Christensen Brothers had bucked the horse for eight years, mostly in California and in the states north of it. Hank Christensen was known to say that the horse had no distinctive bucking pattern but just tried his hardest. The stock contractor spent $10,000 to insure the horse with Lloyd's of London, the first to do so. It was a great deal of money in that time period. In 1959, the first National Finals Rodeo (NFR) took place. War Paint competed at the NFR for the first and only time, where he was ridden twice. He helped Jim Tescher and Les Johnson finish 1‚Äì2 in the Average race. War Paint's career lasted almost two decades. He finished his career off with an almost 90 percent buck-off rate. \\"If they got past those first three or four jumps, they'd ride him once in a while\\", explained Bobby Christensen Jr. ‚ÄúHe came out so high and came down so hard those first three jumps; not many of them got past those‚Äù. Retirement and death In 1966, at the Emerald Empire RoundUp, in Eugene, Oregon, War Paint bucked off Jim Botham. His owners had him unsaddled in the arena, and announced that he was retired. War Paint traveled 540,000 miles in his career. In his last season, he had 28 starts with 25 buck-offs. War Paint lived into his 30s. In his retirement, the Christensen Brothers hauled him with the other horses when they took them to major rodeos to compete. Usually, it was rodeos like California Rodeo Salinas, St. Paul Rodeo, and Pendleton Round-Up. Both the fans and War Paint seemed to appreciate having their pictures taken together. When War Paint became very old and his health was declining, the stock contractors made the decision to euthanize him so he would not have to endure another hard winter. It was Kent Rothrock, a Pendleton rancher, who had the idea to have his body preserved. War Paint died in October 1975. His owners accepted Rothrock's idea and had his body preserved by a taxidermist. Legacy War Paint's preserved body is on display at the museum in the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame in Oregon. In 2019, the Idaho Rodeo Hall of Fame inducted War Paoint. In 2011, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted War Paint. In 2001, the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame inducted War Paint and in 1969, the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame inducted War Paint. War Paint bucked off 90 percent of his riders over a two decade career. He had a signature dive which occurred within his first three jumps. The handful of riders that did ride him figured out how to get past that dive. He was popular with all the different rodeo personnel and fans. Announcers were partial to calling his name. He received fan mail from everywhere.

They are generally located in more rural areas, many of which are near the Korean demilitarized zone. The inhabitants do not interact with Korean society at large due to the stigma associated with living and working in kijichon. In terms of Korean citizens, kijichon are primarily populated by the poor and otherwise marginalized. The towns exist mainly to provide prostitution to American soldiers, which was deemed as \\"necessary for soldiers to continue protecting South Korea, and was beneficial for economic development\\" in kijichon. All of the businesses in these towns that explicitly cater to \\"U.S. military personnel must be licensed by the Korea Special Tourist Association.\\" This cooperation with the government and the fact that many bases are located near the demilitarized zone makes it easier to conceal the sex work and G.I. crime from the general population. Women who work in kijichon are particularly stigmatized as there is a sentiment that they chose to lead that life. As such, kijichon women rarely leave and when they do, they hide their lives from their families.

Participants take detailed notes of each stage of the unpacking. Drug test specimen bottle: Frangible security label detects tampering or altering of the specimen. Evidence packaging involves the specialized packaging methods and materials used for physical evidence. Items need to be collected at a crime scene or a fire scene, forwarded to a laboratory for forensic analysis, put in secure storage, and used in a courtroom. Items might include DNA, hair samples, body parts, blood samples, sperm, knives, vomit, firearms, bullets, fire accelerants, computers, checkbooks, etc. Each police or fire jurisdiction has its own policies and procedures for evidence collection and handling. Legal requirements for admissible evidence to a court also vary from region to region. Many commonalities do exist. Physical containment and protection Packaging should be the proper size, type, and material for the item. Many items are suited to a clean paper bag sealed with a security tape. Many jurisdictions desire one item per container, but situations do vary. Clean zipper storage bags are also used: special security bags or ‚Äúevidence bags‚Äù have built-in security and tamper-indicating features. Knives are best suited to packing in corrugated boxes so the blade does not cut the package or people. Empty firearms are often attached to a corrugated box by cable ties. Salvage drums are available in various sizes to contain potentially hazardous liquids. When detection of fire accelerants is needed for evidence from a fire investigation, the package must be a vapor barrier. Sometimes a glass jar such as a mason jar is used. Heat sealable nylon plastic bags have also been shown to be effective. Contamination Control is needed to prevent contamination of the evidence: investigators to the evidence, scene to scene, evidence to evidence, etc. Dangerous evidence Particular care is needed when packaging material classified as dangerous goods (Hazardous materials) and with items possibly qualifying as hazardous waste or biomedical waste. This might include: explosives, loaded firearms, ammunition, etiologic agents, flammables, radioactives, etc. Local specialists often transport items to a local laboratory for analysis or to an approved storage facility. When items are shipped (particularly by common carrier), strict regulations govern the construction, preparation, and labeling of shipping containers. Identification Individual packs and collections of items in a larger container need to be labeled: description, source, preliminary comments, special handling needs, etc. Chain of custody labels with authenticated signatures are often required. Gaps in documented custody make submission to a court more difficult. Security The physical security of packaged items is critical. The items cannot be damaged or degraded in transit or storage. The risk of theft, pilferage, tampering, adulteration, etc. must be tightly controlled. Packaging is not to be considered as ‚Äútamper proof‚Äù; it is only one component of an evidence management system. No one security feature can be considered as \\"tamper proof\\". Most security products can be foiled by a knowledgeable person with sufficient time and with access to specialized tools, solvents, extreme temperatures, other security bags, other security tapes, etc. See also *Fire investigation *Criminal investigation *Forensic firearm examination *DNA collection References * Rosette, J L, ‚ÄùImproving Tamper-Evident Packaging: Problems, Tests and Solutions\\", 1992 * Yam, K.L., \\"Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology\\", John Wiley & Sons, 2009, Forensic techniques Law enforcement techniques Packaging ","title":"Evidence packaging"},{"id":"60471810","text":"Onamihime (ÈòøÂçóÂß´, July 4, 1541 ‚Äì August 30, 1602) was a late-Sengoku period Onna-bugeisha. She was the first daughter of Date Harumune, sister of Date Terumune and aunt of Date Masamune. She was the ruler of Sukagawa castle in Mutsu Province. She was best known for being a potential enemy of her nephew, Masamune, participating in several campaigns against expansion of the Date clan in the region of ≈åsh≈´.  Life  Onamihime was married off to Nikaid≈ç Moriyoshi and they had two sons, Heishiro and Yukichika. Heishiro was sent off as a hostage with the powerful Ashina clan and was adopted turning Ashina Moritaka. After Moriyoshi and Yukichika death, Onamihime became the owner of the Sukagawa castle, chief representative of the Nikaido clan and took nun name of Daijou-in. Due to the death of Date Masamune's father, Date Terumune by the hands of Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu, Masamune swore vengeance, launching an attack against the Nihonmatsu in 1585. She fought in the Battle of Hitotoribashi alongside Ashina, S≈çma, Hatakeyama and Satake against Date clan. The allies marched with their 30,000 troops toward Motomiya Castle. Masamune with only 7,000 troops prepared a defensive strategy, Onamihime commanded her troops to attack but Masamune used a strategic defense and the allied forces retreated. In 1588, Onamihime allied again with Ashina and S≈çma clan to counter Date Masamune in Battle of Koriyama. The Battle of Suriagehara started in July 1589, Date masamune defeated Ashina and Satake troops and was given the victory of Date army, consolidating of power in Southern Mutsu. After this Date Masamune asked his aunt to come surrender, but she strongly refused. Onamihime and Ishikawa clan continued with resistance. She defended herself against the attack at the castle, when her vassal Hodohara Yukifuji betrayed the Nikaid≈ç clan to the Date and helped Masamune take Sukagawa Castle, in October 26 1589, the castle fell. Masamune saved his aunt Onamihime life, and had her escorted safely to live in retirement at Suginome Castle. However, she wasn't going to live with this, Onamihime who hated Masamune left to live with Iwaki Tsunetaka, who was another nephew. After his death, she went to Satake Yoshinobu. The Satake clan allied to the Western Army and Onamihime went along in the Battle of Sekigahara. Following the defeat of the Western Army by the Tokugawa Ieyasu Eastern Forces, the Satake Clan was allowed to continue existing, but was punished. The Satake's was moved to Dewa by Tokugawa order in 1602, and it was on the way up to Dewa, while passing her old castle in Sukagawa, that Onamihime died in 1602 and was buried there.

The building's stone facade was controversial when it appeared, as it had not been fully detailed in the building's planning documents. Islington Council called for the building's demolition, but this was overturned on appeal. The building won a RIBA National Award in 2018. History Taha originally proposed a building with a bronze facade in 2012. Taha then replaced this design with one utilizing bricks before settling on stone. During construction, Islington council indicated that the brick facade was the chosen one on its website, apparently due to an error. The council had received and approved designs for the stone facade, but because they were never placed online for the public to see, the final facade was a surprise to neighbours. Islington Council issued a ruling that the building be demolished in mid-2017 due to the error, which the council withdrew after an inquiry from a legal team employed by Taha. After rescinding the first order to demolish the structure, the council issued a second in February 2018, following \\"an investigation\\" that determined the building's final design differed from the approved design. This order cited the location of the fossils within the stone facade as \\"[...] deleterious to the conservation area and listed buildings\\" due to their \\"haphazard\\" placement. In August 2019, Taha's appeal was successful and the council's planning office granted planning permission, ruling that the building \\"accords with the generality of what had previously been approved\\" and removing the demolition order. Taha lives on the top floor of the building with his family, and the building houses the offices of his architectural practice Amin Taha + Groupwork. Design The building has a limestone facade, with visible fossils embedded in the material. The limestone was sourced from Normandy, and acts as a supportive \\"exoskeleton\\" for the building, meaning the interior does not require columns or other supports. Use of limestone sourced from Normandy was inspired by the site's original structure, an 11th-century Norman abbey, also built from limestone, unusual for that time. The building includes a small public park to its left. Taha cites Alvar Aalto, Carlo Scarpa and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe as inspirations for the structure. Reception Ann Pembroke, of the Clerkenwell Green Preservation Society, said she was \\"appalled\\" by its aesthetic departure from the surrounding buildings, adding that \\"If you want to do something outrageous don't choose a medieval close to put it in.\\" The building won a RIBA National Award, and was also considered for the Carbuncle Cup.

Their musical style today can be described as progressive rock or even progressive metal. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Darran Charles, bass player Dan Nelson, guitarist Gavin Bushell and drummer Tom Price. The band has released four studio albums and one self-titled EP; Spiral Vendetta, The Envisage Conundrum, Emergence and Faced With Rage.  History  = 2009 - 2012 = Godsticks burst onto the progressive rock scene way back in 2009 with their eclectic self-titled EP. The sheer originality of the music was greeted with enthusiasm by critics and music fans alike, with the band being considered ‚Äúa refreshing approach to the contemporary music scene‚Äù. In July 2010, the band released their debut full-length album Spiral Vendetta ‚Äì the culmination of 16 months of writing and a lengthy production process. The extensive production proved worth it as the album received a unanimously positive response, being described as ‚Äòmesmerising‚Äô. Jez Rowden of DPRP said: \\"Spiral Vendetta has it all in spades with chops, emotion, musicality and imagination, the songs pack a breathtaking amount into concise pieces and the album in no way outstays its welcome.\\"Godsticks live at Stone Free Festival London 17/06/18 = 2012 - 2013 = A worldwide distribution deal was secured on the strength of Spiral Vendetta and the band completed a number of tours and festivals, supporting such acts as The Pineapple Thief. In March 2012, Godsticks were also the supporting act on a 5-date UK tour with The Aristocrats; featuring world-renowned guitarist Guthrie Govan, bassist Bryan Beller and drummer Marco Minnemann. The tour was a huge success and introduced the band to a much wider audience. At the end of that tour the band went into the studio to record The Envisage Conundrum. The recent and extensive live work had influenced the newer material and it became much heavier and more guitar-driven. None of the band's vaunted originality was lost but The Envisage Conundrum represented a more focused and settled band, still offering an eclectic array of songs, but in a much more accessible package. = 2013 - 2014 = The Envisage Conundrum was released in 2013 and packed a hard punch in places, whilst maintaining a steady move forward in musicianship and writing. Kerrang Magazine said: \\"From the stuttering hard rock of Caught In A Bind to epic three-parter Borderstomp's electric jazz, we get flashes of innovation and virtuoso class\\". In 2013 Godsticks supported ‚ÄòThe Mike Keneally Band‚Äô on a 13-date tour of Europe and co-headlined a UK tour with ‚ÄòKnifeworld‚Äô. A three-week European tour in 2014 supporting ‚ÄòThe Aristocrats‚Äô followed, and that tour in particular indirectly forged a path towards an even heavier sound. = 2014 - 2017 = In April 2014, Godsticks continued to explore the heavier side of their musical style and set to work writing their third full-length studio album Emergence (released September 2015). A great deal of research was spent in achieving the sound they had in mind for this album. Drums were tracked at Monnow Valley Studio in November 2014, whose incredible and acclaimed live room provided the perfect foundation for the heavy guitar tracks that were to follow. Emergence was also produced by James Loughrey (known for his work with acts such as Skindred, Manic Street Preachers and Def Leppard). It received great reviews and signified a milestone in the progression of the band from complex eclectic prog-rock to a more focused, heavier progressive metal style filled with addictive grooves and memorable choruses. Total Guitar Magazine said ‚ÄúEmergence is a rare thing ‚Äì an album of technically astounding prog-metal replete with hooks and melodies\\". Typically for Godsticks, who are difficult to pin down to a specific genre, Emergence has been likened to a variety of different bands at the heavier end of the progressive spectrum, including Mastodon, Rush, and Alice in Chains. The three-piece band line-up that features on Emergence had existed since 2010. Drummer, Steve Roberts, was hired by founding member Darran Charles to play on the debut EP and subsequently joined the band. Bassist Dan Nelson was brought on board a short time later (original bass player Jason Marsh left in late 2009), having been discovered by Darran via a YouTube video Dan had posted of himself playing a Godsticks tune. Just as Emergence was being released in September 2015, Steve Roberts departed the band and an additional guitarist, Gavin Bushell, joined along with new drummer Tom Price. The new four-piece line-up started performing together in late 2015, racking up a string of support slots with bands such as Textures, Dorje and Aisles. In 2017 they supported The Pineapple Thief on both European legs of the Your Wilderness Tour, as well as performing at the HRH Prog and Planet RockStock festivals in North and South Wales respectively. = 2017 - 2019 = Godsticks subsequently went on to be signed by Kscope records and in October 2017 released their most successful album to date Faced With Rage, in addition to playing headline shows across the U.K. in 2018.

He graduated magna cum laude from California State University, Northridge with a degree in journalism in the same year and was recognized as both the outstanding journalism graduate and the outstanding overall graduate. He continued to work at the Los Angeles Times until he died of a heart attack in his office 34 years later. During his career, he was awarded with an Emmy Award, Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, and the Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. Early life and education Del Olmo's father left the household soon after his birth, causing him to be raised by his mother, siblings and other family members. Del Olmo tried to enlist in the U.S. Air Force after graduation at the height of the Vietnam War but was rejected from becoming a fighter pilot because he did not satisfy the eyesight requirements. Instead, he received a full scholarship to study journalism at UCLA, but he was forced to continue his studies elsewhere when the journalism department closed two years later. Del Olmo transferred to California State University, Northridge and finished his journalism degree magna cum laude there in 1970. He was also recognized as both the outstanding journalism graduate and the outstanding overall graduate and started an internship during that summer at the Los Angeles Times, where he was mentored by Ruben Salazar. Originally, del Olmo had the intention to attend Columbia University for a master's program in journalism on a full scholarship. This plan was quickly abandoned when the Chicano Moratorium started a march through East Los Angeles on August 29, 1970. His mentor, Ruben Salazar, was killed. Del Olmo canceled his scholarship to Columbia to continue Ruben's work at the Los Angeles Times. Work In 1972, del Olmo was the co-founder of the California Chicano News Media Association. He won an Emmy Award a few years later for \\"The Unwanted\\", a documentary on illegal immigration written by del Olmo. Throughout his work at the Los Angeles Times (and especially when he became a columnist in 1980), he wrote about and advocated on topics such as illegal immigration, issues affecting the Latino community, city policies, pop culture, and even baseball. Frank chaired a 1982 meeting of Latino journalists which led to the creation of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in 1984. Del Olmo and his team were awarded with the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their work on the 27-story Latinos. He became a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in journalism from 1987‚Äì1988. Del Olmo had a son in 1992, named Frank, who was diagnosed with autism in 1994. This led to del Olmo writing columns on autism in 1995, a topic he eventually wrote 10 columns about. Del Olmo was promoted to associate editor in 1998, at which point he had already been the first Latino to be listed among the Times' top editors since 1989. Another major milestone before his death was his induction into the National Association of Hispanic Journalists Hall of Fame in 2002. Throughout his career, del Olmo held positions as \\"an intern, a staff writer specializing in Latino issues and Latin American affairs, an editorial writer, deputy editor of the editorial page, a Times Mirror Company director and an assistant to the editor of The Times[, and associate editor]\\" (Los Angeles Times).

Ma'aseh Bereshit (following Genesis 1) comprises the cosmogony of the Talmudic times; Ma'aseh Merkavah (based on the description of the Divine Chariot in Ezekiel 1, and on other prophetic descriptions of divine manifestations, such as Isaiah 6), is concerned with the theosophic views of those times. Rules regarding study The secret doctrine might not be discussed in public. Ecclesiasticus inveighs against its study: \\"Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.\\"Ecclesiasticus 3:21-22 The Mishnah says: \\"Ma'aseh Bereshit must not be explained before two, nor Ma'aseh Merkavah before one, unless he be wise and understands it by himself\\";Hagigah 2:1 The Talmud then goes on to explain that the chapter- headings of Ma'aseh Merkavah may be taught, as was done by R. Hiyya.Hagigah 13a According to Yerushalmi Hagigah 2:1, the teacher read the headings of the chapters, after which, subject to the approval of the teacher, the pupil read to the end of the chapter. R. Zera said that even the chapter-headings might be communicated only to a person who was head of a school and was cautious in temperament. According to R. Ammi, the secret doctrine might be entrusted only to one who possessed the five qualities enumerated in Isaiah 3:3. A certain age is, of course, necessary. When R. Johanan wished to initiate R. Eliezer in the Ma'aseh Merkavah, the latter answered, \\"I am not yet old enough.\\" A boy who recognized the meaning of ◊ó◊©◊û◊ú (Ezekiel 1:4) was consumed by fire,Hagigah 13b and the perils connected with the unauthorized discussion of these subjects are often described.Hagigah 2:1; Shabbat 80b Maaseh Breishit Hagigah 11b states that it is permissible to inquire concerning the events of the six days of Creation, but not regarding what happened before the Creation. In no case, then, is the entire cosmogony included in the term \\"Ma'aseh Bereshit,\\" but only its more mystic aspects, nor can all the passages of the Talmud and the Midrash dealing with these problems be considered as parts of the doctrine. Thus, ideas like those regarding the ten agencies by means of which God created the world, or questions as to whether heaven or earth was first created, or concerning the foundations of the world, or as to whether there are two heavens or seven (all these problems being mentioned in connection with the interdiction against teaching the Ma'aseh Bereshit to more than one person), do not belong to the doctrine itself, for such arguments are forbidden by the dictum, \\"You may speak of the seven heavens, but of the things after it you may not speak.\\" The views which are found scattered throughout the Talmud, and especially in Genesis Rabbah 1-12, are generally aggadic in character; indeed the question arises whether anything more than mere allusions may be expected therein regarding Ma'aseh Bereshit, in so far as it is esoteric in content. Some information seems to be given, though only by intimation, in the story of the four scholars that entered paradise (that is, penetrated the mysteries of the secret doctrine), of whom only R. Akiva remained uninjured.Hagigah 14b-15b R. Akiva's words at the beginning of the story, \\"When you reach the shining marble stone do not cry out 'Water, water,'\\"Hagigah 14b seem to point to those theories of Creation which assume water to be the original element. Ben Yoma is represented as interested in the determination of the space between the upper and lower waters. Hagigah 2:1 also indicates this in the story of R. Judah b. Pazzi, who opened his discourse on Ma'aseh Bereshit with the words, \\"In the beginning the world was water in water.\\" Thus, the question of the primal elements undoubtedly belongs to this field. Here again, one must distinguish aggadic and devotional from mystic and philosophical thought, and must not teach views such as that the world was created out of \\"tohu\\" and \\"bohu\\" and \\"hoshekh,\\" or that air, wind, and storm were the primal elements, as component parts of the doctrine of Creation. Similarly, the cosmogonic conceptions of the Apocrypha and of geonic mysticism must not be considered as indications of the secret teachings of the Ma'aseh Bereshit. Maaseh Merkavah Somewhat simpler is the question regarding the nature of the Ma'aseh Merkavah, which is designated as \\"an important matter\\" in the Talmud,Sukkah 28a and which, perhaps, occupies on the whole a more prominent position than the Ma'aseh Bereshit. Just as in the case of the latter, the purely aggadic explanations of Ezekiel 1 (as found, for instance, in Hagigah 13b) must not be taken into consideration. It is declared that this chapter of Ezekiel may be studied even by young pupils, because a boy can seldom recognize the doctrines implied in it. The object, therefore, was to find special secrets in these verses. Rabbi Akiva is saidHagigah 15b-16a to have gathered his mystic deductions from Deuteronomy 33:2 (\\"and he came with ten thousands of saints\\"), Song of Songs 5:10 (\\"the chiefest among ten thousand\\"), Isaiah 48:2 (\\"The Lord of hosts is his name\\"), and I Kings 19:11,12 (Elijah's great theophany). The Ma'aseh Merkavah, therefore, dealt with esoteric teachings concerning the visible manifestations of God, and hence with angelology and demonology, though not to the same degree as in Talmudic literature. As the story of R. Akiva indicates, the other theophanies mentioned in the Bible were used in the Ma'aseh Merkavah; ·∏§ag. 13b shows, e.g., that this was the case with Isaiah 6. Practical Applications Ma'aseh Merkavah seems to have had practical applications. The belief was apparently current that certain mystic expositions of the Ezekiel chapter, or the discussion of objects connected with it, would cause God to appear. When R. Eleazar ben Arach was discoursing upon the Ma'aseh Merkavah to R. Yohanan ben Zakkai, the latter dismounted from his donkey, saying, \\"It is not seemly that I sit on the ass while you are discoursing on the heavenly doctrine, and while the Divinity is among us and ministering angels accompany us.\\" Then a fire came down from heaven and surrounded all the trees of the field, whereupon all of them together began to recite the hymn of praise. R. Jose ha-Kohen and his companionR. Joshua; or R. Simon b. Nathanael according to Yerushalmi Hagigah 2:1 had similar experiences. The belief in the appearance of God is indicated also in the popular idea that all who inquire into the mysteries of the Ma'aseh Merkavah without being duly authorized will die a sudden death. Such a divine interposition is expressly mentioned in connection with the \\"story of the Creation\\" in Sanhedrin 95b. Rab Hananiah and Rab Hoshaiah studied the Sefer Yetzirah and the \\"Hilkhot Yetzirah\\" respectively every Sabbath evening and succeeded in creating a calf as large as a three-year-old ox. This esoteric tendency must have led often to pessimistic and nihilistic views, as is shown by the accounts of Elisha ben AbuyahHagigah 15a, b and the Mishnaic passage, \\"He who speaks of the things which are before, behind, above, and below, it were better he had never been born.\\" According to a tradition handed down by Jose b. Judah, a tanna of the second half of the second century,Tosefta Hagigah 2:2; Hagigah 14b; Yerushalmi Hagigah 2:1 Yochanan ben Zakkai was the founder of the secret doctrine. In the same passage, in both Talmuds, it is said, however, that he refused to discuss it, even in the presence of a single person, although, as already stated, R. Eleazar ben Arach discoursed on it with him and was extravagantly praised by him; two other pupils of his, R. Joshua and R. Jose ha-Kohen, also discussed it with him. According to tradition, the second one to give instruction in these matters was R. Joshua, vice-president of the Sanhedrin under R. Gamaliel. He was succeeded by R. Akiva, and the last to teach them was R. Ne·∏•unya ben ha-·∏≤anah. R. Jose the Galilean and Pappus discussed the subject with R. Akiva.Hagigah 14a; Genesis Rabbah 21 The tradition, quoted above, of the four who studied the secret doctrine mentions, besides Akiva, Simeon ben Azzai, Simeon ben Zoma, and Elisha ben Abuyah. The fate of the last-named, who was driven from Judaism by his experience, is said to have given rise to restrictive measures. The study of profane books was forbidden,Sanhedrin 100 and an interdiction of the public discussion of these subjects was issued, only R. Ishmael objecting. In the time of R. Judah, R. Judah b. Pazzi and Bar ·∏≤appara delivered public discourses on these mysteries.Yerushalmi Hagigah 2:1; Genesis Rabbah 1 R. Levi regarding this as inadmissible, R. ·∏§iyya declared that the chapter-headings might be taught. R. Judah ha-Nasi was at this time the authority to whom, as formerly to R. Johanan, such matters were referred. In later times the interdiction against public discussions of the story of the Creation was accepted without protest, but by way of warning this sayingHagigah 16a of Resh La·∏≥ish was added: \\"His eyes shall be dull who looketh on three things‚Äîthe rainbow [because it resembles Ezekiel's vision], the king [because he resembles God in majesty], and the priest [because he utters the name of God].\\" Source of Doctrines This Talmudic doctrine may well be connected with the old Jewish esoteric teachings of the time of the Second Temple, as partly preserved in the Apocrypha and the pseudepigrapha. But the theosophic and cosmogonic portions of this literature cannot with certainty be regarded as the source of the Talmudic doctrine. Nor can the literature of the so- called geonic mysticism, crystallized in the Ma'aseh Bereshit and the Ma'aseh Merkavah and designated in its literary form by these names, be regarded as the immediate continuation of Talmudic mysticism. Although much of the material found in the former may belong to the Talmud, yet the entire doctrine of the heavenly halls, angelology, and the doctrine of the Creation as it is found, for instance, in Sefer Yetzirah, must not be regarded as Talmudic in origin. The very fact that there are so many Talmudic and midrashic parallels to the conceptions of the geonic period leads to the conclusion that they contain only a limited amount of original material from the ancient esoteric teachings. Later interpretation Alternative Medieval views developed of the esoteric meanings of Judaism. Maimonides interprets Ma'aseh Bereshit as referring to, or prepared by, Aristotelian physics and Ma'aseh Merkavah as referring to an Aristotelian philosophical metaphysics basis for understanding Divine Providence in terms of God's Attributes of Action. Due to the vicissitudes of history, Aristotle's profound intellect had rediscovered this ancient Judaic wisdom. In contrast, Theosophic Kabbalah (\\"Received Tradition\\") interpreted their mythic, dynamic psychological drama of God's Persona attributes, and their mutual influence by Man, as the meaning of these secret doctrines of the Torah.

At 19, she was married to Prince Alexander Borisovich Kurakin (1697 ‚Äì 1749), Privy Councilor and Conference Minister, who had just returned from Paris, where he was the Plenipotentiary Ambassador. Their wedding took place on April 26, 1730. Alexandra's marriage was the beginning of the rise of the Panin family. The Kurakin family held a high position at court. Alexander Borisovich under Empress Anna Ioannovna was a supporter of Ernst Johann von Biron and became his official jester and amusement. With the help of intrigue, he managed to maintain his position in the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna. In 1749, Alexander Ivanovna widowed. She had eight children left in her arms.

By the beauty and ease of syllable, clarity of thought, the letters of Alexandra Ivanovna are among the best examples of the epistolary heritage of the 18th century. She wrote equally easily in Russian and French. After marrying her daughters and the disintegration of a large family, deserted the huge Kurakin house, in which she remained alone with her unmarried daughter, Princess Agrafena Alexandrovna, continued to serve, thanks to her, as a connecting center for the whole family, among which she enjoyed great respect and prestige.

Newman moved to England in 1814, and was soon afterwards appointed minister to the Jewish community of Plymouth by Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell. While in London, Newman took part in spirited public debates at the Freemasons' Tavern with Christian missionaries. Having challenged any Jewish convert or learned Christian to dispute with him on Old Testament messianic prophecies, he held a well-attended public disputation with Joseph Wolff on 8 March 1827. Newman also delivered regular Shabbat sermons at the Jews' Free School, the building being always crowded by anxious listeners. At the same time, Newman taught Hebrew at the University of Oxford. As a Jew, Newman was debarred from a professorship, but among his pupils were many distinguished Christian and Jewish scholars, including Morris Jacob Raphall, David Woolf Marks, and future Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Campbell Tait. Newman left for the United States in about 1849 and settled in New York City, gaining a livelihood as teacher and writer. He died there in February 1871, and was buried in the Beth Olam Cemetery. Work In 1850 he published a polemical tract in answer to Christian missionaries, entitled The Challenge Accepted, consisting of a series of dialogues between a Jew and a Christian respecting the fulfilment of the prophecies on the advent of the Messiah. The work explained crucial biblical passages, mostly in the Books of Genesis and Isaiah, and then moved on to question the authenticity of the gospel literature based on inner contradictions.

After Augustus's death in 1878, Amelia Yeomans, along with her daughter Lilian, decided to enter the medical profession. Since Canadian medical schools did not accept women students, Yeomans and her daughter enrolled in the Ann Arbor Medical School at the University of Michigan. Yeomans received her degree in 1883. She then moved to Winnipeg, where Lilian was already practicing midwifery and medicine. Yeomans's second daughter, Charlotte, became a nurse and joined the family in Winnipeg in 1890.  Career  Plaque honoring Dr. Amelia Yeomans, Winnipeg As physicians, Yeomans and her daughter frequently treated sex workers, homeless women, and others being held in the local jail. These experiences led Yeomans to write a pamphlet educating women about sexually transmitted diseases. The pamphlet was released by the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The WCTU was the first English-speaking organization in Manitoba to espouse women's suffrage. In 1893, the first year of recorded WCTU activity, Yeomans served as an officer for the organization. On February 9, 1893, Yeomans and the WCTU staged a mock parliament in the Bijou Theatre in Winnipeg, organized by Arminda Myrtal Blakely, and invited the Manitoba legislature to attend. Yeomans played the premier, while other members, including Nellie Letitia Mooney and Ella Cora Hind, presented pro and con arguments. In 1894, Yeomans helped to form the Equal Franchise Association in Manitoba. Yeomans served as the provincial president of the WCTU from 1896‚Äì1897.

He is sometimes incorrectly called Reid or Reade. Early Life Patrick was the son of Christopher Patrick Read and Emma McKay, both originally from Dublin, Ireland. In 1898, they emigrated to England, where they settled in London before moving to Liverpool. Patrick was born on the ship they took to Liverpool. In 1912, the family emigrated to Canada. When the family returned to England in 1915, Patrick remained in Canada. He quickly joined the Canadian Army. World War One Read served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in a transmission unit. His unit's role was to lay telephone lines between the different army units as radio units were not generally available. Read joined around 1915 and served for three years, including time on the Western Front. It is speculated in his obituary, which was published in the Industrial Worker newspaper, that he married while in France and had a child [who is thought to have died in World War 2.] During his time in France, he was likely introduced to the ideas of Anarcho-Syndicalism. Interwar Period Following the end of his service, Read returned to Canada before moving to the United States of America. In 1919, while in the U.S. he became involved in the Industrial Workers of the World, an international labor union founded in 1905 in Chicago. The union combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union whose members are further organized within the industry of their employment. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as \\"revolutionary industrial unionism\\", with ties to both socialist and anarchist labor movements. In 1921, he returned to Ireland and took up residence in Cork City, where he worked as a freelance journalist tied to the Cork Examiner. While in Ireland, Read became involved in the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI) and joined the Anti-Treaty Side (Irish Republican Army) in the Irish Civil War. Read identified with espoused Irish labour leader James Connolly, who was an Irish Republican and Socialist leader. Connolly was part of the Industrial Workers of the World and founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party. Read served on the executive committee of the CPI and advocated for Syndicalist positions to be adopted by the party. Read clashed with CPI party leader Roddy Connolly (son of James Connolly) who would later expel Read from the party. Read believed that Roddy Connolly allowed the far-left in Ireland play a subservient role to the Nationalist Movement. By 1924, at the age of 25, Read left Ireland for England where he remained until 1932. Read returned to the United States where he reconnected with the IWW. He became the Editor of the Industrial Worker, the official newspaper of the IWW. Read founded the Council for Union Democracy, based in Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s. This group was influenced by the IWW, helping trade-unionists combat the corruption and violence that afflicted many labour organizations. Fellow board members were Jack Sheridan and Sidney Lens. Spanish Civil War Read is reputed to have been among the first group of Americans to sneak over the French border to Spain to join the war, following the closure of the border, around 5 February 1937. When he arrived, Read was offered a leadership position due to previous World War One military experience. Read declined, citing his anarchist beliefs as the reason. Read was often at odds with those he served beside due to his ideologies. Read transferred from his initial placement with French volunteers in XIV International Brigade over to the Lincoln Battalion of the XV International Brigade, which was considered more tolerant of dissenting political views. Read was known for his anti-Stalinist beliefs, refusing to bow to the Soviet Union on left-wing political matters. While in Spain, Read became a member of Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo, the militant Spanish Labour union. As he had done during World War 1, Read's role in the Spanish Civil War was transmissions. Read left Spain on 5 December 1938, aboard the President Roosevelt. Later life Following the end of the Spanish Civil War and the defeat of the Republican forces, Read returned to Chicago where he resumed his position as Editor of the Industrial Worker. Read died at the age of 48 on 16 November 1947 of a cerebral haemorrhage.

Van der Aa, p. 418 Adriaan Teding van Berkhout (Hoorn, 1571 or 1572? -- The Hague, 13 August 1620) was an eminent Dutch jurist, justice in the Hof van Holland, and politician of the Dutch Republic. He was a friend of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who tried to warn the latter of his impending arrest before the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets. Personal life Adriaan was born the son of Hoorn burgomaster Jan Teding van Berkhout and Levina de Huybert. He was educated at a latin school in Leiden and subsequently studied law at Leiden University where he was enrolled as a student under the name Hadrianus Berckhout on 11 February 1588. He received his doctoral law degree from the University of Orl√©ans on 10 April 1595.Morren, p. 124 He married Geertruid van Gael in Monnikendam in 1597, with whom he had one son (Volkert), and after her death, on 25 May 1604 with Margaretha Duyst van Beresteyn in Delft. With the latter he had the following children: Lidia (who died young), Johan (who was deaf-mute), Paulus, Lydia (who married Govert Brasser, pensionary of Delft), Geertruid (who married Hugo Brasser, baljuw of Haringskerspel), Cornelia (who married lieutenant-admiral Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp), Maria (who married Nicolaas de Bye, pensionary of Monnikendam and later justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland), and Margaretha (who married jonkheer Jan van Egmond van den Nieuburg, schepen of Alkmaar and bewindhebber of the VOC). Morren, p. 125 Career After finishing his studies Adriaan was appointed pensionary of the city of Monnikendam in 1596 and promoted to treasurer of that city on 29 September 1598. On 6 May 1605 he was enrolled in the court of audit of the States of Holland and West Friesland, for which he moved to The Hague. There he became a member of the Court of Audit of the Dutch Republic on 31 March 1611. On 6 May 1613 he was appointed a member of the Council of State. On 28 March 1614 he was appointed justice in the Hof van Holland. As such he was part of a commission that was sent in 1615 by the States of Holland to mediate in a conflict within the city government of Leeuwarden. In 1614 the States of Holland promulgated a Resolution entitled \\"For the Peace of the Church\\", promoted by Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius to enforce toleration between partisans of two warring theologians, Jacobus Arminius (who called themselves the \\"Remonstrants') and Franciscus Gomarus (who were called the \\"Counter- Remonstrants\\"). The enforcement of this Resolution caused discord within the Hof van Holland, with Rombout Hogerbeets and Reinoud van Brederode, the president of the Hoge Raad, joined by Adriaan, opposing Counter-Remonstrant sympathizers on the court. The conflict escalated after the States of Holland adopted the Sharp Resolution. Adriaan was a good friend of Oldenbarnevelt and when the States General authorized the stadtholder and Captain general of the Dutch States Army Maurice, Prince of Orange to arrest Oldenbarnevelt on 28 August 1618, Adriaan went to warn the latter of the impending arrest together with another member of the court. But Oldenbarnevelt ignored the warning and was arrested the next morning.Van der Aa The following trial brought peril for Adriaan also, because he had imprudently written a compromising letter to Oldenbarnevelt that was found during a search of the latter's correspondence by one of the judges in the trial, Albert Bruinink (a colleague of Adriaan).

In addition to the Town of Ballston (including the hamlets of Burnt Hills and Ballston Lake), it also serves Charlton, Clifton Park, and Glenville.Home. Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Central School District. Retrieved on April 12, 2019. Today, district enrollment typically hovers between 3,100 pupils to 3,200 pupils, with 400-500 students enrolled in each elementary school, approximately 800 students enrolled at Richard H. O'Rourke Middle School, and about 1,200 students enrolled at the high school. The district was established in 1915 so residents could have their own local high school instead of paying to send their pupils to surrounding schools. It was formed out of three existing districts, each having one-room schoolhouses, making it the first consolidated school district in the state. Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake School of Agriculture & Homemaking was established in 1916 and the first high school graduation ceremony was held in 1920 for two pupils. In the early 1930s, the front facing side of what was then the Lakehill Road School, and is now Francis L. Stevens Elementary had burnt down, and was rescontructed. Fourteen additional districts joined in the period 1925 to 1962, all of which had one-room schoolhouses. Many additional buildings were constructed throughout the 1950s. Pashley Elementary, the first building with the intent of teaching grades K-6 was built in 1951 following the post-war baby boom; at this point, many children continued to attend one room schoolhouses. In 1955, the BH-BL High School was build, and the Lakehill Road School was converted into Ballston Lake Elementary School (renamed Francis L. Stevens Elementary in 1967 to honor the district's first superintendent). Next, Glenhaven and Charlton Heights Elementary Schools were built, using the same design in order to save the district money. In 1961, a final school was constructed, and the Junior High became the third building in the district on Lakehill Road. Throughout the 1960s, every building received a new addition to accommodate for the district's growing enrollment, which peaked at 5,467 students in 1970. The 1980s and 1990s saw a few more major changes to the district. Sixth grade classes were moved from elementary schools to the Junior High School in 1988, and the building was modified to service pupils grades 6-8. Then, in 1994 the building was renamed to Richard H. O‚ÄôRourke Middle School, to honor a long- time superintendent upon his retirement. In 1981, Glenhaven Elementary was closed due to declining enrollment in the district. The space was renamed the Hostetter Administration & Leadership Center, and held the district's administrative office until a water main break led to extensive damage in 2009.

He was Auxiliary Bishop of Lima from 2002 to 2006. He is a member of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV).  Biography  Jos√© Antonio Eguren Anselmi was born on 14 June 1956 in Lima, Peru, the son of Alejandro Eguren Bresani and Blanca Anselmi. He entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and about the same time joined the SCV., becoming a member of its founding generation. He then studied philosophy and theology in Lima, earning a degree in sacred theology. On 9 July 1981 he took his perpetual vows as a member of the SCV. He spent 1982 at the in Colombia, and pursued specialized studies in Spirituality and Liturgy at the Pastoral Theology Institute of Episcopal Conference of Latin America (CELAM). He was ordained a priest on 12 December 1982 by Cardinal Juan Land√°zuri Ricketts and became a priest of the Archdiocese of Lima in February 2001 when Pope John Paul II granted the SCV the right to incardinate its own priests. In addition to work within the SCV, Eguren from 1985 to 1989 was secretary of the Liturgy Commission of the Peruvian Bishops' Conference. From December 1991 to February 2002, he was pastor of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Reconciliaci√≥n in Lima. In November 2000 he was named episcopal vicar with responsibility for apostolic movements as well as a member Archdiocesan College of Consiltors. On 16 February 2002, Pope John Paul II appointed him titular bishop of Castello di Ripa and Auxiliary Bishop of Lima. He received his episcopal consecration on 7 April from Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne. On 11 July 2006, Pope Benedict XVI named him Archbishop of Piura. He was installed there on 22 August.  Defamation lawsuits  In January 2018, Peruvian journalist Pedro Salinas published articles online that compared Eguren to Bishop Juan Barros, who was then the center of the clerical sex abuse scandal in Chile. He wrote that Eguren \\"knew everything\\" about abuse committed by the founder of SCV, Luis Fernando Figari, and accused him of participating in illegal real estate transactions. When Salinas refused to retract several statements, Eguren sued him, submitting a criminal complaint alleging aggravated defamation in August 2018. In October Eguren sued a second journalist, Paola Ugaz, for defamation for statements similar to those made by Salinas. She later said: \\"With this complaint, Eguren demonstrates himself as the ‚Äòstar‚Äô student of Figari, who established a culture of abuse and cover- up.\\" Salinas and Ugaz are co-authors of Half Monks, Half Soldiers (2015), an expos√© of sexual, psychological and physical abuse on the part of the SCV's leadership. Though the charges carry both fines and prison sentences, Eguren was not seeking more than a verdict in his favor and any fine imposed could be paid to a charity. In February 2019, Martin Scheuch, a former SCV member who was testifying in defense of Salinas, described Eguren as \\"very sentimental and affectionate\\" in contrast to the rest of the SCV leaders, but lacking \\"an analytical ability and critical spirit\\". He said Eguren's behavior was \\"no different substantially than what other people in positions of authority in the Sodalitium did\\" and that he witnessed Figari's behavior but lacked the capacity to recognize its severity. He said \\"either he was unable to see the excesses and disorders that that way of life implied, or he simply ignored them out of fidelity to the institution\\". On 28 February 2019, Amnesty International expressed concern that the legal proceedings were in criminal court. It asked Peruvian authorities to \\"ensure that the judicial system is not used to harass or discredit critical voices by imposing punishments for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression\\". Salinas was found guilty in April 2019, fined $24,000, and given a one-year suspended sentence. In response, the Peruvian Bishops' Conference expressed support for Salinas, saying that he \\"sought to clarify the truth\\" about the SCV. Their statement said that Pope Francis wanted them \\"to prioritize the compensation and attention to the victims of every type of abuse, condemning any form of complicity\\" and that he had \\"praised and thanked the work of the journalists who, through their investigations, contribute to denouncing the abuses, punishing the perpetrators and assisting the victims\\". The statement called for solidarity with victims of abuse and those who expose it. The case provoked a political discussion about decriminalizing defamation to remove the threat of prison. Eguren withdrew his complaint against Salinas on 24 April, nullifying Salinas' sentence, which he said had produced \\"a series of unjustified reactions, including inside of the Church\\".

Features  The basis of Shastar Vidiya is a five-step movement which includes advancing on the opponent; hitting his flank, deflection of incoming blows, taking a commanding position and striking. As a full combat martial art it also includes both unarmed and armed combat techniques using swords, clubs, sticks, spears, daggers and other weapons. =Theory of Power= Shastar Vidya is a subtle art and does not rely on fitness, flexibility or strength like western fighting systems. Instead, it uses tactical positioning and body mechanics.

Early life and education  Badeau was born in Pittsburgh in 1903. He received a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from Union College, a bachelor of divinity degree from the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, and a master's in sacred theology from Union Theological Seminary. Badeau also pursued graduate studies in Arabic and Muslim philosophy. As an ordained minister and missionary of the Dutch Reformed Church, Badeau moved to the Middle East in 1928. He was a civil and sanitary engineering missionary in Iraq, Mosul, and Baghdad.The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography, by John S. Bowman. Copyright ¬© Cambridge University Press 1995. Badeau spoke fluent Arabic and later became a Presbyterian.  Academic career  From 1936 until 1945, Badeau was dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at the recently established American University in Cairo. During World War II, Badeau went on a brief leave of absence from the University to serve as the Chief Middle East Specialist with the United States Office of War Information. In 1945, he was named the second president of the institution and served in that role until 1953. While president of the university, Badeau continued to teach religion, ethics and philosophy classes. Badeau developed the University's first strategic plan and established the university's social research center with a grant from the Ford Foundation. Badeau was a recipient of the Order of the Nile from President Mohamed Naguib. In May 1964, Badeau was named as director of Columbia University's Near and Middle East Institute and began work as adjunct professor of international relations. Upon his retirement in 1971, he became professor emeritus of modern Middle East studies. He continued to be a professional lecturer at Georgetown University until 1974, and was a founding fellow of the Middle East Studies Association of North America.  Diplomatic career  In 1953, Badeau was named president of the Near East Foundation. In 1961, Badeau was named by President of the United States John F. Kennedy as his choice for Ambassador to the United Arab Republic. While Syria had seceded from the UAR in the same year, Egypt would still be referred to as the UAR until 1971. After the Assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, Badeau informed President Lyndon B. Johnson that he wished to return to academic life. He left his post as Ambassador in 1964.  Works  Badeau's various published works included \\"East and West of Suez\\" (1941) and \\"The Emergence of Modern Egypt\\" (1953), both for the Foreign Policy Association; and \\"The Lands Between\\" (Friendship Press, 1958) and \\"The American Approach to the Arab World\\" (Harper and Row, 1967), for the Council on Foreign Relations. Badeau contributed to numerous other publications and was the author of articles that appeared in Foreign Affairs and The Atlantic. He also wrote about the background of Soviet Middle Eastern foreign policy during the Cold War for the Academy of Political Science.  See also  * Foreign policy of the John F.

The theory suggests that a harsh or hostile environment will lead to the regal (warlike) societal structure or regal reaction, while a secure and safe environment is expected to lead to the kungic (kalyptic; peaceful) societal structure or kungic reaction. Both of these societal designs may be impacted by other groups designs, and the proximity of one group to another group. In addressing these psychological response effects on cultural constructions, the theory applies at the individual-level and social group-level. Precursors to this regality theory are cultural r/k theory and cultural selection theory.  Theoretical foundations and conceptual connections  Evolutionary psychology is the major discipline that the regal and kungic society theory falls under. Evolutionary psychology focuses on the psychological adaptations thought to be specific to an entire species that are displayed and observed by individuals of the species of focus These psychological adaptations are then suggested to explain elements of culture in that they are linked to cultural structure/patterns (social organization) based on the way that the individuals creating and perpetuating the culture are thinking of their surrounding world, which is considered a worldview. The regal and kungic society theory poses that the social group environment triggers psychological adaptations that are meant to address whatever collective dangers come from that environmental setting. The modeling of this regality theory is also attributed to evolutionary game theory and life history theory (in a biological lens). It incorporates evolutionary game theory in that the regal and kungic society theory have similar expectations of social behavior, specifically altruism and cooperation. Individuals fighting for the collective social group (altruistic behavior or self- sacrifice) directly refers to the regal dimension of the regal and kungic society theory. Life history theory's connection to this regality theory comes from the shared expectations of reproduction patterns based on ecological settings. This also connects the theory of regal and kungic societal structures to the discipline of evolutionary ecology as both theories (regality theory and life history theory) are addressing events that are considered the universal stages/events of life across all organisms- birth, reproduction, death.  Agner Fog  Agner Fog is considered the main writer and investigator of regality theory. Fog is attributed with coining the term \\"regality theory.\\" He is currently an associate professor at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), and has been present at DTU since 1995. In this time, Fog has studied and published works of research that focus on cultural and evolutionary anthropology (includes regality theory), computer science (the field he predominantly lectures), and social systems. Fog has also developed some forms of computer modeling that are meant to model some elements of cultural patterns. He developed this regal and kungic societal patterning theory through the 1990s to the 2010s, but the term \\"regality theory\\" is directly used in his 2017 work, Warlike and Peaceful Societies: the Interaction of Genes and Culture. However, first versions of the regal and kungic society theory by Fog are present in his book, Cultural Selection, which was published in 1999. In it, he uses the terms \\"regal\\" and \\"kungic\\" or \\"kalyptic\\" in the identical fashion as his 2017 book. = Warlike and peaceful societies: the interaction of genes and culture = This is the book that breaks down the theory of regal and kungic soocietal structures in the greatest detail under the name of \\"regality theory\\". This book, published in 2017, is meant to explore the regal and kungic conditions to understand how collective dangers (real or perceived) impact the psychological dispositions of social group members that lead to the preference for conditions of strong leadership and hierarchy or for egalitarian, peaceful social systems.  Regal society  By this theory of regality, under harsh or hostile environmental conditions, the regal reaction is anticipated. It is the societal pattern that the term \\"warlike\\" is referring to. Individuals that live in these settings are likely to prefer an organization where there is a strong leader that is perceived as adequate enough to handle collective danger, whether it is real or perceived. This leadership based condition would then address what is known as the collective action problem. This problem is understood as the need for all members of the collective to behave cooperatively or altruistically where they \\"fight\\" for the collective good no matter the individual level cost, which may be resource loss, injury, and/or death, but there is a failure to do this if group level interest are in conflict with the individual's interests. These individual interests are thought to outweigh the cost and potential benefits of group/joint action. Should leadership employ their centralized power well enough across members of the social group, this collective action problem can be addressed and the potential of free-riding is lessened, which eradicates the occurrence of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The prisoner's dilemma, a concept from game theory (and subsequently evolutionary game theory), refers to the expected strategy choices of individuals in reference to obtaining some form of benefit/payoff(s). In this dilemma, there is the defector (cheater) and the cooperator. The idea suggests that individuals will choose to behave (defect/cooperate) based on which choice will most likely incur the greatest payoff and/or lowest cost. The idea of the regal condition/response will have an authoritarian figure strong enough to ensure the cooperation of the social group members as it is perceived such cooperation will ensure the defeat of the collective danger, which is typically war or intergroup conflict. It is mentioned as well that, in this condition, tyranny becomes possible as the collective is upholding a central power that could, by exploiting the fear of the group interference to the collective danger (real or not), monopolize resources and further their power. The characteristics expected in a society at this regal level would include authoritarianism, hierarchy, xenophobia (intolerance to minorities and out-groups), territoriality, and discipline of high degree. = Authoritarian personality theory = Authoritarian personality theory is equated to regality theory, particularly at the regal level. An authoritarian personality would entail an individual having attitudes depicted as belief of absolute obedience/submission to authority. This is submission is or belief in submission is accomplished via the oppression of those not in power (typical members of the social group) by the centralized authority. It is currently understood in two sections based on two identified worldview. The worldview that the world is a dangerous place perpetuates the right-wing authoritarian personality type, while the psychological understanding of the world as a dog-eat-dog world will lead to social dominance orientation. The perception of collective danger and the expected response to such danger described by authoritarian personality theory allow for the connection between this theory and regality theory. The difference between the two and the justification for the consideration of regality theory over authoritarian personality theory is that regality theory allows for greater empirical research via statistical analysis of causal relationships as well as regality theory's better avoidance of politics.  Kungic society  A kungic society is then the resulting community formation from environments of collective safety and general peace, and is considered the opposite condition to the regal condition, which suggests a dichotomous structure. This condition may also be known as the \\"kalyptic\\" level. There is little to no expected, perceived, or real collective danger that would trigger psychological adaptations specific to addressing dangers. The security of resources, territory, and within-group peace would result in the psychological dispositions towards an egalitarian system. The theory poses that there would be greater equality/equity across the group members at this level and that leadership would be little or at least not centralized as in the regal counterpart. In the kungic society, it is also anticipated that tyranny would not be possible, as the collective would not tolerate an opportunity for a centralized power to exploit resources and members of the group for their own self-enrichment. The characteristics expected for this societal pattern would include an egalitarian system, tolerance of minorities and out-groups (opposite of xenophobia), peacefulness, little separation of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\", and less specialization.  Applications  = Methods of study = It is important to note that forms of study used to empirically observe regality of a culture are still developing. The most common form seen is to retroactively attempt to find evidence of the regal and kungic designs on studies already completed. Thus, studies particularly designed with instruments to study regal and kungic are somewhat limited. A study was done by taking data of 186 non- industrial societies in the form of a standard cross-cultural sample and ethnographic records that created a sub-sample set. The study utilized various statistical methods and was retroactively performed on data from explorers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Exploratory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and multiple correlation analysis were all run on this data and found that cultural variables such as political integration, sex morals, trends in autonomy, class stratification, and high gods, are correlated with intergroup conflict in the directions that regality theory would predicts. Studies that are considered related to this are studies that look that also attempt to isolate the relationship of cultural variables to collective dangers. Variations of factorial analyses appear to be most common statistical method that might be applied to regal and kungic society studies. There is suggestion that archaeological data may also prove regal and kungic societal structures of ancestral populations. Artifacts, by regality theory, reveal in their design whether a researcher is looking at a piece from a kungic society or a regal society. This connection is considered exemplified by the organization of a design. If the design appears uniform and orderly, then is it likely from a regal society in that this condition would have higher value for these styles of detail- this is if one is to believe that identify may be derived form artifact. An artifact of a kungic society might then have design that is more abstract, disorderly, and lacking uniform. = War and intergroup conflict response = Intergroup conflict and war are the major evolutionary factors thought to make up the collective dangers a social group might encounter. This makes them two evolutionary factors very relevant to regality theory. War and intergroup conflict response is what the psychological dispositions that select for a regal society are theorized to be meant for. A major objective of studying regal and kungic (kalyptic) responses is that one might be able to isolate universal conditions leading to war and intergroup conflict and the needed conditions for peace-building and peace-keeping. This real-world application connects this regality theory to political psychology.  Regal/Kungic social patterning in non-human species  Considering the study of regality theory among real world human communities is relatively new, studies of regal and kungic level societies amongst non-humans remains basically non-existent and potentially more contentious than at the human level. It would involve utilizing a definition of culture that is not human specific. Defining culture remains a contentious topic across the whole of social sciences. The empirical compromise has been studying patterns of social organization across non-human species that doesn't necessarily require definitive use of a culture definition that allows for the inclusion of non- human species. Still, this is based on regal-like and kungic-like behaviors and this does not address the needed psychological flexibility for regality theory and culture as a whole. Studies of the social structures of non-human primates, some social carnivores, and hymenoptera may show regal and kungic societal patterns. Non-human primates, as human's closest relative, are subject to the most studies to observe \\"human-unique\\" characteristics in non- human species as a whole. Chimpanzees and bonobos make the most popular example of non-human species potentially displaying regal and kungic societal patterns, though studies of their social organization were not necessarily targeting evidence of regality theory. Chimpanzees typically exist in smaller temporary co-ed groups of males and females where males have rank of high or low, which impacts mating opportunity. Aggressive behavior is observed amongst chimpanzees with some authoritative characteristics which allows for their consideration as regal society types. Bonobos are observed to have a kungic society based on kungic-like societal expression. Like chimpanzees, they exist in co-ed groups and follow a fission-fusion pattern. In these groups, females are usually associated with rank and aggressive behavior between individuals is rare for this species. Unlike chimpanzees, the infants and young of the group are more so tolerated by the group males These egalitarian patterns allow for their consideration as a kungic type. Social carnivores like wolves, lions, meerkats & dolphins have also been subject to lengthy recordings of their social organization. Wolves and lions are considered to follow regal- like societal structures. Meerkats, however, hold an odd placing. They are known to share burrowing space with other burrowing species harmoniously, though meerkat communities also have an alpha-pair that will scent-mark subordinate group members' space to assert dominance/authority. Also, there is killing of young in these communities, often by the subordinate members on the alpha pair's young. This is meant to increase fitness and opportunity of the subordinate young. Their tolerance of outgroups hinders their direct fit into the regal or kungic society theory dynamics. Dolphins are also of interest in that they are one of the few non-human species that are considered to show signs of culture. This is based on their adults teaching young to make and use tools, which is considered cultural transmission of learned behaviors. They vary in behaviors based on species and environment so deciding if they follow a kungic-like of regal-like societal pattern cannot be universally applied. However, they are all social, form strong social bonds and typically cooperative. Hymenoptera refers to insects such as bees, wasps and ants. They are considered to be the species that perfected the police state social system, and thus they are prime examples of the regal societal structure. In these groups, there is authoritarian structure- queens, workers, soldiers- and often aggressive behavior that is lethal to individuals that do not fit into the collective.  Criticism  The shortcomings of regality theory include its relative newness and that the study of the theory seems highly specialized to Agner Fog, though there are kin theories of cultural dimensions and organization. In several theories of cultural design there is some question as to this theory being potentially misused in negative explanations of some cultures/groups of people. The potential marginalization of people groups is compounded by the dichotomous design of the theory. Like the argument of personality as either states or traits, regality theory poses that cultures/societies are a collection of traits and that they create only two levels- regal/warlike or kungic/peaceful. It suggests two general worldviews when there is no evidence found to suggest that all humans only think in these two ways.

She works on ancient DNA and pioneered a means to extract DNA from bones. Her research has applications in evolutionary biology and forensic science.  Education and early career  At the age of 13, Hagelberg's father escaped from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom on the Kindertransport in 1939. Hagelberg studied biochemistry at the University of London and earned her bachelor's degree in 1977. She moved to the University of Cambridge for her doctoral studies, earning her PhD in 1983. Traditionally, DNA could only be found in soft tissues, but Hagelberg developed techniques to recover small quantities of DNA from bone. Once the DNA has been extracted, it is possible to use the polymerase chain reaction to determine the sequence of amino acids.  Research  Hagelberg works in the analysis of ancient DNA from archaeological bones. She joined the University of Oxford in 1987, where she worked at the John Radcliffe Hospital alongside Bryan Sykes and Robert E. M. Hedges. At Oxford Hagelberg collaborated with Alec Jeffreys on the applications of bone DNA in forensic science. Jeffreys once described her as being able to ‚Äúget DNA out of a stone, just about,\\". Jeffreys and Hagelberg worked on single tandem repeat typing. Her early work included the analysis of bones from the Mary Rose. Hagelberg identified pig DNA in a leg bone from the food stores in the Mary Rose. Jeffreys and Hagelberg demonstrated the DNA analysis could be used to identify the skeletal remains of a murder victim. Unfortunately, the body had been in the ground for so long that it had disintegrated. They could not use conventional DNA fingerprinting to analyse the DNA, and had to develop more sophisticated techniques. In the 1990s she was one of the first people to use bone DNA analysis for forensic identification. Hagelberg's DNA extraction technique was used to identify bones found in Brazil that were believed to belong to Josef Mengele. With Jeffreys, Hagelberg extracted DNA from a skeleton that had been buried for several years, and compared it with that of Mengele's family members. Their discovery closed a case of war crime that had stayed open for half a century. She also participated in the identification of remains of the Romanov family. This involved the analysis of nine skeletons, including those of the putative Tsarina and three of her daughters, and comparing their DNA to that of living descendants. She has also used mitochondrial DNA to study the migration of human populations. She has also extracted DNA from mammoth bones. In 1998 Hagelberg left Cambridge and joined the University of Otago in New Zealand. Here continued her research on human migrations in the Pacific Islands, by examining mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in Polynesian and Melanesian bones to resolve conflicting opinions on the migratory patterns. She also investigated the genetic origins of the people of the Andaman Islands. She found that the Andamanese are genetically more similar to Asian as opposed to African populations, predicting they are descendants of the paleolithic colonies in Southeast Asia. Hagelberg has also written on the evolution of language, and how social complexity is related to brain size. She is interested in how reliable mitochondrial DNA is in studies of human evolution and phylogenetics. In 2002 Hagelberg joined the University of Oslo. Hagelberg investigates how definitions of biological race are used by evolutionary biologists. Her work has been covered in The Guardian, The New York Times. She has contributed to several books, including the Oxford Companion to Archaeology and Life and Death in Asia Minor in Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Times: Studies in Archaeology and Bioarchaeology.

Wenzel was most notable as the person who exposed the Red Orchestra after his transmissions were discovered by the Funkabwehr, later leading to his captured by the Gestapo on 29‚Äì30 June 1942. Life Wenzel came from a working-class family and was the son of a farmer. After leaving school Wenzel worked as a locksmith apprentice in a coal mining company in the Ruhr and in a company of the Krupp Group in Essen. Wenzel was a communist in his youth and joined the Young Communist League of Germany in 1921 and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1925. Career In 1929-1930 Wenzel travelled to Moscow to take a military- political course as a Kursant under a covername, Horst that was run by the AM Apparat of Communist International. When Wenzel returned he worked as a full- time instructor for communist military issues in Hamburg, Bremen, Essen, D√ºsseldorf and Cologne using the covername Hermann, for the next several years During this period Wenzel was likely already in touch with the veteran Soviet intelligence officer Henry Robinson who would later become an assistant to Leopold Trepper and technical director of the AM Apparat for Western Europe in 1940 and director of an espionage network in France. In the summer of 1933, Wenzel travelled to the Netherlands with Theodor Bottl√§nder an official of the AM Apparat department of the Central Committee of the KPD, to obtain information on Marinus van der Lubbe who was in Berlin and who was among those accused of setting the Reichstag fire. After the fire, the German Communist Party was banned, forcing Wenzel to flee. In 1935 Wenzel was ordered to report to the 4th Division of the General Staff of the Red Army, the Intelligence directorate to be intensively trained as a Wireless telegraphy (WT) operator in preparation to be a technical advisor in Western Europe. In January 1936 he travelled to Belgium under the guise of a student of mechanics and enrolled at a technical school. There he met the Soviet intelligence officers Leopold Trepper who controlled seven espionage networks in Western Europe and Anatoly Gurevich his assistant, who controlled one those networks. His express mission was to use his new training to set up an radio network in Belgium but the Belgian authorities refused him permission to remain, so he moved to the Netherlands in early 1937 where he made contact with Daan Goulooze who was director of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and who acted as the main liaison officer between the CPN and the Communist International in Moscow. With Goulooze they discussed plans for the construction of a radio network in the Netherlands. In early 1938 Wenzel entered illegally back into Belgium and it is likely that he resided with Franz Schneider and his wife Germaine. Schneider was a Swiss communist who had connections with Henry Robinson. In 1939 he became a technical advisor on WT procedures and codes to Anatoly Gurevich and trained a number of WT operators in the Low Countries. Wenzel was also a technical advisor to Konstantin Lukitsch Jefremov who was a Soviet agent who ran a separate network in the Netherlands. From December 1940 to July 1942 Wenzel transmitted intelligence by WT to the Soviet Union. In November 1941 on orders from Anatoly Gurevich, Wenzel transmitted messages on information that Gurevich had received from Harro Schulze-Boysen, in October 1941 in Berlin. In May 1942, following Mikhail Makarov's arrest, Wenzel was invited to re-establish a WT link to Moscow by Jeffremov, after Jeffremov took over Anatoly Gurevich's network after he escaped to France. In May 1942, Wenzel commenced transmitting important traffic to the Soviet Union. In June 1942, following the capture of Hersch Sokol who was the WT operator for Leopold Trepper in Paris, Leon Grossvogel a Soviet intelligence officer who was Treppers assistant ordered Wenzel to become the WT operator for Trepper in France. Capture By using direction finding and radio intercept monitoring techniques, from the goniometric stations in Nuremberg, Augsburg and Brest that had formed a triangulation azimuth, the Funkabwehr were able to identify an illegal radio transmission that came from the home of Wenzel at his Brussels home at 12 Rue de Namur. It took some days to identify the correct location due to the layout of the building and the electric railway that ran through the neighbourhood, but on 29‚Äì30 June 1942, Captain Harry PiepeHarry Piepe working for section IIIF of the Abwehr in 1942, finally identified the correct apartment. He was interviewed in 1965 by the French journalist Gilles Perrault and an account of this is contained in the Kesaris, Paul. L, ed. (1979). The Rote Kapelle: the CIA's history of Soviet intelligence and espionage networks in Western Europe, 1936-1945. Washington DC: University Publications of America. p. 384. along with some men including policeman and Luftwaffe personnel sealed off the street in Laeken in Brussels. When the Abwher broke into the apartment in the tenement that Wenzel was located, the Abwehr surprised him and he took off over the rooftops, firing his pistol at the Germans as he tried to escape but he was eventually arrested. During the search of the apartment, it was found that Wenzel had left a series of coded messages and two messages written in the German language that were waiting to be enciphered. These messages contained the details of such startling content, the plans for Case Blue, that Piepe immediately drove to Berlin from Brussels and after revealing his find and explaining its relevance, met with Wilhelm Canaris. Canaris arranged an immediate meeting with Wilhelm Keitel who was chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Wenzel was taken to St. Gilles Prison in Brussels. Piepe informed Karl Giering the director of Gestapo in Brussels and he forwarded a message to the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) Section IV Subsection 2A, requesting any details regarding on Wenzel, and they returned a number of card indexes that were found detailing Wenzel's early communist career and his name was identified in the RSHA Black Book as a wanted man. Such was the urgency by the Germans to reveal the communist network that was associated with Wenzel that he was subject to brutal interrogation including torture that lasted six to eight weeks and he eventually confessed to everything including his cover-name, The Professor, due to him being a specialist in radio telephony and its technology. After his torture he was a broken man and he agreed to collaborate with the Germans in a playback operation using Wenzel's radio transmitter that began on 6 August 1942 and was controlled by Heinz Pannwitz of Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle at a house on Rue de l'Aurore in Brussels. Escape Over several months, the guards at Rue de l'Aurore became lulled into a false sense of security and either on the 17 or 18 November 1942, Wenzel managed to escape from the guards of the Sonderkommando, when they failed to lock an outside door. Wenzel noticed this, fled and locked the door behind him and managed to get away.

Willis (c.1887‚Äì7 July 1970) was an American suffragist, pacifist, lecturer, activist and organiser of the early 20th-century. Biography Portia Willis, born circa 1887, was the second daughter of lawyer, real-estate businessman and Democrat former senator Benjamin A. Willis and Lillie Evelyn Macauley. She was educated at the Anne Brown School and attended, though did not graduate from, Columbia University and Harvard College. Willis involved herself in the New York state suffrage movement from about 1910 through to its successful conclusion in 1917, including organising and giving lecture tours throughout the state, dropping leaflets from aeroplanes, and speaking in other states including Massachusetts in 1914, and New Jersey and Washington, D.C. in 1915. Her relatively high profile, the circumstances of her birth into a well known political family, and the nature of newspaper reporting of the day gave rise to frequent press coverage earning her the soubriquet of \\"The Prettiest Suffragette in New York State\\". Her name was entered into New York State's suffrage honor roll in 1931. Her pacifism activities lasted throughout her life as she organised and involved herself in a string of organisations dedicated to world peace. She served as the Grand Marshal for the Women's Peace Parade in 1914. She was a member of the Women's Pro-League Council, which organised in support of the League of Nations. After the 1920 inception of the League, she helped to found and manage the Greater New York branch of the League of Nations Association. Other of her memberships include the New York Board of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Round Table on the United Nations, which she chaired from 1950-53. Despite her pacifism, she was an active supporter of airmen in World War I and a member of the Red Cross; after the war she was given honorary membership of the Aerial League of America for her services. Besides these activities, she was also one of the founders, in 1919, of the Women's Roosevelt Memorial Association; an elected member of the National Institute of Social Sciences; a member of the Women's City Club of New York; a member and sometime vice-president of the Woman's Suffrage Study Club; in much later life she was a member and from 1953 president of the Little Gardens Club of New York City; and a member and sometime vice-president of the Women's Farm and Garden Association. Her lecturing activities continued throughout her life, in addition to which she served in 1924 as an Assistant in the Oral English Department at Harvard, and from 1948-50 as a lecturer at the Barmore School in New York City. She married two or three times: first to Captain L. Rodney Berg in 1925 until his death in 1941, taking the name Portia Willis-Berg. She is recorded thereafter as marrying a prince of Thurn und Taxis.This claim may be in error, a possible confusion with Lida Eleanor Nicolls, who became Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis upon her second marriage, having previously been married to one Gerald Purcell Fitzgerald, a person who shared the same name as Willis's husband from 1958. In 1958, she was married to Gerald Purcell-FitzGerald, a musician and linguist. She died on 7 July 1970.

It is situated in North Cascades National Park, north of the North Klawatti Glacier and southeast of the Borealis Glacier. Its nearest higher peak is Primus Peak, to the west. Precipitation runoff from Tricouni drains into Thunder Creek. The peak is named for the tricouni which was used for traction on ice, and the approach to the peak involves traversing a glacier. Climate Tricouni Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Sanbonmatsu is an American structural biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. She works on the mechanism of non-coding RNA complexes including the ribosome, riboswitches, long non-coding RNAs, as well as chromatin. She was the first to perform an atomistic simulation of the ribosome, determine the secondary structure of an intact lncRNA and to publish a one billion atom simulation of a biomolecular complex.  Education and early career  Sanbonmatsu was born in Rochester, New York, the daughter of Joan Loveridge-Sanbonmatsu, and Akira Loveridge-Sanbonmatsu, who are both professors of speech communication in the State University of New York. She attended Oswego High School, and was valedictorian. She won the Pembroke College Stokes Society Scientific Lecture Competition at the University of Cambridge. Sanbonmatsu studied physics at Columbia University, where she used the Very Large Array radio telescope to estimate the distance to supernova remnant G27.4+0.0 and its central X-ray source, which is now known to be a magnetar. Karissa's early research was in plasma physics. She earned her PhD in astrophysical sciences at University of Colorado Boulder under Martin V. Goldman (a student of Donald F. Dubois). Her dissertation entailed analytical treatments of non-linear wave-wave interactions in plasmas, elucidating the competition between Langmuir wave-wave and wave-particle effects in the auroral ionosphere. In 1997, after earning her doctorate, Sanbonmatsu joined Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoctoral scholar under Donald F. Dubois (a student of Murray Gell-Mann), determining the effect of kinetic processes on Langmuir waves in plasmas. She became interested in what distinguishes life from matter. In 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory built Q-machine, one of the world's fastest supercomputer. The Q-machine allowed Sanbonmatsu to run the world's largest simulation in biology, publishing the first simulation of the ribosome in 2005, where she identified the ‚Äúaccommodation corridor‚Äù of the ribosome.  Research  In 2006, Sanbonmatsu was the first transgender person at Los Alamos National Laboratory to be awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. At the time, epigenetics was beginning to develop, and Sanbonmatsu realised that RNA could be involved in how genes are turned on and off. The Sanbonmatsu Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory was established in 2001. They use a variety of wet lab and computational techniques to study ribosomes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), riboswitches and chromatin. Sanbonmatsu has been a leading figure in structural studies of long non-coding RNAs in epigenetics. She studied COOLAIR, a stretch of RNA that controls the timing and flowering of plants. It works by controlling the internal triggers that tell a plant to stop flowering, which work in combination with a repressor protein called Flowering Locus C. When Sanbonmatsu studied the RNA structure, she found features that are similar to ribosomes. In 2012 her group was the first to describe the secondary structure in a lncRNA; the steroid hormone receptor activator (SRA). She went on to look at how the structure of RNA impacted the fate of a cell. She uses illumina dye sequencing for high throughput SHAPE probing. The first billion atom simulation of an entire gene (GATA4). She develops computer simulations to understand tRNA translocation, combining single molecule fluorescence with cryogenic electron microscopy. Ribosomes undergo a dramatic change in structure when transfer RNA are passing through, and this was simulated computationally by Sanbonmatsu. Sanbonmatsu has also written about gynandromorphism, and how DNA influences hormones, but hormone can reprogram DNA. She was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012. Most recently, her group set the record for the world‚Äôs largest published biomolecular simulation at one billion atoms, the first simulation of an entire gene. = Public engagement = She described her work with epigenetics and came out as transgender in a 2014 TEDxTalk. Sanbonmatsu delivered a TED talk at TEDWomen on The biology of gender, from DNA to the brain, in November 2018. In the talk she covered epigenetics, how DNA can change due to trauma and diet, and how her gender transition led her to study the role of epigenetics in gender identity. Sanbonmatsu serves on the board of Equality New Mexico.

The film premiered at the LA Film Festival in September 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019. Plot Brian Banks (Aldis Hodge) is a 27-year-old former high school football star living with his mother (Sherri Shepherd) in Long Beach, California. He is currently on parole and registered as a sex offender due to an incident 11 years prior where he and a classmate, Kennisha (Xosha Roquemore), sneaked off to kiss. When he overheard teachers approaching, he fled to avoid getting caught, leading the scorned Kennisha to falsely accuse him of raping her. On the advice of his attorney, Banks pled no contest to rape and was sentenced to six years of prison. His childhood dreams of becoming an NFL player are further damaged when new laws require him to wear an ankle monitor at all times and stay 2000 feet away from schools and public gathering spots, preventing him from playing football, and he has trouble finding legitimate employment due to his criminal record. Banks approaches the California Innocence Project hoping to clear his name, and they advise him to write a plea of habeas corpus to the California legal system to get them to retry him. When this fails, Innocence Project founder Justin Brooks (Greg Kinnear) explains that the justice system requires new evidence that incontrovertibly points to his innocence before they will hear his pleas; this excludes DNA evidence, which was taken during the original trial but never used in his defense. Innocence Project lawyers interview several of Banks' former classmates, but their word is not strong enough to cast doubt on Banks' conviction. Banks unexpectedly receives a Facebook friend request from Kennisha, leading him to devise a scheme with several of his friends to trick her into confessing on tape that the rape allegation was fraudulent. This seemingly succeeds, and Banks takes the tape to the Innocence Project. However, since Kennisha did not know she was being recorded, the evidence is inadmissible in court. Brooks sends the tape to the media, causing public outcry at the injustice of Banks' situation. Banks' parole officer calls him and warns him that his contact with Kennisha is a parole violation, but gives him until his parole expires before reporting the violation and placing Banks back in prison. Brooks approaches District Attorney Mateo (Jose Miguel Vazquez) and convinces him that Banks needs a new trial. Banks goes to court, but Kennisha refuses to testify and claims that Banks offered her $20,000 to say he didn't rape her on tape. Mateo and Brooks confront her and eventually get her to say on the record that her claim that Banks bribed her was a lie; this casts enough doubt on Banks' guilt to convince the judge to finally overturn Banks' conviction. Banks cuts off the ankle bracelet and heads to a local park, where he enjoys a game of football with some local children. The final narration reveals that Pete Carroll, a former University of Southern California coach who offered him a scholarship to USC during his high school days, invited him to try out for the Seattle Seahawks; failing to make the team due to his skills atrophying as a result of his extended time in prison, Banks trained hard over the next year and eventually was signed by the Atlanta Falcons.

Her work explores the evolution of human body movement and the intersection between choreography and visual art. Early life and education Madeline Hollander was born in 1986 in Los Angeles, California. She trained with Yvonne Mounsey while growing up in Los Angeles and she danced professionally with the Los Angeles Ballet and with Angel Corella‚Äôs Barcelona Ballet. She received a Bachelor's Associates degree from Barnard College of Columbia University in 2008 and attended the MFA program at Bard College's Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts from 2016 to 2019. Artistic practice Madeline Hollander is an intense observer of everyday gestures. Hollander's work investigates the body's ability to communicate and respond to the limits within everyday systems. Since 2013, Hollander has been adding to Gesture Archive, a long-term research project that surveys expressive human movement in all its variety. She uses performance and dance to communicate how a space in contemporary art can be experienced rather than space being a reaction to the art object. These dances and performances are unlike the ballets Hollander danced growing up. The movements often reflect her observations of gesture and emulate the everyday. Benjamin Millepied, the artistic director of L.A. Dance Project and a former New York City Ballet principal, said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a clear understanding of classical craft when it comes to the architecture of her dances.\\" Hollander‚Äôs fascination with systems goes beyond repeating existing systems. She is also constructing systems of her own. They often involve placing the body in conversation with various contexts, such as molecular or mechanical arrangements. Along with creating choreography, Hollander has developed a more intuitive and organic system of color codes and pictographs to recall her movements. ‚ÄúThe drawings are only meant to be understood by me and the dancers. It‚Äôs a system for recall. To remind the bodies who already lived through the movements.‚Äù As well as creating a rich amount of her own work, Hollander also collaborates as a choreographer with other artists. She made her first step into Hollywood, hired as a movement consultant and choreographer to Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúUs.‚Äù She helped to develop physical vocabularies for the characters‚Äô dueling selves. She was also apart of Helsinki Contemporary's \\"Future Delay\\", a show curated by New York based curator Amanda Schmitt, where she, Pearla Pigao, and Hans Rosenstr√∂m were commissioned to explore the future potential of technological immortality. Regardless of who Hollander is collaborating with she consistently creates new ways of drawing her choreography's vocabulary from many sources, from the interaction of interface design (Illegal Motion, 2015); sports referee gestures (Mile, 2016); and building evacuation procedures (Drill, 2016). =Heads/Tails= Hollander's work \\"Heads/Tails\\" is her first major exhibition without human actors. The installation consists of hundreds of used automobile headlights and taillights, covering opposite walls of the gallery, synched with the traffic signal at the nearby intersection of Walker Street and Broadway. Breaking cars driving on Walker Street trigger the installation‚Äôs taillights resulting in their illumination. These results are modeled after the behaviors of various types of New York City drivers and the installations car lights turn off again when the street light changes to green. At sunset the headlights in the installation change to the \\"brights\\" setting and at sunrise they will revert to a ‚Äúfog light‚Äù setting in a nonstop, 24/7 cycle. Alongside the installation of car lights, Hollander shows a series of watercolors that mirror the pictographs she uses to help her and her dancers recall their movements. However these watercolors, while seemingly abstract have the capacity to signify the featured movement sequences, detailed drawings of hand gestures, and multicolored circles that function as graphemes. These works remind viewers of the correlation between the city and the body constantly circulating with a heartbeat. A text by A.E. Benenson accompanies the exhibition. The text addresses the history of New York City traffic and its regulation of movement vis-a-vis concepts of progress, performance and order. It is presented alongside a small bronze statue of Mercury, one of the 104 that adorned the tops of traffic lights along Fifth Avenue from 1931-1964, and have since largely gone missing. =New Max= As in all of Hollander‚Äôs other work to date, the dancers‚Äô choreography references or ‚Äúcites‚Äù everyday physical activities. The project notes for \\"New Max\\" describe the installation's \\"Performance begins at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and dancers continuously hit a new maximum temperature each round.\\" The starting temperature in the room is 65 degrees Fahrenheit as this is the museum standard for storing works of art. The choreography is a series of scripted movements that create body heat, raising the room‚Äôs temperature to 85 degrees. This change in room temperature takes place over a series of sixteen rounds. Each round with a new min and max temp and the goal of Round 1 is to get to 70 degrees, triggering the A/C units to turn on and cool the room. This begins round to at a starting temperature of 66 degrees. As this pattern continues, two Dancers track their progress by the room‚Äôs lights. They are attached to a temperature sensor and become brighter as the room heats up. When the temperature hits the maximum, the lights turn out, the A/C units on, and the dancers rest. As soon as the minimum is reached again, the dancers are back in motion. =Performances and choreography= *Gesture Archive: BASE (2013) - Human Resources - Los Angeles, CA *2014 - Futurevisions, Torrance Shipman Gallery, New York *DRAFT (2014) - Jack Hanley Gallery - New York City *Heimlich at SkowheganPERFORMS (2016) - Socrates Sculpture Park, New York *In Practice: Under Foundations (2015) - SculptureCenter - New York City *Arena (2017) - Rockaway Beach - New York City *New Max (2018) - Artist‚Äôs Institute - New York City *Urs Fischer‚Äôs PLAY (2018) - Gagosian - New York City *Work Marathon festival (2018) - Serpentine Galleries - London *Us (2019 film) - choreographer *Whitney Biennial (2019) - curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta Grants, residencies and awards *2015 - Fountainhead Studios Artist Residency, Miami, FL *2015 - Choreographic Coding Lab: Motion-Bank, Center for the Art of Performance, UCLA *2015 - Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture *2016 - Socrates Sculpture Park Emerging Artist Fellowship References 1986 births Living people 21st- century American artists Barnard College alumni American contemporary artists ","title":"Madeline Hollander"},{"id":"60472954","title":"List of presidents of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York"},{"id":"60472965","text":"The VI Conference of Heads of State and Government of the CPLP (), commonly known as the 6th CPLP Summit (V Cimeira da CPLP) was the 6th biennial meeting of heads of state and heads of government of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, held in Bras√≠lia, Brazil, on 17 July 2006.VI Confer√™ncia de Chefes de Estado e de Governo da CPLP Outcome The 1st Youth Forum of the CPLP was created and held during the VI CPLP Summit.

The song features vocals from American singer Ty Dolla Sign and Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper Nicki Minaj. It was originally slated to be included on West's album Yandhi which was never released. The song's original lyrics are about body shaming and the stigma surrounding plastic surgery. A reworked version of the song featuring Christian-themed lyrics was later previewed at listening parties for West's ninth studio album Jesus Is King (2019). In June 2020, Minaj stated that she would contact West about potentially releasing the song after its leaked version became viral on TikTok. The song was ultimately scrapped from Jesus Is King just before its October 2019 release due to creative differences between West and Minaj. Since being leaked online in July 2019, the song received positive reviews and was noted for being a highlight among other leaked Yandhi tracks. Critics praised West's reworked Christian lyrics for being more positive and respectful. Background and recording Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper Nicki Minaj was previously prominently featured on West's fifth studio album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and provided a voice memo for his eighth studio album Ye (2018). American singer Ty Dolla Sign was also featured on Ye, along with The Life of Pablo (2016) and Kids See Ghosts (2018), West's collaborative album with American rapper Kid Cudi. The song \\"Violent Crimes\\" from Ye features vocals from Ty Dolla Sign, along with American singer 070 Shake, and the voice memo from Minaj. On September 9, 2018, West was spotted recording music with American rapper 6ix9ine. The two later flew to Colombia to record music together. On September 17, 2018, West announced his ninth studio album Yandhi, just three months after the release of his previous solo album Ye, revealing the cover art and initial release date of September 29, 2018. On September 27, West visited The Fader headquarters to preview new music from Yandhi. Songs previewed included vocals from Ty Dolla Sign and 6ix9ine. West took out a pocket dictionary and read the definition of the word \\"artificial\\", explaining his view that \\"a woman‚Äôs pussy count goes back to zero\\" after having any plastic surgery procedures done. The Fader reported that this explanation was related to the song that featured 6ix9ine. West would later feature on two tracks from 6ix9ine's debut studio album Dummy Boy (2018): \\"Kanga\\" and \\"Mama\\", with the latter also featuring Minaj. West's wife Kim Kardashian (pictured) coordinated Nicki Minaj's guest appearance on the song. While West was in New York City finishing up Yandhi for the season 44 premiere of Saturday Night Live, West's wife Kim Kardashian coordinated to get Minaj featured on \\"New Body\\". Before recording her verse, Minaj explained that she was \\"going to say some real ass shit that bitches need to hear, too, and that they want to say and be feeling like they can‚Äôt say.\\" Minaj wrote her verse within an hour after Kardashian reached out to her. West failed to release Yandhi in September 2018. On October 1, 2019, West visited the TMZ office in Los Angeles to record a music video for \\"We Got Love\\" with American singer Teyana Taylor. In an interview with TMZ's Raquel Harper, West confirmed that he had an upcoming song about body shaming that featured Ty Dolla Sign and Minaj. On March 8, 2019, GOOD Music audio engineer Kevin Celik confirmed that the Yandhi track featuring Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign was titled \\"New Body\\". Celik stated that the \\"record for sure is Kim K-inspired\\", referring to Kardashian. During listening parties for Jesus Is King in September 2019, West previewed a reworked version of \\"New Body\\". In October 2019, Minaj stated that she was rerecording her verse to fit the religious theme of Jesus Is King, but that she and West were having disagreements. Minaj explained that West wanted to rework the track as a gospel song, adding \\"I done wrote three different verses chile, and I don‚Äôt know. We ain‚Äôt seeing eye to eye on it. I don‚Äôt know, but of course, I love and respect Kanye, and Kim, we‚Äôll see what happens with that\\". \\"New Body\\" was previewed at a Jesus Is King listening party at The Forum in Los Angeles two days before the album's release date, but was removed from the final track listing for the album revealed the next day. The track was ultimately scrapped from the album due to the creative differences between Minaj and West. In June 2020, Nicki Minaj stated that she would contact West about potentially releasing the song after it became viral on TikTok. Later that month, she urged fans to spam Kardashian for the song's release. On July 18, 2020, West included \\"New Body\\" on the track list for his tenth studio album Donda: With Child. Themes and lyrics The original leaked version of \\"New Body\\" addressed the issues of slut-shaming and body shaming. Charles Holmes of Rolling Stone called the song West's \\"ode to the wonders of plastic surgery and the myths of body count\\". West explained the concept of \\"New Body\\" in an October 2018 interview, stating: Holmes described the reworked version of the song previewed in September 2019 as Christian-appropriate and that the \\"body is [now] simultaneously more metaphorical and metaphysical\\". Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times wrote that the song had been \\"altered for content, turning its more secular, sexual lyrics to something more chaste and respectful.\\" Danilo Castro of Heavy.com noted that the reworked song had no curse words and \\"a more positive overall message.\\" Promotion and leak \\"New Body\\" was last previewed at a Jesus Is King listening party in Los Angeles two days before the album's release. West announced that he had a song with Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign about body shaming in an October 2018 interview with TMZ. The recording of Minaj's verse was prominently showcased in an April 2019 episode of American television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Following the airing of the episode, Kardashian discussed the writing of the song on Twitter. \\"New Body\\" was leaked online in July 2019 alongside another Yandhi track titled \\"The Storm\\", featuring Ty Dolla Sign and posthumous vocals from American rapper XXXTentacion. \\"The Storm\\" was scrapped and reworked for Jesus Is King as \\"Everything We Need\\". Paul Thompson, writing for The Fader, noted that the leaks did not receive mainstream attention and were a \\"minor story\\" compared to West songs that had leaked previously. A music video for \\"New Body\\" was recorded but never released. \\"New Body\\" was previewed by West at multiple listening parties for Jesus Is King throughout September and October 2019. \\"New Body\\" was notably absent from the listening party in Chicago, but was later re-added to the track list at further parties. \\"New Body\\" was last previewed at the listening party at The Forum in Los Angeles two days before the album's release date, but was removed from the final track listing for the album revealed the next day.

Critical reception Paul Thompson, writing for The Fader, compared \\"New Body\\" to other Yandhi leaks as being \\"in various states of progress\\". Thompson praised the production and polishing on Ty Dolla Sign's hook and Minaj's verse, but described West's verse as still being in demo form as he \\"lapse[s] from finished lines into mumbles reference phrases\\". Thompson praised \\"New Body\\" and the other Yandhi leaks for having \\"more shape and direction that nearly anything on [Ye]\\" despite the unfinished lyrics. In writing for Rolling Stone, Thompson called it \\"the one song from the Yandhi leaks that sounded like it might be a hit.\\" Sam Murphy, writing for Cool Accidents, described the song as becoming \\"a superfan favourite\\" ever since it leaked.

Gaetano Magnolfi, Operaio e Benefattore, speech by Isidor del Lungo, given 2 October 1898 at a local Art Exhibition, published by Tipografia Giachetti and sons, Prato (1898); page 9. He had become a wealthy businessman through contracts to provide the Grand Duchy with carpenters and woodworkers. By 1833, he had been elected as a municipal magistrate, and he had funded a school for young poor children, making them literate, and teaching them the trade of sewing. In 1838 he purchased the suppressed Convent of the Carmelites and transformed it into a hospice and a technical (trade) school or institute called the ‚Äò‚ÄôOrfanotrofio Tecnologico della Piet√†, which was focused on helping orphan and abandoned children. The school granted laboratory space to local artisans if they took on orphans as paid apprentices. Magnolfi was awarded a medal for his efforts supporting the orphans. In the third Congress of Scientists, (1841) held in Florence, the innovation of this technological orphanage were praised by Enrico Mayer, a pedagogist and fellow philanthropist from Livorno, as a model for such institutions.Lungo, page 16. Magnolfi also helped found a Cassa di Risparmio in Prato, a bank which allocated loans to small businesses and craftsmen. Magnolfi helped fund the railway line (1848) connecting Florence, Prato, and Pistoia. In 1898, a speech commemorating Magnolfi, was published to and its sale used to fund the bronze monument placed in 1900 at the Piazza Santa Maria della Piet√†, Prato, close to the orphanage. The speech compares Magnolfi to the local 15th-century philanthropist Francesco Datini. The statue, sculpted by Oreste Chilleri, unfortunately inaccurately depicts him dressed as a laboring carpenter, despite his main role being the financial management of wood working in the state. It also includes a child at his feet, recalling his focus on the orphanage. The statue was transferred to Piazza del Duomo for about twenty years, only to be finally relocated to its inaugural site. Magnolfi was buried at a chapel built in his orphanage, designed by Fortunato Rocchi, instructor of design at the institute, and frescoed by Eustachio Turchini, containing a bas-relief donated by the Ginori porcelain company, and a sculpted monument by Vincenzio Chilleri with a bust by Egisto Giampaoli, a pupil of Dupre.Inagurazione, 1867.

In the first world, some socialist individuals believe in the legalisation and right to abortion on demand as a public service, whereas others do not believe abortion should be legal in any circumstances for a number of reasons. In Third World, there are discussions regarding traditionalists, Natalists, Malthusianists and economics factors within society. Socialism impacted a number of countries in the 20th century and had long standing influence on the law of the countries in which it took hold. Socialist parties can have diverging perspectives regarding the importance of the issue and where the issue derives from. In particular, feminist socialists believe the oppression of women in society has resulted in restrictions surrounding abortion and a Marxist group may deem abortion as a secondary issue, instead focusing more on what they deem primary issues. Some regions criminalised abortion due to issues concerning the rates of replacement of the population. Socialists at a pro-abortion rights protest in Chicago, Illinois  Socialist abortion rights in Europe  Regardless of the diverging views and policies on abortion throughout history in Europe, socialist countries and nonsocialist countries approached abortion access in a different manner. During the 1970s there was a stronger socialist presence in Eastern Europe, and therefore more progressive fertility policy. Historically, in Western Europe, many ideologies have coexisted, and this has created strife for suggested fertility policies due to the lack of universal approval. The Eastern Bloc under the Soviet Union had widespread fertility and reproduction policies at the time, and restricted debate on the matter. The debate involved many individuals from the health industry, such as physicians and psychologists, as well as legal workers and economists. The socialist government and their policies on the matter were built with a strong influence from a strong body of knowledge on these areas. = Perspectives on the legalisation of abortion in the USSR = Some people believe the socialist body used abortion regulations to create a more idealistic population, with the intention of strengthening and empowering the state. Abortion on demand was legalised in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1955, with other Eastern European countries also legalising abortion in the years following, such as Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary. Abortion was legalised in 1920 until this action was reversed in 1936 and was once again prohibited until 1955. Prior to 1955, whilst it was illegal, abortions had still occurred and therefore posed a large threat to a woman's health after being treated by unskilled individuals in unfavourable conditions. The major push for legal abortion in the USSR was majorly driven by medical experts who explained the issue to the public. When observing the documentation during this period of abortion legislation comparative to the documents provided by gynaecologists and psychologists, the same language is present within both, with heavy emphasis on focusing on the collective. It is uncertain whether professionals felt pressured to make recommendations that complied with the USSR ideology, or if legal abortion on demand stemmed from the scientific recommendation. After legalisation, women had to request an abortion and pay a fee to an abortion committee. There was an increasing rate of abortions and a decreasing birth rate, so the government released propaganda and punished any doctor or physician who performed illegal abortions in order to ensure proper procedures were followed. In 1979, women who requested abortion on demand were not given pay during their time off work, and the procedure wasn't paid for by the government. However, if the abortion was for health reasons, the fee was covered by the government and they still received paid leave. Additionally, all abortions required women to have one counselling session by a midwife. At this time, 273 abortions occurred per 100 births.  Abortion between 1920 and 1936  Regulations allowed women to leave work for three weeks following an abortion and receive pay during this absence from work. A woman was allowed an abortion if it was within the first 2 and a half months of pregnancy. Additionally, it couldn't be her first born child. A doctor could not refuse an abortion in any other circumstance, however, they could dissuade the patient from undergoing the operation. Although the socialist perspective on abortion allowed access to abortion during this period, there were still doctors opposed to terminating pregnancies. In some instances women were reportedly told that vacant hospital beds were full and could come back in 2 to 3 months, forcing them to seek illegal abortion. Doctors were more likely to give abortions to women who met criteria. A woman who was poor and had upwards of 3 children was generally granted an abortion request, and dispatched to the state hospital for the operation. However, a healthy woman with a higher socioeconomic status and 1-2 children was often persuaded to keep the unborn child. In some cases doctors would request that a woman observed an abortion operated on another female before undergoing one, in order to ensure this was the right decision for her.  Potential ulterior motive for abortion access in 1957  A potential ulterior motive for abortion under the socialist state in 1957 was due to their pro-population stance following the war. They had the perspective that a woman's body was a resource that needed to be maintained at a high quality for reproduction. In order to ensure quality population growth and reproduction, they wanted to reduce the number of illegal abortions. Illegal abortions had the high possibility of harming a woman's reproductive organs and therefore posed a threat for future pregnancy and repopulation. They also advised minority women to have abortions, as they wanted women to have a minimum of 2 children in a heterosexual white family.  Regulation changes in 1986  In this bill, the commissions were eliminated from the abortion process and women had free access to abortions. This was after the discovery that abortions earlier in the pregnancy posed a lesser threat to a woman's health comparative to later months.  Statistics on abortion in USSR  Per 100 childbirths, 400 abortion procedures occurred. This would assume that the average woman under Soviet control in 1967 would have, on average, 9 abortions in her lifetime. The USSR was estimated to have spent $525M on abortion procedures this year. This was 17% of the world spend on fertility control during this period.  Abortion in post-Soviet states  In Armenia, abortion remains legalised upon request up to 12 weeks, after a 3-day reflection period. Additionally, it is illegal to perform sex-selective abortions. = Czechoslovakia's abortion policy = Abortion in state-socialist Czechoslovakia was legalised early comparative to Western Europe. Abortion was legalised in 1957 under the Czechoslovak Act on Artificial Termination of Pregnancy. This policy allowed particular commissions, established by the government, the jurisdiction to give a woman access to abortion on demand. These commissions regulated the number of abortions, and were able to analyse the women requesting an abortions. Some people believe commissions used this restricted access to information with the purpose of acquiring more power, and approved access to abortion to strengthen the state, rather than ensuring women's health. The commission had the power to grant or deny a woman permission to receive an abortion.  Post state socialism collapse  The state socialist government collapsed in 1989. The increased access to the pill resulted in a reduction in the number of abortions, following a peak in abortion on demand from 1987-1992. This period in time had increased access to information on sex and contraception methods. Perspectives towards family orientation diverged from the norm during the state socialist reign. = Abortion in Hungary = Following world war two, abortion was determined by medical judgement and professionalism. This changed in 1949 when communism was in the process of consolidating their power, which criminalised abortion. It was illegal even in circumstances where women provided medical reasons. Some people believe this decision was driven by the post war shortage of labour for the workforce. Instead of increasing the birthrate in the long term, the illegal birth rate increased. When abortion became legal in 1956 in Hungary the population struggled to replace itself, which meant that a lot of incentives were created to encourage procreation. After legalisation, there were still measure in place that could potentially limit a woman's ability to access abortion, such as the requirement to see a counsellor, the price of abortion doubled and doctors were allowed to decide whether they actually performed the procedure. = Socialist involvement in the National Abortion Campaign in the UK = Five National Abortion Campaign badges, United Kingdom, 1970 The National Abortion Campaign was developed in the UK following the failure of James White's Amendment Bill in 1975 to amend the 1967 Abortion Act During this time the 1967 Abortion Act was under scrutiny as it required two doctors to examine a woman's medical, psychological and social situation. The Act required a woman to admit she was unfit to become a mother in order to receive approval for an abortion. During this time, doctors were still able to refuse abortions due to their personal preference against the surgery, which was considered by some to not fulfill woman's needs. The National Abortion Campaign, led by feminists, increased the ability for women to come together, lobbying for legal abortion and a woman's right to choose. Many socialist individuals partook in this woman's movement, and campaigned due to its alliance with socialist beliefs, regarding the emancipation of women. During this time, the women's liberation movement was growing, who fought not only for legal abortion, but the economic, psychological and social freedom of women. = Women's liberation movement = A socialist feminist in the 1970s typically had the choice to follow a Marxism perspective of society, or separate themselves and join the women's movement. The issue for a woman aligning herself with a Marxist group during this period, was the presence of male-domination within the group. They deemed woman's issues inferior to other political concerns and tended to divide labour by gender. Often abortion was justified by population control, however socialist feminists believe the access to abortion is a necessity. Feminist socialists focused on overall equality of the sexes, focusing on abortion becoming free to all women free of charge or reason. There were different groups of feminists including separatist feminist, liberal feminist and socialist feminist. During the Women's Liberation Movement, the woman believed all voices shall be heard and were anti-hierarchical, therefore not having a need for one specific leader. There was a large focus on ensuring women gained confidence about their sexuality and psychology, with abortion standing in the way of ownership of their body. Two reasons they believed that women in 1970 were oppressed was due to the economic dependence on men, as well as the sexual objectification of women. = Labour Zionism = In Israel, The left-wing party Meretz argues in favor of legalized abortion for reasons of personal liberty. In 2006, MK Zehava Gal-On of Meretz proposed a bill that would eliminate the termination committees, effectively decriminalizing unrestricted abortion. Gal-On argued that women with financial means can have abortions in private clinics, bypassing the committee and therefore gaining rights based on their wealth. The bill was rejected by a wide margin.  Perspectives and laws on abortion in the People's Republic of China  The (non-Marxist) Empire of China prohibited abortion in 1910, and the law remained in place until 1953 when it was revised by the government of the People's Republic of China. The specific motivation for this change is not clear, with many potential factors influencing the change in law, including the protection of women's health. Some people believe the largest concern within China was population control, rather than focusing on the sole issue of the emancipation of women. It is known that China first publicly promoted contraception was in 1954. One difference from various fertility laws at the time was China's requirement to receive a joint application for an abortion from the parents of the child along with the doctors approval. Additionally, an organisation that couple belonged to would have to partake in this application. The laws had a heightened emphasis on ensuring the health of mothers, which meant that abortions weren't approved simply by the will of a mother. There were regional disparities, for example, one particular region required both parents to agree upon the abortion. By the 1970s, women were able to procure abortions if they were deemed \\"unfit to give birth\\" or if contraception had been used and was ineffective. Policies in Shanghai specifically were largely focused on fertility planning as a type of fertility control. = Current law = Currently, abortion in China is legal as a public service.  Within Third-World socialist movements  = Bolivia = During the government of Evo Morales, despite opposition by the church, the abortion by social and economic reasons was allowed. = Brazil = The abortion in Brazilian politics had never been subject of debate before the 2000's. The opinions about the issue by top names of socialism, like Miguel Arraes or Leonel Brizola are subject of doubt. While chief of executive of Rio de Janeiro state, Brizola approved a law supporting aid for women who wish to perform limited abortions, but accepted a asking by a bishop, and ask for the Assembly to revoke the law a few weeks later. Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva, before the 2010's decade, was against abortion. Helo√≠sa Helena and Eduardo Campos, were also against abortion. Nowadays, abortion on request is supported by the vast majority of socialists, like Guilherme Boulos, Ciro Gomes, Manuela d'√Åvila, Dilma Rousseff, Fernando Haddad and Lula. = India = Despite Mahatma Gandhi position against abortion, the law in India is often discussed not as an individual right of a female citizen, but as a collective Malthusianist action regarding birth control. = Indonesia = Socialist leader Sukarno, never supported the abortion on request, preferring to think about a strong population for his country. Only after his deposition, his successor, Suharto, established a birth control and family planning. = Sandinism = In Nicaragua, the Sandinist government often declares the children as subject of mothers' responsibility, and supports aiding from state to help these mothers. The Sandinist government, with support of Catholic Church, passed laws banning almost all forms of abortion, but uses the state to helping and praising women that bears the duty to becoming mothers. These laws and state positions sound controversial among media, because even underage mothers are seem as an example of parental praise. = Tanzania = Despite the opposition to abortion by socialist leader, Julius Nyerere, the country always had a notable doctrine of family planning. The government supported the Family Planning Association of Tanzania, although considers abortion do not considers a alternative, but a termination of pregnancy. = Tunisia = During the socialist Habib Bourguiba's government, the country become the first Arab Muslim majority country to legalize abortion on request. = Uruguay = During the government of socialist president Jos√© Mujica, the country become the second latino-american country to allows abortion on request.  Within religious movements  Christian socialists and followers of liberation theology often describes themselves as pro-life Catholics. Paulo Freire and √ìscar Romero were examples of socialist pro-life Catholics  References  Socialism History of abortion Abortion ","title":"Socialist perspectives on abortion"},{"id":"60473321","text":"Giorgos Sabanis (Greek: ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ Œ£Œ±ŒºœÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ, born 15 May 1983) is a Greek singer- songwriter and athlete.

The church was designed by Gherardo Mechini who erected a typical Tuscan order portico. The interior has a delineated architecture recalling Brunelleschi churches. In 1699, the land adjacent was granted to the Discalced Carmelite nuns (Teresians), who built a convent. In 1786, the convent was suppressed, and the church became the Priory of Santa Caterina de‚ÄôRicci, but the Carmelites returned in 1792, and stayed until 1818, when they were moved to the Monastery of San Francesco. The Monastery was given to Gaetano Magnolfi to establish an orphanage and school.Archives of Prato. The former convent and orphanage is now a nursing home and cultural center. The main altar was designed by mechini, but completed in polychrome marble by Giovanni Battista Cennini and Pier Maria Ciottoli.

The main minerals are petroleum, coal, iron, manganese, tin, tungsten, antimony, copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, gold, silver, mica and precious stone. In most of the deposits, oil and natural gas resources rank first in all continents and can be divided into three oil storage zones. The first oil storage zone extends east to northwest China, south from Mesopotamia Plain, Persian Gulf and the Iranian Plateau. From the east to Myanmar, and south to Sumatra. The most famous is the Persian Gulf oil and gas fields located in Saudi Arabia, the oil reserves account for 60% of the total reserves in the world, which Saudi Arabia accounts for 1/4 of the world's total reserves. The second oil storage zone rises from Sakhalin Island to the north and passes through Hokkaido and the east of Taiwan Island. The third oil storage zone is located in Western Siberia. Hence, many countries regard mining as their main source of income, especially in Saudi Arabia, China and Iran. Mining is a complex industry. Mining minerals not only require enormous energy and financial resource, but also copes with a variety of core problems. For example, how to standardize the operation of mining industry, how to ensure the safety of miners, how to avoid the occurrence of mining accidents and so on. Therefore, countries are actively committed to reducing the negative impact of mining. TOC Work safety Safety has long been a concern in the mining industry, especially in underground mining. There are many occupational hazards associated with mining, such as mining equipment produces considerable noise and puts miners at risk of hearing loss. Although all miners have right to require a safe and healthy workplace, this right is not a reality for most of the workers. Mining industry has made a great contribution to the growth of gross domestic product (GDP), the life and health of miners are not fully respected by the whole industry. In order to effectively address the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) problems for the miners in Asia, 11 countries discussed this issue in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. One of the solutions is that set up a union check inspector in all countries. They could promote institutions to improve working conditions for miners. The lack of regulation of Small-Scale Mining (SSM) results in OSH problems and child labor. The government offers a policy called ‚ÄòFitness for Work‚Äô which require companies be responsible for the health of miners. ‚ÄòMine Safety and Health Convention‚Äô (NO.176) was proposed as a core of the occupational safety and health work in 1995. However, few states have ratified Convention No. 176. Philippines is the only Asian member State ratifies the Convention. Therefore, the Council decided to hold a two-day seminar in the Asian area to outline good practices for safe mining. Illegal labor The main feature of Small- Scale Mining (SSM) is a family business, which means a group of families gather resources together and attempt to find precious metals from known deposits or excavated mines abandoned by large mining companies. According to data statistics, 4 million workers are found to be in Asia who engaged in SSM activities out of 6 million, mostly in China, Philippines and India. The issues brought about by SSM are similar globally and locally. SSM provides a number of career opportunities for women and children who lack of educated and unskilled, most of them live in rural areas and undergo poverty. Actually, they were all forced to join the SSM, driven by poverty and lack of food. left The recent ILO‚Äôs global report confirms that there are estimated 127.3 million economically active children age from 5 to 14 in Asia. According to a survey by the National Bureau of Statistics in 1995, the mining department employed about 15626 children in mining. More than 31% of children drop out of high school, and others do poorly at school. Poverty is the common reason for why child labour exists. The purpose of child labor is to assist parents to subsidize their families. Their annual income accounts for 30 percent of total household income, approximately PhP36,614. The majority of child labour are male, but girls are also involved. Girls are more vulnerable than boys to other forms of exploitation, such as child prostitution. Children are deprived of their childhood and education by child labour and exposed to occupational hazards related to working conditions in SSM. Children work in the mine under an incredible conditions. The soil, water and the air were polluted by heavy metal, such as mercury due to environmental hazards. In most of the mines, children have to work underground in darkness and airless. There is only one rope to get in and out of the mine. Sometimes they will use flashlights for lighting. On Friday, June 10, the annual meeting of the International Labour Organization held in Geneva, Switzerland. At the same time, a global initiative was launched by the International Labour Organization (ILO) that to eliminate child labour in SSM with the government. With regard to mining, the Asian Labour Organization has taken positive measures to combat child labour in small-scale mining, while a number of technical cooperation projects have been carried out to illustrate how to crack down child labour in the mining industries. The best way to help child laborers is to improve the survivability, environmental sustainability and safety of the SSM economy. Mining pollution  Due to the irregular operation of mining, it has caused irreversible damage to the environment. Mining produces a lot of chemicals, causing serious pollution to air, soil and water resources. = Air pollution = Underground mining is a common method of mining. In the process of mining, drilling and blasting are usually used to underground mining. Large amounts of dust and toxic gas are emitted after blasting, such as carbon monoxide, methane and sulfur dioxide. Most of these particles are harmful to the human body. If the particles inhaled into the lungs, it will cause lung perforation. Coal is the primary energy needs demand of three of the four countries in Northeast Asia. Coal accounts for 77% of China, 85% of South Korea and 80% of Mongolia. In Northeast Asia, coal is used for both industrial and residential. Actually, almost half of the coal is used in heating system. Air pollution levels are exacerbated by extremely inefficient conversion of heating systems. In general, the main problem is that the sources of air pollution are generated during the coal combustion and conversion phases. The air pollution will result in a respiratory diseases. The greenhouse effect is caused directly by the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal. = Water pollution = In China, coal mines pollute both air and water resources. Chemicals from coal mining begin to erode the soil, then gradually seep into the groundwater. According to the research, each ton of coal mine will pollute 1 cubic meter to 2.5 cubic meters of water resources. Mine water is essential for mine operation. In the process of mining, mine water will be contaminated with different intensity, especially acidic chemicals which formed acid mine drainage (AMD). A large number of sulfides-containing rocks are exploited during mining. These rocks react with oxygen and water in the air to produce sulfuric acid. As long as the rocks are exposed to the air, sulfuric acid seeps from them. These acidic substances will pass through rainwater into the river and soil.  Mining spill in Fujian China  In Fujian Province, China, a leakage accident occurred in the mining waste pool of a Zijinshan Copper Mine, resulting in reservoir pollution. The nearby fishermen lost a lot of money and more than 4 million pounds of fish were killed by toxic. Xinghua news reported that Zijin Mining Company will take full responsibility for the incident. The company will compensate the fishermen for their losses. At the same time, the government issued a notice and mobilized local villagers to help salvage the toxic fish from the rivers.  Gold mine in Lao  The mining industry is the main source of income for Lao. Gold mining in Vientiane has contaminated nearby rivers with large amounts of cyanide, which is one of the most common mining chemicals and used mainly to dissolve gold. Cyanide leaks usually occur during the rainy season. Overflow from sewage treatment plant caused cyanide enter rivers through the soil. = Soil pollution = Soil is important to human. People use soil to develop agriculture and rely on soil-grown crops to survive. However, due to the large number of mining companies to develop the mining industry, resulting in serious soil pollution. Chemicals from mining minerals tend to create biochemical reactions when exposed to air. The resulting new material will slowly seep into the soil. As a result, over time, these chemicals accumulate more and more. The accumulated chemicals eventually form a variety of toxins hat harm human health. Farmers grow crops on the contaminated soil. During the growth of crops, nutrients are drawn from the soil. These toxins are absorbed through the roots of the plant. When the crops are ripe, they are sold to the market and end up being eaten by people. These toxins are absorbed by human body and threaten their health. The staple food in China is rice, and the annual production of rice is also considerable. According to the industrial and commercial bureau investigation, some rice was found to contain excessive levels of heavy metals. These heavy metals are all carcinogens to human body. China has always been beset by soil pollution. According to the study, more than 2/3 of the cultivated land is polluted, and 82.8% of the soil samples contain nickel, lead, arsenic, copper, mercury, chromium, zinc and cadmium. Sustainability Mineral sector and sustainable development need to be considered from four aspects: society, economy, environment and management, which as a new framework. Mineral industry is an important economic activity in contemporary society. Governance systems need to be constantly developed and improved if the government departments want to promote sustainable development for demonstrate the continuously improvement of their economic, social and environmental contributions. Minerals are a diversified sector with more than 80 mineral products, although the mineral sector exists as a relatively small one in the global economy. Some metals were discovered and used thousands of years ago, while others have only recently been used. With the improvement of automatic mechanization, the employment rate of mining industry is declining rapidly. According to the Labor Bureau, 30 million people are engaged in large-scale mining and 13 million people are involved in small-scale mining activities (SSM), accounting for 1 per cent of the world's labour force. Partly estimated, the number of people who dependent on mining industry as their main source of income approximately 300 million. As an important economic activity in the world, mineral production accounts for at least 25% of commodity exports in 34 countries. Moreover, mineral production activities are gradually concentrated in developing countries. In the past few centuries, the prices of some mineral commodities have fluctuated with the continuous improvement of mining technology and the different demand for mineral resources in the market. Minerals are widely used in all fields of society, and society is also highly dependent on the value of minerals. The use and production of minerals is essential for livelihood and economic development through employment and income generation. With the increasing population and per capita income, the demand for mineral products is also increasing. Therefore, developing countries choose to expand mineral consumption to meet the basic needs of the population. Ecologically, most mineral resources are non-renewable resources. Even if the continued use of minerals for centuries has not led to the scarcity of minerals, there is no guarantee that they will last into the future.

History Protestant Reformed Dutch Church of Flushing (Bowne Street Community Church) Seven churchmen, four members from other nearby Reformed Dutch Churches and three Presbyterians organized the Flushing congregation and On May 20, 1842, formed the Flushing Reformed Dutch Church. Until then parishioners either attended at the churches at Jamaica or Newtown, or with the Presbyterians worshipping at Saint George's. The church was formally incorporated the following year in 1843 as the ‚ÄúProtestant Reformed Dutch Church of Flushing.‚Äù The congregation erected a church in the downtown area at the corner of Prince and Washington (now 37th Avenue) streets. The cornerstone and foundation stones were quarried from Blackwell's (Roosevelt) Island for the first church building and it was laid in August 1843. Later some of those same stones were salvaged to build a fireplace in the current church building. By the 1870s, the Reformed Dutch Church had increased in membership and plans were made to move farther away from the overpopulated center of town. In 1873 a large undeveloped lot (approx ) was acquired from local landowner Mary B. Parsons.New York City Office of Register, Deeds, Liber 421, page 268, dated September 24, 1873. A notation on the 1873 map (Beers, Comstock & Co.) of Flushing reads: ‚ÄúMiss M. B.

Murray Hill had many single family homes, With the Prince and Parsons Nurseries, Quaker Meeting House and Bowne house being the most noted, farther east was still open land.https://www.bklyn-geanology- info.stevemorse.org/Queens/history/flushing.html In 1877, a parsonage was built on the southeastern portion of the lot, but it would be another 20 years before funds were secured for construction of the church itself. Reverend James Demarest (1832‚Äì1913), a distinguished cleric within the Reformed Church of America Synod of New York, arrived in December 1890 to take the post as pastor and served until 1897. The changes came after he left, in 1899 the parsonage was sold, there were debts due which occurred during the construction of the church itself. In 1907 a new parsonage was added to the church holdings at 37-16 Parsons Boulevard. =The church building= The church features a formidable corner bell tower which is its most prominent attribute. The builder, Edward Richardson, laid the cornerstone on October 10, 1891. Inside it features arched openings, detailed brick and stonework, and stained-glass produced at the glassworks of the Tiffany Glass Company of New York by designer Agnes Fairchild Northrop (1857‚Äì1953), a noted congregant renowned for her skill with opalescent glass.Flushing Journal, August 13, 1892.Martin Eidelberg, Nina Gray, and Margaret K.

The Skinner Organ Company of Boston supplied Opus 813 organ, a revision with 3 manuals, 34 stops and 46 ranks was installed in 1929 and revised and enlarged from 1977-1984. The renovation was done by Peter Batchelder of NYC. From 1984-1988 the organ renovation was continued under John Wessel, who modified the console of the pipe organ. The 1929 cost was $22,800. The previous organ (c.1892) was from Reuben Midmer & Sons of Brooklyn. The original church on Washington Street had a George Jardine & Son of NYC supplied organ.https://www.nycago.org/Organs/Qns/html/BowneStComm.html The Reformed Church of Flushing is a congregation in the Queens classis of the New York regional synod of the Reformed Church in America (RCA). Founded in 1628, the Reformed Church of America is the oldest Protestant Christian denomination in the United States. =The congregation= There was a body within the original church that was pulled in a different path, which led in 1851 to them withdrawing membership and joining with others in the community to form the First Congregational Church of Flushing. That church stood across the street on Amity (Roosevelt) Ave until 1970, when it was destroyed by fire. As the needs of the church and community changed the church body grew, an organ was installed in 1859, structural improvements were made, and the preaching shifted from Dutch to English. The 20th century saw the greater Flushing community have an influx of immigrants from Central America, China and Korea, today Bowne st. reflects the shift with neighborhood storefronts displaying signs in both Chinese and Korean Hanzi and Spanish. One hundred and twenty-three years after they split, the Reformed Church of Flushing formally re-joined with the First Congregational Church of Flushing, merging in 1974. This time it was to recognize that Flushing had changed markedly from the congregants of the '30s thru the '50s, which were drawn from a predominantly white Anglo-Saxon Protestant community; which changed in the 60's and 70's when the neighborhood had a large influx from Asia, making Flushing home to the largest community of ethnic Chinese and Korean in the United States.https://www.nycago.org/Organs/Qns/html/FirstCongFlushing.html First Congregational, which is governed by the United Church of Christ agreed to the merger in 1970. The name was changed to the Bowne Street Community Church. The building became associated with the Reformed Church in America, the United Church of Christ, and later in 1988 with the Taiwanese Zion Christian Church. Additionally, an independent Korean congregation, the New York Yeram Church, which is not affiliated with any particular denomination, has its main offices at the Church and also holds services there. Over three centuries ago, to recover their right to worship, Flushing citizens fought back against over- reaching local governance by formally petitioning for religious freedom denied by Gov. Peter Stuyvesant thru the Flushing Remonstrance of 1657. Today, Flushing is home to a multi-denominational church continuing the same traditions of faith and tolerance espoused by the Society of Friends, thereby reflecting the ethnic, cultural and religious diversity of the blended Flushing community. The Bell tower was made a NYC landmark in 2017. Present day Today, The Reformed Church of Flushing still serves its original purpose, with meetings for worship taking place every Sunday.

The people lived in different areas of rural India master in unique skills. Such as the rural people living in Kerala, they have professional skill in carving wood, the other rural people proficient in weaving carpet live in Kashmir, there are various skills from place to place is because of the factors of resources and traditions. Besides, in India, the agricultural is vital for the economy because it accounts for 44.5% of GDP from 1970 to 1971 and offers 68% of rural employment. However, the agriculture sector shrunk to 16.1% of GDP in 2009 while the proportion of non-agricultural industry achieved 86% of the GDP. A rural enterprise refers to a company registered in the rural areas, was under the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The reasons for business operating in the rural area are favorable factors such as the appealing dwelling, fresh air, bigger extend headroom, cheaper rental fees, and harmonious relationships with labor. In India, there are still many people living in rural areas. Furthermore, There are approximately 90% of employees are residents who work in an assigned area in the countryside and aim to increase the local economy. The purpose of increasing in rural economy is to make fewer people living under the poverty line. The joint family structure is predominant as the strong kinship relationship in India. Therefore, in order to assure that there are lucrative employment opportunities in rural India, the intervention of the plan is needed. For example, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been promulgated to increase the opportunities for wage employment.  History  In a different historical time, the performance of agriculture has a discrepancy, at the beginning of the green revolution, between the 1970s and 1980s, the growth rate of agricultural remains high in Uttar Pradesh. In the 1990s, the substantial loss is suffered by the farm economy as the growth space brings by the Green revolution may be used up. Such as the decline in the outputs of cereal crops, wheat, and groundnuts. After the period of the liberalization, the growth of the food grains stayed behind the increase in the population between 2000 and 2001 and the Total factor productivity show a decreasing trend from 1993 The rural economy with slow growth pace has developed to a high-speed growth economy after the liberalization in economic and the improvement in the facilities. Between 1990 and 1991, the launch of new economic policies leads to a decline in the output of food grains and an increase in non-food crops such as cotton. The location of 61% of the total enterprises is in rural areas, as stated in the 2005 Economic Census Report. Types of rural industries Agriculture farming in south India =Agriculture Industries= The agriculture industry is crucial as it solved the subsistence of the 2/3 of the population in the field study at Ambedkar Negar district, in which, the labor force of India accounts for 52%, and this sector made the contribution of 15.7% of the Gross domestic product between 2008 and 2009. The majority of the National economy is contributed by the agricultural industry. The job of people who lived in rural India is still mainly engaging in agricultural. Nevertheless, it also found that the agricultural has a receding proportion in the GDP. There are approximately 91% of the population in the 13 selected villages in India works associated with farming, among these, over 86% are the small and marginal farmers who have an achievement of cultivating 75% of the total arable land. Besides, The agrarian economy mainly comes from the little area and marginal and small land possessed by farmers. However, there are still some factors such as the advent of diseconomies caused by the liberalization agenda, the downward trend of the share of the land, the limited job opportunities and production possibilities may lead to the livelihood under the line of poverty. Finding the sources or crops that can generate incomes and trying to satisfy the need of the consumers is needed to sustain their daily life. The sources or crops that can generate incomes and trying to satisfy the need of the consumers is needed to sustain their daily life. For example, the commercial products (milk, vegetables, and fruits) are the sources that can be traded in markets and are required by the residents as secured food. Besides, the small and medium farmers are more likely to foster diversified resources with catering the demand such as the grains, fibers, and oilseeds, which makes more profits. Therefore, many farmers made a transformation from farm to non-farm agriculture businesses. For instance, there are roughly 66% of the peasant engaged in non-traditional agricultural enterprises. =Forest Industries= logging teak in India The forest industry traditionally produces two primary resources, which are timber and non-timber forest products (NTEPs). The fuelwood plays a crucial role among the forest products as it taking up more than 35% average forest income in the selected 27 villages around the Jharkhand in India. Besides, the forest income is significant because it made 12% to 42% increases to the village economy, and it is the dominant source of income in HFLA and HFHA villages. From which, it would alleviate the livelihood burden of households. It is using the majority of the firewood in the rural family as a source for heating in the selected villages in Jharkhand. Thus, less than 10% of the fuelwood for trading. Apart from the firewood, there is another forest product also very valuable, which is NTFPs. The timber uses for producing furniture and equipment. In contrast, the NTFPs encompass the products that can use in different areas, such as the medicinal plants for healing, some specific plants used in making cosmetics. Furthermore, NTEPs is one of the oldest product in trade. For instance, in the 12th century AD, there is trade in sandalwood oil and Arabic gum. Thus, it contributes to the local economies that started from the early days. Nowadays, the Baiga tribal in India still lives to rely on the NTFPs as the source for living and income. Moreover, it also stated that NTFPs has intangible values such as in many cultures, specific forest area is sacred. Therefore, the function of the NTFPs also can be related to religion, not merely on the trade and the products. =Hand loom industries= Sambalpuri Ikat weaving loom (Tanta) from Odisha The hand loom industries in Odisha state, India is followed by the agriculture sector in terms of the contribution of the employment, which maintained the livelihood of the weavers in the low class. In rural India, the Bastralaya handloom cooperative produces traditional clothes (sarees, lungis) and household's products (bed cover) with dyeing yarns. There is a tradition in India, when the advent of the Nuakhai festival, the handloom items will be sent between family members. Also, women will wear a sari to dance during this festival. Furthermore, there is a complicated braid art called Ikat, which weaving prominent patterns on the silk with using environmentally friendly colored threads. Furthermore, while carrying on the orders, the quality of the product is strictly controlled, such as if the weaver did not meet the standard criteria in terms of the dimension of the sari, the cash fined will be required after rigorously check. Weavers in this industry should possess textile skills, learn new knowledge through regular activities and observe the needs of the customer such as the color they preferred for the sarees, these competencies with the help of Bastralaya company will improve social-economic. Thus, the Bastralaya commit to bringing more earnings for weavers. Structure of rural enterprise A Joint family enterprise in India has a dominant place due to the concept of family and the incentives of the economic benefits. The Joint family encompasses two types of family, which are patrilineal and matrilineal. Besides, the partnership between the family members or relatives with the same caste and sub-caste will bring significant start-up capital and assistance from relatives to solve the issue, such as handling all of the business simultaneously. Besides, another predominant reason for this form of partnership is the concept of unity in a kinship, which is a cherish perception relate to the immediate family or distant relatives as partners. For example, 23 partnership ventures have a corporation with family members in the total of the 48 enterprises in the selected two villages at Gujarat, West India. However, even if the strong sense of unity as a family but the conflicts may appear eventually, and sometimes the certain activities need different nature of the collaboration. Therefore, it could happen that the partnership established outside of the joint family. Rural enterprise in India In India, there are different forms of rural enterprises, which are community-based organizations, self-help groups, and cooperatives, these companies are beneficial for the rural economy due to the job opportunities created. However, there are some challenges for enterprise in rural India, such as the limited assets, inadequate skills and labors, unsteady communication system, and weak transport infrastructure. These are obstacles for enterprises in rural areas to be enlarged to a higher- value market. Also, the deficit of knowledge on promoting the product may lead to the proposition of improper decisions. For example, India rural enterprise has a reliance on the traditional experiences to thrive on, such as the weavers in Sambalpuri Bastralaya Handloom cooperative society limited obtained basic knowledge from parents and community. Therefore, the appearance of e-commerce is to solve these issues. For instance, Anand milk union limited is an India dairy cooperative; it applied the e-business in rural India to gain a robust supply chain, eliminate transport obstacles, and have a good relationship with customers. =Rural cooperatives in India= 'thrift cooperative' in Mulukanoor, India Cooperatives in India is on behalf of one of the most extensive system in terms of rural finance in the world. Agricultural cooperatives in India still have excellent scope for improvement with the changing economy. Through the reaching a large amount of the clients, farmers (small and marginal farmers), and people under the poverty line, it can be seen that rural cooperatives have an essential role in the hinterland of rural area. there are approximately 4.5 lakh cooperatives in India with 220 million people involved. Also, cooperatives initially originated from the twentieth century, cooperatives at an early stage mainly catered to the financial needs of the farmer, especially when the advent of harvesting and sowing. Today, the cooperatives are responsible for the majority of the rural credit, which constituted for 65%. Under the different types of cooperatives in India, the credit cooperative is a powerful system in India, which encompasses the organization of rural credit cooperative. Besides, in the villages of India. The other types of cooperatives found, which are societies of farmer service and multipurpose society for large-scale agricultural. Rural cooperatives also engaged in distributing quality inputs to farmers by charging maximum price through the activity of procurement. The dairy cooperatives in rural India helps women involving in the production of the milk and acquiring confidence, more specifically, concerning the success of the Amul experiment. Pravaranagar Cooperative Sugar Industry is another successful example as the contribution to the development of the social-economic about rising in the economic benefit and the improvement of the rural facilities, which were inclusive of the areas of education, recreation center, hospitals, and cooperatives. =Rural self- help groups= 161x161px The self-help group in India is an action taken in a group in a wide range, which helps approximately 33 million of Indian women to obtain financial services and other activities with lower prices. Women in rural India, especially with lower castes and lower education level, facing a plight such as the adverse health condition and limitation to acquire financial products. There are commonly 10 to 20 members in a rural self-help group, who funded money mutually for the enterprise or emergency. For example, in Tamil Nadu, India. The new self-help groups established after the natural disaster. One of the famous models launched in rural India is to provide microcredit to poor Indian women. The initiatives of rural development in India concentrate on the development of the economic status of women and other vulnerable people by providing micro-credit. Besides, there is another model not only offer the Microfinance plus but also involved in the areas of education, social attendance, and politics. The self-help group has ethical implications for Indian women, such as alleviating the economic burden and eliminating gender inequality. After accessing the loan products, there is an improvement for rural women in the aspects of psychological and economic conditions. Moreover, women who are widowed will receive support. In South India, the large proportion of rural women, especially widows, experienced poverty, uncertainty in the inheritance of land, and barriers of involving in community. The existence of the rural self-help group is to empower the vulnerable group, especially women, to conquer the barriers.

The genus contains a single species, Utaetus buccatus. It lived in the Middle to Late Eocene (about 40 to 36 million years ago) and its fossil remains were found in Argentina and Brazil in South America.  Description  This animal, about long, was very similar to a modern armadillo. In particular, the appearance likely recalled that of the modern Euphractus, and it already had the typical well-developed xenarthral joints on the vertebrae. Among the other characteristics in common with the modern armadillos, Utaetus possessed a bony connection between the ischium and the sacrum (this structure was constituted by caudal vertebrae known as pseudosacral) and continuous-growth cylindrical teeth similar to chisels, with wear in the occlusal part. There were ten lower teeth on each side of the jaw; the first two were much smaller and are interpreted as incisors. Unlike later armadillos, however, Utaetus still had a varying amount of enamel on the lingual and buccal surfaces of the teeth, and the cervical vertebrae were separated (and not co-ossified). The skeleton shows that this animal was suitable for digging, as evidenced by the presence of a large acromion on the scapula and a prominent olecranon on the ulna. The posterior margin of the scapula was thickened, and formed a secondary incipient spine.  Classification  The genus Utaetus was first described in 1902 by Florentino Ameghino, based on fossil remains initially thought to date back to the Cretaceous. The type species is Utaetus buccatus, also known for cranial material, but Ameghino described further species based on fragmentary remains (U. deustus, U. lenis, U. laevus, U. laxus), now considered nomina dubia.Utaetus is considered a primitive member of the Dasipodidae, the family that includes the modern armadillos and their extinct relatives. In particular,Utaetus and its close relatives (such as Parutaetus) could be closely related to the modern genus Euphractus. The name Utaetus is an anagram of Eutatus, another extinct armadillo.

History Dr. Rupert Hornabrook Hornabrook was born in Kent Town, South Australia, a son of Charles A. Hornabrook and his wife Eliza, n√©e Soward. John Hornabrook, owner of the York Hotel, at the corner of Pulteney and Rundle streets, Adelaide was a grandfather. He was educated at St Peter's College, before studying for the (Anglican) priesthood under Canon Field and F. A. D'Arenberg then was admitted to the University of Adelaide, studying medicine, in 1891. After completion of his Bachelor's degree, and during his internship at the Adelaide Hospital, the \\"Adelaide Hospital Row\\" disrupted teaching, and many, Hornabrook included, left for hospitals overseas to complete their training. :A dispute arose in 1894 when a sister of the Chief Secretary (later Sir) John Gordon was appointed to a senior nursing post over several, arguably better qualified, applicants. A letter of protest was sent by these nurses to the Board, which treated the petition as gross impertinence, as they did representations by Hornabrook. Under pressure, all but one of the signatories, Nurse Graham [q.v.], backed down, creating a cause c√©l√®bre. Acting outside his authority, Premier Kingston sacked the Board, replacing them with men of his own choosing. :On 8 April 1896, 17 members of the Adelaide Hospital‚Äôs honorary staff resigned in protest, though maintaining service until replacements had arrived. :Kingston recruited several British doctors to take up the slack. Rivalry between surgeons Napier (one of the \\"strikebreakers\\") and Corbin was so acrimonious that patient welfare suffered. Hornabrook contributed his own observations to the public discourse. :Kingston‚Äôs government fell in 1899 and the issue faded away. The dispute with the University was resolved by the quiet diplomacy of William Mitchell, professor of philosophy, and teaching resumed in 1902. Hornabrook, along with fellow South Australian J. A. Bonnin, completed his medical training at \\"Barts\\" (St Bartholomew's Hospital) in London in 1897, adding qualifications M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. to his MB., and accepted a locum tenens position at the West London Hospital. In 1898 he commenced working for the Government of India combating bubonic plague as Chief Medical Plague Officer of Dharwar. Less detailed reports have him working in Bombay (modern Mumbai), some 500 km distant. A year later he was in the South African Republic performing similar work, where it was feared the disease was being brought in by Indian workers. Later that year he joined the Imperial troops in South Africa as a medical officer, and was credited with several displays of bravery and was wounded under fire, before being laid low with sunstroke and enteric fever during the Siege of Ladysmith. Hornabrook returned to Adelaide briefly in March 1901 before proceeding to Melbourne, where he was an invited guest at the Public Schools Old Boys' reunion. In May 1902 at St George's (Presbyterian) Church, St Kilda, Victoria he married Miss E. Winifred Sargood, daughter of Sir Frederick Sargood of Rippon Lea Estate. He transferred to the Australian Army Corps, and in February 1904 was appointed lieutenant, promoted to captain the following year. In February 1904 he was called to the Celtic Queen, from Acapulco, anchored off Wallaroo, three of whose crew had died, and most of the rest laid low by fever. He spent much of the years 1907‚Äì1908 in London, studying anaesthetics under one Dr. Barker, perhaps Arthur Edward James Barker (10 May 1850 ‚Äì 1916) at the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank. Hornabrook, his wife and small family moved to Victoria in early 1909, settling at Lansdowne Road, East St Kilda. He was appointed assistant anaesthetist to the Melbourne General Hospital, where he is credited with popularizing use of the \\"ethyl chloride-ether sequence\\" (chloroethane followed by di-ethyl ether) for general anaesthesia. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Hornabrook on 3 August 1914 enlisted with the Permanent Naval Force on battlecruiser HMAS Australia, serving as temporary surgeon under Staff Surgeon Alexander Ruan Caw. HMAS Australia was involved with the AN&MEF;, which captured German New Guinea, then joined the Royal Navy‚Äôs Grand Fleet as flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, patrolling the North Sea, but saw little action. Hornabrook resigned his commission on 7 August 1915 and enlisted with the Australian Army and sailed for England with the First AIF aboard the liner, later troopship, SS Medic. He served in 1 AGH, 11 Surgical Team, and 12 CCS, and was promoted major in September 1917. He had his appointment terminated in December 1917 in order to take up anaesthetic work at Melbourne University. Hornabrook maintained his interest in anaesthesia after the war, but confined his practice to the Children's Hospital, the Melbourne Dental College, and the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. He retired in 1934 after suffering a heart attack. He was in 1929 elected the first chairman of the Anaesthetics section of the British Medical Association, Victorian branch. In 1934 Hornabrook and Gilbert Brown (the Society's first president) were foundation members of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists. Hornabrook died at his home, 10 Toorak Avenue, Toorak, Victoria. Other interests He was active in a variety of sports, rowing for St Peter's College, playing football for North Adelaide 1889‚Äì90. He adjudicated He had a close relationship with St John's Ambulance Brigade, giving lectures and adjudicating at competitions. He was a member of the Australian Club, Melbourne He was the author of numerous \\"Letters to the Editor\\" (more like essays) on a variety of subjects: *Export of eggs to England *Donation of a hospital to Russia Just a year before the first Revolution, and Russia no longer an ally.

George Henry Laporte (c. 1799, London (?) - 23 October 1873, London) was an English animal painter. He specialized in horses, mostly of the Arabian variety. His works depict scenes from hunting, racing and other sporting events, as well as animal still-lifes. His birthplace is generally given as Hanover. This likely involves some confusion resulting from his employment with the King of Hanover, who was a member of the British Royal family, as there appears to be no evidence that his parents were ever there or that he was adopted. Life and work His father was John Laporte, a noted watercolorist and etcher of Huguenot descent, who was also his teacher. His first exhibit came in 1818 at the British Institution. Later, he was one of the founding members of the Royal Society of British Artists and was a regular contributor to their exhibitions at the Suffolk Street Gallery.Lane Fine Art. He also continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy, although the Society was meant to be an alternative to it.Biography of his father @ WikiSource, In 1831, he became one of the first members of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, for which he provided clever sketches of hunting scenes and cavalry groups. Forty-three of his works were engraved and published in The Sporting Magazine, as well as several other journals. Described as a man of great charm, he enjoyed a widespread patronage. He was appointed as an official animal painter to the Duke of Cumberland and his son, Prince George of Cumberland. A few of his paintings are in Orientalist style, set in Egypt, which suggests that he may have travelled there at some point.

For more than four centuries, Mozambique was ruled by the Portuguese. Following Mozambique‚Äôs independence from Portugal came 17 years of civil war, between RENAMO and FRELIMO, until 1992, when peace was finally reached. Armando Guebuza was then elected president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009, despite criticisms that he lacked honesty, transparency, and impartiality. This sparked a series of human rights incidents including unlawful killing, arbitrary arrests, inhumane prison conditions, and unfair trials. There were also many issues regarding freedom in relation to speech and media, internet freedom, freedom of peaceful assembly, and discrimination and abuse of women, children and people with disabilities. Many of these issues are ongoing and have become current human rights violation is for Mozambique. TOC  History  = Independence War = In September 1964, FRELIMO sought an attack against the Portuguese to gain independence. Attempts at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, Eduardo Mondlane, who was the founding president of FRELIMO, began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. The war continued sporadically for 10 years, and finally in 1975, the Portuguese fled Mozambique, FRELIMO took control of the country, and Mozambique became independent from Portugal. Mozambique was successful in the war, however, under the reign of the Portuguese, the country was educated and had abundant resources such as professionals and tradesmen. Without the Portuguese, they lacked this educated workforce, causing conflict within the country. RENAMO revolutionaries caused the start of another war within Mozambique, protesting the reign of FRELIMO. = Civil War = Immediately following Mozambique‚Äôs independence, the country descended into Civil War for 15 years. It was fought in Mozambique from 1977 to 1992. The war was between the countries two key political parties, Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) and Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO). The war caused the deaths of over 1 million Mozambicans due to either combat or starvation, as food supplies were interrupted. The Civil War destroyed most of the countries critical rural infrastructure such as schools, roads, rail lines, and hospitals. The two belligerents involved in the war conducted countless acts against human rights and crimes against war and humanity. They were responsible for killing many innocent people, forcing conscription to join the party, forcing child soldiers to fight, and indiscriminately covering the countryside with land mines. FRELIMO won the war and a new constitution was drafted in July 1989, and adopted in November 1990. It made Mozambique a multiparty state, with recurring elections, and confirmed democratic rights.  RENAMO  244x244px The Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) is a political movement, led by Afonso Dhlakama, to oppose Mozambique‚Äòs ruling FRELIMO political party. RENAMO was built from former FRELIMO politicians, who oppose the ruling party‚Äôs principles. The assembly of RENAMO perpetrated the Civil War, and the party was supported heavily by South African anti-Communist governments. During the Civil War, crimes against humanity and human rights were severe. Part of RENAMO‚Äôs war strategy was to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in order to weaken the opposing party. These crimes included mass killings, rape and mutilation of civilians, forcing children and civilians into employment as soldiers.The public resented RENAMO for the brutal crimes they committed, they named them ‚ÄúArmed Bandit‚Äôs‚Äù, and promoted their hate for the party by encouraging beatings against them.  FRELIMO  The Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), is the dominant political party in Mozambique. It was founded in 1962, as a national movement against the Portuguese, in order for Mozambique to achieve independence. Since independence was achieved, FRELIMO has been the reigning political party. FRELIMO was also responsible for many crimes against war and humanity. People were forced into employment, and times of conscription were often illegally extended. While the FRELIMO crimes against humanity were less violent and less frequent than that of RENAMO, sexual violence such as rape was widespread amongst the soldiers. The party was also accused of detaining petty criminals, political appointments and prostitutes without trial in ‚Äúre-education camps‚Äù.  Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life  Mozambique has had numerous reports that included descriptions of the government and Mozambican police committing unlawful and arbitrary killings. = Unlawful killings by police = Mozambique security forces such as the Mozambique Republic Police (PRM), have been indicated in various reports as key culprits of unlawful and arbitrary killings. They have been reported throughout the country for killing unarmed citizens for negligible breaches of the law, and sometimes for no violation at all. In 2010, a riot occurred in Mozambique in response to a 30% rise in the price of bread in the country. Demonstrators burnt tires, blocking roads, and stole from shops in the capital of Mozambique, Maputo. According to the police officials, real bullets were used to shoot the rioters once they run out of rubber bullets. Hospital and police sources identified the death toll at six people, including two children. An unknown citizen stated that the police were heavily armed and arbitrarily firing live bullets at anyone they thought were involved, causing the death of innocent bystanders. = Inhumane prison conditions = Prison conditions in Mozambique are inhumane and life- threatening due to multiple unsanitary conditions. The physical conditions of Mozambique prisons include overcrowding, limited medical care and hygiene, and inadequate sanitary conditions. Overcrowding has been identified as the main issue, resulting in further problems of insufficient hygiene, medical care, and food. It also means that prisoners cannot be separated appropriately, and often juvenile convicts are forced to live in adult facilities, there is little differentiation regarding the level of crime committed by the inmates, and those with contagious illnesses are unable to be isolated. According to the Attorney General‚Äôs Office (PGR), the overcrowding issue of prisons meant that in a space built for 8,188 people, there were 18,185 prisoners. This is an example of severe overpopulation, as the person is at 222% capacity, which results in little to no human rights for the prisoners. = Arbitrary arrests = An arrest is arbitrary when there is insufficient evidence to condemn an individual, and when there is no legal basis to the arrest. The law states that anyone that is detained without legal basis or on the foundation of insufficient evidence should be released, however the authorities of Mozambique have that responsibility, and have been found to not follow this law strictly. According to Amnesty International, the Mozambican police have been found to arrest citizens without sufficient reason or evidence to do so. Many detainees in detention centres are being held while their case is still being investigated. They were arrested on the suspicion of theft, and some are held in these pre-trial facilities for almost a year, while police investigate the case, providing the assumption that the arrests were arbitrary and on suspicious grounds. The Mozambican law also states that an arrest is arbitrary if it does not comply with the procedures for arrest set out in the Criminal Procedure Code. Amnesty International has documented arrests that do not comply with these procedures due to failing to inform those being arrested and detaining their rights. Violating a detainee‚Äôs rights can include not allowing them to see a lawyer, forcing detainees to sign documents, or beating or ill- treating detainees to force them to confess. = Denial of fair public trial = The ruling government party, FRELIMO, was accused of providing understaffed and poorly trained judiciary. It was also believed that the judiciary was politically influenced during trials. Detention without trial also became an issue throughout Mozambique, particularly in prisons in Maputo and Nampula, where hundreds of people were held without trial for illegal amounts of time. Some were held without charge. For example, a man named Jos√© Capitine Cossa was detained for over 12 years in a maximum-security prison without charge or trial. When questioned, the authorities claimed to be unaware that he was even there. He was released after they held an investigation, yet he was awarded no compensation, and nobody was held responsible for unlawfully arresting and detaining him.  Freedom  = Speech and media = In the 2018 Human Rights Measurement Initiative, Mozambique‚Äòs protection of freedom of expression received a result of 5.3 out of 10. There were restrictions on free speech, forced by the Mozambican police, although there were no government official constraints. The restraint of free speech was primarily in regard to any criticism of the government. During Armando Guebuza‚Äôs reign as president, RENAMO became accusatory of the government, influencing violence between the ruling and opposition parties. In 1991 Mozambique introduced the Press Law, which classified any slander, criticism or offence about the president or government as illegal. This limited journalists‚Äô ability to write freely, and also closely impacted the people‚Äôs ability to fairly choose their government. The public wouldn‚Äôt know the accurate truth about the government, and therefore couldn‚Äôt make an informed decision at elections. Ericino de Salema was a well-known journalist and human rights lawyer. Anonymous armed man abducted and beat him due to his reporting. Armando Nenane was another journalist and human rights activist. He expressed his views on a group called G40, who slandered RENAMO, the governments opposition, and was allegedly created by the ruling government. Armando Nenane also received anonymous death threats for his ostracised views, and nobody was convicted or held responsible for the attack on him. = Assembly = Again, the laws did not explicitly abolish the freedom of peaceful assembly, however, the right of peaceful assembly wasn‚Äôt respected by the government. If a group of people were to peacefully assemble and protest, they were required to provide the local authorities with a written notification of the protest at least four business days prior to the event. The government had the authority to disapprove the request for protest, indistinctly impeding the right of peaceful assembly.  Societal discrimination and abuse  = Women = Rape and domestic violence is illegal and can result in imprisonment. However, in 2014, a draft law was considered by Mozambique‚Äôs National Assembly that would allow rapists to marry their victims in order to avoid detention. The law was thoroughly considered, however it was not ratified in Mozambique. While domestic violence is punishable by law, these laws were not enforced heavily by the government, and more than 20,000 domestic violence cases were reported in one year. Sexual harassment remains a prominent issue in the country, as there are no laws incriminating sexual assault in public places. Amnesty International have reported countless cases of women murdered by men, many of whom were known or related to one another. For example, a man stabbed his wife to death with a kitchen knife in Inhagoia neighbourhood on the outskirts of Maputo. In Vanduzi district, a 27-year-old man decapitated his mother with a machete saying she had refused to serve him food. In many cases the culprit justified their actions by claiming the female used witchcraft against them. In both these cases and many more, the perpetrators admitted their crime, however, the authorities failed to develop, resource and implement an effective strategy to combat violence against women. On 15 September 2020, Amnesty International called for an immediate and impartial investigation into the extrajudicial execution of an unarmed and naked woman by some men wearing army uniforms. The armed men appeared to be members of the FADM or Mozambique Armed Defense Force. = Children = Sexual and physical abuse towards children remains a key issue, particularly for orphans and vulnerable children. The law prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children was partially enforced, and therefore, unsuccessful in eliminating the problem. In multiple cities and towns, child prostitution is customary. = Persons with disabilities = Discrimination against persons with disabilities is illegal by law, however these laws have failed to be enforced effectively. Access to buildings is overlooked, and discrimination in basic services like health care was common. Education and employment opportunities were very unequal, and there were no government initiatives implemented to improve this inequality or strive to improve persons with disabilities accessibility to information.

She co-founded various environmental organisations, including the Tahoma Audubon Society, the Washington Environmental council, Washington Wilderness Coalition, The Arboretum Foundation, Nisqually Land Trust, and Citizens for a Healthy Bay in Tacoma. Engle had traveled the world, including to Antarctica, to observe birds.  Biography  Engle was born in Tacoma on February 18, 1926 and grew up in Oakville where she lived on the family homestead. She was studying nursing during World War II at the University of Puget Sound. She married Stan Engle in 1947. After the birth of her third child, she quit nursing and in the 1950s, she and Stan joined The Mountaineers. Becoming familiar with hiking through The Mountaineers helped her see how the natural land around her was being lost to logging and pollution. In 1969, after she and a friend, Thelma Gilmur, learned about a plan to develop Nisqually Delta, they organized the Tahoma Audubon Society. Eventually, Engle would go on to serve on the board of the National Audubon Society. Gilmur and Engle also created the Washington Environmental Council. As part of the Tahoma Audubon Society, she and the group protested land development in 1976. Gilmur, Bob Ramsey and Engle created Snake Lake Park, which was renamed the Tacoma Nature Center in 1979. Engle and Gilmur also created China Lake Park. In 1990, Engle led a sit-in at Congressman Norm Dicks' office because he supported logging salvage. Engle died in her home at University Place on March 11, 2019 due to renal failure. Awards *Thomas O.

Intravenous ascorbic acid is used as a dietary supplement for nutritional deficiencies and also, as complementary therapy to cancer treatments. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid as a cancer treatment or co-treatment has been a controversial topic since the emergence of misleading data in the 1970s. However, more recent research suggests an ability to decrease inflammation in the patient and to improve symptoms related to disease processes, and side effects of standard cancer treatments.  Medical uses  = Nutritional deficiencies = In patients suffering from malnutrition or malabsorption, intravenous ascorbic acid can be used to treat deficiency. For people who are receiving all of their nutrient requirements via total parenteral nutrition there are vitamin products that include ascorbic acid.  Contraindications  High doses of ascorbic acid administered by intravenous infusion have been shown to increase the absorption of iron. However, in individuals with hemochromatosis (a genetic disorder where the body takes up and stores too much iron), intravenous ascorbic acid is contraindicated as high dosages of ascorbic acid may result in iron overloading and therefore, lead to life-threatening complications such as heart disease, diabetes, or tissue damage. High dosages of ascorbic acid (such as those used in intravenous therapy) have been reported to cause some intestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, as well as increased gas and urination.  Pharmacology  Chemical structure of ascorbic acid (reduced form) = Mechanism of action = Ascorbic acid operates as an anti- oxidant and essential enzyme cofactor in the human body. In in vitro studies, the primary mechanism of high dosage intravenous ascorbic acid can be related to ascorbic acid's pro-oxidant activity, whereby hydrogen peroxide is formed. In the extracellular fluid of cells, ascorbic acid dissociates into an ascorbate radical upon the reduction of transition metal ions, such as ferric or cupric cations. These transition metal ions will then reduce dissolved oxygen into a superoxide radical- this will then react with hydrogen to form hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, according to Fenton chemistry, these transition metal ions can be further oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to generate a highly reactive hydroxyl radical. The formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals is believed to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis of cancer cells. Although many in vitro studies have studied hydrogen peroxide generation by ascorbic acid, the pharmacological mechanism of intravenous ascorbic acid in vivo is still unclear.  History  = Pioneering research = Although the pharmacology of ascorbic acid had been studied since its discovery in the 1930s, the method of administration and its medicinal potential to human patients was not investigated until the 1940s. In 1949, American physician, Frederick Klenner, published his scientific report, ‚ÄúThe Treatment of Poliomyelitis and Other Virus Diseases with ascorbic acid‚Äù, which detailed the use of intravenous ascorbic acid to treat polio in children. Although Klenner's attempts were unsuccessful, his research pioneered future studies investigating the medicinal role of intravenous ascorbic acid. Klenner's work was recognised by Linus Pauling in the foreword to the Clinical Guide: \\"Dr. Fred Klenner's early research reports provide much information on the use of high-dose ascorbic acid for the prevention and cure of many diseases, and these reports are still important.\\" Nobel Prize winner, Linus Pauling, is recognised as one of the early pioneers of ascorbic acid research = Linus Pauling = Nobel Prize winner and biochemist, Linus Pauling, was pivotal in the re-emergence of intravenous ascorbic acid research. Over the course of the 1970s, Pauling would begin a long-term collaboration with fellow physician, Ewan Cameron, on the medical potential of intravenous ascorbate acid as cancer therapy in terminally ill patients. In 1976, Pauling and Cameron co-authored a study whereby a group of 100 terminal cancer patients underwent supplementary ascorbic acid therapy (10g/day by intravenous infusion and oral thereafter) and the control group of 1,000 patients did not. Their findings reported that the survival rate of the terminal cancer patients increased by four-fold, compared to the control group, stating that: \\"the treatment of ascorbate in amounts of 10g/day or more is of real value in extending the life of patients with advanced cancer.\\" Subsequent studies by Pauling and Cameron hypothesised that ascorbic acid's role in enhanced collagen production would lead to the encapsulation of tumours and thus, protect normal tissue from metastasis. Following these findings, Pauling became a strong advocate for vitamin megadosing and continued to investigate the medicinal potential of intravenous ascorbic acid across a range of illnesses, including: HIV transmission, the common cold, atherosclerosis, and angina pectoris. = Medical controversy = The efficacy of intravenous ascorbic acid therapy came under scrutiny of the medical and science community, following the numerous high-profile studies authored by Linus Pauling in the 1970s. The experimental design of Pauling and Cameron's 1976 publication, \\"Supplemental ascorbate in the supportive treatment of cancer\\", had garnered considerable criticism as it was neither randomised nor placebo controlled. To test the validity of Pauling and Cameron's findings, the Mayo Clinic conducted three independent experiments in 1979, 1983 and 1985, whereby terminal cancer patients were given doses of oral ascorbic acid under randomised, double bind and placebo-controlled conditions. All studies concluded that high doses of oral ascorbic acid were not effective against cancer. = Recent research = In the 2000s, new research highlighted the important pharmacokinetic differences between intravenous infusions of ascorbic acid and oral supplementation; ultimately, these findings indicated that oral supplementation produces lower serum concentrations of ascorbic acid, as opposed to intravenous administration.  Research directions  =Cancer= The use of intravenous ascorbic acid in the treatment of cancer is a contentious issue. There is no evidence to indicate that intravenous ascorbic acid therapy can cure cancer. However, reviews suggest therapeutic value to cancer patients undergoing treatment. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), high-dose vitamin C (such as intravenous ascorbic acid therapy) has not been approved as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. Cancer patients often have a compromised ascorbic acid status due to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation caused by the ‚Äúmetabolic state of the malignancy and its effects on host metabolism, the catabolic effects of antineoplastic therapy, and the physiologic stresses of disease processes‚Äù. Therefore, high-dosages of ascorbic acid are administered intravenously to supplement these deficiencies. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid in cancer patients has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve nutrient deficiencies and also, reduce post-oncological side effects related to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. As intravenous ascorbic acid therapy is currently used as a complementary treatment for cancer patients, there many been multiple studies devoted to investigating the medicinal properties of ascorbic acid. The use of high-dosage intravenous ascorbic acid as a cancer treatment was first promoted by Linus Pauling and Ewan Cameron in the 1970s; however, these findings were not reproduced using oral administration by subsequent Mayo Clinic studies in the 1980s. Nonetheless, the turn of the 21st century saw a renewed interest in the medical potential of intravenous ascorbic acid therapy. In the early 2010s, in vitro preclinical and clinical trials were undertaken to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of action of intravenous ascorbic acid therapy. These findings demonstrated ascorbic acid's pro-oxidant capabilities to produce hydrogen peroxide and thus, proposed a possible pharmacological mechanism of action against cancer cells. Nonetheless, ascorbic acid's potential as an anti-tumour therapy is still dubious, as other pro-oxidant substances (such as menadione) have been unsuccessful in the treatment of cancer patients. In 2010, an academic review which detailed 33 years of ascorbic acid and cancer research stated: \\"we still do not know whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant anti-tumor activity. Nor do we know which histological types of cancers, if any, are susceptible to this agent. Finally, we don't know what the recommended dose of Vitamin C is, if there is indeed such a dose, that can produce an anti-tumor response\\". =COVID-19= As of April 2020, there are ten ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).

Most plastids are photosynthetic, thus leading to color production and energy storage or production. There are many types of plastids in plants alone, but all plastids can be separated based on the number of times they have undergone endosymbiotic events. Currently there are three types of plastids; primary, secondary and tertiary. Endosymbiosis is reputed to have led to the evolution of eukaryotic organisms today, although the timeline is highly debated.  Primary endosymbiosis  The first plastid, is highly accepted within the scientific community, to be derived from the engulfment of cyanobacteria ancestor into a eukaryotic organism. Evidence supporting this belief is found in many morphological similarities such as the presence of a two plasma membranes. It is thought that the first membrane belonged to the cyanobacteria ancestor. During phagocytosis, a vesicle engulfs a molecule with its plasma membrane to allow safe import. When the cyanobacteria became engulfed, the bacterium avoided digestion and led to the double membrane found in primary plastids. However, in order to live in symbiosis, the eukaryotic cell that engulfed the cyanobacterium must now provide proteins and metabolites to maintain the functions of the bacteria in exchange for energy. Thus, an engulfed cyanobacterium must give up some of its genetic material to allow for endosymbiotic gene transfer to the eukaryote, a phenomenon that is thought to be extremely rare due to the \\"learned nature\\" of the interactions that must occur between the cells to allow for processes such as; gene transfer, protein localization, excretion of highly reactive metabolites, and DNA repair. This would mean, a reduction in genome size, for the cyanobacteria, but also an increase in cytobacterial genes within the eukaryotic genome. The genus of Synechocystis sp., strain PCC6803 is a unicellular fresh water cyanobacteria that encodes 3725 genes, and a 3.9 Mb sized genome. However, most plastids rarely exceed 200 protein coding genes. A recent study sequenced the genome of a cyanobacterium that was living extracellularly in endosymbiosis with the water-fern Azolla filiculoides. Endosymbiosis was supported by the fact that the cyanobacterium was unable to grow autonomously, and the observance of the cyanobacterium being vertically transferred between succeeding generations. After cyanobacterium genome analysis, the researchers found that over 30% of the genome was made up of pseudogenes. In addition, roughly 600 transposable elements were found within the genome. The pseudogenes were found in genes such as dnaA, DNA repair genes, glycolysis and nutrient uptake genes. dnaA is essential to initiation of DNA replication in prokaryotic organisms, thus Azolla filiculoides is thought to provide nutrients, and transcriptional factors for DNA replication in exchange for fixed nitrogen that is not readily available in water. Although the cyanobacterium had not been completely engulfed in the eukaryotic organism, the relationship is thought to demonstrate the precursor to endosymbiotic primary plastids.  Secondary endosymbiosis  Secondary endosymbiosis results in the engulfment of an organism that has already performed primary endosymbiosis. Thus, three plasma membranes are formed. The first originating from the cyanobacteria, the second from the eukaryote that engulfed the cyanobacteria, and the third from the eukaryote who engulfed the primary endosymbiotic eukaryote. Chloroplasts contain 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA. 16S and 23S rRNA is found only in prokaryotes by definition. Chloroplasts and mitochondria also replicate semi-autonomously outside of the cell cycle replication system via binary fission. Consistent with the theory, decreased genome size within the organelle and gene integration into the nucleus occurred. Chloroplasts genomes encode 50-200 proteins, compared to the thousands in cyanobacterium. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis, nearly 20% of the nuclear genome originate from cyanobacterium, the highly recognized origin of chloroplasts. Recent studies have been able to identify the speed and size at which chloroplast genes are able to incorporate themselves into the host genome. Using chloroplast transformation genes encoding spectinomycin and kanamycin resistance were inserted into the DNA of chloroplasts found in tobacco plants. After subjecting the plants to spectinomycin and kanamycin selection, some plants began to tolerate spectinomycin and kanamycin. Roughly 1 in every 5 million cells on the tobacco leaves highly expressed spectinomycin and kanamycin resistant genes. By using the cells expressing resistances, they were able to grow tobacco from these cell to maturity. Once mature, the plants were mated with wild-type plants, and 50% of the progeny expressed spectinomycin and kanamycin resistance genes. Pollen cannot transfer chloroplast DNA, thus leading to believe that the genes were incorporated into the tobaccos genome. Furthermore, 11kb of integrated chloroplast DNA was introduced to the host genome, transferring more DNA that previously predicted at a faster rate than previously predicted.  Tertiary endosymbiosis  Although previous endosymbiotic events resulted in the increase in the number of membranes, tertiary plastids can have 3-4 membranes. The most largely studied tertiary plastids are known as peridinin and found in dinoflagellates. Peridinin is believed to have been derived from a red algae secondary endosymbiosis. Consistent with our previous rules for reduction in genome size, and incorporation of genes into the host genome, peridinin genome consists of about 14 genes. These genes are broken down further into small minicircles that contain 1-3 genes. These genomes are circular like prokaryotic genomes. Further, they only encode atpA, atpB, petB, perD, psaA, psaB, psbA-E, psbI, 16S and 23S rRNA. These genes play vital proteins used in photosystem I and II, indicating further their cyanobacterial origin.

He worked as a mining surveyor at Ararat, Victoria before moving to Stawell, Victoria. He was the Borough engineer as well as the town valuer, surveyor and designer of several buildings, including the town hall built in 1870.Bridging the Gap: the History of Hall's Gap from 1840, Ida Stanton, Publisher: I. Stanton 1988,  The Stawell water supply  After gold was discovered around 1853, Stawell‚Äôs population began to grow and in 1866 residents realised they needed a permanent water supply. One of the schemes proposed was to block off the ends of the valley and flood the whole of Hall‚Äôs Gap. D‚ÄôAlton came up with a more viable plan that is still in use. The survey of the scheme was commenced in October 1873 but it was not until February 1875 that the first sod of the tunnel was turned by the then Mayor, Mr HC Purcell.Pomonal: A Picturesque Place Revisited, Isabel Armer, Publisher: Pomonal Progress Association 2013, His proposal was to bore a tunnel through the Mt William range, a distance of 1 km, and have the water diverted from Fyan‚Äôs Creek by open channels and flumes. It commenced operation in December 1881. The system worked by gravity and delivered up to 38 megalitres a day to the Big Hill reservoir in Stawell. Much of Stawell‚Äôs water supply still comes from Fyan‚Äôs Creek and parts of the original system are still in use, including the tunnel. A new weir has been built near the original and in 1978 a chlorination plant was added. The original brick-lined reservoir which held a maximum of 11 megalitres has had additional reservoirs added and total capacity is now 500 megalitres. The original 12 km flume, on timber structures and using inverted syphons or aqueducts to cross gullies, was replaced with by steel initially but was replaced by underground piping in 1955. The construction of the 1 km long tunnel was started from both ends in 1875 and, for the first time in Victoria, dynamite was used. It was safer and more effective than black powder (gunpowder). Using a compressed air drilling machine, the two sides met, after many delays, with precision five years later.Engineering Heritage Marker dedicated 12 October 2014: Engineers Australia, Parks Victoria, Engineers Australia, GWM Water, Northern Grampians Shire Council, IPWEA Victoria The original cost was estimated at ¬£84.500.

He married his cousin Henrietta Hayden (1801‚Äì1886) John married Jane Galbraith (1834‚Äì1873) just as they left for Australia. Jane gave birth to eight children but died the day after the last was born. D‚ÄôAlton sent an urgent message to his family in Ireland asking for someone to come out and help. His widower mother, Henrietta, did not want to part with her family so they sold up and all migrated in 1875. The family was not small, there was Henrietta, brothers Charles, St Eloy and William (who had been in New Zealand) and sisters Susan, twins, Sophia and Henrietta, as well as the family governess, Miss Carpenter.Good Country for a Grant: A History of the Stawell Shire, Robert Kingston By the time they arrived John had remarried a widow Catherine Denholm-Fulton who already had five children.

TOC  Origins  LEPRA gained assent in November 2002 and was implemented in December 2005. The act was a response to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, also referred to as the Wood Royal Commission, which occurred between 1995 and 1997.

The associated report that was published in 1997 advocated for consolidation of police powers into a procedural code. New South Wales. Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service & Wood, J. R. T. (James Roland T.) & NSW Child Protection Council. Interagency guidelines for child protection intervention (1997). Final report. Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, Sydney, N.S.W. It argued this would have the benefit of protecting individual rights, reducing police corruption and aiding police training. The NSW government then approved drafting of LEPRA a year later in 1998. The structure of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, an Act that relates to the use of police powers in the United Kingdom, served as a guide for the layout of LEPRA.  Major features  The main function of LEPRA is to codify and govern the exercise of specific police powers. If police do not comply with provisions within LEPRA, this may, but does not always, lead to evidence being unable to be used in court under section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. = Consolidation of common law = Within LEPRA, there are many provisions that essentially reflect the exercise of police powers within existing common law. This is evident in section 231 of LEPRA which dictates that only \\"reasonably necessary\\" force must be used to make an arrest. Parts of LEPRA also extend the common law. This includes section 10 which regulates the ability of police to enter into premises to arrest individuals, a power previously found in the case Lippl v Haines (1989) 18 NSWLR 620. = Re-allocation of existing provisions from other Acts = LEPRA also contains sections that relocate guidelines concerning police powers from other Acts. For example, Part 16 of LEPRA, which relates to the power of police to detain an intoxicated individual, very closely mirrors the Intoxicated Persons Act 1979. As well, Part 9 of LEPRA (\\"Investigations and questioning\\") contains provisions that essentially copy what used to be Part 10A of the Crimes Act 1900. Sections 114 and 115 in Part 9 of LEPRA outline the circumstances in which police may detain someone for investigative purposes as well as the appropriate length of time for an investigation period. = New powers and safeguards created =  Searches  Part 4 of LEPRA describes the power of police to undertake different categories of searches without a warrant. Specifically, division 4 contains provisions which permits personal searches. This includes searches generally and strip searches. Sections 33 and 34 contain rules in relation to ensuring the privacy and appropriateness of strip searches, including a provision that specifies that children under 10 must not be strip searched.  Arrest  Section 99 of LEPRA expands the scope of the previous common law power of police to arrest. Sentas, V., & Mcmahon, R. (2014). Changes to Police Powers of Arrest in New South Wales. Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 25(3), 785‚Äì801. This is primarily due to the broadness of the list of \\"reasons\\" which constitute the need for arrest (section 99, sub-section (1)(b)), as well as the lack of a provision which governs circumstances in which an officer \\"must not arrest\\" an individual.  Crime Scenes  Part 7 of LEPRA codifies crime scene powers not previously enshrined in legislature.Tan, A. (2006). Consolidation and codification of police powers to be scrutinised by Ombudsman. Law Society Journal, 44(1), 36‚Äì37. It outlines the circumstances where police are able to set up a crime scene as well as the power to prevent individuals from entering, tampering with or recording crime scenes.  Safeguards  Part 15 of LEPRA contains restrictions on the exercise of police powers. Section 202 outlines how police must give their details as well as any warnings to an individual \\"as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so\\" when exercising a power, or beforehand when specifically giving directions or requesting an individual carry out a particular task. Section 203, sub-section (1) specifies that police must also warn an individual when the law specifies that they must \\"comply with a direction, requirement or request\\". = External monitoring of LEPRA = Section 242 of LEPRA requires the Inspector of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission to review and scrutinise police powers, such as in relation to search warrants, as a method of external monitoring of the Act. As part of this, the Inspector must also produce a report containing any observations made or research conducted (section 242(6) of LEPRA). Currently, the Inspector is Terry Buddin, a previous Supreme Court Judge in NSW. Smith, A. (2018). 'Vexatious and false': Claims made by minister against former judge. The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved from https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/vexatious-and- false-claims-made-by-minister-against-former-judge-20180830-p500uq.html As well, section 242A of LEPRA requires the Commissioner of Police, the Commissioner for the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission to \\"each report annually on the exercise of powers under Part 5.\\" Lastly, the Chief Commissioner of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission \\"may at any time make a special report on any matter arising out of the operation of Division 4 of Part 3 to the Minister\\" (Section 242B(5)). Justice Michael Adams is the current Chief Commissioner of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.  Amendments to LEPRA  = Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment (Search Powers) Act 2009 = This Amendment Act commenced on the 29th May 2009.Palmer, C. (2009). New state powers for computer and data examination and seizure in New South Wales introduced together with covert search powers: amendments to the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. Computers & Law, 75(6). It introduced a new section (75A) relating to police search powers, which allows ‚Äúa person executing or assisting in the execution of a warrant‚Äù to bring equipment to the premises and operate it in order to inspect specific objects. The provision also allows police to take anything away from the premises for the purposes of further examination. Section 75B is similar but it instead permits ‚Äúa person executing or assisting in the execution of a warrant‚Äù to use equipment in order to look at data, copy data or take the device where the data is stored for further examination. = Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment (Arrest without Warrant) Act 2013 (LEPRA Amendment Act) = The LEPRA Amendment Act was a response to Part 1 of a review of LEPRA carried out by Andrew Tink, who used to be the Shadow Attorney-General and Paul Whelan, a previous Police Minister, which focused specifically on the power of arrest under section 99. Accordingly, the LEPRA Amendment Act replaced section 99 with a new provision which effectively expanded police powers of arrest and demonstrated a shift towards arrest as a first rather than last resort. =Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment Act 2014= Part 2 of Andrew Tink and Paul Whelan‚Äôs report was published on 12 December 2013, and concentrated on Parts 9 and 15 of LEPRA. This review subsequently led to the implementation of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment Act 2014 which commenced on the 2nd November 2014. According to an article by Jane Sanders called ‚ÄúPolice powers update March 2015: recent legislative amendments‚Äù, one of the most controversial amendments was pursuant to section 115 in which the investigation period (which starts when an individual is arrested) was extended from 4 to 6 hours. Sanders, J. (2015). Police powers update March 2015: recent legislative amendments [pdf]. The Shopfront Youth Legal Centre. Retrieved from https://criminalcpd.net.au/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/Police_powers_update_March_2015recent_legislative_amendments.pdf. [Accessed 17 May 2019]. The Act also amended police search powers, such as the removal of the separate categorisation of frisk and ordinary searches to \\"searches generally\\" under section 30. Part 15, relating to safeguards, was also amended. This involved the removal of the consequences of a police officer failing to provide their details to an individual under section 201. Previously, this would mean the exercise of the particular power would become invalid, but now it results only in a complaint. Other amendments were also made to police powers of entry (sections 82-84) and crime scene powers (sections 91-95).  Significant cases  =R v McClean = R v McClean [2008] NSWLC 11 was a case that considered section 99 of the original LEPRA Act before the 2013 LEPRA Amendment Act. It affirmed the idea of arrest as a last resort. The case involved a woman (McClean) who police suspected to be involved in a break and enter. She was initially questioned, then arrested and then a physical struggle took place between her and police. In court, Magistrate Heilpern explained how arrest is unlawful if it does not align with one of the purposes in section 99, sub-section 3 and determined that in this particular case, arrest was for further investigation which did not fall under one of those purposes. As well, Magistrate Heilpern emphasised that the arrest remained unlawful despite the purpose of arrest subsequently changing to something else. = Poidevin v Semaan = Poidevin v Semaan [2013] NSWCA 334 was a case that occurred before the introduction of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment Act 2014, where safeguards concerning police powers were all located in section 201 of LEPRA. The case was heard by the NSW Court of Appeal. The case involved an interaction between Mr Semaan and a police officer (Mr Poidevin) where Mr Poidevin tried to take Mr Semaan‚Äôs phone and restrain him. On appeal, the issue for the judges to consider related to section 201 of LEPRA. Leeming JA outlined how a failure by police to give warnings and details when it is ‚Äúreasonably practicable‚Äù after exercising their powers does not then ‚Äúretrospectively affect the lawfulness‚Äù of their actions. =DPP (NSW) v Mathews-Hunter = DPP (NSW) v Mathews- Hunter [2014] NSWSC 843 was a case that took place after the 2013 amendment to section 99 of LEPRA. It involved a transit officer who saw the defendant (Mathews-Hunter) drawing on a window of a train. The transit officer subsequently arrested the defendant, due to the fact he was graffitiing the train, by ‚Äúphysically restraining him‚Äù when a fine would have been sufficient. Since the defendant was arrested by a citizen rather than a police officer, the judge, Fullerton J, was forced to consider whether the notion of arrest as a last resort applied to section 100.Sanders, J. (2018). Police powers of arrest and detention. [pdf] The Shopfront Youth Legal Centre. Available at https://criminalcpd.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Police-Powers-of-Arrest- and-Detention-Jane-Sanders-November-2018.pdf [Accessed 17 May 2019]. She held that it did apply to the \\"Power of other persons\\" to arrest, such as in the situation of a transit officer. = Hamilton v State of New South Wales = Hamilton v State of New South Wales (No 13) [2016] NSWSC 1311 concerned a situation where the plaintiff (Hamilton) was arrested by police due to his alleged assault of a taxi driver. The judge, Campbell J, held that the arrest complied with section 99 of LEPRA, but did not satisfy section 231 which relates to use of force. He found that police used excessive force which was not proportionate to the plaintiff's alleged crime.As well, Campbell J found that police also did not comply with the requirement under Part 15 that they provide their details and any warnings as soon as reasonably practicable.  Current controversy and proposed reform  = Police powers to conduct strip searches = A recent SMH newspaper article titled ‚ÄúRise in strip searches in NSW damaging the credibility of police‚Äù that was published in February 2019 described the sudden increase in the number of strip searches in NSW that occurred in 2017-18 (5483) compared to in 2014-15 (3735). The article argued that this increase was alarming based on the notion of strip searches as a last resort. As a result of this increase, in October 2018, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission stated that it would investigate the exercise of police powers under LEPRA to undertake strip searches. In May 2019, 10 daily published an article ‚ÄúHighest in the World: Half of Aussie Drug Users Report Encounters with Police‚Äù, which examined the link between the use of sniffer dogs and subsequent strip searches of individuals by police for possession of any drugs.Brancatisano, E. (2018). Highest In The World: Half Of Aussie Drug Users Report Encounters With Police. 10 Daily. Retrieved from https://10daily.com.au/news/australia/a190516pnbag/highest-in-the-world-half- of-aussie-drug-users-report-encounters-with-police-20190516 The power of police to use dogs in relation to drug detection comes under Part 11, Division 2 of LEPRA. The article outlined public criticism of the use of drug detection dogs. It referenced a study conducted in 2011 which suggested that ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù resulting from searches conducted by sniffer dogs occurred around 80% of the time, leading to unnecessary strip searches. = Use of necessary force by police = There has also been recent discussion in the media concerning the use of force exercised by police when making arrests, which falls under section 231 of LEPRA. A May 2018 article from news.com.au called ‚ÄúWhat powers do police have when it comes to using force?‚Äù reported a statistic compiled by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, which documented ‚Äú93 investigations into NSW Police use of force, 18 of which include allegations of assault and unreasonable force‚Äù. Livingstone, T. (2018). What powers do police have when it comes to using force?. News.Com.Au.

(2018). Call to lift secrecy around police Taser use after mentally ill man's death. The Guardian. Retrieved from https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/call-to-lift-secrecy- around-police-taser-use-after-mentally-ill-mans-death In 2012, Roberto Laudisio-Curti died after being tasered by police, which led to the NSW ombudsman preparing a report that same year on police using Tasers. Further, in February 2018, a man who had a mental illness also died from the use of a Taser during an arrest. This prompted the New South Wales Council for Civil Liabilities to demand further investigation and research of statistics relating to Taser use, in order to review and improve Taser procedures. This relates directly to the use of necessary force when making arrests under section 231 of LEPRA.

Led by Cruz Chavez, a local notable and charismatic figure, the rebellion was one of a series of uprisings against the government calling for social reform and religious autonomy. The rebellion initially met with success but was eventually crushed by government forces in 1892. The defiance of the tomochitecos became a symbol of resistance against tyranny and became enshrined in Mexican folklore. Furthermore, the rebellion was unique as it was one of the first religiously inspired revolts against the state, with the rebels rallying behind the cult of Teresa Urrea as a symbol of their defiance of the regime.  Background  At the turn of the 19th century the Mexican government under the Porfirio regime began a process of centralisation. Regional areas that historically enjoyed relative autonomy increasingly began to experience state authority. The remoteness of the northern provinces of Chihuahua state and the threat of Apache Indians resulted in the government initially relying on military colonists to maintain order. These local serrano inhabitants, used to independence and with a strong subscription to regionalism were destined to clash with the centralisation policies of the Federal government. The appointment of local officials by the central government caused further resentment by the tomochitecos of the regime. Changes in technology were also seen as an intrusion of independence by the residents of the remote frontier regions. The coming of the north western railway and lumber workers from the United States was a major source of the conflict. These remote regions were instantly connected to the economy of the United States through the railway, becoming footholds for American timber, mining and agricultural companies. These large corporations gained animosity from northern communities as more and more land was taken over, displacing small local land holders. The Guerrero district also experienced drought in the early 1890s bringing hardship and further depressed the local economy. The stealing of religious paintings from the local chapel by the captain of the guard of the governor Lauro Carillo while the governor was on a campaign trek was a sign to the tomochitecos of the disconnect between the central government and themselves. It was in this economic and political situation that the villagers of Tomochic under the leadership of Cruz Chavez declared their faith in Teresa Urrera, a local woman who had become a religious folk figure after reportedly seeing visions from god whilst experiencing convulsions and declared that the only authority that they would recognise was that of God alone. Course of the Rebellion  = Initial skirmish = As the drought worsened in the northern regions, Cruz Chavez attempted to organise a procession of holy relics in hope of alleviating the worsening conditions. The Mexican catholic church had banned such proceedings unless express permission was granted and hence regarded Chavez's actions as an act of defiance to the authority of the church. It was the threatened suspension of church services by the new centrally appointed priest that was the last straw for Chavez and his followers. On 7 December 1891 the villagers of Tomochic clashed in a brief confrontation with federal troops which resulted in Chavez and his followers fleeing into the surrounding Sierras and began their journey to Carbora to seek the folk saint Teresa Urrea. The next confrontation between federal troops and the rebels occurred at Los Alamo ranch on 26 December where the rebels ambushed an army patrol commanded by Captain Emilio Enriquez. The federal troops were routed and the rebels continued onto Carbora in search of Teresa Urrea. Not finding her there, Cruz and his followers decided to return to Tomochic. = A Relative Peace = After the ambush at Los Alamo a chase was organised and led by Colonel Lorenzo Torreres. With no success a change in tactics was ordered by Governor Carrillo. Rather than risk another ambush the rebels would be allowed to return to the village unmolested where they would stay until the army was ready to launch a full-scale assault. However, politics was to get in the way and with an election looming Carrillo decided that negotiation would be the best option to solve the crisis. The state negotiator, Tomas Dozal y Hermosillo, after meeting with Chavez recommended to the governor that the villagers be left alone until they realise that they had mistakenly placed their faith. With Diaz more concerned about other affairs, the Tomochic issue was cast as a low priority and so the villagers returned to their daily routines. It was the conflict on 15 May 1892 at Navajoa that put the Tomochic affair back in the spotlight. Around 200 native Indians of the Mayo and Yaqui tribes attacked the mining town of Navajoa in the name of Saint Terresa Urrea. This was enough for Diaz to order the commencement of the assault on Tomochic. = The Second Confrontation = On 2 September 1892 Federal troops under the command of General Jose Maria Rangel marched on the tomochitecos. Poor intelligence resulted in Rangel severely underestimating the strength of the rebels, thinking that his force would only encounter a total of 38 rebels. Three columns made up of militia and regular infantry formed a V and moved towards the village with the centre column soon coming under heavy fire by a nearby cemetery. Captain Vergara, commanding one of the flanks of the V, was shot almost as soon as firing began. Colonel Ramirez commanding the central part of the wedge was struck in the shoulder amidst the firefight. With the leadership of the army force in disarray the federal forces began to lose cohesion as a fighting force resulting in the decimation of the task force and the capture of General Rangel as well as the commander of the militia unit involved in the battle. The federal troops, marching defeated back into the city of Guerrero described the tomochitecos as \\"a terrible lot . . . they know their Winchesters inside out; since they were children they have kept up a constant struggle against Apaches and bandits; they can run like a deer through the sierras without putting a foot wrong; but they are excessively ignorant and proud\\". Seeing the devastation caused by the tomochitecos the city soon became panic stricken fearing an attack on the city itself. This second confrontation struck home to Diaz and in order to prevent others from joining the cause of the tomochitecos a renewed campaign was ordered. = The Final Confrontation = The Tomochitecos, desperate for more fighters, were joined by a bandit named Pedero Chappero and his gang. However their loyalty to the cause of the tomochitecos was questionable. Chavez allowed them to fight alongside the rebels as long as they remained pious and loyal to the cause. The army, still reeling from the disaster of early September, began a renewed campaign against the rebels of Tomochic. The new federal army campaign against the tomochitecos began with confusion with General Felipe Cruz, drunk and in a stupor, leading a cavalry charge slashing at cornfields at Le Generala, thinking the corn stalks were the rebels. General Rosendo Marquez was ordered by President Diaz to take command of the campaign. The army now outnumbered the rebels at least 15 to 1. On the morning of October 20 the initial army offensive was halted by the rebels. Faced with an entrenched enemy General Rangel who was back in command changed tactics and decided to lay siege to the village. On 25 October federal troops attacked the cave in which the newly recruited Pedero Chapparo and his brigand of outlaws was holding out resulting in the loss of life of 23 soldiers. With the cave now ion the hands of the army a full on assault of the village could be conducted. On 26 October, federal troops attacked the village church that was the stronghold for the rebels burning it to the ground with the remaining rebels fleeing to other defensive positions. The final assault by the federales occurred on 29 October against the 13 remaining rebels holding up inside their cuartel. After the army had stormed the building the remaining six survivors including Cruz and his two brothers Manuel and David were executed, ending the rebellion.  Aftermath  The Tomochic Rebellion became a thorn in the side of the Porfirio regime. The altercation with federal forces resulted in the deaths of 300 male townsfolk and numerous women and children. The women and children who survived the siege totalled 40 and 70 respectively. Foreign media outlets portrayed the rebellion as a deepest revolution against the Mexican government. Local newspapers such as El Monitor Republicano demanded an investigation into the actions of the government and El Tiempo stated that extermination was not permitted by a civilised country. Newspapers in the United States heralded the tomochitecos as defenders of a new alamo, fighting for their liberty against a repressive regime. Teresa Urerra was sent into exile by the Diaz government even though she denied her political involvement in the rebellion. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 was just around the corner, making Tomochic an important precursor to the eventual overthrow of Diaz and the installation of Francisco Madero as president.  The Importance of Religion  Religion was vital in determining the course of the Tomochic Rebellion. The Mexican countryside in the late 18th century was awash with millennialism and the belief that those who fought for God would not only be martyrs but would on some instances also be reincarted in the flesh. It was this religious fervour that inspired the tomochitecos to hold out for so long against overwhelming numbers. Cruz Chavez believed that the rebels were condemned to die and were on a god given mission. It would be only through their deaths that the new millennium would arrive.  In Popular Culture  The events at Tomochic became the subject of a serialised novel written by Heriberto Frias. This novel criticised the actions of the government in dealing with the tomechitecos and appeared in the opposition party's newspaper el Democrata.

The year of construction was likely 1903, although in an annual report issued by the Boise School District 1972‚Äì73, the year was given as 1908. On file at Main Branch, Boise Public Library Above the main entry of a 1951 addition to the building was written, \\"Cole Elementary Est. 1888.\\" The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1982. With History Orric and Ella (Bown) Cole donated part of their farmland for construction of a school on March 30, 1888, and the original Cole School was constructed in that year. Ella Cole taught at the school during its first five years. By 1891 Cole School was part of School District 29, and it may have been the only school in the district. By 1903 Cole School was part of School District 5, and a new school building had been designed by architects Campbell & Wayland, later Wayland & Fennell. Contractor I.J. Allen constructed the 2-story, 8-room brick schoolhouse. It opened in November, 1903, with Professor John H. Kruger as principal. The building featured a hipped roof and secondary hipped roofs at each corner, with a central bell tower above and behind a small, hipped gable with dormer centered above the Romanesque entry. Cole School became a stop on the Intermountain Electric Railway, later the Boise Interurban Railway, in 1904. In 1937 Tourtellotte & Hummel designed a 2-story Art Deco gymnasium and cafeteria adjacent to the school, and in 1951 a 1-story addition to the school was constructed. Cole School was annexed into the Independent School District of Boise City in 1948. In 1975 the Boise School District identified three school sites, Garfield, Campus, and Cole, as being \\"hazardous and noisy locations for elementary schools.\\" Of these, only Garfield School remains. Campus School was closed in 1990 and became part of Boise State University. A bell was installed in the tower at Cole School in the late 1980s. Cole School closed on June 5, 2008, and the school district announced plans for demolition. A committee of preservationists and local activists tried to save the school, but it was demolished in November, 2009.

Early life  Earnest was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, and attended Wellesley College. As a young woman, newly married, she lived for a time in Pennsylvania German country, an experience to which she ascribed her interest in folk art.  Art collection  She worked for a time as Eva LaGalliene's stage manager before moving to Stony Point, New York, where with Cordelia Hamilton, she opened the Stony Point Folk Art Gallery in 1948. The gallery soon became known for its displays of folk sculpture, of which decoys were a particular highlight. Growing from this interest, Earnest in 1965 published The Art of the Decoy: American Bird Carving, among the first books to discuss decoys in a scholarly context. Alongside Hamilton, Marian Willard, Burt Martinson, Albert Bullowa, and Herbert Waide Hemphill, Jr., she was a founding trustee of the American Folk Art Museum. Instrumental in supporting many of its early programs, she donated numerous works to the collection, including a pair of decoys by Lothrop T. Holmes; also among her gifts was a weathervane depicting the Archangel Gabriel which went on to become a symbol of the institution. Weathervane - American Folk Art Museum, NYC - IMG 5873 In 1984 she published a combination memoir- history of the field of folk art collecting, Folk Art in America: A Personal View. Earnest traced her interest in the art of decoys to a set of three carvings of dovetailed geese which she purchased in 1954; two of these she sold to Stewart Gregory, and one has since been dubbed the Earnest-Gregory dovetailed goose.  Death  She died in a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Washington. She was survived by her son, Eugene, and two grandchildren, her husband Joel having died many years before. Earnest's papers are held in the archives of the American Folk Art Museum.

In the late 1980s, at the start of the Zambian AIDS epidemic, her mother died as a result of the syndrome, quickly followed by her father. Princess Kasune married when she was 17; her older husband, Moffat Zulu, it transpired, had already lost two of his previous wives to AIDS. In 1997 she took an AIDS test which proved positive, prompting her to begin a life of AIDS activism. Initially she took an unconventional approach by giving the appearance of a prostitute and hitching lifts with long-distance lorry-drivers, who she would then lecture on the importance of condom use. She was appointed an ambassador for World Vision International's Hope Programme, and in that capacity travelled to the US in 1993 to meet President George H. W.

Its nearest higher peak is Mantis Peak, to the west, and Snowfield Peak rises to the west. Precipitation runoff from Styloid Peak drains into Neve Creek and McAllister Creek, both tributaries of Thunder Creek. The first ascent of Styloid Peak was made on May 31, 1981, by John Roper and party, on the same day that they climbed Distal Phalanx. Roper, being a doctor, named some of his many first ascents for anatomical parts of the body. Climate Styloid Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is located within the premises of the University of the Philippines Diliman. It has a population of 21,513 based on the census conducted in 2015.  History  Krus na Ligas was founded in the 17th century by Marikina townsfolk who settled in the hilly area to cultivate the land. The residents called their community Gulod (Tagalog for hilltop). It became a visita of Marikina, and as popular folklore has it that a small chapel was built near a cross-shaped marking nut tree known in Tagalog as ligas stood. It was first recorded in 1705 with 30 families residing in the community. After the Battle of Pasong Tamo on 26 August 1896, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, Guillermo Masangkay, Pio Valenzuela and other Katipuneros camped in Krus na Ligas and met in one of the houses fronting Plaza Santa Inez before heading to San Juan del Monte. In 1939, Krus na Ligas together with the barrios of Balara, Diliman, Barangka, and Jesus de la Pe√±a were separated from Marikina to form part of Quezon City. Jesus de la Pe√±a and Barangka would later be reverted to Marikina. On April 2, 1949, a vast tract of public land which tilled by residents of the surrounding communities including Krus na Ligas was authorized by President Elpidio Quirino to be sold to the University of the Philippines for one peso, for it to build its new campus outside of Manila. Significant portions of the farmlands of Krus na Ligas would be turned into government housing projects that would be latter known as Sikatuna Village, UP Village and Teacher's Village. Despite the growth the university campus, sections of Krus na Ligas remained farmlands well into the 1990s, until the remaining farmland was used for a housing project for university personnel, displacing the last farmers in the area. = Land dispute = The inclusion of the settlement of Krus na Ligas into the UP Diliman campus effectively turned the residents of the barrio into illegal settlers. This resulted into several court cases attempting to secure legitimate ownership of the land the residents claim to have been in their family for generations, long before UP Diliman was even established. Attempts to settle land ownership between the residents and several UP Administrations have repeatedly failed. During the administration of Edgardo Angara as UP President, an agreement was reached to donate 15.8379 hectares of land to the Quezon City government‚Äîacting as trustee of the residents‚Äîin exchange for the removal of structures on the boundary of the university and the community of Krus na Ligas; construction of a fence to demarcate such boundary; and relocation of families living on the university side of the boundary. However, the failure of the residents to fulfill the specified conditions caused the revocation of the donation. In 2008, the new charter of the University of the Philippines was passed by Congress prohibiting the sale of any of its land. Attempts to allow the legitimate residents of Krus na Ligas to finally attain ownership of their land was then sought through an amendment of the university's charter. In September 2019, Republic Act No. 11454 was made into law. This law included amendments to aforesaid charter to allow the sale of some portions of the land, subject to conditions. It remains to be seen how the law and land distribution will be implemented. Despite the dispute, Krus Na Ligas remains to be a very important residential community for UP students and employees.

History The CMO was formed in 1936 after the recently-formed Citizens' Municipal Party decided to expand to a greater organisation, citing a desire to avoid party politics. Despite this claim, it was closely affiliated with the Queensland branch of the United Australia Party in the early part of the organisation's existence, before moving to the Queensland People's Party when the Queensland UAP separated in 1944. The People's Party became the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, and CMO aligned itself with the Queensland Liberal division until its own dissolution. It ran candidates in City of Brisbane elections throughout its existence. Two Lord Mayors were elected representing the CMO ‚Äî John Beals Chandler from 1940 to 1952 and Reg Groom from 1955 to 1961. The official dissolution date of the organisation is unclear. Before the 1967 election, a number of CMO members defected and formed the Liberal Civic Party, which ran candidates against both the CMO and Labor at that election but failed to win a seat. At the 1973 election, the CMO was described as \\"moribund\\" and the Brisbane Civic Party was formed to challenge Labor, albeit unsuccessfully. Finally, from the 1976 election onwards, the Liberals decided to run under their own banner rather than that of the CMO or any other secondary organisation, certainly dissolving the ostensibly nonpartisan group in an official sense if it had not been already.

S. Hornabrook\\" was an Anglican priest in the colony and State of South Australia, possibly best remembered for his work in Adelaide with St Mary Magdalene's Church and St Peter's College Mission, in Moore street, Adelaide. History Rev. C. S. Hornabrook Hornabrook was born in Adelaide, the oldest son and second child of Charles Atkins Hornabrook JP (c. 1833 ‚Äì 26 August 1903) and his wife Eliza Maria Hornabrook, n√©e Soward, (c. 1838 ‚Äì 26 January 1901). He was educated at St Peter's College and joined the architectural firm of Woods and McMinn, spending two years in England furthering his education at the Royal Academy architectural schools, during which time he wrote a monograph on the history of stained glass in England, read before the St George's Art Society and as Painted Glass published in The Furniture Gazette Vol. XXIII p.135 London 1885.Catalogue: Department of Science and Art of the Committee of Council on Education, South Kensington Museum. A List Books and Pamphlets, accessed through forgottenbooks.com and was serialized in The Building News. The Building News was founded in 1854, became The Building News and Architectural Review in 1860, The Building News and Engineering Journal in 1863, of which Ebeneezer J. Kibblewhite was a longtime editor and John Passmore Edwards a longtime owner of these titles. He then worked for two years as catechist under the Rev. R. H. Phillips, incumbent of St John's (Anglican) Church, Taree, New South Wales. In January 1887 he left Australia to study for Holy Orders at Lincoln Theological College, where he gained first class honours in the 1889 examinations. That same year he was ordained by Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln, and returned to Australia, and in November 1889 was sent to the Diocese of Newcastle, New South Wales. In 1892 he returned to Adelaide as curate of St John's (Anglican) Church, serving mostly at St Mary Magdalene's mission church, 26‚Äì28 Moore Street (between Angas and Carrington streets. In 1894 he was appointed rector of Christ Church, Kapunda. Ellen Benham was then headmistress of the Christ Church Day School before leaving to study in Europe. Hornabrook and Miss Day ran then ran the school. His duties included oversight of the Eudunda and Hamilton churches. In November 1901 Hornabrook left for St Paul's Church, Port Adelaide, where he succeeded Archdeacon Samwell as rector, and remained there for four years. Rev. George Griffiths, of Willunga, was his replacement at Kapunda. He was appointed honorary canon in April 1904. In 1905 Hornabrook left St Paul's, and was replaced in January 1906 by Archdeacon Young of Mount Gambier. In 1906 he was granted a general licence in the Diocese of Adelaide for two years. He first visited England with his family, then assisted Archdeacon Dove at Walkerville. In January 1908 Bishop Harmer appointed him Archdeacon of Mount Gambier, which diocese encompassed much of the South-East, including the Deanery of Strathalbyn. This appointment was not welcomed by Rev. A. G. King, rector of Christ Church, Mount Gambier, who resigned in protest. It irked him that the office should go to someone with no connection to the area when there was no shortage of qualified local men, though the real reason may have been Hornabrook's High Church orientation. This appointment, which was in the gift of the bishop, did not require him to spend much time in the South-East. Rather, he was given St Mary Magdalene's Church in Moore Street. He actively supported that church's Men's Bible Class, its Literary Society (member R. G. Lillywhite was president of the Literary Societies' Union), and fostered the formation of other groups, including three Boy Scout troops. He was made a Canon in 1911. In 1918 he succeeded Bishop Wilson as Archdeacon of Adelaide, the first native South Australian to hold that position. ;St Peter's Mission In 1908 St Peter's College followed the lead of similar public schools in England in establishing an outreach mission at St Mary Magdalene Church, Moore Street, city to benefit people in one of the poorer districts of Adelaide, and Hornabrook was appointed missioner. Hornabrook had a considerable influence on the architecture and fitting-out of the mission church, decidedly in the Anglo-Catholic mould. ;Barwell Boys In 1922 Premier Henry Barwell announced the \\"South Australian Farm Apprenticeship Scheme\\", when thousands of impoverished and orphaned English boys were brought in to relieve the shortage of farm labourers resulting from WWI casualties. A form of philanthropy, but also described as \\"more cheap labor\\", Hornabrook was at the forefront of assisting their settlement in the new country. ;Ritualism Hornabrook was criticised for his promotion of Anglo-Catholic vestments as adopted by the new headmaster of St Peter's College.

Along with Theo van Leeuwen and David Barton, she is considered one of the most prominent researchers on literacy.  Career  Ivaniƒá taught English language, literacy and study skills to children and adults in Devon, London and Stockton, California between 1970 and 1985. She was director of the Language Support Unit at Westminster Kingsway College in London, United Kingdom. She was a lecturer in adult literacy, language and learning at Garnett College for teachers in further and higher education before joining the staff at Lancaster in 1986. Ivaniƒá was a full-time member of the Department of Linguistics and English Language of Lancaster University between 1986 and 2008. She has been an Associate Director of the Literacy Research Centre of Lancaster University since 2002 and she was appointed Professor Emerita in September 2008. Research Ivaniƒá's research focused on literacy, intertextuality, applications of Theo van Leeuwen's Theory of Representation, academic discourse practices, writing practices in both academic and non-academic settings, the link between research and practice, multimodal communication, adult literacy, educational linguistics, critical language awareness, punctuation, and second language writing. In 1994 Ivaniƒá, along with Lancaster Literacy Research Group including David Barton, claimed that literacy is not a skill but a set of practices which is culturally shaped and embedded in social action. In a research article, published in the Journal of Second Language Writing in 2001, Ivaniƒá claimed that writing (lexical, the syntactic, the organisational and the material aspects of writing construct identity) conveys a representation of the writer. In a research article, entitled Discourses of writing and learning to write and published in Language and Education, Ivaniƒá proposed a meta-analysis of theory and research about writing and writing pedagogy. She identified six discourses: # skills discourse # creativity discourse # process discourse # genre discourse # social practices discourse # sociopolitical discourse Publications Ivaniƒá has publications in several major journals such as Journal of Second Language Writing, Literary and Linguistic Computing, and Language and Education.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range, and the mountain is situated on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. Ballard ranks 88th on Washington's highest 100 peaks. The nearest higher neighbor is Azurite Peak, to the south. Precipitation runoff from Mount Ballard drains into Mill Creek and Slate Creek, both tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Mount Ballard is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It has rough bark from the base of the trunk to the thicker branches, smooth bark on the thin branches, egg-shaped to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and smooth cup-shaped to conical, and sometimes ribbed fruit.Flower buds of subspecies canescensFlower buds of subspecies beadelliifruit Description Eucalyptus canescens is a mallee that sometimes grows to high but is often low and spreading, and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, grey, flaky bark from the base of the trunk to the branches as thin as , and smooth, light grey bark on the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glaucous, egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, the same dull bluish to greyish green colour on both sides, with a blade that is usually long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with an operculum that is rounded to conical, long and usually has a few striations. The fruit are cup-shaped, cylindrical, hemispherical or conical, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus canescens was first formally described in 1998 by Dean Nicolle, and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (canescens) is a Latin word meaning \\"grey\\" or \\"hoary\\", referring to the grey general appearance of the type subspecies. Nicolle described two subspecies that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus canescens subsp. canescens, the Ooldea Range mallee, has its twigs, buds and fruit covered with a powdery white bloom, greyish leaves and more strongly ribbed fruit; * Eucalyptus canescens subsp. beadellii, Beadell's mallee, lacks the whitish bloom. The name beadellii commemorates the surveyor and explorer Len Beadell. Distribution and habitat Subspecies canescens grows on sand dunes or on sand plains in the southern part of the Great Victoria Desert from near Cook to near Maralinga in South Australia and extending into Western Australia. Subspecies beadellii is rare, only known from near the Cook-Vokes Hill track.

Physical disabilities account for about 50% of the total disabled population. In the past few decades, guided by the five-year plan, policies and services related to the disabled have been improved. The government has established several regional rehabilitation centres for people with disabilities and has provided and implemented rehabilitation programmes in their communities. The number of disabled people in Korea is also becoming more and more severe as the society ages. In that situation, Korean government is planning a stable welfare model to adapt to long-term changes. Demographics 13.9% of the disabled have their daily lives dependent on the help of others, and 82.4% of them are taken care of by their families. After increasing the number of disabled people's line management benefits in 2011, the use rate of care workers increased by 10.8%, compared with the previous one. The average monthly income of families with disabilities is about US$1,780 (2,000,000 won) and the average monthly expenditure is US$1,460 (1,620,000 won), which is about 54% of the average for all households in the country. According to statistics, 72% of the income of disabled people is used for medical related matters. Their unemployment rate is 7.8%, which is twice the total unemployment rate. And the wage level of disabled employees is 1,280 US dollars (1,420,000 won), which is only 54.6% of the national average wage (2,340 US dollars or 2,600,000 won).{ \\"version\\": 2, \\"width\\": 200, \\"height\\": 200, \\"data\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"table\\", \\"values\\": [ { \\"x\\": 0, \\"y\\": 320 }, { \\"x\\": 1, \\"y\\": 593 } ] } ], \\"scales\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"x\\", \\"type\\": \\"ordinal\\", \\"range\\": \\"width\\", \\"zero\\": false, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" } }, { \\"name\\": \\"y\\", \\"type\\": \\"linear\\", \\"range\\": \\"height\\", \\"nice\\": true, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" } } ], \\"axes\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"x\\", \\"scale\\": \\"x\\" }, { \\"type\\": \\"y\\", \\"scale\\": \\"y\\" } ], \\"marks\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"rect\\", \\"from\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\" }, \\"properties\\": { \\"enter\\": { \\"x\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" }, \\"y\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" }, \\"y2\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"value\\": 0 }, \\"fill\\": { \\"value\\": \\"steelblue\\" }, \\"width\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"band\\": \\"true\\", \\"offset\\": -1 } } } } ], \\"padding\\": { \\"top\\": 30, \\"bottom\\": 30, \\"left\\": 30, \\"right\\": 30 } } Before people began to change the status quo of the disabled, due to the conservative and homogenous nature of Korean society, people with disabilities did not receive equality and attention. The Korean government and social institutions also lacked long-term planning and effective support. In South Korea, the Employment Promotion Law for Persons with Disabilities requires employers with more than 300 employees to retain 2% of jobs for people with disabilities. However, only 0.91% of jobs in the company are disabled. Many employers are reluctant to hire people with disabilities. After statistics, there are only 11% of people with disabilities have personal computers, and 6.9% use the Internet, which limit them to accept information. In order to change the public's perception of people with disabilities, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) produced three special TV programs for the disabled.  Discrimination  With the efforts of people with disabilities and stakeholders, many people have begun to call attention to people with disabilities, telling the public what the real life of people with disabilities is, and showing them that people with disabilities can contribute to society. Many countries have also published anti-discrimination laws and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These changes have also occurred in South Korea. However, because of the rapid expansion of the material space and rights awareness of previously isolated, persons with disabilities will face various forms of conflict and discrimination in new interpersonal relationships. = Hansen's disease = More than half of people with Hansen's disease (leprosy) are accompanied by disability and change the appearance of the patient, which has been rejected and discriminated by most people in the twentieth century. In 2000, the word \\"leprosy\\" was replaced by \\"Hansen disease\\". On October 11, 2004, in Seoul, the Korean Bar Association hosted a forum to discuss the human rights of Hansen patients. Media reports At the forum, more than 101 more than 400 disabled people, who once had Hansen's disease, gathered together, known as the \\"Sea of Tears\\", expressed their experiences and called for special legislation to correct Extreme discrimination and the shame they suffer. = Sexual violence = Since 2001, ‚Äúwomen with disabilities do not want to be the target of sexual violence‚Äù is the slogan of the center for Sexual Violence against Women with Disabilities. T  Disability hierarchy and related issues  In South Korea, disabled people are divided into six levels. Index 1 indicates the most severe degree of disability, and index 6 indicates less serious. In this grading, people without disabilities mean no disability; mild disability means that the disability severity index is between 3 and 6; severely disabled means that the disability severity index is one or two. Mild disability includes people who can take care of themselves, even if some of them require personal support. Severe disabilities include those who are highly dependent on personal assistance or assistive devicesMOHW The Judgment Criteria for Rating Disability. Division of Policy for Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Health and Welfare, South Korea (2015) Retrieved from:http://www.bokjiro.go.kr/pension/p03.jsp. The reason for dividing people with disabilities into serious and minor is that not only do they have different medical needs, but also some benefits are determined by this definition of severity Trevor Palmer, an emeritus professor at the University of Sydney and a contributor to the 2011 World Disability Report, said: \\"From a government perspective, this sounds reasonable, but his fairness cannot be confirmed. The system is completely dependent on medicine, this is an act of oversimplifying disability.\\" In addition to hoping to abolish the classification system, activists also wish to repeal a law that grants them disability benefits based on the disability or the income of their relatives, which is very unfair to some low-income people. And these allowances are likely not to be used to care for the disabled. In South Korea, there are also people with disabilities who are severely disabled and whose relatives are unable to take care of them. They are housed in government-established institutions that currently house more than 30,000 people. They are barely exposed to other people in society in their daily lives. This is a permanent perception of their abnormality, and in institutions established specifically for the disabled, people with disabilities still cannot avoid human rights violations. But at least in these institutions that specialize in the disabled, the facilities they need are basically complete, and people with disabilities cannot get rid of such institutions. Because the outside world lacks infrastructure, housing, employment, and transportation are not enough to meet the needs of the disabled. Physical and mental needs. There are currently more than 4,000 people waiting on the list. About 70% of applicants are relatives of disabled people, so they can take care of the disabled at home without sacrificing all of their personal lives or work. 596x596px On September 5, 2017, under the efforts and persistence of many parties, the Korean disability classification system was finally cancelled. The activists ushered in a short-lived victory, at the same time, a protest was erupting in a district of Seoul, South Korea. Some parents of disabled people asked to establish a disabled school in the local area, while others felt that disabled schools would affect The reputation of this area and the price. Therefore, there is still a long way to go about the issue of disabled people.  Rehabilitation and treatment  Consistent with the ideas of many countries, South Korea has placed the disabled population in an essential position in our peaceful years.. Technology, economics and medical development have confirmed this shift, and many Koreans believe that the ability to transform people with disabilities through biomedical physics is part of society and can show their ability to cure people with disabilities, thereby strengthening the impression of other countries on Korea and establishing a national spirit To this end, the Korean government has developed and implemented a series of policies and programs aimed at improving the facilities for the disabled and increasing the subsidies for the disabled. The first plan was to achieve equal treatment of the people with disabilities from 1998 to 2002; to realize the welfare construction of disabled people from 2003 to 2007, such as targeted education and job opportunities; from 2008 to The third plan implemented in 2012 is to continue to develop social inclusion of persons with disabilities, eliminate discrimination, strengthen hardware facilities, and establish a welfare service system centered on persons with disabilities. After more than 10 years of continuous development, the concept and system of disabled people in Korea has been completely different from the original. Previously limited to physical barriers, now the obstacles caused by the brain, psychological disorders such as autism, surgery or plastic injury are also added to the damage barrier. National health insurance costs about $765 million in physical therapy equipment for disabled people and in the development of occupational therapy. The government has provided auxiliary equipment for low-income people with disabilities to improve their self-care ability, such as prosthetics and wheelchairs. After 1997, these equipments were also widely added to welfare protection. The household items covered are TV subtitles, audio watches) and rehabilitation products such as acne prevention pads and orthopedic shoes. The most commonly used crutches for disabled people with physical disabilities and brain lesions, the use rate of electric wheelchairs increased by 22.3% and 6.9% respectively, 74.3% of deaf people have hearing aids, and more and more language the people with disabilities use artificial larynx, the patient who has the kidney disease uses a dialyzer.

Kant's writing on teleology is contained in the second part of the Critique of Judgment which was published in 1790. The Critique of Judgment is divided into two parts with the first part Critique of Aesthetic Judgement and the second being Critique of Teleological Judgement. Within the first part Kant discusses and presents his ideas on aesthetics and within the second part Kant discusses how teleology has a role in our understanding of natural systems and the natural sciences. Kant's moral philosophy is also concerned with ends but only in relation to humans, where he considers it to be wrong to use an individual merely as means. The Critique of Teleology is concerned with ends in nature and so this discussion of ends is broader than in Kant's moral philosophy. Kant's most remarkable claims within his description of natural teleology are that organisms must be regarded by human beings as ‚Äúnatural purposes‚Äù in the Analytic of Teleological Judgement and his arguments for how to reconcile his teleological idea of organisms with a mechanistic view of nature in Dialectic of Teleological Judgement. Kant's claims about teleology have influenced both contemporary biology and the philosophy of biology. Purposiveness  Kant gives his first definition of an end in Critique of Aesthetic Judgement: ‚Äúan end is the object of a concept [i.e. an object that falls under a concept] insofar as the latter [the concept] is regarded as the cause of the former [the object] (the real ground of its possibility).‚Äù(¬ß10/220/105). Kant characterises an end as a one place predicate where if an object is intentionally produced by an agent then that object may be considered an end. For Kant an object is an end, if and only if, the concept which that object falls under is also the cause of that object. In the Critique of Teleological Judgement when speaking of ends Kant describes causes ‚Äúwhose productive capacity is determined by concepts‚Äù, so the concept of an object determines the causality of the cause. This idea of causes leads to a more complicated definition of an end which is different to Kant's previous claims in the Critique of Teleological Judgement about the definition of an end. The concept of an object determines the causality of the cause as when an individual creates an object then the movement of that individual's arms in a particular way causes that object, but the movement of the individual's arms is determined by the individual's concept of the object. Beisbart uses this above example to show how the concept and cause of the object are related under this definition of purposiveness.  Natural purposes  Kant presents the idea of a natural purpose in the Analytic of Teleological Judgment, where he argues that organisms such as plants and animal constitute a natural purpose and that they are the only natural things which do so. Kant characterises organisms as natural purposes through his definition of an ends claiming, ‚Äúa thing exists as a natural end if it is the cause and effect of itself (in a twofold sense)‚Äù. To support this initial claim of natural ends Kant illustrates it through an example. A tree may be thought of as a natural end through three terms, (i) it originates from a tree of the same species, (ii) the tree grows from receiving alien material and (iii) the parts of the tree contribute to the function of the whole. Organisms display a reciprocity between part and whole which constitutes that organism as an end as the parts of an organism contribute to the function of the whole organism. As the character of the whole determines both the structure and the function of the parts Kant takes this relationship to mean that the tree is the cause of itself. Kant's initial definition of ends in ¬ß10 implies that the archetype of purposiveness is human creation as an end arises from a creator's concept which the individual planned to produce; the end is a result of a design. One issue with Kant's characterisation of natural purposes which was addressed by him in the Critique of Teleological Judgment and in the contemporary literature is how an organism may be both natural and an end when purposiveness is derived from design. Kreines (2005) notes that the characterisation of natural purposes also applies to artefacts. Watches have parts as well which contribute to both the structure and the function of the whole watch and therefore this causal relationship between the parts and the whole in organisms is also present in artefacts. The coherence of a natural purpose is illusory without reconciling the natural characteristic of organisms with their purposiveness, so Kant provides a second qualification as to what signifies a natural purpose so ‚Äúthe parts of thing‚Ä¶ are reciprocally cause and effect of their from‚Äù. This qualification is not met by artefacts as the parts of watch are not necessary for maintaining the other parts of said watch and are not produced by other parts of the watch. Ginsborg (2001) attempts to resolve this issue in a different way to Kant by interpreting Kant's idea of purposiveness from a normative standpoint. so, when we regard something as a purpose, we claim that there is a specific way it ought to be. This normative distinction separates the idea of purposiveness from its prima facie requirement of a designer. We regard organs such as eyes to be purposes because they ought to be structured in a way which makes it possible for the organism to see. Artefacts such as rocks however are not regarded as purposes because there is no way in which we could say they ought to be. Rocks do serve purposes but not in this normative sense, for example they may be used to build houses, yet it is arbitrary to say they ought to be structured in a way in which allows them to build houses.  Mechanism and teleology  In the Analytic Kant goes on to claim that the production of organisms is unable to be explained through a mechanical explanation and instead must be understood in teleological terms. Kant declares that it is ‚Äúabsurd for human beings‚Ä¶to hope that there may yet arise a Newton who could make conceivable even so much as the production of a blade of grass according to natural laws which no intention has ordered‚Äù (¬ß75, 400), the fact that production of organisms cannot be explained in mechanical terms leads to a conflict which Kant calls ‚Äúthe antinomy of judgement‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe antinomy of judgement‚Äù refers to the conflict between nature and natural objects with no mechanical explanation. We must aim to explain everything in nature in mechanical terms through scientific inquiry and yet some objects cannot be explained mechanically and should thus be explained in teleological terms. Furthermore, as purposiveness may not be sufficiently explained through mechanisms in nature then there is an essential feature which exists for natural objects which cannot be accounted by these natural laws. For example, during the ontogenetic process, the laws of physics determine the production of either a normal chick or an abnormal chick. From this viewpoint however as they both arise from the laws of physics there is nothing inherently special about the normal chick and hence the idea that the embryological process should lead to the production of a normal chick is arbitrary from this viewpoint. Kant solution to \\"the antinomy of judgement\\" consists of the claim that the principle by which we should explain everything in mechanical terms and the principle that natural objects resist explanation in mechanical terms are both \\"regulative‚Äù and not \\"constitutive\\". What he means by this claim is that the principles only explain how we should investigate nature and they do not explain the true character of nature.  Teleology of nature as a whole  Through reflecting on organisms as purposes Kant claims that we are led beyond this topic and thus reflect on nature as a whole. Though teleological judgements are catalysed by our experience of organism the scope of teleological judgements is not limited to organisms but may rather be extended to nature as a whole including organic artefacts. Kant makes two claims regarding the teleology of nature as a whole, first that everything in nature has a purpose and second that nature itself is a system of purposes which also has a purpose. Nature presents itself with cases where features of an organism's environment, both organic and inorganic are both necessary and beneficial for that organism. Rivers are necessary for grass to grow and thus they are indirectly helpful for humans as they produce fertile land. Grass is necessary for agriculture which in turn provides food for carnivores through farming cattle. Kant provides a negative argument as to how we may account for this system without appealing to purposes. The origin of a river may be determined mechanically, and even though grass is regarded as a purpose due to its relation to itself, we do not have to determine its relative helpfulness to other living things in order to comprehend it. Kant does however reason that these natural objects, such as rivers, rocks and beaches do have a purpose in a relative sense. They have a purpose in a relative sense as long as they contribute towards the existence of a living thing which has an internal purpose. These relative purposes provide the condition by which it is possible for nature to be a system of purposes where all organisms and natural objects are connected teleologically through relative purposiveness. The teleological idea of this system of purposes leads to both the idea of the ultimate purpose [letzter Zweck] of nature and the idea of the final purpose [Endzweck] of nature. The former pertaining to the idea of the existence of something within nature which all other things exist for its sake, with the latter being the idea that something exists outside of nature for which nature exists for its sake. Human experience does not lend itself to identify what the ultimate or final purpose may be, yet Kant argues that the final purpose can only be man as a moral agent.  Influences of Kant's teleology on biology  Kant's teleology has influenced contemporary biological thought, particularly with scientists use of functional language in their characterisation of organism's parts and biological processes. Kant's writing on teleology has impacted contemporary biology as he addressed the problem of how it is possible for organisms to have functions and for biological purposes to exist without the presupposition of a divine designer existing. One particular example of a contemporary biologist influenced by Kant's ideas may be seen in Roth(2014). The anti reductionist approach proposed by Kant, that organisms cannot be understood as composed of pre-existing parts, Roth(2014) argues that this approach may be used as a model for contemporary biology. Furthermore, Walsh(2006) argues that Kant's characterisation of organisms as \\"natural purposes\\" ought to play a vital role in explaining ontogenetic development and adaptive evolution. As well as arguing against Kant's theory that natural purposiveness is not revealed through an objective principle of nature rather saying that purposiveness of organisms is a natural phenomenon through appealing to recent biological studies in self-organization. Walsh(2006) however believes that Kant's idea of organisms being natural purposes provides biological explanations.

Research is conducted using a variety of different microscopy techniques, primarily Atomic Force Microscopy methods. He hopes to make analyses of condensed phase nano materials as common as analyses using optical microscopy techniques. The lab has used these microscopy techniques primarily for the study of voltaic and ionic transport materials such as those used in batteries. Microscopy is also useful for studying nanoscale properties of organic photovoltaic systems such as injection, transport, and trapping. Ginger's group at the University of Washington has unique imaging capabilities that are used to better understand the electronic geometry and charge mechanics of semiconducting materials to create theory based products. = Solar energy and electronic materials = One focus of Ginger's career has been the development of more efficient and effective methods of solar energy capture. Ginger's group has developed of thin film semiconductors that are sturdier and less expensive to manufacture than traditional silicon solar panels. The development of these semi conductors that can be cast onto flexible surfaces has opened a wide range of possibilities of future applications.

They have also developed nano-materials that can be optically activated through isomerization of the DNA spacers between the particles. The conversion between the cis and trans forms of the DNA strand either allows or inhibits bonding between DNA strands. Coupled with the high specificity characteristic of DNA molecules, this allows for the structure and size of nanoparticles to be closely controlled with light. The long term goal of this research is to develop a method of controlled materials assembly, but DNA's high degradation tendency limits practical applications. Ginger's lab is interested in controlling the orientation of particles in photo-voltaic cells which may make it possible to reach maximum theoretical efficiency: Ginger stated that in order to create an interface between biology and electronics, new materials must be created to merge the gap.

It is not only a feudal system in the Middle Age, but also a representative of the civil law system. France is committed to the judicial system which was gradually established after the Revolution of French in the late 18th century.Simon Schama ‚Äì Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution. Penguin, [1989] 2004. p. 442 From beginning of the 19th century to nowadays, Napoleon codified a series of significant rules and established the common court system, administrative court system as well as independent judicial system which formed a unified modern judicial system.  Judicial organization  = Cour de Cassation = The presence of the Highest Court in France. The French Cour de Cassation works as the final court of appeal for civil and criminal cases. As a judicial court, it cannot hear those cases including protesting against the government. Such cases usually fall within the scope of the administrative court, and the State Council Acts as Highest Court of appeal. The court was founded in the Tribunal de cassation in 1790 during the Revolution in France, which was built to have a review court which was used to amend the jurisdiction of the lower- level local privileged court.Judicial Organization in France, 33 Can. L. Times 565 (1913) The court is made up of a judge, the Prosecutor's office and the Administrative Office of Courts. The judge of Cour de Cassation is composed of premier president, first presidents of the chambers, justice conseillers and assistant judge conseillers referendaries.Ministry of Justice (2012), The French legal system. Minist√®re de la Justice. Retrieved from http://www.justice.gouv.fr/art_pix/french_legal_system.pdf Judges shall be appointed by the President of the Republic on the recommendations of the high judicial council. The chief justice works as the highest judicial officer and shall be responsible for the court's executive branch as well as the discipline of the judges. = Tribunal de police = The tribunal de police consists of a single judge but the court is constituted by a prosecutor and a recording officer. Generally, there are five categories that violate the rules. The tribunal de police hear class five contraventions separately from one to four contraventions, with the fine ranging from 250 francs to 10,000 francs.\\"Police Court Justice in France: Investigations and Hearing in Ten Cases in the Tribunal de Police\\" In addition, after the trial of the tribunal de police, provided that the suspect refuses to accept the judgements of the court, the suspect can appeal to French Cour d' Appeal. = Tribunal correctionnel = The tribunal correctionnel performs the duty as a court which addresses ordinary criminal cases and usually hears the crimes which ranges from two months to five years in prison or more than the fine of 10,000 francs.Donovan, J. (2010). Studies in Legal History: Juries and the Transformation of Criminal Justice in France in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. University of North Carolina Press. The tribunal correctionnel is set upin the provincial capital of each province. Furthermore, those densely populated provinces are permitted to locate more than one tribunal correctionnel independently. The court usually comprises three judges and one recorder. Since 1973, the case of the accused's consent hasbeen permitted to beheard by the judge alone. = Cour d' Assise = Cour d‚Äô Assises, which shoulders the responsibility of handling major criminal cases, usually hears cases of five years or more imprisonment, hard labor or death penalty. Cour d‚ÄôAssise, which is located in the provincial capital of each province, whose name is based on the name of the province. The court exercises jurisdiction within the range of the province. In accordance to the French Criminal Procedure Law, the composition of Cour d‚Äô Assise in made up of the court as well as the jury. The courts implement the judge on the basis of the Court of Appeal or the First Instance, which consists of three judges and nine jurors.Perroud, J. ‚ÄúTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE COURTS AND THE JUDICIAL BENCH IN FRANCE.‚Äù Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law11.1 (1929): 1‚Äì18. Web. Cour d' Assise, the only court in France that has a jury for a criminal case, harbors the combined composition of professional judge and non- professional juror. It is worth mentioning that it represents one of the biggest differences between tribunal de police and tribunal correctionnel. Moreover, the judgement made by Cour d' Assise cannot be appealed.  Criminal justice system  = History = From the late Middle Ages to the early Renaissance, the earliest commence of in modern French criminal law were marked by the Templar trial which took place in the early 1300s as well as the trial of Jeanne d' Arc over a hundred years later. Although the former was an instant medieval legal trial, obviously, the medieval-nowadays evolution of modern law was reflected in the latter's proceedings. In addition, France was witnessing an evolution in its criminal justice system, which was responded with a string of jury trials from the French Revolution to the 20th Century, with the overall inquisitorial commitments of the Ecclesiastical Courts of the 13th Century. Under this criminal justice system, individuals are in fact deprived of their rights and can be put into uninformed investigation or even being subjected to cruel torture and interrogation. As a result, since the late 18th century, the criticism on this inquisitorial system has been increasingly growing fiercely intensified. After the French Revolution in 1789 the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen established principles that would become significant for later legal developments. Eventually, 1808 witnessed the establishment of the Code of criminal procedure in the litigation mode of separated prosecution and trial. After the end of World War II, the judicial committee brought out the amended version of the criminal procedure code, thus bringing the procedure into judicature.Wheatcroft, Andrew (1999). The Road to War (2nd ed.). London: Penguin Books. . pp. 328‚Äì30 = Criminal law = France's criminal law is featured by its concept structure instead of its result. Distinguishing itself from some aspects of civil as well as public law, it is structured with rooted middle age in royal law but is now heavily influenced by international criminal and criminological trends, without being struck by sharp-cut influence by Roman law. The innovation of the penal code in 1994 made it possible to gain a modernized and systemized treatment to the corresponding issues. However, the revolution and Napoleonic history still exert a strongly far-reaching impact. The principle of legality requires that in France crimes should be made by loi. 13 supervision has been accepted as a legitimate source of supervision for violations, even if they lead to imprisonment. But laws and crimes must be the product of regulations.Bell, J. (2008). Criminal Law. Principles of French Law, 201-240. doi: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199541393.003.0008 In addition, courts have issued notices immediately which are opposed to the enactment of criminal offences, even if they are merely supervisory offences.  The criminal proceedings  French criminal law provides for three classes of crimes including felony, misdemeanor and petty offense. The criminal procedure in France is regarded as mainly inquisitorial. And the operational process of French criminal justice is divided into three stages of pre-trial, trial and post-trial. The first procedure in the process of prosecuting a criminal for most crimes is an investigation by a pretrial judge. Different procedures are provided for the prosecution of each class of offense. = Before Trial = Before trial, a preliminary investigation conducted by a pretrial judge is a routine part of the judicial process. It transfers the case to the highly competent court on the basis of a reasonable estimation of what the accused criminals may be convicted of in the future. The criminal procedure in France requires early intervention by examing magistrate.Code de procedure penale, article 79. In most common law jurisdictions, any offence, except the most trivial, is tried by the same court Cases can be initiated in two ways. If a petition is filed with a civil claim, the magistrate has the right to proceed with the investigation. If no claim for damages is provided against the complaint, it must be transferred to the local prosecutor. If the prosecutor determines to pursue the matter, the pretrial judge will be notified.Ibid, Art 80. Besides, the jurisdiction of the investigation is based on the initial application. Once the investigation has begun, the magistrate is free to investigate any violations related to the application and may proceed to further inquiry any person who may be involved.Ibid, Art 86. Persons who are ordered to appear and offer evidence must do so. Any refusal to appear before the court is deemed as punishable by contempt of court. It is not necessary for the person being investigated to take an oath like other witnesses, on the premise of the person who has been investigated is capable of calling a lawyer for assistance. Witnesses other than the civil claimant cannot acquire the assistance of a lawyer unless they are advised to accept the investigation. In such cases, the trial judge must warn the witnesses in advance.Kock, G. (1960). Criminal Proceedings in France. The American Journal of Comparative Law, 9(2), 253-262. doi: 10.2307/837194 As for the criminal proceedings, they shall be conducted in writing or made into a written record immediately afterwards, instead of presenting to public and likewise they are not adversary in form except in the extremely limited circumstances.Ibid, Art 104,105. If the pretrial judge determines that the case should be prosecuted, the judge will make an order for transfer.Ibid, Art 178. And the following parts will be several various methods for addressing criminal behaviors. If the offence is regarded as a petty offense, the case will be referred to the police court. If it is deemed as a misdemeanor, it will be transferred to the appropriate lower court for trial. If the case involves a felony, it must first be referred to the district court of appeal for prosecution rather than directly to the court.Ibid, Art 213. = The Trial Court = The court for tribunal de police is composed of one judge and hears the same case as for misdemeanors.Ibid, Art 544. Cases can be referred to such courts in several aspects. In the first place, when both the offender and the complainant appear voluntarily, it is possible that the case will be concluded in a quick manner. And the other is a complaint raised by the victim or the district attorney, which is the most common formula. After the court receives the complaint, it issues a direct summons order, which will be delivered to the defendant or the defendant's residence by the bailiff of the court. The defendant must be provided a time limit of not less than five days to appear in court.Ibid, Art 178,180. For misdemeanors and police offences, the judge may conduct a final judgment in court. The procedure of a felony is much more complicated than that of a misdemeanor. The felony court administers all cases referred to it by the district court of appeal, and hears merely such cases. The felony court is an institution peculiar to the French legal system. The jury as one of its constituent parts, holds a meeting quarterly, and the judgment of the felony court will not be appealed to the court of appeal. Once a final order for a trial is released, the defendant should be transferred to the prison where the felony court is located. Besides, any conviction must be upheld and supported by at least five members of the nine jurors.Ibid, Art 362. If the results of vote agree with the conviction, the judge will immediately vote on the sentence. The method of conviction is carried out based on the secret ballot in which each person proposes a penalty which must be imposed by a majority vote. Moreover, the approach of consecutive votes must be taken and performed until a penalty is confirmed. From the third round of voting, the most severe penalty was removed one by one from the proposed candidates.Ibid, Art 362.  French Juvenile criminal justice system  = The period of Paternal Power = Until the 1789 revolution, the law conducted recognition about three age groups of children defined in Latin: infans (ages 0 to 7), proximus infanti (ages 7 to 10) and proximus pubertati (ages 10 to 14).Blatier, C. ‚ÄúJuvenile Justice in France. The Evolution of Sentencing for Children and Minor Delinquents.‚Äù British Journal of Criminology 39.2 (1999): 240‚Äì252. Web. For each age group, judges acted the way they considered as appropriate, and were free to reach great extremes in both punishment and forgiveness. And it was common to perform deliberate imprisonment of children by parents until the end of the seventeenth century. In addition, although criminal sentences are in principle no harsher for adolescents than for adults, the penal code allows for the implementation of life imprisonment, deportation and even the death penalty for children under the age of 7. During the period of the governance of Napoleon, fathers had the right to require civil courts to imprison their children for up to one month. Additionally for older children, the magistrate of the court owns the power to determine the time limit of imprisonment, but the maximum term is one month.Catta, E (1988), A quoi tu juges? Paris: Flammarion. According to the law in 1804, any father who was dissatisfied with the conduct of his child could petition the court of superior supervision to imprison the child. However, these laws also gradually began to restrict parents' right from implementing corporal punishment. = Juvenile criminal proceedings = The purpose of establishing Juvenile court aims at the particularity of juvenile crime. In 1945, the basic criminal policy against crimes committed by minors was formulated, and special juvenile judges and juvenile courts were established respectively. Cases of minor offences against the first four grades of police offences are still addressed before the police courts, while cases against the fifth grade of police offences, misdemeanors and felonies are required to be tackled under the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts. The system includes several parts of juvenile judges, juvenile courts, appellate courts and juvenile felony courts.CODE PENAL [C. PEN.] art. 45-174 (1945) (Fr.). These courts are presided by one juvenile court judge with two assistants of two lay judges and one court clerk. By virtues of the referral of a juvenile judge or pretrial judge, the juvenile court hears felony cases committed by minors under the age of 16 and misdemeanors committed by minors under the age of 18. The juvenile court may order for adopting measures of protection, assistance, supervision and education for all minors, and take educational sanctions against those minors over 10 years of age. Furthermore, minors who are at the age of 13 to 16 can be sentenced. However minors can only afford half of the sentences prescribed by adults. And they cannot be remanded unless they have committed a serious crime. In terms of the judicial structure, the juvenile felony court shares the same construction system as the common felony court, which is composed of 3 professional judges and 9 jurors. The juvenile felony court hears felonies committed by minors between the ages of 16 and 18.\\"Ordonnance n¬∞ 45-174 du 2 f√©vrier 1945 relative √† l'enfance d√©linquante. - Legifrance\\". www.legifrance.gouv.fr.

Wiley was known for her 7am walking tours and natural science field trips of Central Park and Greater New York, and was an author, illustrator, teacher and historian.  Early life  Wiley was born in Orange Township, Shelby County, Ohio in 1889. According to county records of the time, Wiley's parents bred percheron horses, requiring them to visit France. Percheron breeders in 19th century Ohio preferred to bring back horses from La Perche to maintain the genetic purity of their lines. While there are no official historical records documenting the Wiley family travels, given their line of work and horse husbandry trends, it is almost certain they visited France on at least a few occasions. Farida was a unique name in the Midwest, and can be speculated it derived from one of the famous alm√©es, Farida Mazhar, of the Exposition Universelle. Mazhar rose to fame in 1889, but was also a minor participant in The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, where she was noticed by American audiences. Wiley had an older sister named Bessie, with whom she moved to New York City after the death of her parents and Bessie's subsequent marriage.  Career  Wiley was known as a self-made expert having received only a high school diploma. Her first job in New York City was as a part-time botany teacher for blind children at the Museum of Natural History. Apart from teaching children, Wiley led 7am tours in and around New York City. Her focus was on local birds, plants and animals. These outings were frequented by upper-middle class women, mainly housewives, and cost between fifty cents and a dollar to attend. In the summer, Wiley conducted botany courses at the Audubon camp in Damariscotta, Maine. These courses were also frequented by holidaying New Yorkers, with women comprising the majority of her field study classes. Wiley continued to have an illustrious career at the American Museum of Natural History. By 1936, she had risen to become the Director of Field Courses in Natural History and the Director of Nature Study Courses for City Teachers. In 1948, she became the Director of Field and Laboratory Courses in Natural Science. At the time, the museum was the center of natural science education and outreach, a role that has since been taken over by academic institutions. Wiley's role, therefore, was pivotal both in an educational and curatorial standpoint. Outside of her work at the American Museum of Natural History, Wiley authored a field guide in 1936, Ferns of Northeastern United States, which she co-illustrated. She described the pocket handbook as one that could be \\"conveniently carried on jaunts in the field.\\" The book contained all known species of ferns at the time, with detailed remarks on those that were commonly confused. While many of the specimens were studied in the wild, likely on her summer trips, Wiley also took help from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York City Botanical Gardens. By popular demand, the guide printed a second edition in 1948, with an addendum about fern cross- sectional patterns. Both editions of Ferns were indexed using Linnaean taxonomy and observational characteristics, displaying Wiley's technical and descriptive prowess. In 1955, Wiley edited Theodore Roosevelt's America: Selections From the Writings of the Oyster Bay Naturalist. Wiley had met Roosevelt once as a child, writing in her introduction \\"let us all remember with grateful thanks what is probably his greatest Presidential gift to us; millions of acres set aside for the conservation of our natural resources and the ideas engendered in the minds of out people that wise use of natural resources is a necessity for natural survival\\" Wiley invited Ethel Roosevelt Derby, Theodore Roosevelt's youngest daughter, and her personal friend, to write the foreword. The book was approved by the Roosevelt family and trust, with other American naturalists and essayists, such as Ambrose Flack, John Burroughs, Gifford Pinchot and Henry Fairfield penning essays for the project. By this time, Wiley was a Senior Director at the Museum, and had the connections to make such an undertaking possible.  Legacy  Wiley was known for her prominent role as an educator. In 1953, she was awarded The American Museum of Natural History's Silver Medal, for over 50 years as a naturalist and teacher. She was in her eighties before she retired, working at the museum, retiring as an Honorary Associate in Natural Science Education. Despite being a skilled naturalist with an immense body of knowledge, Wiley commented \\"Most women don‚Äôt have the strength or endurance for [expeditions]. But then, I myself never wanted to discover something. I‚Äôve gotten my satisfaction from learning what others have discovered and teaching it\\". Self- effacing, Wiley mirrored the behaviors of many other 20th century female scientists. Other female museum directors, including Mary Louisa Duncan Putnam of the Davenport, Iowa Academy of Natural Sciences took a back seat when it came it came to claiming scientific aptitude. Margaret Rossiter attributes this systemic behavior in part to the patriarchal academic society of the day. During Wiley's tenure at the American Museum of Natural History, the title of ‚Äúscientist‚Äù was largely connected to doctorates, publications, and decades of instructional experience at a university. A middle-aged woman like Wiley may have found the bureaucratic and imposing world of academia tedious, and focused her efforts on public outreach, bringing many women, who otherwise would not have possessed the tools to understand the life sciences, into the fold.

Gregory (1913 - 1976) was an American collector of folk art. Gregory was descended from a family which had lived in Wilton, Connecticut, for many generations. His interest in collecting antiques was sparked by his 1944 purchase of a Guarneri cello. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1936, graduating from Harvard Law School in 1939. By trade he worked in the field of pharmaceuticals, retiring at the age of fifty. In building his collection, Gregory worked closely with Mary Allis, from whom he purchased numerous pieces; he also purchase work from Adele Earnest; the Earnest-Gregory Dovetailed Goose, a decoy which both collectors owned, now bears their name. Eventually his collection came to contain, in addition to decoys, weathervanes, hooked rugs, tinware, watercolors, and other items, among them portraits by John Brewster Jr., Erastus Salisbury Field, and Ammi Phillips. Chairman of the Wilton Historical Society, Gregory converted an eighteenth-century barn into a home where he could show off his pieces. He also collected memorabilia related to the American Civil War. A vice president and trustee of the American Folk Art Museum from 1964, in 1972 the museum exhibited his collection in the exhibit \\"An Eye on America: Folk Art from the Stewart E. Gregory Collection\\". After his death, in 1979, Gregory's collection was dispersed at auction, a moment that has been called a watershed in the field of American folk art collecting because of the prices realized and the interest engendered. Many of his pieces are currently in major American museum collections.

It contains the type and only known species T. imperforatus. Thliptosaurus is from the upper Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone, making it one of the youngest Permian dicynodonts known, living just prior to the Permian mass extinction. It also represents one of the few small bodied dicynodonts to exist at this time, when most other dicynodonts had large body sizes and many small dicynodonts (such as Diictodon) had gone extinct. The unexpected discovery of Thliptosaurus in a region of the Karoo outside of the historically sampled localities suggests that it may have been part of an endemic local fauna not found in these historic sites. Such under-sampled localities may contain 'hidden diversities' of Permian faunas that are unknown from traditional samples. Thliptosaurus is also unusual for dicynodonts as it lacks a pineal foramen, suggesting that it played a much less important role in thermoregulation than it did for other dicynodonts. While the name literally translates to \\"compressed lizard\\", referring to the severely crushed and flattened skull of the only known specimen, it also alludes to the Biblical thlipsis, a time of tribulation and hardship preceding the End Times, alluding to the existence of Thliptosaurus just before the mass extinction at the end of the Permian, also known as the Great Dying. Description Thliptosaurus was a small dicynodont (skull length of only long), but it displays several characteristics indicative of maturity in dicynodonts. Only the skull is known, but like other related dicynodonts it would have been a squat, sprawling quadruped with a short tail and a large head with a tortoise- like beak. Thliptosaurus appears completely toothless, lacking even in the distinctive tusks found in some other dicynodonts (including the closely related Dicynodontoides), although teeth may be obscured by the lower jaw if they are present. The post cranial skeleton is unknown, but probably resembled that of other kingoriids, such as Kombuisia. Skull of Thliptosaurus viewed from underneath (ventrally), showing the palate. =Skull= The skull of Thliptosaurus is fairly typical for dicynodonts, being broad at the back with very large temporal fenestrae, with a much shorter snout that gently tapers to a blunt point. The nostrils aren't visible on the specimen, meaning they must have been placed on the very front of the snout facing forwards, and not on the sides. The tuskless caniniform process of the maxilla is prominent and sits well forward of the eyes. The front margin of the caniniform process is long and slopes gently downwards from the front, while the back margin rises steeply up to meet with the zygomatic arch below the eyes. The caniniform process is similar to that of Dicynodontoides, but is lacking the tusks found in that genus. No other teeth are visible on the specimen, but as much of the maxilla is covered by the lower jaw it is impossible to be sure. The nasal bones sport three prominent well-pitted bosses with a rough, rugose texture. These bosses resemble those of Dicynodontoides, with two flaring laterally over the front of the snout, split by the single fused premaxilla, and meeting with a third medial boss behind them. The intertemporal region, or bar, is unusually wide for a kingoriid, composed of the broad frontal bones in the front and the flat exposed parietal bones behind them, each contacting with the single preparietal (a unique bone found in dicynodonts and some other therapsids) just behind the eyes. Very unusually for a dicynodont, Thliptosaurus has no visible pineal foramen, and the suture between the parietals appears uninterrupted for their whole length. Even if the parietal foramen existed and was obscured by deformation during fossilisation, it would had to have existed as a very thin slit between the parietals that did not contact the preparietal, which itself would be a highly unusual condition for a dicynodont. However, comparisons with other kingoriids indicate that the absence of the pineal foramen is likely a genuine feature. Unfortunately, the palate is mostly obscured by the tightly occluded lower jaw, leaving only the pterygoids and the basicranium (the part of the skull underneath the braincase) readily visible. The pterygoids are relatively long and narrow, and straight for much of their length like those of Compsodon and Dicynodontoides. The two pterygoids meet at a median pterygoid plate positioned relatively far back on the skull, which also results in the rami that contact the quadrate being angled at approximately 60 degrees to the skull's long axis. The occiput is poorly preserved and few details can be discerned, but the overall structure appears typical for dicynodonts, as is the basicranium. =Mandible= Thliptosaurus skull with diagram isolating the mandible. The mandibular symphysis of the dentaries is long, creating a long, flattened shovel-like beak tip. The rest of the jaws is otherwise roughly v-shaped, as is typical for dicynodonts. The dentary has a tall plate on its sides that obscures the external mandibular fenestra, an unusual condition amongst dicynodonts. The coronoid process (a site for jaw muscle attachment) is unusually short compared to that of other kingoriids. The dentary also has a short horizontal shelf about halfway up its side, representing a greatly reduced lateral dentary shelf (a site of attachment for the external lateral adductor, an important jaw muscle in dicynodont feeding). The reflected lamina of the angular is relatively short, surrounded by a concave lateral exposure on each side. The articular has a curved, convex upper surface that contacts the condyles of the quadrate and extends beyond them, facilitating palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaw, typical of dicynodonts. =Ontogeny= The small size of Thliptosaurus, combined with the taphonomic distortion and ontogenetic variability of some of its characteristic traits raised the possibility that the only known specimen of Thliptosaurus actually represented the juvenile of an unknown larger bodied animal, possibly even that of the contemporaneous kingoriid Dicynodontoides. However, three traits typical of mature, fully grown dicynodonts were identified in the specimen. The snout is well ossified and fused together, with none of the irregular sutures observed in the juveniles of larger dicynodont species. There is no sign of a postfrontal bone, which is interpreted as fusing with the postorbital bone during ontogeny in other dicynodonts. Thirdly, the preparietal is small relative to the size of skull, unlike the large preparietal found in juvenile dicynodonts. These traits indicate that the holotype of Thliptosaurus is not a juvenile of a larger taxon, despite its small size, and represents a mature, small bodied dicynodont. History of discovery Skull of Thliptosaurus in lateral views highlighting the severity of the dorsoventral crushing. The holotype and only known specimen of Thliptosaurus, BP/1/2796, was discovered and collected by palaeontologist James Kitching in September, 1958 on an expedition at Stoffelton in western KwaZulu-Natal, near the town of Bulwer. This site records exposures of the Permian Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone (AZ) and Triassic Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone across the Permo-Triassic boundary, and while of scientific importance has been relatively unexplored and under- sampled compared to more historically recognised localities in the Karoo Basin. Indeed, much of the specimens from this site were collected by Kitching himself, and many of them remain as yet unprepared and unstudied. The fossil can be recognised as belonging to the Permian Daptocephalus AZ by the light grey colour of the fossil bones and grey siltstone matrix surrounding them (contrasted with the yellow bones and red matrix of Triassic fossils). The specimen was not described until 2019 by palaeontologist Christian Kammerer, who diagnosed it as its own new distinct genus of dicynodont. The holotype is held in the collections of the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg in South Africa. Thliptosaurus skull viewed from behind, clearly showing the areas reconstructed with plaster. The single skull of Thliptosaurus is nearly complete, but it has been severely crushed and flattened from top-to-bottom (dorsoventrally), and some broken areas of bone at the back of the skull have been restored using plaster. Details and sutures on the top of the skull are readily visible, but poor preservation and over-preparation have obliterated features on the sides and rear of the skull. The lower jaw is firmly occluded to the upper jaw, obscuring some details of the sides of the skull and many of the palate. The generic name is from the Ancient Greek Œ∏Œª·øñœàŒπœÇ (thlipsis) and œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (saurus), literally translated to mean \\"compressed lizard\\", referring to the flattened nature of the skull from being severely dorsoventrally compressed during fossilisation. The name also alludes to the Biblical thlipsis, the name given to a period of great tribulations accompanying the End Times, as a play on the taxon's existence just before the Permian mass extinction, also known as the Great Dying. The specific name is from the Latin imperforatus, meaning \\"unpunctured\\", referring to the greatly reduced pineal foramen in the roof of the skull, if it is not entirely absent altogether. Classification Thliptosaurus was found to be a member of the clade Emydopoidea in the family Kingoriidae, closely related to the genera Kombuisia and Dicynodontoides. Thliptosaurus shares with other kingoriids a dentary plate that occludes and obscures the mandibular fenestra, an arcing anterior process of the lacrimal that contacts the nasal, cutting off the maxilla from contacting the prefrontal bone, and an absence of the postfrontal bone (also shared with other kistecephalians). It shares an extremely reduced pineal foramen with the kingoriid Kombuisia frerensis and cistecephalid Kawingasaurus. However, it is distinguished from these genera by having a moderately broad intertemporal bar, intermediate in width between that of Kombuisia and Kawingasaurus. The intertemporal bar also has broad, flat exposures of the parietals, a primitive trait for dicynodonts but that has been lost in other kingoriids. A phylogenetic analysis using the latest iteration of the data matrix from Kammerer (2018),. itself modified from Angielcyzk & Kammerer (2017), agreed with this interpretation. A simplified excerpt of the consensus tree from this analysis, focused in on the relationships of Emydopoidea, is shown in the cladogram below: Comparison of the skulls of Thliptosaurus (top left) to other kingoriids Kombuisia (top right) and Dicynodontoides (bottom row). Kammerer noted that the recovery of Myosaurus as the sister taxon to Kingoriidae was unusual, as it is usually recovered as a close relative of Cistecephalus. However, the support for this relationship was low, and so he did not regard this result with much significance. Similarly, the analysis recovered an 'expansive Endothiodontia', including several taxa not normally recovered in this clade, such as Pristerodon and Endothiodontidae, as successive outgroups to Emdyopoidea, but the support for this was also low. Otherwise, the analysis recovered a generally similar topology to other recent analyses of this data matrix. =Taxonomic distinction= The small, crushed nature of the sole specimen of Thliptosaurus raised the possibility that it may belong to an existing genus, and the seemingly unique features are just taphonomic. The skull of Thliptosaurus was compared to similarly sized and crushed specimens of the other kingoriids Kombuisia and Dicynodontoides, the latter of which co- existed with Thliptosaurus. However, even when crushed flat, Thliptosaurus could be distinguished from the other two kingoriids by the greater width of the intertemporal bar, and the parietals remained obscured postorbitals in the other taxa while they are exposed in Thliptosaurus. The pineal foramen was also still readily identifiable in the other kingoriid specimens, as would be expected for dorsoventral crushing. This implies that the characteristic broad temporal bar and absent pineal foramen of Thliptosaurus were not simply the result of taphonomic distortion, and are indeed genuine diagnostic characteristics of a distinct kingoriid taxon. Palaeobiology =Loss of the pineal foramen= Pineal eye of the modern Carolina anole. The seemingly total absence of the pineal foramen in Thliptosaurus is very unusual for dicynodonts, and it has otherwise only been recorded in the related kingoriid Kombuisia frerensis and cistecephalid Kawingasaurus (although its presence or absence is rarely intraspecifically variable in some other dicynodonts). The pineal foramen, supporting a pineal gland and pineal \\"third\\" eye is suggested to have played a role in thermoregulation for dicynodonts, allowing them to register changes in light levels throughout the day and yearly seasonal changes that would allow them respond and modify thermoregulatory behaviours, such as basking, as is recorded in modern tuataras and some lizards. The absence of the pineal complex in Thliptosaurus then suggests it was playing a less important role in thermoregulation, if any at all, although the reasons for this are unclear. The independent loss of the pineal foramen in advanced therocephalians and cynodonts across the Permo-Triassic boundary has been suggested to be a consequence of developing endothermic (i.e. warm blooded) metabolisms, something inferred not to have occurred in the contemporary dicynodonts or gorgonopsians. The independent loss of the pineal foramen in Thliptosaurus and other kistecephalian dicynodonts may support an alternative hypothesis for the loss of the pineal foramen in therapsids. It's possible that changing global environmental conditions at the end of the Permian, such as global warming and the movement of the continents towards the equator, meant that less control was needed over thermoregulation in therapsids like Thliptosaurus, decreasing the need for the pineal foramen until it was ultimately lost. This is similar to some modern tropical lizards, which have much reduced pineal eyes as they do not need to regulate their body temperature as well as lizards in more seasonal and temperate environments. These changes to therapsid thermoregulation influenced by the environment may then be more important to the acquisition of endothermy in mammal evolution than sometimes presumed. Palaeoecology =Late Permian small dicynodonts= Thliptosaurus was one of the few small-bodied dicynodonts (i.e. those with a skull length >15 cm) present in the latest Permian just before the Permian mass extinction, as they had suffered a major decline in diversity after their success in the earlier Middle to early-Late Permian. Small dicynodonts went from being over three times as numerous as all other tetrapods combined in the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone (primarily in the form of Diictodon) to down to only 19.2% of total tetrapods in the lower Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone (AZ), and then to just 4% by the upper Daptocephalus AZ when Thliptosaurus had appeared. At the same time, larger species of dicynodonts were on the increase, occupying up to 64% of all tetrapods in the upper Daptocephalus AZ. The newly evolved Lystrosaurus in particular was especially abundant at 34% of the total. The presence of a previously unknown small dicynodont in the Upper Daptocephalus AZ then is surprising. Restoration of the contemporary and related small dicynodont Dicynodontoides. Despite their decline, small dicynodonts still survived the Permian mass extinction, as evidenced by the kingoriid Kombuisia and myosaurid Myosaurus from Antarctica and South Africa. Both were present during the Induan of the Early Triassic, but while Myosaurus perished shortly after Kombuisia persisted into the earliest Anisian of the Middle Triassic. The ancestor-descendant relationships of these small dicynodonts to those of the Permian is unclear, but they do not appear to be directly related to any known Permian species. It has been suggested that the ancestors of the small Triassic dicynodonts (as well as the successful Triassic Kannemeyeriiformes) must have been present outside of the well-sampled historical localities of the Karoo Basin. The discovery of Thliptosaurus may support this idea, as it could indicate that local, endemic second-order faunas existed amongst the more widespread well known faunas of the Daptocephalus AZ. More crucially, it suggests that such 'missing diversities' may be present even in the under- sampled localities of otherwise historically important regions like the Karoo Basin. =KwaZulu-Natal palaeoenvironment= The environment of the upper Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone has been interpreted as well-drained floodplains, with a lower water table than the preceding wetter lower Daptocephalus AZ. This may have reduced the inferred marginal river and low undergrowth habitats that small dicynodonts are thought to have preferred, leading to their decline. Favourable habitats for small dicynodonts must have still existed, including in KwaZulu-Natal, as evidenced by Thliptosaurus. In KwaZulu-Natal, Thliptosaurus co-existed with other more widespread fauna typical of the Daptocephalus AZ, namely the dicynodonts Daptocephalus itself and Lystrosaurus. It also at least co-existed with the smaller dicynodont Kwazulusaurus, which may represent another local endemic dicynodont species from KwaZulu-Natal (however, it's possibly a synonym of Lystrosaurus), as well as the large predatory therocephalian Moschorhinus. Other therapsids known from elsewhere in the latest upper Daptocephalus AZ include the larger dicynodonts Oudenodon, Pelanomodon and Dinanomodon, the therocephalian Promoschorhynchus and remains of gorgonopsians.

He is known for his 2015 memoir, I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves, about his life as a gay man with cerebral palsy, which he adapted into television series Special for Netflix, which premiered in April 2019.  Early life and education  O'Connell grew up in Ventura County, California with what he described as his \\"liberal\\" family. He has a mild form of cerebral palsy (CP) since birth, which affects the right side of his body with a noticeable limp. Because of his CP, he had ten or eleven surgeries as a child, spending time in the hospital, and received much physical therapy. Growing up, O'Connell requested TV scripts for Christmas, and watched shows with the closed captioning on to learn more about writing. He would watch shows and attempt to figure out the A-Plot versus the B-plot, and the structure of the script. He loved performing as well, acting in all the middle-school and high-school plays. Later on he suppressed this desire, seeing himself not represented in popular culture. He attended Foothill Technology High School. On discovering his sexuality, O'Connell said, He remained closeted until he was seventeen and felt he needed to come out, to pursue another boy who was already out. His family was supportive when he did; his sister, uncle, and grandfather had already identified as LGBTQ. When O'Connell was twenty, he was hit by a car and required four hand surgeries. The accident resulted in compartment syndrome, and affected mainly his left hand. Nine months later, he moved to New York City to attend The New School. There, peers assumed his limp was from the car accident, and he chose not to correct them. He described feeling in limbo about his CP, not really fitting in with disabled or able-bodied people. Additionally, disabled representation in popular culture was nearly non-existent.  Career  = Early career = O'Connell worked as a blogger for three years, first serving as editor of Thought Catalog in 2011. He contributed to Vice, BuzzFeed, and other publications including The New York Times and Medium. Some of his writing went viral and when he was 25, he was offered a book deal from Simon & Schuster. At the time, he kept his disability private. In 2015, he wrote a column for Thought Catalog called \\"Coming Out of the Disabled Closet\\" about hiding his disability with the car accident. He later expanded the article into his book, which he used to publicly reveal his disability. While writing the book, he moved to Los Angeles and at 27, started his television writing career with MTV's Awkward. Just as his second season with Awkward wrapped in 2015, his memoir I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves was published. In April 2015, Jim Parsons, who had read O'Connell's Thought Catalog article, optioned the book through his company That's Wonderful Productions which he runs with husband Todd Spiewak. O‚ÄôConnell was assured with Parsons and Spiewak; he felt he could not trust a network with the gay content, and let the project die after buying the option. In late 2015, O'Connell was named to the Out100 honoring LGBTQ icons. = 2016 and Special = In 2016, O'Connell received a go-ahead from Stage 13 to develop a script for Special, based on his memoir, with eight 15 minute episodes for Netflix. The short-form format was taxing for the veteran script writer as there was no room for a C-plot alongside the A-Plot and B-plot, the writing also left no room, ‚Äúevery line needs to count for something and you can‚Äôt do anything somewhere else.‚Äù Special was all written on weekends, as he was writing full-time. In December 2016, he completed the writing but still had obstacles getting it produced because of the disability angle. He started doing media work for Special while writing full-time on BH90210, a Fox comedy-drama reboot of Beverly Hills, 90210 which debuted in August 2019. He noted it was hard to launch a show with a gay lead character, let alone one who was also disabled; a first for television. He stated, \\"I think Hollywood is largely not interested in disabled people because they don't view us as 'sexy' or 'cool'.\\" He lamented, \\"1 in 4 people identify as disabled and there are only two shows (me and This Close) on the air from disabled people.\\" In Special, the lead character Ryan misleads his coworkers that his limp was the result of a car accident instead of his cerebral palsy. The show is largely based on O'Connell's life. He uses the show to \\"explore his own internalized ableism and insecurities of being in the gay community\\". A 2016 Ruderman Family Foundation study found that \\"about 95% of characters with disabilities on television are played by able-bodied actors\\". Including actors with disabilities is still rare in entertainment industries; in 2018 Ali Stroker was ‚Äúthe first person in a wheelchair to win a Tony Award‚Äù; in July 2019, Marvel made history announcing a deaf superhero, a first; and AMC's The Walking Dead and HBO's Years and Years are among the few opening their casting. Although he looked for an actor, ultimately he took the role himself due to budget constraints. The eight-episode season was shot over nineteen days. Producers filmed with Austin, Texas doubling for Los Angeles, also due to budget constraints. He found in particular the sex scenes were emotionally taxing but also rewarding as disabled people having sex is rarely seen, and among LGBTQ people even rarer. O'Connell also \\"set out to depict onscreen sex in an authentic way, something rarely shown with LGBTQ people\\". He said, \\"I also want to live in a world where it's not groundbreaking to show an accurate sex scene between two men.\\" Special also shows the lead character Ryan losing his virginity to a male sex worker in what O'Connell characterized as \\"a beautifully honest and sweet sex scene\\". Digital Spy noted \\"it's probably the first-ever TV show to tackle gay, disabled sex with authenticity, while destigmatising sex work at the same time.\\" USA Today called the episode a landmark for disability representation and noted \\"O'Connell hope(s) to destigmatize sex work with the graphic scene, but also normalize gay sex for mainstream audiences who aren't used to seeing it in Hollywood movies or popular TV shows\\". O'Connell and the show were commended for his \\"standout performance and quippy prose\\". = 2017 to present = O'Connell wrote for a season of Daytime Divas in 2017. He then worked as executive story editor on the 2017 reboot of Will & Grace, which taught him to keep stories grounded in the characters even if the action gets \\"wacky\\". In May 2019, O'Connell was honored with the HRC Visibility Award by the Human Rights Campaign at the 2019 HRC Atlanta Gala Dinner. In June 2019, O'Connell was the celebrity grand marshal for the LA Pride Parade. That month, Queerty named him one of the Pride 50 \\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people.\\" In July 2019, Special was nominated for four 71st Primetime Emmy Awards taking place in September: Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series; both Punam Patel and Jessica Hecht for Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series; and O‚ÄôConnell for Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series. This is the most nominations for a short form piece this year. In August 2019, it was announced that O‚ÄôConnell and Anna Dokoza, an Australian director and producer who worked on Special, as well as Flight of the Conchords, and Lady Dynamite, will be mentoring prospective producers in Australia.

Most of his works are landscapes and urban scenes in and around Chelsea. Life and work He was born with a spinal deformity that often made him shy and reclusive. Nevertheless, he studied at the Royal College of Art and became a pupil of the French √©migr√© painter, Theodore Roussel. It was through Roussel that he became acquainted with the circle of artists around James McNeill Whistler, known as the \\"London Impressionists\\"; a group that included Walter Sickert and Philip Steer. He was also introduced into the Royal Society of British Artists.The Correspondence of Whistler @ the University of Glasgow By 1888, he had become a member of the New English Art Club; joining with Sickert and Steer at their exhibitions. His paintings were also shown at the Royal Society's Suffolk Street Gallery, the Grafton Galleries, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. In 1889, he was privileged to be included in the exhibit at the Goupil Galleries in Paris that introduced English-style Impressionism to the French.Macconnal-Mason Art Despite the wide distribution his paintings received, his spinal condition made it difficult to move his canvases and easels, so he confined himself to painting in the immediate surroundings of his home in Chelsea; including Kensington Gardens, the Chelsea Embankment and views across the river to Battersea. He continued to paint there after the area had become industrialized and other artists had begun to abandon it. Whistler's influence is especially evident in those scenes. He taught drawing in South Kensington. In 1893, he became an art examiner for the London Board of Education, a post he held until 1908. His works can be found at the Tate Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum and the Southampton City Art Gallery.

Congenital blindness is a hereditary disease and can be cured by gene therapy. Visual loss in children or infant can occur either at the stage of prenatal (during the time of conception or intrauterine period) or postnatal stage (during birth). A variety of causes can promote congenital blindness but the most concern and highest cause of it is a genetic mutation. 60% of congenital blindness are contributed from prenatal stage and another 40% are contributed from inherited disease. However, most of the congenital blindness cases show that it can be avoidable or preventable with early treatment.  Causes  Prenatal stage Retinopathy of prematurity *Premature Birth *Refractive error *Congenital cataract *Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) *Infection such as Ophtalmia neonatorum that happen during time of conception or intrauterine period * Vitamin A deficiency * Measles Postnatal stage RPE65 *Genetic mutation The mutation can usually be an autosomal recessive condition and unusual condition of infant happened where it forms retinoblastoma result from autosomal dominant condition. The mutation of Retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kDa protein (RPE65) gene which function to produce retinoid isomerohydrolase which is an enzyme. RPE65 performs a key role in the trans-cis isomerization of retinol in the retinal pigment epithelium of the eye. The palmitoylation of RPE65 serves to switch off the visual cycle in darkness and to switch it on in the light. Mutation in this gene causing disorder of phototransduction pathway through brain which detect light fail to function. Diagnosis Paediatric nurses, medical officers and paediatricians trained in eye screening could detect small or large eyeballs, nystagmus, strabismus, ‚Äúwhite pupils‚Äù and birth defects like coloboma and aniridia. For pregnant women from family with history of congenital blindness will be closely monitor and need to carry out genetic test in order to identify is there mutation occur or not.  Gene therapy treatment  The gene therapy treatment procedure involving outpatient which means the patients came to the hospital for treatment for their eye and went back home. The patients do not need a strict monitor and staying in the hospital. The gene therapy treatment is in vivo which involved uses of a delivery vector to delivers the therapeutic gene into target cells. In this therapy, the delivery vector uses a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the RPE65 gene (AAV2-hRPE65v2).the Adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the RPE65 gene (AAV2-hRPE65v2) The therapeutic gene called Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) which is the first gene therapy approved by FDA for inherited diseases. This gene therapy can only improve eye vision significantly but cannot cure the condition entirely. The procedure involves a single injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2 therapeutic gene into unilateral subretinal in the eye.

In theories which consider human actions will be affected by motivational tendencies, the concept that for achieving a favorable stimulation level, social practices stimulated by pure desire plays a significant role. The medium levels of stimulation, which is also called the optimum stimulation level, are the most common one to be chosen, and due to individual difference, the determination of the optimal stimulation level (OSL) vary between each person. People may explore surroundings for reaching they satisfy stimulation, meaning that individuals who have a high optimum stimulation level are more likely to be attracted in exploratory. Therefore, the relationship between human needs for motivation and their tendency of exploration indicates that the optimum stimulation level probably has a decisive influence in behaviors. With the most well-pleasing intermediate stimulation level, an inverted U-shaped function exists between stimulation acquired from the environment, and human stimulated a response. People who have high optimum stimulation level attract by stimulation and others avoid stimulation.  Customer behavior  The OSL, which has an unusually productive influence on variety searching, cognitive reactions of consumers, information seeking, innovative behaviors, and risk decision making, play a significant role in exploratory buyers' behaviors. Based on several experiments, the interactions between OSL and individual behavior investigate. = Exploration = There are three classifications about the inquiry of tendencies for consumer reaction, including behaviors engaged by curiosity, variety searching, and assumption of risk and innovative practices. Curiosity can categorize as particular interest stimulated behavior and diverse curiosity encouraged the practice. The first mentioned of two displays an in- depth analysis for a single incentive because this stimulation evokes curiousness of consumer; in this situation, exploration is a reaction for a specific stimulus motivated by collative properties. However, the diverse curiosity, which can be initiated by an assortment of sources, refers to the response for boredom, meaning that it does not react to a particular stimulus. For changing pace, people will shift purchasing behavior for familiar objects such as stores to access stimulation ‚Äî this action named as variety seeking. Acquiring from purchasing behavior, the suboptimal level of stimulation leads customers to feel tedious after they simplify their decision procedure. As a result, they tend to enhance the complexity of the buying process. A positive relationship exists between OSL and risk undertaking behavior. According to the idea of an opportunity of loss, a majority of conceptions of risk-taking built. This point of view is similar to the leading theory among consumer behavior; the perceived risk establishes as a two dimensions function: consequences uncertainty and consequences significant or magnitude. = Innovation and stimulation = A supposition used during the discussion about buyers‚Äô behaviors means that consumers actions display a mechanical operation which operates to prevent imbalances due to an unexpected stimulus input caused. However, because the apparent propensity to search for new expending experiences, the hypothesis which refers to buyers seek to reduce stimulation to the minimum is hard to identify. The conception of OSL provides an adequate point of view. The innate character of this concept is that people struggle to stay the OSL; otherwise, the deviation from optimality results in a re- establishment of stimulus input within the optimum intermediate interval. An optimum stimulation level provided with internal stability but the difference between each person. Based on the tendency of buyers for perception seeking, the property of the adoption decision-making process has a difference between both recently developed retail facilities and innovative products. Hypothesis confirms that high sensory seekers are more sensitive to realize the new alternatives, think over more options, making less rejection decision with cognitive assessment, will attempt and eventually take more innovations. Generally, high-sensitivity seekers incline to have a reasonable expectation for goods and equipment through the evaluation stage entering the practical experiments, but consciousness and the model that is ultimately adopted seem to depend on the essence of innovation.  Recreational shopping tendency  For leisure consumers, whether to buy products or enjoy services, shopping is a comfortable way to spend time. They want to buy in beautiful surroundings, which is engaging, full of surprises, surreal, exciting, and safe to evoke an enjoyable shopping experience. Other words, casual consumers trend to shop in an environment which is considered containing emotional stimulation, and the emotion caused by stimulation probably is pleasing. Several functions have a relation with OSL: *The inverted UB-shaped function: the OSL does not create influence *The butterfly curve function: the OSL produces effects, which are similar to the zero influence, with moderate deviations. *The inverted UB- shaped function: the OSL create maximum effects The researcher considers that the favorable wake level of t stimulation containing two majority elements: the first is a crucial component named novelty, and the second is called conflict, which is a negative feature. The novelty component refers to the joint effects of the number of increases in individuals' ideal attributes such as the level of surprise; the other component indicates the negative aspects of persons, including vagueness and uncertainty. The sum of these two different independent variables represents the entire preference for stimulation. Color in advertising thumb thumb thumb Colors, including three main parts, which are tint, lightness, and saturation, are crucial in advertising because it influences human attitudes for advertising. Assuming effects of colors are different for people, the optimal stimulation level treated as a moderator variable which is considered as a quantitative or qualitative variate and plays a significant role in the relationship between a predictor or independent variable and a standard or dependent variable. This concept indicates that the OSL for people will affect his or her preference of colors.  Online consumers behaviors  thumb The Internet provides hypermedia surroundings for consumers to interact easily with companies. It is a compelling social medium due to its unique features, including comprehensive coverage, liable receiving consumers feedback, low cost, the ability to squeeze space and time, etc. Because websites contain diversity information and varying different levels of hedonic features, the individual variable, the OSL, need to be considered for the study of internet shopping.
