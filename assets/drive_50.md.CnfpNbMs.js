It was established in 1807 by Frederick Augustus I, the first King of Saxony. The order was originally limited to 24 knights, but exceptions were made for members of ruling houses and those whose membership in the order would add to its prestige. The Order of the Rue Crown was presented in a single grade, Knight. Twice, the order was granted in a special grade with diamonds, to Portuguese Prime Minister Dom Nuno Jos√© de Moura Barreto, Duke of Loul√© in 1859 and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1885. From its founding to the fall of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1918, the order was presented 332 times. Appearance The badge of the order is a gold Maltese cross, enameled in green with a white border. The white center medallion features the crowned monogram of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, encircled by a green crown of rue. Between the arms of the cross is a golden crown of rue.

In 2012, Nivis was the only company that supports both the ISA100.11a and WirelessHART standards with a single device; by 2015 the company had several competitors in this field.\\"ISA100 Wireless comes of age at Achema 2015\\". isa.org. By Andre Ristaino Technology Nivis has specialized in wireless mesh network research and technology, in which no device or connection can be a single point of failure. The technology has several advantages: it uses an architecture which supports a variety of network topologies, allowing the user to choose one appropriate for a specific environments. At start up, devices automatically organize themselves into a multi-hop, layered network, and the nodes organize themselves in layers and form redundant routing paths. If a node fails, the remaining nodes automatically re-route traffic around that node. Each node makes routing decisions locally, so that the network can dynamically adapt to changes in the network by adopting new routes. The decentralized, wireless networks scale easily and at low cost, and the radio nodes typically communicate on unlicensed frequency bands (for example 2.4 GHz), in a time-slotted network that is able to coexist with other wireless networks that may or may not be based on the same standard. Nivis supports the Advanced Encryption Standard adopted by the U.S. government and worldwide, as well as FIPS-197 certification, 802.15.4 security level, ISA100.11a MAC and Transport layer security, WirelessHART MAC and Transport layer security, and follow the IPsec standard for securing end-to-end IP communications.

He seems to have lived much of his early life there, having married Mary Evans in 1589 and where all ten of his children were baptized. Per Banks, he was a smith by occupation with the parish register of St. Peter's, Sandwich providing information on his children's baptisms.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 291-292Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (New York: Grafton Press, 1929), p. 54 Although being a sexton of St. Peter's, Sandwich between 1604 and 1609, Fletcher found himself excommunicated by the church three times since by the early 1600s; he appears to have become involved in the Separatist movement. In 1609 he first found himself having a problem with church authorities when, on April 24 or 25, he was at the burial of a child of Andrew Sharpe which was considered an illegal burial as it was accomplished outside Church of England control. As recorded in church records, Fletcher and others were \\"calling into question the lawlessness of the king's constitutions in this and other behalfs, affirming these things(s) to be popishly ceremonious and of no other force.\\" The Separatists considered Anglican burial ceremonies \\"popish\\" and that they sponsored idola. On June 12, 1609, Moses Fletcher, along with the wife of future fellow Mayflower passenger James Chilton and several other persons were excommunicated from the Anglican church for the supposedly illegal burial.Moses Fletcher at plimoth.org On November 6, 1609, Moses Fletcher was excommunicated again for burying his own daughter Judith, according to church records, was \\"in the sermon time very disorderly and unseemly.\\" His final excommunication from the church was proclaimed to churchgoers on February 11, 1610.  Life in Leiden  It appears that in or after 1610, Fletcher and his family departed Sandwich with the Chilton family and possibly others, traveling to Leiden in the Dutch Republic where they connected with the Separatist church which had been recently established there. Fletcher's wife Mary seems to have died either just before or soon after the family moved to Leiden. He remarried in Leiden to Sarah, widow of William Denby on December 21, 1613. The marriage record notes that Fletcher was a blacksmith. Leiden records for Moses Fletcher and his family show that in 1616 he witnessed the betrothal of Zachariah Barrow to Joan Barrow. Two years later, in 1618, Fletcher's eldest son John married in Leiden to Josina Sacharias, a Dutch woman. Two other of his children, Priscilla and Elizabeth, are recorded as having married in Leiden later.Caleb H.

The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21.

History and Background The Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area was established on May 8, 2008 by Public Law 110-229, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. The designation provides a framework for the promotion and interpretation of the area's cultural and historic character, with particular emphasis on the region's role in the American Civil War, and the preservation of the natural and built environment. The National Heritage Area extends from Gettysburg in the north to Monticello in the south. It is managed by the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, which encompasses the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Scenic Byway. The heritage area roughly follows the route of the Old Carolina Road. The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising the awareness of the history within the Gettysburg-Monticello corridor. Its mission is to promote and support civic engagement through history education, economic development through heritage tourism, and the preservation of cultural landscapes in one of the nation‚Äôs most important historic regions. Partners include over 350 municipal, business, and non-profit organizations, including many elected bodies within the four-state region. All related entities are collectively referred to as the Journey Through Hallowed Ground. The Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area denotes the region that Congress designated as a Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area in 2008, in a program affiliated with the National Park Service. There are 15 counties in the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area, spanning those four states. With 400 years of European, American, and African-American heritage, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground is a National Heritage Area with a National Scenic Byway running through it. It contains World Heritage sites, over 10,000 sites on the National Register of Historic Places, 49 National Historic districts, nine Presidential homes & sites, 13 National Park Units, hundreds of African-American and Native American heritage sites, 30 Historic Main Street communities, sites from the Revolutionary War, French-Indian War, War of 1812, and the largest single collection of Civil War sites in the nation. The Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area comprises Adams County in Pennsylvania, Frederick and Carroll counties and the eastern part of Washington county in Maryland, the area around Harpers Ferry in Jefferson County, West Virginia, and Loudoun, Fauquier, Culpeper, Orange, Albemarle, Greene, Madison and Rappahannock counties and parts of Fairfax, Prince William and Spotsylvania counties in Virginia. National Scenic Byway The Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Scenic Byway refers to the 180-mile road that intersects the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area. Once known as Old Carolina Road, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Scenic Byway runs 180 miles through three states and includes portions of US Rt. 15, VA 231, VA 20, and VA 53, running through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The JTHG National Scenic Byway is one of 150 scenic byways nationwide designated by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. National History Academy In the summer of 2018, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground launched National History Academy, an innovative five-week residential summer program for top high school students from throughout the country. The Academy teaches the foundations of American democracy through place-based education. National History Academy‚Äôs mission is to inspire students to understand the foundations of American democracy and the responsibilities of citizenship. The first of its kind, the Academy was founded to address the current crisis in American civic and historical literacy.https://loudounnow.com/2018/07/06/national-history-academy-debuts-in- loudoun/ During the five-week course, students study American history, from the Native American settlement era through the civil-rights movement, with an emphasis on significant events and figures between 1765 and 1865. The group alternates between classroom studies and visits to historic sites within and near the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area. National History Academy‚Äôs motto, ‚ÄúHistoria Est Magistra Vitae,‚Äù is taken from Cicero‚Äôs De Oratore and means ‚Äúhistory is the teacher of life.‚Äù =Admissions and Student Life= The Academy has capacity for ninety rising 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students each summer. In 2018, 233 students applied, and 89 students from 28 states enrolled. Courses are taught by six master teachers. Students are also overseen by twelve college counselors. National History Academy is hosted at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, a private secondary school. The campus is located 45 miles from Washington, D.C. and within a three-hour drive of all the historic sites that the students visit. Filmmaker Ken Burns is featured in the Academy‚Äôs promotional video. =Curriculum= The curriculum is built around four components: (1) history cases; (2) parliamentary debates; (3) a speaker series; and (4) visits to the defining sites of American history. History cases The Academy uses the case-based History of American Democracy curriculum developed by Harvard Business School Professor David A. Moss. The cases provide an interdisciplinary and contextual examination of key historic events, permitting students to consider multiple viewpoints and to place themselves in the role of decision makers. In 2018, Professor Moss taught the first case on the United States Constitution at James Madison‚Äôs Montpelier. Better Angels debates The Academy offers a parliamentary debate program in partnership with the Better Angels and its founder, David Blankenhorn. The College Board provided the initial funding for this partnership. The debates are designed to encourage civil discourse across the partisan divide in an open and respectful environment. This formal style of parliamentary debate allows students to explore challenging contemporary issues in contrast to the historical debates studied in the cases. Guest speakers The Academy invites more than 20 nationally recognized guest speakers to supplement classroom activities. Among the 2018 guest speakers were David Rubenstein, Ernest Green, Margaret Richardson, Brent Glass, Jon Parrish Peede, Trevor Potter, Douglas Owsley, Ron Maxwell and Robert Duvall. Site visits and unique experiences The Academy alternates classroom work with visits to the defining historic sites in the region, from Gettysburg to Harpers Ferry, Washington, D.C., Charlottesville and Colonial Williamsburg. Students experience iconic National Parks, museums, presidential homes, battlefields, and Civil Rights sites.

They consist of extreme, maladaptive levels of certain personality characteristics (these characteristics are commonly described as facets within broader personality factors or traits). Within the context of personality psychology, a \\"dimension\\" refers to a continuum on which an individual can have various levels of a characteristic, in contrast to the dichotomous categorical approach in which an individual does or does not possess a characteristic. According to dimensional models personality disorders are classified according to which characteristics are expressed at which levels. This stands in contrast to the traditional categorical models of classification, which are based on the boolean presence or absence of symptoms and do not take into account levels of expression of a characteristic or the presence of any underlying dimension. The way in which these diagnostic dimensions should be constructed has been under debate, particularly in the run up to the publication of the DSM-5. A number of dimensional models have been produced, differing in the way in which they are constructed and the way in which they are intended to be interpreted. There are four broad types of dimensional representation, although others also exist: # Dimensional representation of the original DSM categories of personality disorders; # Dimensional representation based on identification of latent traits with the DSM disorders; # Dimensional representation based on the traits from normal personality research; # Representation based on integration of dimensional modals, e.g. by using network analysis. The dimensional approach is included in Section III (\\"Emerging Measures and Models\\") of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), where it is described as an \\"Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders.\\" The decision to retain the old DSM-IV categorical model of personality disorders in DSM-5 was controversial, and efforts continue to persuade the American Psychiatric Association to replace it with the dimensional model in DSM 5.1. Usage Dimensional modals are intended to reflect what constitutes personality disorder symptomology according to a spectrum, rather than in a dichotomous way. As a result of this they have been used in three key ways; firstly to try to generate more accurate clinical diagnoses, secondly to develop more efficacious treatments and thirdly to determine the underlying etiology of disorders. =Clinical diagnosis= The \\"checklist\\" of symptoms that is currently used is often criticized for a lack of empirical support and its inability to recognize personality-related issues that do not fit within the current personality disorder constructs or DSM criteria. It has also been criticized for leading to diagnoses that are not stable over time, have poor cross-rater agreement and high comorbidity suggesting that they do not reflect distinct disorders. In contrast the dimensional approach has been shown to predict and reflect current diagnostic criteria, but also add to them. It has been argued to be especially useful in explaining comorbidity which is often high for patients diagnosed with a personality disorders. Following from these claims, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) incorporates a combined categorical-dimensional approach to diagnosing personality disorders based on the degree to which a person shows elevated levels of particular personality characteristics. However one of the issues in using a dimensional approach to diagnosis has been determining appropriate cut off points so as to know who belongs to the category of people requiring treatment, this is partly why both categorical and dimensional diagnoses are included. Since the categorical model is widely used in clinical practice and has a significant body of research supporting it, its common usage is compelling to laypeople when they are judging the credibility of professional opinion. Therefore, the dimensional approach is often further criticized for being difficult to interpret and less accessible. It is however widely used in some professional settings as the established approach, for example by forensic psychologists. =Treatment efficacy= Another suggested usage of the dimensional approach is that it can aid clinicians in developing treatment plans and assessing other mechanisms contributing to patient‚Äôs difficulty in functioning within the social, personal, or occupational domains. The approach can improve treatment in two ways. Firstly it can enable development of more personalized care plans for individuals based on their adaptive and maladaptive characteristics. Secondly, it means that relevant symptomology which is not considered maladaptive can be considered when developing and evaluating general therapeutic and medical treatment. =Determining cause= Attempts at presenting an etiological description of personality disorders have been avoided due to the influence of the DSM and its principles in psychiatric research (See history section). However some techniques are looking at potential interrelated causalities between symptoms of personality disorders and broader influences including aspects of normal personality (See integrated approaches section). History =Initial development of a categorical model= The adoption of a categorical approach to personality disorders can be understood in part due to ethical principles within psychiatry. The ‚Äòdo no harm principle‚Äô led to Kraepelinian assumptions about mental illness and an emphasis on empirically grounded taxonomic systems that were not biased by unsubstantiated theories about etiology. A taxonomic checklist based on empirical observations rather than bias prone theoretical assumptions developed. It was both categorical and hierarchical, with the diagnosis of a disorder being dependent of the presence of a threshold number categories (usually five) out of a total number (seven to nine) Disorders were organized into three clusters, existing purely to make the disorders easier to remember by associating them with others that have similar symptoms, not based on any theory about their relatedness. =Emerging problems with the categorical model= The dimensional model was developed in response to the limitations of this standard categorical model. The expectations from a Kraepelinian approach were that as systematic research into psychiatric health increased; diagnostic categories would be refined and targeted reliable treatments would be developed. However this reductionist approach to diagnostic categorization has led to disorders with high comorbidity, life course instability, poor treatment efficacy and poor diagnostic agreement. In addition the findings from psychopathological research have led to an increasing body of evidence suggesting overlaps between normal and maladaptive personality and interrelatedness across disorders. These findings have been further supported by genetic and developmental studies which have constantly pointed towards greater interrelatedness then the diagnostic categories can offer. These consistently disconformity findings, alongside the successful shift to a continuous rather than categorical approach in other areas of research, such as regarding ASD, led to consideration of alternative approaches. =Development of methodological techniques= Factor analysis The development of factor analysis as a popular statistical technique in differential psychology has led to an increase in attempts at finding underlying traits. More recently this has been used in the context of personality disorders both as a means of looking at which personality traits current categorical diagnoses are related to and also as a method of looking for new psychopathological latent variables. Factor analysis has helped illustrate that the full range of relevant personality pathology is not included in the DSM psychiatry nosology. However the technique does not show information about a continuum from normal to clinically relevant personality. Dimensional analysis Dimensional classification techniques show individual multidimensional profiles and therefore they can show information about a personality continuum (from normal to atypical), one such technique is Hybrid modeling.Helzer, J. E., Kraemer, H. C., Krueger, R. F., Wittchen, H. U., Sirovatka, P. J., & Regier, D. A. (Eds.). (2009). Dimensional approaches in diagnostic classification: Refining the research agenda for DSM-V. American Psychiatric Pub. Cut off points can be introduced into these modals to show where a diagnosis may lie. However the number of different rating scales that need to be looked at and the lack of interdisciplinary research between statisticians and psychologists has meant that attempts at finding a ‚Äòworldwide‚Äô criteria for dimensional diagnosis using this method has been of limited success. Comparative analysis Analyses have been conducted to test the relative fit of categorical and dimensional modals to evaluate whether single diagnostic categories are suited to either status. These types of analysis can include a range of data, including endophenotypes or other genetic or biological markers which increases their utility. Multivariate genetic analysis helps establish how well the current phenotypically developed structure of personality disorder diagnosis fits with the genetic structure underlying personality disorders. Results from these types of analysis support dimensional over categorical approaches. Network analysis Network Analysis has been used as a means of integrating information about personality with personality disorders and as well as information about other genetic, biological and environmental influences into a single system and looking at interrelated causalities between them (See integrated modals). Model development =Adapted categorical models= There are different ways to ‚Äòdimensionalize‚Äô personality disorders, these can be summarised into two categories. # The first involves quantifying DSM-5 pathology. This can be done either based on the degree to which symptoms are present or on how close to a prototypic presentation a patient's presentation may be. The prototype approach includes features not present in the DSM. # The second approach involves identification of DSM disorder traits by means of factor analysis to show underlying dimensions of the personality disorder criteria, this method may also include relevant psychopathology. =Normal personality models= Five-factor model The Five-Factor model of personality, which is the most dominant dimensional model, has been used to conceptualize personality disorders and has received various empirical support. Under this approach, extreme levels of the basic personality traits identified by the FFM are what contributes to the maladaptive nature of personality disorders. Over 50 published studies supporting this model have been identified, providing much empirical support for this approach. Most of these studies examine the relationship between scores on separate measures of Big Five trait and personality disorder symptoms. The Five-Factor model was first extended to personality disorders in the early 1990s, when it was established that a satisfactory profile of each personality disorder in the DSM-III-R could be created through various levels of Big Five traits. Thomas Widiger and his colleagues have demonstrated that many of the central elements of personality disorders can be explained in terms of Big Five traits ‚Äì for example, borderline personality disorder is characterized by high levels of hostility, trait anxiety and depression, and vulnerability, all of which are facets of neuroticism. This approach also helps to differentiate characteristics of disorders that overlap under the current categorical model, such as avoidant and schizoid personality disorders. The Five-Factor-based approach explains much of that overlap as well as the ways in which they are different. For example, both are characterized primarily by maladaptive excessive introversion, but antisocial personality disorder also includes high levels of facets of neuroticism (such as self-consciousness, anxiety, and vulnerability), while schizotypal personality disorder includes the addition of low assertiveness. The Five-Factor approach also resolves previous anomalies in factor analyses of personality disorders, which makes it a more explanatory model than the current categorical approach, which only includes three factors (odd-eccentric, dramatic-emotional, and anxious-fearful). A prototype diagnostic technique has been developed in which Five-Factor-based prototypes for each disorder were created, based on the aggregated ratings of personality disorder experts. These prototypes agree well with DSM diagnostic criteria. The Five-Factor prototypes also reflected the high comorbidity rates of personality disorders. This is explained by the idea that various other disorders tap into dimensions that overlap with those of the primary diagnosis. Another Five-Factor based technique involves diagnosing personality disorders based on clinician ratings of various facets of the five factors (e.g. self-consciousness, which falls under the neuroticism factor; excitement seeking, which falls under the extraversion factor). This technique is partially based on the prototype model, as each facet's \\"score\\" is based on its rating of how prototypical it is of each personality disorder, with prototypically low facets (with a score less than 2) reverse-scored. Using this technique, diagnosis is based on an individual's summed score across relevant facets. This summed-score technique has been shown to be as sensitive as the prototype technique, and the easier computation method makes it a useful suggested screening technique. The Five-Factor assessment of personality disorders has also been correlated with the Psychopathy Resemblance Index of the NEO Personality Inventory, as well as with the individual personality dimensions of the NEO-PI-R. It also resolves several issues regarding the PCL-R psychopathy assessment, as a Five-Factor-based re- interpretation of the PCL-R factor structure shows that the ‚ÄúAggressive Narcissism‚Äù factor taps into facets of low agreeableness (with some contribution of facets of neuroticism and extraversion), and the ‚ÄúSocially deviant lifestyle‚Äù factor represents facets of low conscientiousness and low agreeableness. It has also been shown that the sex differences in personality disorders can be reasonably predicted by sex differences in Big 5 traits. =Criticism= The dimension of openness to experience of the Five-Factor model has been criticized for not directly relating to any of the major characteristics of personality disorders in the same way as do the other four dimensions . It has been suggested that schizotypal and histrionic personality disorders could be partially characterized by high levels of openness to experience (in the forms of openness to ideas and feelings, respectively) , while obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and avoidant personality disorders can all be conceptualized by extremely low levels of openness . However, there is little to no empirical support for this hypothesis, particularly with schizotypal personality disorder. Additionally, the Openness scale of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used measures of Big Five traits, was based on research and theory which viewed openness (such as self-actualization and personal growth) as beneficial, so measurement of extreme openness using the NEO-PI-R, is actually a marker of good mental health. Seven factor model The Five-Factor approach has been criticized for being limited in some respects in its conceptualization of personality disorders. This limitation is due to the fact that it does not include evaluative trait terms such as ‚Äúbad‚Äù, ‚Äúawful‚Äù, or ‚Äúvicious‚Äù. Some research has suggested that two evaluative dimensions should be added to the Five-Factor model of personality disorders. Empirical support for this approach comes from factor analyses that include the Big Five factors and evaluative terms. These analyses show that the evaluative terms contribute to two additional factors, one each for positive and negative valence. The addition of these two factors resolves much of the ambiguity of the openness dimension in the Five-Factor approach, as the openness factor changes to a conventionality factor, and adjectives such as ‚Äúodd‚Äù, ‚Äústrange‚Äù, and ‚Äúweird‚Äù (which all characterize schizotypal personality disorder) fall onto the negative valence factor. These results indicate that the inclusion of evaluative terms and valence dimensions can be valuable for better describing the extreme and maladaptive levels of personality traits that comprise personality disorder profiles. Internalizing/Externalizing model A two-factor model of psychopathology in general has also been suggested, in which most disorders fall along internalizing and externalizing dimensions, which encompass mood and anxiety disorders, and antisocial personality and substance use disorders, respectively. Although this approach was originally developed to understand psychopathology in general, it has often been focused to apply to personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder to help better understand patterns of comorbidity. Szondi drive theory Hungarian psychiatryst L√©opold Szondi formulated in 1935 a dimensional model of personality comprising four dimensions and eight drives (\\"facets\\" in DSM V terminology). It was based on a drive theory, in which the four dimensions correspond to the independent hereditary circular mental diseases established by the psychiatric genetics of the time:Ellenberger, H. (1970) The Discovery of the Unconscious, p.866 the schizoform (containing the paranoid and the catatonic drives), the manic-depressive (for the \\"contact\\" dimension), the paroxysmal (including the epileptic and hysteric drives), and the sexual drive disorder (including the hermaphrodite and the sadomasochist drives).Szondi (1972) pp.34-6 quotation: The Sex (S) and Contact (C) dimensions can be further grouped as representing pulsions at the border with the outer world, while the Paroximal (P) and Schizoform (Sch) dimensions at the inner part of the psyche. =Integrated models= Network analysis Network analysis diverts most strongly from the categorical approach because it assumes that the symptoms of a disorder have a causal relationship to each other. This theoretical assumption is made because no mental disorder can currently be understood as existing independently from its symptoms, as other medical diseases can be. According to the network approach symptoms are not looked at as the product of a set of latent disorders, instead they are looked at as mutually interacting and reciprocally reinforcing elements within a wider network. Therefore, a diagnosis is not needed to understand why the symptoms hang together. Clusters of densely connected symptoms can be defined as disorders, but they are inevitably intertwined with related symptoms and cannot be entirely separated. This helps explain the growing body of research showing comorbidity, co-occurring genetic markers and co-occurring symptoms across personality disorders. =Therapeutic consequences= The therapeutic consequence of this is that treatment is targeted at the symptoms themselves and the causal relations between them, not the overarching diagnosis. This is because targeting the diagnosis is trying to treat an unspecified summary of a complex collection of causes. Adopting this attitude sits well with the therapeutic treatments in use at the moment that have the strongest evidence base. =Network construction= Network analysis has its roots in mathematics and physics but is increasingly being used in other areas. Essentially it is a method of analyzing mutually interacting entities by represented them as nodes which are connected to through relations called edges. Edges represent any sort of relation such as a partial correlation. Complex network analyses of other subjects have looked at tipping points, where one system suddenly transitions into another, such as when a tropical forests goes into a savannah. If these could be identified in individual‚Äôs psychopathological dynamic networks then they could be used to determine when a person‚Äôs network is on the brink of collapse and what can be done to alter it. =Criticisms= There are concerns that the network modal does not have enough parsimony and is too difficult to interpret. DSM-5 The Personality and Personality Disorder Work Group proposed a combination categorical-dimensional model of personality disorder assessment that will be adopted in the DSM-5. The Work Group's model includes 5 higher-order domains (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism) and 25 lower-order facets, or constellations of trait behaviors that constitute the broader domains. The personality domains can also be extended to describe the personality of non-personality disorder patients. Diagnosis of personality disorders will be based on levels of personality dysfunction and assessment of pathological levels of one or more of the personality domains, resulting in classification into one of six personality disorder \\"types\\" or Personality Disorder Trait Specified (depending on the levels of traits present), in contrast to the current traditional categorical diagnoses of one of 10 personality disorders (or personality disorder not otherwise specified) based on the presence or absence of symptoms. =Criticism= There are concerns that the addition of dimensional models to DSM-5 may raise confusion. Carole Lieberman has stated that \\"As it is now, people don't really make use of the subcategories that there are to describe severity of symptoms. Instead, I see this as a tool that insurance companies could well co-opt to try to deny benefits.\\" References Further reading       Category:Psychological theories Category:Personality traits ","title":"Dimensional models of personality disorders"},{"id":"35350511","text":"The Maritime Art Association (1935-1945) was a Canadian regional alliance of art clubs and societies, public schools, universities, social organizations, service and civic groups, artists, art students and art appreciators. As the first organization of its type in Canada, the Association offered Maritimers a more democratic and populist arena than art associations in the rest of the country, which tended to be city-based and only a few were province-wide. The Association responded to the need for an active regional infrastructure in the arts; representing groups from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Walter Abell organized the Maritime Art Association while a professor of Art at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. The MAA‚Äôs constitution was ratified at the Association‚Äôs first annual meeting held in Saint John, New Brunswick at the end of March 1935, and Abell was elected its President. Violet Gillett succeeded Abell as president and edited the short-lived Maritime Arts Bulletin. Gillett's mission as President was to steer the organization from art appreciation, towards community involvement in art. The Association‚Äôs objective was: \\"to promote a knowledge and appreciation of art; to foster art activities in the Maritime Provinces by uniting for cooperative effort, all interested groups and individuals, by securing and offering for circulation, exhibitions of fine and applied art,\\" as well as \\"arranging for lectures and for engaging in such other activities to promote these aims.\\" The MAA attracted a membership of seventeen groups in fourteen centres within two years, and would continue to maintain these numbers for the coming decade. he creation of many local art societies, such as the Fredericton Art Club and another at Charlottetown, were the immediate result of the formation of the MAA. Through the association's program of traveling exhibitions, lecture series, radio broadcasts on the arts, and various other activities, the Maritime Art Association positioned the arts to become an arena for regional discussion, appreciation and solidarity. The MAA‚Äôs exhibition programme of about eight shows per year was its most effective instrument for aesthetic development. The MAA annual exhibition, with its wide variety of regional artists and enthusiastic newspaper coverage, was perhaps the most successful strategy for constructing the identity of the regional art community. Its lecture circuit of speakers from both within and outside the Maritimes was highly promoted by the MAA, and radio talks and later a slide collection would also be part of its cultural mandate. Local squabbles and regional jealousies came to the forefront over the Association‚Äôs performance during World War II. Other internal problems arose from the diverse resources of the member organizations; others were the result of ineptitude. Nevertheless the MAA created an infrastructure for the promotion and dissemination of art in the Maritimes ‚Äì despite or perhaps in recognition of the difficulties imposed first by the Depression and then by the Second World War.  Maritime Art (Magazine)  With the aid of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, Walter Abell started the publication Maritime Art in 1940. The magazine helped to spread news of artists' work; in three years, Abell edited and designed fifteen issues. Following the Kingston Conference in June 1941, the magazine was refocused and renamed to Canadian Arts in 1943, with the help of the National Gallery of Canada.

The film stars Laxmikant Berde, Madhu Kambikar, Nilu Phule, Varsha Usgaonkar in lead roles and Mohan Agashe and Dilip Prabhavalkar in supporting roles. The film portrays the life of folk theater artist and is considered as one of the few films made on the life of tamasha artistes, including Pinjara (1972) and Natarang (2010). Laxmikant Berde, who is better known for his comic roles in Marathi and Hindi films, was appreciated for his role as Aburao. The film is based on a short story written by Jabbar Patel with screenplay and dialogues penned by the veteran Marathi writer, P. L. Deshpande (Pu. La.) after a hiatus of 39 years. Previously, Deshpande had written screenplay and dialogues for another Marathi film Gulacha Ganapati (1953) starring himself. The film won several awards and was adjudged as the Best Film at Maharashtra State Film Awards (1993). It also won two National Film Awards at the 40th National Film Awards (1992); Best Feature Film in Marathi and Best Choreography for Laxmibai Kolhapurkar. Kolhapurkar became the first choreographer and the first woman to win the National Film Award for choreography. The film also participated at the Indian Panorama, International Film Festival of India in 1993. Plot Film begins with Aburao (Laxmikant Berde), a famous film-star in Maharashtra, performing death rituals (≈örƒÅddha) for his mother, Manjula (Madhu Kambikar) in his hometown Begadewadi. As these rituals are usually performed with the shaved head, Aburao is forced to do it by wearing a wig so that he does not lose on the continuity of his films currently being shot. To capture on his popularity, rituals are also being covered by media. Exasperated with media attention, Aburao leaves the crematory and heads towards his mother's home, only to revisit his childhood memories. Film unfolds in flashback with Aburao, an illegitimate son of a tamasha dancer, Manjula. She left her dancing troupe and eventually became a mistress of a politician-landlord, Himmatrao Inamdar (Mohan Agashe). But sudden death of Inamdar forces Manjula and Aburao to join back the dance troupe; this time her sister Kausalya's troupe. While Manjula is being mentored by Nana (Nilu Phule), young Aburao gets fascinated by Nana's ability to make people laugh and aspires to be a \\"Songadya\\" (Clown) like him. Now grown up Aburao learns mimicry, singing and becomes famous for his political satirical jokes in the tamasha world. Once Aburao's school friend Gunawant (Dilip Prabhavalkar), who has now become a minister, attends his show. Amused by Aburao and his team's performance, Gunawant advises Aburao to form his own tamasha troupe. Following the advice, Aburao forms a new troupe along with Manjula and Nana. On achieving the success of 500th show, Aburao invites Gunawant for the felicitation program. Gunawant is also accompanied by film-star Menaka (Varsha Usgaonkar). She enjoys the performance and advises Aburao to join film industry. Initially reluctant Aburao gets convinced by Menaka and her associates in the industry. Having thought of doing only one film, Aburao eventually gets attracted towards fame and Menaka and leaves behind his troupe along with his pregnant girlfriend, Subhadra (Pooja Pawar). Eventually Menaka and Aburao get married but then soon he realizes that Menaka married him only to get away from her boyfriend Ravi (Tushar Dalvi). She also unknowingly confesses that she loves \\"Songadya\\" (Clown) in Aburao more than Aburao himself as clown diverts her attention from all the worries and bad past she had. Years later Nana visits Aburao along with a small girl, Jaai. Nana informs Aburao that Subhadra has died. He also reveals Jaai to be Aburao's own daughter from Subhadra and tells a strange thing about her that she has never smiled till date. Nana also requests Aburao to take care of Jaai henceforth. Aburao takes Jaai home which leads to clashes with Menaka and him. Menaka decides to leave Aburao to elope with Ravi. Over a period of time, Aburao tries all his tricks to make Jaai smile but she does not responds to any of them. She tells him that she expects a simple fairy tale from him like any other father would tell to his kid than his fun-making stories which makes other people happy and not her. Gunawant, chief minister now, convinces Aburao to join politics. Gaining the popularity as a politician, Aburao starts defying his own principles till Nana revisits him and reminds of his ethical responsibilities. Gunawant, on the other hands, wants to utilize Aburao and medicates to have him performed in the election rally. Suddenly Aburao gets the heart attack because of the given medication and also notices Jaai in the audience. Having realized this, he changes his speech into a fairy tale which upsets the audience. Everybody leaves except Aburao and Jaai to have their story finished which he narrates as a pure tale of joy. This makes Jaai smile and laugh. Aburao also becomes happy to realize the true meaning of love in the life.

The site was occupied at a time when the Lake Michigan shoreline extended further inland than it does today. It was excavated by researchers from Western Michigan University in the mid-1970s. The site was populated by Middle Woodland period peoples at two distinct times: one earlier occupation of relatively short duration (1 to 2 seasons) and a later occupation that lasted longer. The occupation was interrupted by what was likely a short rise in lake level or a heavy seasonal flood. Remains at the site indicate that the inhabitants subsisted on fall-spawning fish, and therefore the site represents an early experimentation in coastal living in the late fall and winter.

Shanghai County was first established in 1292 and finally abolished in 1992. Shanghai County was for most of its existence a part of Songjiang Prefecture, in Jiangsu Province, but later became a county under Shanghai Municipality. Shanghai County was historically the governing authority of the Shanghai's urban area and neighbouring areas. Its extent reduced with the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality and, later, Shanghai Municipality. Immediately before abolition, the county extended over a crescent-shaped area adjacent to, and surrounding, the southwest of Shanghai's city centre.  History  In 1290, Busa Hanwen (), the Jurchen governor of Songjiang Prefecture requested that Kublai Khan, as the Shizu emperor of Yuan, approve the division of Huating County into two, on the basis of administrative difficulty due to Huating's large area and dense population.„Ää‰∏äÊµ∑Ê∞ëÊóèÂøó„Äã>>Â§ß‰∫ãËÆ∞ The request was approved by the Yuan court in 1291 and Shanghai County was established in 1292. The first permanently appointed county governor, Zhou Ruji, arrived in 1294. Shanghai County offices from 1915 to 1933, in the Old City. From 1845, due to the establishment of foreign concessions in Shanghai, the area under the effective control of Shanghai County gradually reduced. By 1911, the areas under the effective control of the County included the Old City (the county seat) and surrounding areas, Zhabei and Xuhui, as well as the docklands by the Huangpu River which are today the central and northern part of Yangpu District, the western part of Changning District and the riverside part of Pudong District, as well as the western suburbs which are today part of Minhang District. These areas were known as the \\"Chinese area\\" of Shanghai. In 1927, Northern Expedition forces took over Shanghai. The Nationalist government established Shanghai Special Municipality in order to assert overarching Chinese control in Shanghai. The Special Municipality's seat was soon moved from the Old City to the Xujiahui area. In 1930, Shanghai Special Municipality was elevated to the same level as Shanghai County, both under Jiangsu Province, and the seat of Shanghai County was moved to Minhang township. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai County was abolished in 1939, but re-established at the end of the war in 1945. Under the People's Republic, various counties of Jiangsu Province, including Shanghai County, were handed to the province-level Shanghai Municipality in 1958. In the same year, various neighbouring townships and villages were moved into Shanghai County. In 1959, the new industrial area and township that formed Minhang Satellite City was carved out of Shanghai County to become Minhang District. Minhang District was absorbed into Xuhui District in 1964, but re-established in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, as urbanisation changed the character of Shanghai County, more of the county was moved into surrounding districts of Shanghai Municipality, or established as new development zones. In 1992, the remaining part of Shanghai County was merged with Minhang District to become the new Minhang District.

It was based on characters and storylines published by Marvel Comics, and written by Alex Irvine. The game was available as an Adobe Flash application via the social-networking website Facebook. It officially launched in Facebook at March 1, 2012. It was initially released as promotion for the 2012 Marvel Studios crossover film The Avengers. It won the award for Best Social Game on the G4tv.com Video Game Awards 2012. It was made available on iOS and Android devices on 13 June 2013. The servers running on Playdom's official website were announced to be discontinued, but the game continued to be available via Facebook. Disney shut down the game on September 30, 2016. Gameplay Players take control of an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and can fully customize the agent by gaining experience, leveling up, and equipping their agents with various weapons and uniforms obtained within the game. The player can also team up with two out of the current 166 available Marvel heroes in the game, each with their unique skills and abilities. While some heroes are locked and can only be recruited on some occasions, most of them are available for general recruitment, and can be bought with 'Command Points', one of the currency that appears in the game. Gameplay itself consists of turn-based fights that pit the player's agent and heroes against one or more waves of three or fewer enemies, with each character having unique attacks. There are six character classes: blaster, bruiser, scrapper, infiltrator, tactician and generalist. The first five classes have a specific strength and a specific weakness to one of the other classes, in a rock-paper-scissors style. Blasters have guaranteed critical hits against bruisers and ignore their defense stats. Bruisers increase their statistics when they attack or are attacked by scrappers. Scrappers have a second automatic attack (follow-up attack) against infiltrators. Infiltrators gain the ability to counter enemies' attacks after attacking or being attacked by tacticians, while the latter gain an extra turn when they attack or are attacked by blasters. The generalist class has no special strengths or weaknesses against other classes. Some playable heroes can switch classes during the game, and a character class may be changed with alternate costumes. The player has access to uniforms of all the classes. =Collections= Collections are a feature used to recruit new characters to your team, most of whom were previously Villains. It was first unveiled as part of Special Operations - Cry Havok. Collections can be completed by opening Lockboxes to collect Comic Book Covers. Collecting all eight unique Covers of the Collection will unlock the Hero. =Player Vs. Player (PVP)= For a limited time, Player Vs. Player (PVP) tournaments are available where the players fight to reach different tiers (Silver, Gold, Diamond, Vibranium and Adamantium). Players who placed at Adamantium tier at the end of the PvP season are awarded a new hero. PvP fighting can also be done during non- tournament times in practice mode only. =Special Operations (Spec Ops)= Special Operations are limited time challenges in which the player has to complete, at least, 25 tasks in order to obtain a new hero. Unique boss items can be acquired through battle, and special weapons or items are rewarded for every 5 tasks completed. The only exception has been the first Spec Ops mission, in which the player had to get 5 star mastery in all the missions. =Daily Missions= The daily mission is a 24-hour limited mission. These missions award elite rewards when completed and also include certain restrictions to be played. After the 24-hour window ends the mission is exchanged for a different one and any cumulative score the player had is returned to zero. =Simulator= The S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator is composed of two parts: Challenges and Villain Archive. The Challenges are a set of difficult fights with special conditions and rules which, if completed, earn the player a reward. The Villain Archive provides a brief biography of each villain and also a free fight simulation against them. Plot The player is a new S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit, dispatched by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, as an unknown event, referred as \\"The Pulse\\" causes a strange material known as Iso-8 to emerge on Earth. The material has various properties, but is primarily used in the game to power up characters. The player is charged with joining various heroes in battle to take down numerous villains who are all aiming to gather and use Iso-8 for their own nefarious purposes. As the game advances, more heroes join the conflict as playable characters. The game had 2 seasons; Season 1 was an original plot where Hydra was eventually revealed to be using Iso-8 to resurrect Red Skull, which results in Magneto turning over to fight alongside S.H.I.E.L.D.; Many other villains would follow suit. Season 2 was heavily inspired by the Fear Itself story-line but also contained other details such as Incursions as part of Time Runs Out, that would eventually lead into Secret Wars. Season 2 ended with the defeat of the Serpent, at the cost of the lives of Thor and Jane Foster (as Mighty Thor, who arrived via Incursion). Development Season 2 was expected to be released on the 18th of June, 2013 and featured new heroes and villains. On the 18th, Playdom said there would be a hold on its release. Season 2 was released on August 1. The game was available as a Facebook game. Playdom tried to migrate from it, first by hosting the game on their own page as well, and then by making Marvel Avengers Alliance 2 available only as a cell phone application. However, the Facebook community remained big.In Celebration of 'Marvel Avengers Alliance'! =End= Disney announced the end of the game on September 1, 2016. It was the end for both Marvel: Avengers Alliance and Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2, which had been released early in the year, in all platforms. The games were no longer available for new downloads or accept online payments, but were still available for players for a month. A final Special Operation was released, to close the plot of the game. The game completely ceased to be available on September 30. Related games =Marvel: Avengers Alliance Tactics= A related game to Marvel: Avengers Alliance was called Marvel: Avengers Alliance Tactics, which Playdom made for Facebook. Launched in June 2014, Tactics took the gameplay mechanics built in the original and applied them to an isometric 3D map, with the player choosing four of their agents or heroes for each mission. The game was shut down on October 22. =Marvel Avengers Alliance 2= A mobile-only sequel to Marvel Avengers Alliance, Marvel Avengers Alliance 2 was released in The Philippines on July 27, 2015, and worldwide on March 30, 2016. It has new characters as well as being in 3D. Disney canceled the game on September 30.

Biography His birth surname was Thiel. He graduated from Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg with a medical degree. He decided to emigrate to the United States in 1769, at which time he adopted the surname Cist, the initials of his birth name. He settled in Philadelphia in 1773 and learned printing. With Melchior Steiner, he established a printing and publishing business. During the American Revolution, they published many documents relating to current events, including Paine's The American Crisis. In 1781 the firm was dissolved, and Cist continued in business alone. Cist began the publication of The American Herald in 1784, and of the Columbian Magazine in 1786. Cist aided the colonial government during the revolution by endorsing large amounts of continental currency, which he was later compelled to redeem. He was the first person to introduce anthracite coal into general use in the United States. In 1792 he was a member of the Lehigh Coal Company, and brought several wagons full of this coal to Philadelphia, where he offered to give it away. But he could not dispose of it, and was threatened with mob violence for trying to impose on the people with a lot of black stones for coal. In 1793 he was secretary of the Fame Fire Association, and announced that the society had procured a fire- escape apparatus to save persons from burning houses by means of a bucket drawn up to the top of the building. During the administration of John Adams, he became public printer, and established an extensive printing office and book bindery in Washington, D.C., at great expense, for the purpose of publishing public documents. Family In 1781, he married Mary Weiss. Their son, also named Charles Cist, became a noted editor. Their other son Jacob Cist settled in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania and became key figure in the early development of Pennsylvania's anthracite industry.

Biography He was the son of printer Charles Cist. He was educated in Philadelphia, and during the War of 1812 was engaged in garrison duty in the eastern forts. After the war, he settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a few years later moved to Harmony, Pennsylvania, where he opened a store, and was for a time postmaster. During the winter of 1827/8 he moved to Cincinnati, where he opened and superintended the first Sunday school in Cincinnati, and continued it until it grew beyond his control, when it was divided among the churches. Cist also worked for the success of free schools. In 1843 Cist established The Western Weekly Advertiser, a family journal devoted to the early history of the First Nations of the west, and to statistics relating to Cincinnati and the state of Ohio. A few years later the name became Cist's Weekly Advertiser, and it continued until 1853. He prepared and published Cincinnati in 1841 (drawing largely on an 1815 work by Daniel Drake), Sketches and Statistics of Cincinnati in 1851, Sketches and Statistics of Cincinnati in 1859, and The Cincinnati Miscellany, the last composed largely of incidents in the early settlements, with many of his own writings (2 vols., 1845 and 1846). Family He married Janet White in 1817. They had 13 children. Their son Henry M. Cist was noted for his history of the Army of the Cumberland. Another son, Lewis Jacob Cist (born in Harmony, Pennsylvania, 20 November 1818; died in Cincinnati, Ohio, 30 March 1885), worked in banking, and was noted for his verses and his large collection of autographs and old portraits.

The Bregenz Forest Mountains are entirely located in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg.  Definition  The term Bregenz Forest Mountains refers to the range according to the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps (AVE); the term Bregenz Forest, by contrast, refers to a landscape or region which is part of the Bregenzer Ache basin area. As a result, the Bregenz Forest Mountains and the Bregenz Forest are not conterminous. The Bregenz Forest region also includes the southwestern parts of the Allg√§u Alps. On the other hand, the Bregenz Forest Mountains reach, to an extent, into the landscapes of the eastern Rhine Valley, as well as to the Walgau Valley of the Ill River and the Gro√ües Walsertal in the south. As the range is not geologically uniform, the name is rarely used outside of Alpine literature, is also not used in Vorarlberg state geography and land-use planning and belongs to one of the most disputed mountain groups in the AVE. According to an alternative orographically and hydrologically- oriented mountain range classification (Hubert Trimmel, 1962), the mountains belong to a Rhine Valley‚ÄìWalgau‚ÄìBregenz Forest group. Geography The mountain range is part of a landscape arranged in several tiers rising from the Rhine Valley in the west up to the adjacent Lechquellen Mountains. Most of the area is shaped by a Mittelgebirge character with extended forests and Alpine pastures, except for small High Alpine region in the southeast. =Neighbouring ranges= The Bregenz Forest Mountains are bordered by the following other Alpine ranges: * Allg√§u Alps (to the north and east) * Lechquellen Mountains (to the south) * R√§tikon (to the southwest) * Appenzell Alps (to the west) =Peaks= Glatthorn Klippern The main peaks of the Bregenz Forest Mountains include the following: see Coordinates Bregenz Forest Mountains * Glatthorn, 2,134 m * Dam√ºlser Mittagsspitze, 2,095 m * Diedamskopf 2,090 m * T√ºrtschhorn, 2,096 m * Hochblanken, 2,068 m * Klippern, 2,066 m * S√ºnser Spitze, 2,062 m * Gungern, 2,053 m * Ragazer Blanken, 2,051 m * Kanisfluh, main summit, 2,044 m * H√ºbscher B√ºhel, 2,032 m Other important and well-known peaks in the Bregenz Forest Mountains (in order of height): * Hohes Licht 2,009 m * Hoher Freschen 2,004 m * Hochrohkopf 1,975 m * Winterstaude 1,877 m * Hirschberg (Bizau) 1,834 m * M√∂rzelspitze, 1,830 m * Leuenkopf, 1,830 m * Hangspitze 1,746 m * Niedere 1,711 m * Hohe Kugel 1,645 m * Baumgartenalpe 1,624 m * Hoch√§lpelekopf, 1,467 m * Staufen 1,456 m * Renkknie 1,411 m * Br√ºggelekopf 1,182 m * Hirschberg (Langen) 1,095 m * Karren 971 m  Nature Conservancy  Due to the remoteness of some areas, there are many nature reserves that can be found in the Bregenz Forest Mountains. * Part of the Walserkamm and the whole Glatthorngruppe lie in the area of the 19.200 hectares UNESCO biosphere reserve Gro√ües Walsertal. * A total of nine Natura 2000 sites are located in the Bregenzerwald mountains with the Bregenzerach- Gorge, the Fohramoos, the Unter Stellerh√∂he area, the Unter der Winterstaude area, the Unterragenstein, the √úble Schlucht (Gorge) and the √úbersaxen- Satteins, Walsb√§chle and Torfriedbach areas. * The largest nature reserve area according to Vorarlberg national law, Hohe-Kugel - Hoher Freschen - Mellental, lies in the Bregenzerwald mountains, as well as the smaller nature reserves Farnacher Moos, Fohramoos, Auer Ried, Amatlina Vita, Gasserplatz and Bludescher Magerwiesen and the protected landscapes Haslach - Breitenberg, Klien and Montiola.  Tourism  = Mountain huts = In the Bregenzerwald mountains there are comparatively few alpine huts with overnight accommodation. This is due to the fact that the majority of the mountain tours can be undertaken as day trips from the valley valleys. Mountain huts run by the Austrian Alpine Club: * Freschenhaus (1846 m): open and serviced from mid- June to mid-October, 20 beds & 30 mattress storage, open but no service during winter with space for 13 camps, valley location: Laterns, walking time from Laterns: 2.5 hours. * Hoch√§lpeleh√ºtte (1460 m): open and serviced from mid-May to end-October, 16 camps in a mattress storage, also open during winter in accordance with opening times of local cable cars, valley location: Schwarzenberg, walking time from Schwarzenberg: 1.75 hours * Lustenauer H√ºtte (1250 m): open and services from May to October and December - April, 13 camps in a mattress storage, valley location: Schwarzenberg or B√∂dele, walking time from Schwarzenberg: 2 hours and 1 hour from B√∂dele There are many more huts and restaurants in this region. Therefore, it is advisable to inquire about the exact opening hours and the accessibility of the huts at the Alpenverein or in the valley resorts. = Long-distance Routes = The nordalpine long distance route (DE: Nordalpine Weitwanderweg 01) and the Limestone Alps Way (DE: Kalkalpenweg) runs through the central part of the Bregenzerwald mountain range with the following sections: * Section 17 runs from Z√ºrs to Dam√ºls The greater part of this section is still in the Lechquellen Mountains. It is only at the Faschina Pass (Faschinajoch) that the Bregenzerwald Forest is entered. * Section 18 runs from Dam√ºls to Bregenz via Alpe Portla, Hoher Freschen, M√∂rzelspitze, B√∂dele, Dornbirn. The Via Alpina, a cross-border hiking trail with five partial routes through the whole Alps, runs along the edge of the Bregenzerwald mountain range. The Red Trail of the Via Alpina runs as follows with two stages through the Bregenzerwald Mountains: * Stage R54 runs from Buchboden to St. Gerold (only the second half of this stage is in the Bregenzerwald mountains) * Stage R55 runs from St. Gerold to Feldkirch via R√∂ns, Schnifis and Satteins = Fixed Rope Routes = Geology and geography of the Bregenzerwald Mountains are not exactly conducive to the construction of climbing routes. As easy-to-get-on routes of the simplest level can still apply: * Binnelgrat (North Ridge) on the Hohen Freschen (2004 m) * Val√ºragrat (West Ridge) on the Hohen Freschen (2004 m) * Kugelsteig on the Hohe Kugel (1645m) * Bocksberg-Crossing on the Bocksberg (1461 m)  Literature / Maps  * Dieter Seibert: Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer Bregenzerwald- und Lechquellengebirge alpin.

His main contributions to chemistry include density functional theory development, and its applications to chemistry. Biography Yang was born in Chaozhou, Guangdong, China on March 31, 1961. He entered Peking University in 1978 as part of the first generation of college students after the Cultural Revolution. He received his BS in chemistry in 1982, after which he studied theoretical chemistry as a PhD student with Robert G. Parr at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He completed his PhD degree in 1986, and worked as a postdoc with Robert G. Parr (1986-1987) and William H. Miller (1988-1989). Yang currently works in the Department of Chemistry at Duke University since 1990, as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Philip Handler Professor of Chemistry. Contributions Yang's main contributions to theoretical chemistry range from fundamental theory to applications of density functional theory. He (with Parr) developed the concepts of the Fukui function, hardness, and softness in density functional theory. He also justified the theoretical ground of potential functional (as in Optimized-Effective-Potential methods) and fractional-number-of-electron approaches. The Lee‚ÄìYang‚ÄìParr (shortened to LYP) correlation functional by Yang and his coworkers is extensively used in chemistry and was the second most cited article in chemistry from 1999 to 2006. Yang developed the Divide and Conquer algorithm for linear-scaling density functional theory. In application, Yang also developed methods in QM/MM simulation for large chemistry and biology systems. His book with Robert G. Parr, Density- Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules, is considered to be the basic textbook in the field of density functional theory.

RedOne, BeatGeek and Joker provided instruments for the song and also programming for them. The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. \\"Invading My Mind\\" is an uptempo song, with a length of three minutes and twenty seconds (3:20). Melinda Newman of HitFix described \\"Invading My Mind\\" as being a \\"fast-paced, Euro-tinged, robotic dance thumper\\", while Swagata Panjari of Radio and Music called it a \\"groovy club banger\\" with \\"high energy beats\\". The song contains an almost \\"duplicate rhythm\\" to \\"On the Floor\\", but with \\"more prominent\\" electro keys and breaks that have \\"more of a groove feel\\" to them. The song received comparisons to Ace of Base's 1995 single \\"Beautiful Life\\" and to the music of Kylie Minogue. While working with RedOne, Lopez insists that he \\"brought the best out of her\\", something she credits to his Moroccan, Swedish and American heritage. Lopez stated that: \\"He's awesome. He's one of the nicest people and has a beautiful spirit. He can create something the whole world will love and that is probably to do with his international background. Some people can do dance, others can do urban or pop, but Nadir does it all and understand what makes a hit on every level\\".  Plagiarism allegations  In August 2011, Rebecca Francescatti, a Chicago-based singer, filed a lawsuit against Lady Gaga claiming that she had plagiarized elements of her 1999 recording \\"Juda\\" (It's All About You) for Gaga's 2011 single \\"Judas\\". Francescatti's lawyer told TMZ: \\"Though the songs are different styles, the composition is the same, and the chorus is the same melody. [Francescatti] is seeking recognition for what she created.\\" Francescatti noted that the similarities of the two songs could stem from the fact that her former bass player, Brian Gaynor, was now working for a company who wrote several tracks for Gaga's second album Born This Way (2011). Francescatti's lawyer claimed in December 2012 that Gaga used an additional unlicensed sample in \\"Judas\\" and then incorporated it into \\"Invading My Mind\\". It was alleged that Gaga asked Lopez for a credit on \\"Invading My Mind\\" to \\"cover her tracks\\", with Francescatti's lawyer claiming that she did not even contribute to the song. The lawsuit claimed to have uncovered text messages between Gaga and RedOne proving that she had stolen the sample loop used in both \\"Judas\\" and \\"Invading My Mind\\".  Critical response  \\"Invading My Mind\\" received generally positive acclaim from music critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: \\"Remember when the thought of Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or bad, you won't be able to get it out of your head.\\" Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between \\"On the Floor\\" and \\"Invading My Mind\\" Lopez is \\"really made a glittery return to her extreme club/\\"Waiting for Tonight\\" roots\\". She continued by stating: \\"Sure, '[Invading My] Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, but this one is up from the first second... and never goes down\\". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on \\"Invading My Mind\\" RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the \\"hit potential\\", while Lopez \\"brings the heat\\". She continued by stating that the song is an \\"irresistible '80s euphoria and release\\". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey, who although stated that the song isn't anything \\"we haven't heard before,\\" it is worthy of a standalone release. Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots disagreed, stating that \\"the lyrics are a little repetitive to be a feature single\\", but it could, however, be a \\"great follow up to 'On the Floor' if you want to listen back to back and keep dancing\\". A staff member from Idolator stated that: \\"In a parallel universe, we could definitely hear Gaga herself singing 'Invading My Mind,' though it has more in common with early tracks from Fame than anything the p-p-p-pointy-faced provocateur has done lately\\". He also stated that the verses of the song \\"remind us an awful lot of Lopez's current RedOne- produced hit 'On the Floor'.\\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that \\"Lopez shines\\" on the Love? album cuts which clock at and above 120 bpm, except for what he said was the \\"throwaway\\" song \\"Invading My Mind\\". Cinquemani mockingly called the song's lyrics \\"poetry\\", referring to the line: \\"freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip, drip, drop\\".

Founded in 1854, it amalgamated with what would become Plymouth University in 1989. The main building was located at Earl Richards Road North Exeter from the 1970s with some facilities based at Barts until the early 1980s. Graphics was based on Gandy Street in the old School of Art buildings until it relocated to the main site in 1984. The Printmaking department was initially located at The Mint. The Art College offered higher education courses including Foundation, BA (Hons) and Combination courses with the University of Exeter as well as MA/Pg diplomas. Disciplines were, Fine Art Ceramics, Graphics, Painting, Printmaking, Photography, Sculpture and 4D (Film, Video, Sound). The Priory Press was introduced by Alan Richards and Bernard Beard in association with The Bartholomew Print Workshop in the 1960s and produces limited edition handmade printed books. History The School of Art was founded in Exeter in 1854 as part of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and promoted by Edward Bowring Stephens a local sculptor. In 1858 decorative designer Kent Kingdon offered a ¬£5 prize for a decorative design. In 1951 The Exeter School of Art was renamed as the Exeter Central College of Art. Clifford Fishwick (1923-1997) was appointed Painting Master in 1947 and was principal of the college from 1958 to 1984 a skilled painter having trained at Liverpool School of Art, he was a friend of Peter Lanyon and exhibited regularly with the Penwith Society of Arts. Fishwick is now regarded as an important, if underrated figure in post-war British painting and one of the better artists of the St Ives group. In 1966 students print work was featured in an exhibition entitled \\"An Approach to Printmaking in Exeter\\" at The Whitechapel Gallery, London. In 1973 the College was renamed again as Exeter College of Art and Design and a new building opened at Earl Richards Road North on the outskirts of Exeter. In 1976 painting tutor John Butler set up The Spacex (art gallery) which became a registered educational charity in 1990. The college amalgamated with Polytechnic South West based in Plymouth in 1989 and in 2007 the facilities moved permanently to the Plymouth Campus.

He was disqualified, and stripped of his silver medal and later suspended after testing positive for anabolic steroids. Olympics Tomas Johansson made his Olympic debut in Los Angeles in 1984. His aim was a gold medal, stating before the games that wrestling was one of the sports that had been weakened the most by the Olympic boycott. After losing the final to American Jeffrey Blatnick, Johansson claimed a silver medal. That medal was stripped a couple of days later when it was found that he had tested positive for anabolic steroids. The Swede was banned for 18 months. In 1988, having won medals in two straight world championships, Johansson was unfortunate to be drawn against the eventual gold medal winner Aleksandr Karelin in the opening match of the Olympic games of Seoul. Johansson lost that bout but went on winning the three next to claim a bronze medal. During the four next years, leading up to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Tomas Johansson won two more World Championship medals. Every international championship during these years was won by Aleksandr Karelin, so Johansson was fortunate when he was drawn at the opposite side of the olympic tournament. After an initial tie against Hungarian L√°szl√≥ Klauz, Johansson won three bouts to reach the Gold medal match. Karelin, having won three of his first four games by fall, did this once again, after 93 seconds. After having won his last World championship medal in 1993, Johansson struggled during the years until the 1996 Olympics. There, he won two of his first four bouts, but losing the other two, thereby reaching a match of 7th and 8th places against Japan's Kenichi Suzuki (wrestler). Tomas Johansson won this, his final Olympic match, by fall.

The species' distinctive features include its long, tapering spathes with unfused margins, its white flowers, and its many-flowered lower cymes. It can be found in grasslands and Brachystegia- dominated woodland. It is fairly unusual among Commelina species in having variation in the color of the antherodes (i.e. non-functional anthers), with some individuals having entirely yellow antherodes, while others contain a dark spot in the center. Also, it is one of the only Commelina species known to leave a papery residue of dried fluid inside its spathes; normally only fused-spathe species are known to produce this substance. Only one specimen from Angola resembles this species, but it has blue flowers, suggesting it may be a poorly understood and as-yet undescribed separate species. Commelina hockii is probably closely related to Commelina kituloensis, which shares a similar fruit type, the same tufted perennial habit, similar large spathes with dried fluid substance, and equally numerously flowered inflorescences. That species differs in having purplish flowers, hairy leaves, shorter spathes, and a preference for high altitude grassland.

Heritage listing  Finley is a rare pioneer station group with the building and platform located at ground level (Yass Town railway station being the only such other building). The building is an adaptation of the standard terminus pioneer station building and has the added interest of having a raised platform added at a later date adjacent to the building.

Artists in the movement include Greg Curnoe, Tony Urquhart, Murray Favro, Ron Martin and Jack Chambers. The movement was composed of a group of artists who acknowledged their home as the centre and subject of creative activity; who acknowledged yet refused to situate themselves in the art world of the metropolitan centre; who refused to participate in ‚Äòmovements‚Äô. In fact, the term \\"regionalism\\" was adopted by the community in a spirit of defiance after a Toronto critic used it in a derisive way to describe the scene. The movement is jokingly referred to as not an \\"ism\\" at all, but \\"a group of artists who had decided to stay home.\\" As Canadian curator and art historian Terrence Heath wrote: \\"In the late sixties and seventies, Canadian artists and writers from coast to coast embraced the belief that art can only be made out of the specifics of life, place and time. Curnoe was one of many, but he was a leader and one of the strongest voices....It was not that they rejected all art made in what are called ‚Äòart centres‚Äô per se, but that they rejected the right of any person or group to prescribe what art should be....They sought out and found, in their own lives and localities, the stuff of their art.\\" Art historian Mark Cheetham maintains that Jack Chambers's \\"theory of 'perceptual realism' challenges parochial notions of regionalism.\\"Cheetham, Mark.

It was established in 1794 by Joseph Colen, the chief factor at York Factory, who thought it inefficient to use canoes on the lower river. Here boats from York Factory were unloaded and goods placed in canoes for the more difficult journey upstream. By 1798 32 low-wage men were able to carry in 4 boats cargo that formerly required 72 highly paid voyageurs. Rock Depot was a transfer point and not intended as a trading post. In 1812 extra facilities were built for Lord Selkirk's Red River Colony. In 1820 George Simpson (administrator) met William Williams here. He proposed that record-keeping be moved back to York Factory because of the low quality of the up-country clerks. In 1821, when the HBC merged with the Northwest Company, many of the details were worked out at a meeting at Rock Depot. With the establishment of Norway House Rock Depot declined since it was too far from the Athabasca country and the sources of pemmican. It is said that the first Protestant marriage in western Canada was performed here in 1820 (Reverend John West married Thomas Bunn, in charge of Rock Depot, to Phoebe Sinclair.).

Monumental brasses Two monumental brasses which formerly adorned a tomb-monument of Richard Fortescue exist in Filleigh Church, having been removed from their original setting in the old parish church of Filleigh, demolished c. 1730 to make way for landscaping surrounding the Palladian mansion of Castle Hill, which was a re-modelling of Richard Fortescue's ancient manor house. Both are now affixed within Victorian wooden frames on the north wall of the nave of the new parish church of St Paul, built in 1732 some half mile away from its former location next to the manor house. There are two heraldic escutcheons on each brass, in poor condition with parts torn away. =Brass of Richard Fortescue= Monumental brass depicting Richard Fortescue, Filleigh Church quartered arms: 1: Fortescue; 2: Denzil; 3: de Filleigh ; 4: de Weare (or Trewin) 25px; 2nd & 3rd grand quarters: Gules, a chevron between three stag's heads cabossed or (Hagget of Kent) The right-hand (easternmost) brass on the nave wall depicts Richard Fortescue as a heavily bearded figure dressed in armour kneeling towards the left at a prie-dieu, with his helmet and gauntlets on the floor. It is inscribed below in Gothic script: > \\"Here lyeth Richard Ffortescue of Ffylleygh, Esquier, who dyed on the last > daye of June in the yere of oure lorde god 1570\\" On either side are two escutcheons. That on the dexter shows the arms of Fortescue in the first quarter with three other quarterings. The escutcheon is surmounted by a crest, apparently a plain shield, in Latin scutum, alluding to the Latinized family name de Forti ScutoAblative case of Forte Scutum; although clearly not the name of a manor or a location of an ancient family seat, scribes nevertheless prefixed the name with de, Latin for \\"from\\" meaning \\"(from) a strong shield\\".

The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eiger√∏ya, then in Danish Norway, the opposing forces engaged in protecting their respective countries' trade routes to the Baltic Sea. War between Britain and the Batavian Republic began, undeclared, in the spring of 1795 after the Admiralty ordered British warships to intercept Batavian shipping following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795. A British squadron of four frigates under the command of Captain James Alms was patrolling the entrance to the Skagerrak in August 1795 when three sails were spotted off the Norwegian coast to the north. Closing to investigate, the ships were discovered to be a Batavian squadron of two frigates and a small cutter. In the face of the larger British squadron the Batavian force turned away, sailing southeast along the Norwegian coast with the British approaching from the south in an effort to cut them off from the neutral Danish shore. At 16:15 the leading British ship HMS Stag caught and engaged the rearmost Batavian ship Alliantie (cdr. Claas JagerA.J. van der Aa, Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, bevattende levensbeschrijvingen van zoodanige personen, die zich op eenigerlei wijze in ons vaderland hebben vermaard gemaakt, Volume 19 (Van Brederode 1878), p. 71); the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the Batavian squadron. For an hour Alliantie held out against the more powerful Stag and was eventually compelled to surrender. The remainder of the Batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate Argo, reaching the safety of the Danish harbour at Eiger√∏ya. Background In the winter of 1794‚Äì1795 the armies of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic, reforming the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic. The Dutch Republic was part of the Coalition against Republican France formed in the War of the First Coalition at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, and their closest ally in Northern Europe was Great Britain.Chandler, p. 44 In Britain the Admiralty was alarmed by developments in the Netherlands, particularly the seizure of the Dutch Navy by French cavalry units while the fleet was frozen into its winter harbour, and gave orders that the Royal Navy was to detain Dutch merchant and naval ships. As a result, the Batavian Republic and Great Britain began an undeclared war in the spring of 1795.Woodman, p. 53 In response to the threat that the Batavian fleet posed, the Admiralty established a new British fleet to oppose it. The Admiralty named this force, under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan, the North Sea Fleet. The fleet was based at Yarmouth in East Anglia and consisted mainly of older and weaker second-line vessels.Gardiner, p. 170 Duncan was also provided with a number of frigates, essential in securing the safe movement of the Baltic trade. Much of Britain's vital naval stores were obtained from Scandinavia and the trade routes through the Baltic Sea and North Sea were vital to the maintenance of the Royal Navy. One Navy squadron that sailed from The Downs on 8 August 1795 with instructions to cruise off the mouth of the Skaggerak in the Eastern North Sea, consisted of four ships: 36-gun HMS Reunion under Captain James Alms, 32-gun HMS Stag under Captain Joseph Sydney Yorke, 50-gun HMS Isis under Captain Robert Watson and 28-gun HMS Vestal under Captain Charles White. The Scandinavian trade routes were equally important for the Batavian Navy, and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast along the coast of Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.Gardiner, p. 183 Battle Plan of engagement between Isis, Reunion, Stag and Vestal and the Dutch frigate Alliantie, 22 Aug 1795; sketch c. 1795, by Nicholas Pocock With their ships heavily outnumbered by the approaching British, the Batavian squadron made all sail along the coastline with the intention of sheltering in the neutral Danish harbour of Eiger√∏ya (referred to in British sources as Egeroe or Eger√∂). Sighting the Batavian ships to the north, Alms ordered his squadron to give chase. Soon the fastest British ship, Stag made use of favourable wind to pull ahead of the others and at 16:15 succeeded in cutting off the rearmost Batavian vessel Alliantie from its companions. Although Alliantie with its 36-guns was a stronger ship than the 32-gun Stag, its main battery was of only 12-pounder cannon compared to Yorke's 18-pounder guns. This, coupled with the presence nearby of the rest of the British squadron meant that Alliantie, in the words of naval historian William James, \\"from the first, had no chance of success.\\"James, p. 292 Despite the odds against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship alongside Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for an hour before the Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eiger√∏ya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eiger√∏ya before Alms could intercept them. Aftermath Alms sent the captured Alliantie back to Britain under the command of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of Stag and gave despatches to the Admiralty to Lieutenant William Huggell of Reunion to deliver.James, p. 293 He himself remained at sea with the squadron, completing their assigned patrol. British casualties included four killed and 13 wounded on Stag, one killed and three wounded on Reunion and two wounded on Isis. Only Vestal escaped without any damage or casualties. Batavian casualties in the engagement are not known due to the failure of Alms to record Alliantie's losses in his report to the Admiralty, an omission which James criticises him for. It is known that Argo lost two men killed and 15 wounded in the chase.Clowes, p. 493 The surviving Batavian ships remained at anchor in the Eiger√∏ya channel until the spring of 1796 when they successfully returned to the Netherlands.Brenton, p. 93 Alliantie was subsequently taken to Spithead and purchased for the Royal Navy as the frigate HMS Alliance, for which prize money was distributed to the crews of the British ships, shared equally among them. The sailors on Isis alone shared ¬£240 (the equivalent of ¬£ as of ). Over the ensuing months and years, Duncan's fleet was largely successful in protecting the North Sea trade routes from the depredations of raiders from the Batavian ports and in 1797 inflicted a crushing defeat on the Batavian fleet at the Battle of Camperdown.Gardiner, p. 176 Meanwhile, the reaction in the Batavian Republic was one of great indignation. In a resolution of 3 September 1795 the Provisionele Representanten van het Volk van Holland, the Dutch representative at the Danish Court, Christiaan Bangeman Huygens, was ordered to complain about the violation of Danish neutrality (as Norwegian/Danish pilots had already gone aboard the Dutch ships, indicating that those had entered Danish territorial waters, as the resolution noted) and to demand that Denmark would make representations at the Court of St. James's to obtain the return of the Alliantie.Jan Wagenaar, Vaderlandsche historie,: vervattende de geschiedenissen der vereenigde nederlanden, zints den aanveng der noord- americaansche onlusten, en den daar uit gevolgden oorlog tusschen engeland en deezen staat, tot den tegenwoordigen tyd (Johannes Allaart 1803), pp. 130-131; Martinus Stuart, Nieuwe Nederlandsche Jaarboeken [van het Koningrijk der Nederlanden], Vol 30 (Amsterdam 1795), p.5556 The new commander-in-chief of the Batavian navy, admiral De Winter issued a proclamation equally denouncing the British action and praising the conduct of the Dutch vessels (confirming that the Argo, under command of Cdr. Van Dirckinck, had lost two killed and 15 injured), earning the admiration of the Norwegian citizens of Eiger√∏ya (which he calls by the Dutch name Kerkhaven). In this proclamation he also suggests that the Batavian brigs Echo, Gier and Mercuur in reprisalIn this he was mistaken as the flotilla of the three brigs actually had taken the British merchantmen (and a British brig, the \\"Nantie of Air\\" [sic], master Joseph Leid) on 19 August, which may have caused the British to attack the two Batavian frigates on 22 August; cf.Gerrit Dirk Bom \\"D'Vrijheid\\" 1781-1797: geschiedenis van een vlaggeschip (Bom 1897), p. 123 had stopped four British merchantmen and brought them into KristiansandStuart, op. cit., pp. 5774‚Äì5775 A letter of representative Bangeman Huygens of 19 September 1795 to the Provisionele Representanten reports that the Danish government indeed made representations to the British government (evidently without resultGreat Britain had declared war on the Batavian Republic on 15 September 1795; cf. Bom, op.cit., p. 124) and that the sailors of the British prize ships in the port of Kristiansand had been delivered to the British Consul \\"John Mischell\\" (sic) on 22 August 1795.Decreeten van de Provisioneele repr√¶sentanten van het volk van Holland. 26 January 1795--2 Maart 1796, Volume 5, Part 1 ('Lands drukkerij, 1798), pp. 484-486 The officers and men of the captured frigate Alliantie were not so lucky. Letters from two Dutch officers (Bakker and Gras) of the ship to the Board of Admiralty of the Royal Navy show that they were still prisoners of war in Ashford, Kent in early 1796.

In the summer of 1803, when war broke out between the United Kingdom and the French Consulate, Saint-Domingue had been almost completely overrun by Haitian forces commanded by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. In the north of the country, the French forces were isolated in the two large ports of Cap Fran√ßais and M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas and a few smaller settlements, all supplied by a French naval force based primarily at Cap Fran√ßais. At the outbreak of war on 18 May 1803, the Royal Navy immediately despatched a squadron under Sir John Duckworth from Jamaica to cruise in the region, seeking to eliminate communication between the French outposts and to capture or destroy the French warships based in the colony. On 28 June, the squadron encountered a French convoy from Les Cayes off M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, capturing one ship although the other escaped. Two days later, an independently-sailing French frigate was chased down and captured in the same waters. On 24 July, another British squadron intercepted the main French squadron from Cap Fran√ßais, which was attempting to break past the blockade and reach France. The British, led by Commodore John Loring gave chase, but one French ship of the line and a frigate escaped. Another ship of the line was trapped against the coast and captured after coming under fire from Haitian shore batteries. The remainder of the squadron was forced to fight two more actions on their return to Europe but eventually reached the Spanish port of Corunna. On 3 November, the frigate HMS Blanche captured a supply schooner near Cap Fran√ßais, and by the end of the month, the garrison was starving and agreed terms with Dessalines that permitted it to evacuate safely if it left the port by 1 December. Commodore Loring, however, refused the French permission to sail. The French commander, Rochambeau, procrastinated until the last possible moment but eventually was forced to surrender to the British commander. One of Rochambeau's ships was almost wrecked while it left the harbour but was saved by a British lieutenant acting alone, who not only rescued the 900 people on board but also refloated the ship. At M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, General Louis de Noailles refused to surrender and instead sailed to Havana, Cuba in a fleet of small vessels on 3 December but was intercepted and mortally wounded by a Royal Navy frigate. The few remaining French-held towns in Saint-Domingue surrendered soon afterwards, and on 1 January 1804, the newly-independent nation of Haiti was declared. Background During the French Revolutionary Wars (1792‚Äì1802), the wealthy French colony of Saint-Domingue on the western half of the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea was the scene of heavy fighting. In addition to unsuccessful British and Spanish invasions, the colony was wracked by a brutal civil war as the black population of newly emancipated slaves, under the command of Toussaint Louverture, fought forces from the French Republic before allying themselves with the Republic against foreign invaders.Brenton, p. 274 By 1801, Louverture had seized control of almost the entire island, including much of the neighbouring colony of Santo Domingo. Louverture officially pledged allegiance to France, declaring himself the island's governor. However, following the Peace of Amiens in Europe that brought an end to the French Revolutionary Wars in 1802, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte sent a large expeditionary force to Saint-Domingue under General Charles Leclerc.Brenton, p. 275 Leclerc's army had some initial success and Louverture was captured after signing a peace treaty with the French general, later dying in unclear circumstances in a French prison.Woodman, p. 179 However, following Louverture's arrest and under threat of the restoration of slavery, the Haitian general Jean Jacques Dessalines renewed the campaign against the French. Leclerc and much of his army died in an epidemic of yellow fever in the autumn of 1802, and command fell to the Vicomte de Rochambeau, whose forces were rapidly driven back into a few well fortified towns, relying for communication and supply on maritime links.Brenton, p. 277 In May 1803, the situation in Haiti deteriorated still further for the French when Britain and France once again went to war, after a peace lasting just fifteen months. In preparation for the coming conflict, the French had ordered a number of ships to sail from their southern ports in Saint-Domingue, the frigate Franchise sailing en flute from Port-au-Prince on 3 May. Franchise was however intercepted in the Bay of Biscay by a British battle squadron and captured on 28 May, as was the corvette Bacchante on 25 June which had sailed in April.James, p. 186 The remaining French naval forces in the colony were consolidated at the port of Cap Fran√ßais.Brenton, p. 278 The Blockade Rear-admiral Sir John Duckworth who commanded the blockade The Royal Navy was well prepared for the renewed conflict, with a squadron of ships of the line and numerous frigates based at the Jamaica station, the Navy's western Caribbean base, under Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth. On 18 June 1803 two squadrons were sent to enact a blockade of the principal northern ports in French hands, Cap Fran√ßais to the east and M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas to the west.James, p. 207 The first squadron, which cruised off M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas consisted of the 74-gun ships of the line HMS Cumberland under Captain Henry William Bayntun, HMS Goliath under Captain Charles Brisbane and HMS Hercule under the acting command of Lieutenant John B. Hills.James, p. 187 The second squadron, assigned to the blockade of Cap Fran√ßais, was commanded by Commodore John Loring in HMS Bellerophon and included HMS Elephant under Captain George Dundas, HMS Theseus under Captain John Bligh and HMS Vanguard under Captain James Walker. Loring's force was accompanied by the frigates HMS Aeolus under Captain Andrew Fitzherbert Evans and HMS Tartar under Captain John Perkins. =Actions off M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas= On 28 June, the squadron off M√¥le-Saint- Nicolas sighted two sails close to the Haitian shoreline and closed to investigate. These were revealed to be the French heavy 44-gun frigate Poursuivante under Captain Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez and the 16-gun corvette Mignonne under Captain Jean-Pierre Bargeau. The French ships had sailed with a reduced armament from Les Cayes in southern Saint-Domingue on 26 June with orders to visit M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas before returning to France. On identifying the ships as French, the British squadron separated under orders from Bayntun, the senior captain. Captain Brisbane was instructed to chase Mignonne, Goliath rapidly closing the gap between the ships as they exchanged a few distant shot without effect. Mignonne was becalmed close inshore, and when it became apparent that his ship would be caught by the far larger Goliath, Captain Bargeau surrendered without either side having suffered any damage or casualties. Mignonne was later commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Mignonne.Clowes, p. 317 Bayntun had also ordered Lieutenant Hills to pursue Poursuivante, but Hercule suffered in the light winds, and Hills ordered Hercule's broadside to be fired much too early. This allowed Willaumez to pull much closer to M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas. When the much faster Hercule did find the find wind, the ship of the line soon gained on the frigate and a sharp exchange of fire followed, in which both ships were damaged. Hercule was hit heavily in the sails and rigging, although casualties were limited to a few minor wounds, while Poursuivante was more severely damaged: the rigging, sails, masts and hull were all cut and battered with six men killed and 15 wounded. During the brief battle, Willaumez had manoeuvered his ship close to the shoreline, and Hills, his ship less manageable due to damage, suffered a devastating raking broadside that forced him to pull off in fear that Hercule might be grounded in shallow water. Working through the shallows, Willaumez managed to bring his frigate safely to M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas and then subsequently to Rochefort, although Poursuivante was soon afterwards decommissioned due to age and poor condition. Hills was forced to retire with his ship to Jamaica for repairs, his ship's place taken in Bayntun's squadron by Vanguard.James, p. 188 Two days after the engagement between Hercule and Poursuivante, Vanguard and Cumberland were cruising off the northern coast of Haiti to the east of M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas when another strange ship was sighted attempting to enter the nearby port of Jean-Rabel. This ship was the 40-gun French frigate Cr√©ole under Captain Jean-Marie-Pierre Lebastard, travelling to Jean-Rabel from Cap Fran√ßais with 530 troops under General Morgan. The ship was however in a poor state, the crew reduced to only 150 due to the yellow fever epidemic which had devastated the crews of the French ships in Saint- Domingue as well as the army ashore. Both Vanguard and Cumberland immediately gave chase to the frigate, which was unable to escape as a ship of the line rapidly overhauled Lebastard's vessel on either side. Walker fired a few shot from Vanguard at the frigate, and Lebastard fired a single shot in reply before striking his colours. Cr√©ole was subsequently conveyed to Port Royal in Jamaica for repairs and was there commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Creole under Captain Austin Bissell, but the ship was in a poor state, and foundered on the voyage to Britain, although the crew were saved by nearby British vessels.Clowes, p. 318 A French naval schooner was also captured by the squadron the same day, carrying a hundred bloodhounds from Cuba for use by the French armies in Saint-Domingue against their Haitian enemies. =Flight of Touffet= Capture of French brig Lodi by HMS Racoon on 11 July 1803 off L√©og√¢ne In the month following the capture of Cr√©ole there was little further movement from the French naval forces on the island, the yellow fever raging in the harbours and Loring's blockade squadron at sea constraining operations. The only action of any note during this period was fought off L√©og√¢ne in the Gulf of Gon√¢ve on the afternoon of 11 July when the 10-gun French brig Lodi was intercepted by the 18-gun British brig HMS Racoon under Austen Bissell, and forced to surrender after an action lasting 40 minutes in which the British ship had one man wounded and the French one killed and 14 wounded. In late July the strategic situation altered when orders arrived from France demanding the return of the French squadron, primarily based at Cap Fran√ßais under Contre-Admiral Latouche Tr√©ville.Clowes, p. 321 Command of the returning squadron was given to Commodore Qu√©rangal in the Duquesne, a 74-gun ship Consolidating enough healthy sailors to crew three of his ships, Latouche Tr√©ville gave orders for Duquesne, the 74-gun ship Duguay-Trouin under Captain Claude Touffet that following a recent accident only carried 54 guns,Clowes, p. 322 and the 40-gun frigate Guerri√®re under Captain Louis-Alex Beaudoin to sail from Cap Fran√ßais when it became possible. On the afternoon of 24 July, a rain squall drove the blockade force away from the post and Qu√©rangal's ships slipped out of the harbour, initially sailing westwards with the prevailing wind. All were in a weakened state, none with full crews and all carrying large numbers of sick passengers aboard. The French ships were sighted almost immediately by the frigates of Loring's blockade squadron, which began pursuit. At 21:00, Qu√©rangal took advantage of the darkness to divide his ships, Duguay-Trouin tacking to the east while Duquesne continued following the shoreline to the west. In response, Loring ordered Dundas in Elephant to chase Duguay-Trouin while he remained in pursuit of Duquesne with Aeolus and Tartar.Brenton, p. 282 During the night both British pursuits gained significant ground on their targets, Loring joined by Theseus and Vanguard. At 07:00 on 15 July, Qu√©rangal's ship was sighted by a Haitian battery on shore and came under fire, Loring sending Theseus to investigate the gunfire and arriving on the scene himself soon afterwards, Tartar and Vanguard leading the squadron. Perkins was the first to come within range of the French ship, opening fire at 15:30, followed soon afterwards by Walker. Qu√©rangal returned fire briefly, but his ship was too weak to face the British force, having only 275 crewmen aboard of whom only 215 were fit for duty. Duquesne was so poorly- manned that only 12 guns could be crewed at any one time, although one shot did strike Vanguard, killing one man and wounding another. Before the British ships could take up more effective firing positions however, Qu√©rangal surrendered. His ship was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Duquesne, but was broken up in 1804 following damage in an accident at Morant Cays.James, p. 192 Scale model of the Duquesne, on display at the Mus√©e de la Marine in Toulon The second pursuit, that of Dundas in Elephant and Touffet in Duguay-Trouin continued throughout the night, the British ship coming within range of the French at 06:00 on 25 July. Touffet opened fire on Elephant with his stern- mounted guns, striking the British ship several times, although without serious effect. Dundas was able, despite the French fire, to pull up at some distance from the French starboard quarter, firing broadsides although at such long range that they too had little effect. The action was decided soon afterwards by the arrival of two ships, the 18-gun British sloop HMS Snake under Commander William Roberts to the northwest and the absent Guerri√®re from the opposite direction. Dundas considered that the arrival of the frigate favoured the French too much, and dropped back allowing both ships to combine and escape. This was a serious miscalculation: historian William Laird Clowes notes that the French ships were both desperately under-armed and undermanned and even if they fought alongside one another they would have been unable to match Dundas's weight or rate of shot. By the time night fell, the French ships had reached open water in preparation for the journey across the Atlantic. Touffet's voyage was however far from over: on 29 August while in the Eastern Atlantic close to the Bay of Biscay, they were spotted by the independently cruising 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea under Captain John Maitland, which gave chase, the French ships turning southwards toward the friendly-neutral port of Ferrol in Spain. Throughout the following day, Boadicea followed the French squadron, losing them during the night of 30 August in a fog, but rediscovering them at 13:30 on 31 August when the wind shifted from the west to the northeast. Maitland could now see that Duguay- Trouin was a ship of the line, but was also aware that weakened ships were travelling to Europe from Saint-Domingue and consequently closed with Touffet's force, firing on his ship from a distance of at 14:00, the French ship of the line returning fire. The fire from Duguay-Trouin was fierce enough that, in combination with the approaching Guerri√®re, Maitland considered that they were too powerful for Boadicea to effectively fight and he sheered away, briefly followed by the French ships. At 14:50 however, with Boadicea rapidly widening the gap between the forces, Touffet abandoned the chase, turning southwards towards Ferrol.James, p. 193 At Ferrol, a British battle squadron cruised off the port under the command of Commodore Sir Edward Pellew, HMS Culloden under Captain Barrington Dacres sailing at some distance from the remainder of the squadron. On 2 September, Touffet's small squadron appeared to windward sailing for the port of Corunna and Dacres was well situated to intercept them, opening fire at long range at 11:50. The French were faster than Culloden however, Duguay-Trouin successfully entering Corunna ahead of Guerri√®re as the Spanish batteries opened fire on the British ship. Although Dacres managed to damage Guerri√®re's masts and rigging severely, inflicting casualties of six killed and 15 wounded, the French frigate was able to enter Corunna ahead of Culloden. Dacres, who had brought his ship right into the entrance to the port was forced to retire, having suffered four men wounded.Clowes, p. 323 =Surrender of Cap Fran√ßais= With the removal of the ships of the line from the squadron at Saint-Domingue, the only remaining force of any significance was based at Cap Fran√ßais, consisting mainly of the frigates Surveillante, Clorinde and Vertu. In September, the southern port of Les Cayes surrendered, the garrison capitulating to the British brig HMS Pelican, while in the north Captain Bligh in Theseus bombarded Fort Labouque at the harbour of Fort Dauphin, an important anchorage for small craft resupplying the garrison of Cap Fran√ßais, on 8 September. The fort rapidly surrendered, as did a 20-gun corvette Sagesse, which was at anchor nearby but with only 75 men aboard. Fort Dauphin also capitulated later in the day, the French prisoners requesting that Bligh intercede with the Haitian forces nearby which had captured a number of soldiers including General Dumont and were intending to execute them. Bligh successfully obtained the release of Dumont and transported all of the prisoners, including many suffering from yellow fever, to Cap Fran√ßais. While Loring remained off Northern Saint- Domingue, the brig Raccoon was active against ships travelling between Saint- Domingue and Spanish-held Cuba, destroying two small convoys in September and October.Brenton, p. 287 General de Rochambeau in Saint Domingue who surrendered to John Loring In October, Latouche-Tr√©ville obtained free passage from the British due to his poor health, and returned to France leaving Captain Jean-Baptiste Barr√© in command of the squadron. Attempts were still made however to supply the ports, which were under siege by Haitian forces. On 3 November the frigate HMS Blanche under Captain Zachary Mudge discovered an armed cutter in Mancenille Bay carrying 52 bullocks to the garrison of Cap Fran√ßais and Mudge sent boats under Lieutenant Nicholls of the Royal Marines into the bay during the night. Nicholls, despite unhelpful interference from Lieutenant Warwick Lake of Blanche, successfully cut the ship out from under French shore batteries, losing two killed and two wounded to French losses of two killed and four wounded.Woodman, p. 183 In early November, Captain Walker in Vanguard took 850 French soldiers as prisoners of war from the port of Saint-Marc, General D'Henin surrendering his garrison after Dessalines's advancing forces had threatened to massacre them all. Captured in the harbour were the 12-gun corvette Papillon, naval schooner Courier and the transports Mary Sally and Le Trois Amis. On 16 November, Vanguard captured an American merchant schooner Independence attempting to enter Cap Fran√ßais. On 17 November Rochambeau sent a message to Loring's squadron requesting that he be allowed to safely evacuate the port and return with his men to France. Loring refused, and so on 20 November the French general instead concluded a peace treaty with Dessalines, the terms of which insisted that the French garrison and population had to evacuate the port within ten days.Brenton, p. 292 Loring was informed of the terms of the agreement and although Rochambeau was ready to depart on 25 November, his ships crammed with thousands of refugees, the British squadron blocked all of the escape routes. On 30 November, as Haitian soldiers took possession of the vacated batteries and forts that protected the harbour, Rochambeau was still prevaricating, his ships lying at anchor directly under the guns of the forts. Orders were given to the Haitian garrisons to make preparations to fire heated roundshot at the French in order to burn their ships to the waterline should the squadron still be in the harbour following the deadline. Concerned with the delay, Loring ordered Captain Bligh to enter the harbour and offer terms of surrender to Rochambeau. After meeting Captain Barr√©, Bligh obtained a signed treaty establishing Rochambeau's total surrender to the British blockade squadron. Under the terms, the French ships would sail from the port flying the tricolour, fire a ceremonial broadside each, and then formally surrender to Loring's squadron.Clowes, p. 57 Having obtained French acquiescence, Bligh then had to carry the terms to a reluctant Dessalines, who ultimately agreed to permit the French to leave Cap Fran√ßais unmolested, although he refused to provide pilots to ensure safe passage out of the harbour.Brenton, p. 293 During the afternoon, Rochambeau sailed out first in Surveillante, firing his broadside and striking his colours to Loring. He was followed by a procession of ships, including Vertu, the 12-gun brig , the naval schooner D√©couverte, and the French merchant vessels Endymion, Casar, L'Augusta, Louis Cherie, Jason, Bonnevallere, Jeremie, Havre de Grace, Necessaire, Union, Nicholas Debarre, Marin, and an unnamed schooner, all of which were heavily laden with refugees and taken as prizes. The French hospital ships Nouvelle Sophie and Justice also surrendered, but were packed with hundreds of sick soldiers and sailors and were subsequently reprovisioned and sent back to France as cartels. Five American ships: Sisters, Eugene, Thesbald, Adventurer, and Hiram, and two Danish vessels, Diana and Bentley, were also filled with refugees and seized by Loring's force. Duckworth had arrived during the evacuation on Hercule, adding its boats to the numerous British craft assisting the overloaded French ships. Disaster struck the operation however when the frigate Clorinde attempted to leave the harbour. Weighed down with 900 refugees and soldiers including General Jean Fran√ßois Cornu de La Poype and his staff, the ship accidentally grounded on rocks directly beneath Fort St. Joseph, now manned by Haitian soldiers. Clorinde was stuck fast, heeled over and being repeatedly bashed against the rocks so that the ship's rudder had been torn away, leaving it helpless. The situation was deemed so hopeless that a number of British ship's boats that had been supervising the evacuation of the harbour turned away without offering assistance, abandoning the frigate as a total wreck.James, p. 208 One of the rearmost boats however, the launch from Hercule containing 30-40 men and commanded by Acting-Lieutenant Nesbit Willoughby, turned towards the frigate. Willoughby was determined to assist the wrecked crew and passengers, well aware that without help they would either be drowned or massacred by the Haitians, who could be seen making preparations to fire heated shot from the fort at the frigate. Rebel commander Jean Jacques Dessalines Aware that the people on Clorinde would swamp his boat if he drew alongside the frigate, possibly drowning all concerned, Willoughby instead commandeered a punt and used it to come aboard the frigate. Once on board, Willoughby persuaded La Poype to surrender the ship without the formalities observed outside the harbour, raising the Union Flag. The Haitians were consequently unable to fire on a ship in possession of their ally, Willoughby going ashore to meet with Dessalines, who promised assistance. Willoughby returned with a number of boats crewed by Haitians and was joined by several British boats in anticipation of removing the crew and passengers from the stricken ship. On his return however, Willoughby discovered that the wind had fallen significantly, allowing him to use the boats instead to haul Clorinde off the rocks and into deeper water. Her hull was still intact, and by the evening Clorinde had joined the rest of the British squadron off the mouth of the harbour.James, p. 209 =Final Actions= With the surrender of the main French city in Northern Haiti, the Haitian Revolution was almost at an end, only M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas remaining in French hands. On 2 December, Loring's squadron reached the port and offered the same terms to Noailles as had been offered to Rochambeau, who refused, claiming he had stores to last a five- month siege and so Loring continued to Port Royal in Jamaica, his ships laden with prisoners, leaving Cumberland and the frigate HMS Pique to enforce the blockade. That evening however Noailles made a desperate attempt to escape the port with six small vessels. The French convoy was sighted during the night of 5‚Äì6 December, and soon overrun, the Republic, Temeraire, Belle Louise, Active and Sally Warner all seized by the British warships. Only one vessel, Noailles's flagship, escaped pursuit, although Noailles had apparently been mortally wounded as he died shortly after reaching Havana, Cuba as a result of his reported injuries. French histories recount that Noailles's vessel was able to board and overpower a small British warship en route, but no British warships of any size were lost in these waters during 1803 and so the origin of this story is unknown.James, p. 210 Haitian Independence The fall of M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas marked the end of the Haitian Revolution and the final destruction of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Although vestigial French forces remained in Spanish San Domingo, they were too few and too weak to make any impression on the forces of Dessalines which now controlled the western half of the island. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France.Christer Petley, White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of REvolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 182. On 1 January 1804, Dessailines proclaimed the foundation of the new nation of Haiti, the first independent Caribbean nation since the days before European settlement.

The work was written in Old Spanish, a novelty in this historiographical genre, up until then regularly written in Latin. The work intended to narrate the world‚Äôs history from the beginnings (Creation, as narrated in the Bible) until the time of Alfonso, but it was never completed. The extant work covers from the creation until the birth of the virgin Mary, in the biblical section, and until year zero, in the history of the non-Jewish peoples. For the writing of this huge work, many older books were used as sources. Most of them were written in Latin, but there were French and Arabic sources, as well. Structure The General estoria is divided into six parts (‚Äúpartes‚Äù), the last of which was never completed. This structure was conceived to match the schema of the six ages of history as explained by Augustine of Hippo:In the City of God. These six ages correspond, for Augustinus, to the six days of Creation and to the six periods of man‚Äôs life (infantia, pueritia, adulescentia, iuventus, gravitas and senectus). the first part would have covered the facts happened between the creation and the great flood (first age), the second part would have narrated the history between the great flood and the birth of Abraham (second age), the third part would have covered the history from this moment until the reign of David (third age), the fourth part until the Babylonian captivity (fourth age), the fifth part until the birth of Jesus (fifth age), and the sixth from this moment until the reign of Alfonso X. But following the intended division of one world age narrated in each part, the first books would have been very short, and the last unmanageable. This led to the division of the work in parts (called in Spanish ‚Äúpartes‚Äù) of similar length, the first covering the first and second ages and nearly the first half of the third, the second narrating the second half of the third age and the first of the fourth, the third ‚Äúparte‚Äù covering the second half of the fourth age, and the fourth and fifth parts narrating the fifth age of the world. From the sixth ‚Äúparte‚Äù only the first pages are known, possibly the only ever written. To achieve the ambitious aim of narrating the whole of mankind‚Äôs history, many sources and a complicated structure were needed to relate both the Jewish and the non-Jewish history. The redactors of the General estoria were able to ascertain which events happened at the same time in different civilisations thanks to a work by Eusebius of Caesarea, the second part of his Chronicle, known as Canons (Chronikoi kanones). They set then to work, narrating first some years from the Jewish history (drawn mainly from the Bible, Flavius Josephus, and Petrus Comestor), then all things happened in the same years in other cultural circles, such as Egypt, Greece, Carthage or Rome. For these contents, the sources are more numerous. The Alfonsine redactors did not maintain a strict distinction between historical and non-historical works, and treated mythological material, such as Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses, as history. Therein they were guided by the euhemeristic interpretation of myths, following which they thought gods and goddesses were in reality old kings, queens and heroes, worshipped as deities after their deaths. The second unit in the organisation of the work, following the \\"parte\\" (part), is the one that wears the name of a biblical book: for example, the section in the first ‚Äúparte‚Äù labelled as √âxodo (Exodus) contains the translation (with glosses and commentaries) of this book from the Bible and the history of all things happened at the same time in the whole world (among them, the beginnings of Athens). This textual behaviour begins to waver in the fourth ‚Äúparte‚Äù, which covers the first half of the fifth age, after the Babylonian captivity (590 a. C.). Once the Jewish people have lost their ‚Äúse√±or√≠o‚Äù (political independence), the chronology is no longer guided by a Jewish ruler, but by the ruler of the most important empire (i. e. first Babylon, then Carthage, Macedonia and RomeThe idea of the four kingdoms is explained in the work of Orosius and was very popular in the Middle Ages.); the name of the biblical books is likewise no more a cover for all world happenings of a period, but contains only the translation of that book, whereas the name of a ‚Äúheathen‚Äù (gentil) ruler (e. g. Nabucodonosor / Nebuchadnezzar) gives their title to textual units where other material is also contained. Inside the biblical books or the section dedicated to the reign of a ruler, the following unit is the ‚Äúlibro‚Äù (book), which comprises from four or five until 80 or 90 ‚Äúcap√≠tulos‚Äù (chapters). Not all biblical books are divided into minor books, many are directly organised in ‚Äúcap√≠tulos‚Äù (the first procedure is usual for the First and Second parts, the last for the Third and Fourth). The non-biblical history is much too important to the Alphonsine redactors to occupy only a couple of chapters at the end of a biblical narration, and since the second Part, the outstanding features or figures of the non-biblical world are often given a continuous spell of hundreds of chapters where only the history of this figure (e. g. Hercules, Romulus and Remus) or historical fact (e. g. Trojan War, Theban War) are treated. These ‚Äúestorias unadas‚Äù (united or unitary stories) are situated at the end of the reign of the current Jewish ruler (following whose time the Alphonsines order, as has been explained, the chronology). Sources and source treatment Prior to beginning the work on the General estoria, sources were thought of, looked for, copied, and translated. Probably not all desired works were found; on the other hand, many historical or mythological works from the Antiquity were not widely known in the Middle Ages (e. g. Homer). Among the most important sources are the Bible, Petrus Comestor (Historia Scholastica), Flavius Josephus (Antiquitates Iudaicae, not the original Greek, but a Latin version), Eusebius of Caesarea (Canons or Chronikoi kanones), Ovid (Metamorphoses and Heroides), Lucan (Pharsalia), Pliny (Historia naturalis), Flavius Eutropius (Breviarius historiae Romanae), Orosius (Historiae adversus paganos), Geoffrey of Monmouth (Historia regum Britanniae), the Historia de preliis, the Histoire ancienne jusqu‚Äô√† C√©sar, probably the Fet des Romains and several Old French romans. Not only the number of the sources, but also the scope of their utilisation is astounding: for example, more than half the verses of the Metamorphoses are contained in the General estoria, together with lengthy explanations and allegorical interpretations drawn from several glossators; two thirds of the Heroides are inserted in the text in the suitable moment (Second and Third parts), and the whole of the translation of Lucan‚Äôs Pharsalia is contained in the Fifth part. After being translated, the different sources were combined in the historical relation. The sources treating the same fact were compared, and their similarities and differences carefully exposed; the narration of some years of the Jewish history always precedes, as said above, the part of the text dedicated to the happenings of the same period in other civilisations. Translation and commentary, facts and interpretation go hand in hand, completed by recapitulations and analogies with contemporary realities. Most of the content of the sources is acceptable for the Alphonsine redactors, and censorship or modifications due to a wish to avoid some thing are not frequent. Nevertheless, it is possible to find some places where this does occur: a very poetic tone appears to be sometimes objectionable, as personifications, metaphors or apostrophes are often not translated; the physical transformations narrated in the Metamorphoses need to be allegorically interpreted; some character traits (cruelty, doubts) are eliminated from the description of kings or powerful men and women. Manuscripts and editions More than forty manuscripts of the General estoria are known. Given the dimensions of the work, they only copy one part or, sometimes, two half parts. Only the First and the Fourth Part are copied in currently extant manuscripts from the royal scriptorium, the rest are only known through later copies.A complete survey of all known manuscripts can be found in In√©s Fern√°ndez-Ord√≥√±ez, ‚ÄúGeneral estoria‚Äù, in C. Alvar y J. M. Luc√≠a Meg√≠as (eds.), Diccionario filol√≥gico de literatura medieval espa√±ola, Madrid, Castalia, 2002, p. 42-54. Several of these later copies don‚Äôt contain a whole part, but a selection, normally either the biblical or the non-biblical contents, and sometimes a copy contains e. g. the biblical content of two parts. For the Fifth part, no manuscript is known that copies the whole text: three contain the non-biblical section, three only part of the non-biblical section (only the translation of Pharsalia), and one the biblical section. It is possible than this part was never quite completed and the different materials combined in one narration. The First and Second parts of the work were edited and published in 1930 and 1957-1961 by Solalinde and Solalinde, Kasten and Oelschl√§ger.See references. Several scholars have published transcriptions of the text of some manuscripts and partial editions, which contributed to the better knowledge of the work.See references under the names of Gonz√°lez Rol√°n and Saquero Su√°rez Somonte; Jonxis-Henkemans; Kasten and Jonxis-Henkemans; Kasten, Jonxis-Henkemans and Nitti; P√©rez Navarro; S√°nchez- Prieto and Horcajada. 2009, a team of philologists published the whole of the work.See references under S√°nchez-Prieto.

Copies are held by the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Columbus Museum, Columbus, Georgia, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. It depicts the Greek myth of Europa being abducted by Zeus in the form of a bull. Description The Flight of Europa is an elegant and modern depiction of an ancient act of violation. The strong diagonals make even the massive bull seem to float. Europa herself sits calmly, legs crossed, as Cupid whispers in her ear. Inspired by murals he saw in Crete, Manship added dolphins under the bull to represent the couples' destination. The delicate linear detailing that became Manship's hallmark can be seen in her hair, Zeus' mane, and Cupid's wings. Without the base, the statue stands 20.75\\" (52.7 cm.) tall. At least one copy has \\"P. MaNSHIP ¬©\\" inscribed on the base. The statue is bronze, though some copies have been gilded, and they stand on stone bases of agate, marble, or onyx. Historical information Inspired by a Titian portrait of Europa, Manship created a trio of sculptures about that myth, of which this is the last and most elaborate. They were part of a series of sculptures he created in Paris in the early 1920s that earned him wide acceptance as a serious force in contemporary art. The early appreciation for archaic Greek sculpture he had acquired during his fellowship in Rome combined with his recent anatomy studies with Solon Borglum, enabling him to create a balance between realistic and formal elements. Manship was very fond of his Europa sculptures and often gave souvenir copies to friends. A copy was recently sold at auction for $458,500. =Acquisition= Manship gave one copy directly to the Smithsonian. Four other casts have been located. The Columbus Museum's copy was the last to be acquired by a public institution. It had originally been given to artist Leon Kroll, and a letter from Manship to Kroll describing the gift is held at the Archives of American Art. LACMA's copy had originally been given to Manship's supporters Edwin and Sarah Holter, and their descendants cherished it for 70 years until the generosity of the American Art Council and the Shirley Filiatrault Trust helped LACMA acquire it in 1998. The IMA received its copy in 1950 as a gift of Lucy M. Taggart in memory of her brother Thomas D. Taggart.

It is one of the best known companies of entomology and taxidermy of Paris. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a cabinet of curiosities open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.  History  = Since 1831 = Deyrolle was created in 1831 by Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle, who was soon succeeded by his son Achille, at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean- Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Lib√©ral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7e arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher‚Äôs lessons. (Mus√©e scolaire Deyrolle). In 1995, the world famous painter Richard Marolle bought Deyrolle before selling it to Louis Albert de Broglie In 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop. = The fire of 2008 = On February the 1st 2008, the Cabinet of Curiosities was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened. Some artists who contributed to save Deyrolle: Jan Fabre - Nan Goldin - Jacques Grange - Karen Knorr - Marie-Jo Lafontaine - Claude Lalanne - Fran√ßois-Xavier Lalanne - Pierre Alechinsky - Yann Arthus-Bertrand - Miquel Barcelo - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - Sophie Calle - Johan Creten - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - Mark Dion - Bettina Rheims - Bernar Venet - Huang Yong Ping.  Pedagogy  = The ancient charts = Deyrolle is well known for its pedagogical charts. It all starts around 1871, when Emile Deyrolle developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name \\"Mus√©e scolaire Deyrolle\\". They are meant to teach the \\"Le√ßons de choses\\" (\\"Lessons of things\\") but also Botany, Zoology, Entomology, Geography, Anatomy, Civics, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Mineralogy, Biology, etc. ¬´ Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children‚Äôs mind are rigorously exact. ¬ª √âmile Deyrolle = Deyrolle pour l'Avenir = In 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l‚ÄôAvenir (DPA). There are charts on sustainable development, climate changes, endangered species, renewable energy, etc.  The savoir-faire  = Taxidermy = Deyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the Washington Convention (CITES). = Entomology = Deyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.  Art  The first aim of Deyrolle was to teach natural sciences to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists Andr√© Breton and Salvador Dal√≠, the painters Jean Dubuffet and Mathieu, the writers Louise de Vilmorin and Th√©odore Monod, Raymond Queneau and many others stopped regularly at the shop. = Deyrolle and artists today = Today, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: Bettina Rheims, √âric Sander or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. Woody Allen used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie Midnight in Paris, and Wes Anderson is a huge fan of the shop. Deyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aur√®le or Damien Hirst, for example. = Music = In 2005, French singer Nolwenn Leroy shot the artwork for her album Histoires Naturelles at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single \\"Histoire Naturelle\\". = Exhibitions = Some exhibitions: * Takeshi Shikama, ¬´ Garden of Memory : Animals and Plants ¬ª for Festival Photo Saint Germain 2015. * Jonathan F.Kugel brings three artists together in ¬´ Trophies ¬ª: James Webster, Dan Glasser, Juliette Seydoux, inspired by the rhinos condition.

Ionescu-Caion (, born Constantin Alexandru Ionescu and commonly known as Caion; 1882 ‚Äì November or December 1918) was a Romanian journalist and poet, primarily remembered for his legal dispute with humorist Ion Luca Caragiale. He was a Symbolist, a disciple of Alexandru Macedonski, and a militant Francophile, as well as a leading opponent of literary tradition. His scattered work comprises essays, short stories and prose poetry, noted for their cultural references, but made little impact on Romanian literature. As a journalist, Caion prioritized scandals, accusing Caragiale of plagiarism and losing the subsequent celebrity trial of 1902, before partly recanting and winning the retrial. Despite his own coquetries with Romanian nationalism, Caion focused his verve on Transylvania's contemporary nationalist literary current. Ionescu-Caion was the founder of several magazines, most notably Rom√¢nul Literar. Originally conceived as a literary supplement for the daily Rom√¢nul, it became a tribune of Macedonski's Romanian Symbolist movement, and helped discover George Bacovia, the celebrated modern poet. During World War I, when he oscillated between the two opposing camps, Caion put out the journal Cronicarul. This was his last known activity in the Romanian press. A contradictory figure, Caion was equated with infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently unsubstantiated allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians. In Transylvania, the word Caion was for a while synonymous with yellow journalist. Biography =Early career= Little is recorded about Caion's roots, other than that he was a devout Roman Catholic, and a regular presence at Saint Joseph Cathedral.Cruceanu, p.17 He had a very early debut in cultural journalism. After 1897, when he was 15, his literary chroniclers saw print in several newspapers, under various pseudonyms such as C. A. I. NicƒÉ Burdu»ôel, Ion Filionescu, Marin Gelea, Isac »òt. Micu, Roman Mu»ôat, among others.Tudor Opri»ô, Istoria debutului literar al scriitorilor rom√¢ni √Æn timpul »ôcolii (1820-2000), Aramis Print, Bucharest, 2002, p.22. In January 1898, he was employed by AdevƒÉrul daily, covering the Romanian tour of S√¢r P√©ladan. P√©ladan, a writer, mystic and self-styled mage, failed to impress the young reporter, who reported on his various claims with a note of irony.Mitchievici, p.328 Also then, he affiliated with Macedonski's eclectic art magazine Literatorul (known during the period as Revista LiterarƒÉ). Interested in the Roman Empire, he published with Literatorul a comparative biography of Julius Caesar and Augustus, republished as a book by Carol G√∂bl of Bucharest.Teodorescu et al., p.702-703 Also in 1898, Ionescu-Caion completed his adaptation of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver, published by the AdevƒÉrul collection Biblioteca EnciclopedicƒÉ as Trei ani de suferin»õƒÉ: O cƒÉlƒÉtorie curioasƒÉ (\\"Three Years of Suffering: A Strange Voyage\\"). It came with Caion's own critical study of Swift. According to Anglicist Mihaela Mudure, Caion, \\"a famous journalist and a minor writer\\", was thus the first Romanian to publish an essay on Swift, albeit one that was \\"not very sophisticated\\"; she also notes that the translation added a sexual twist to some of Gulliver's adventures.Mihaela Mudure, \\"From the Infantile to the Subversive: Swift's Romanian Adventures\\", in Hermann J.

Caion published other such translations with Biblioteca EnciclopedicƒÉ, rendering works by Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Louis Henri Boussenard, Henry de Graffigny, Louis Jacolliot and others.Teodorescu et al., p.551, 703 Under contract with AdevƒÉrul (1899), Caion published his translation from Prosper Castanier novellas, dealing with \\"Roman decadence\\". Writing in 2011, critic Angelo Mitchievici suggested that Caion's introduction to the volume exaggerated Castanier's merits, but was still \\"interesting\\" for showing the popularity of \\"decadentism\\" in 1890s Romania: Caion's argument was that Rome fell victim to \\"Asiatic luxury\\" and sophisticated sexuality (\\"orgies\\").Mitchievici, p.293 Caion's own texts on the subject of decadence were published as booklets by the French company Retaux Fr√®res.Teodorescu et al., p.702 His bibliography for 1899 includes the essay Coversa»õii despre artƒÉ (\\"Conversations on Art\\"), and, also with AdevƒÉrul, a selection of his own novellas.Teodorescu et al., p.702, 703 Not much is known about Caion's other involvements, other than that he attended the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, in the same year as fellow journalist Eugen Porn.Durnea (2006), p.62 Although living in the capital, he maintained links with the youth of Ia»ôi, and published alongside I. I. Mironescu in the high school magazine C. Negruzzi. His work included an essay about the works of the eponymous novelist. A \\"Constantin Ionescu\\", whom literary historian Victor Durnea tentatively identifies as the future Caion, was arrested by Romanian Police on Calea Victoriei, Bucharest, during the breakup of a student nationalist rally (September 13, 1894). Victor Durnea, \\"C. Stere »ôi 'Afacerea de onoare' de la 1894\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 2/2009, p.32-33 He was still enlisted at the University in 1899, when he organized a charity event to benefit the impoverished schoolchildren of C√¢mpina.\\"Parte neoficialƒÉ.

Historian Lucian Boia notes that he \\"was not without merit as a publicist.\\"Boia, p.128 Around the year 1900, Caion became a sympathizer of the Romanian Symbolist movement, whose leader was the poet Macedonski. Attached by philologist »òtefan Cazimir to a \\"Secessionist\\" current in Romanian literature, Caion made himself noted for a prose poem entirely dedicated to his lover's hair (a recurring theme in Symbolist literature, taken to extremes by the Romanian author). »òtefan Cazimir, \\"Secesionismul √Æn literatura rom√¢nƒÉ (IV)\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 5/1999 A regular presence in Macedonski's house, Caion mounted a campaign to promote minor Romanian Symbolist authors in France. As noted by critics, the French contacts were themselves fringe magazines, with Legitimist and Traditionalist Catholic agendas. \\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 22-23/1922, p.427 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Caion had an enduring interest in history and, in 1900, completed his monograph on Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu. Titled Asupra domniei lui Bibescu (\\"On Bibescu's Reign\\"), it was first published as an addendum to Georges Bibesco's pamphlet, O execu»õie (\\"An Execution\\"). Bibesco, the Prince's destitute son, continued to employ Caion as his defender and co-author: in 1901, they published an ampler work on the subject of Bibescu family grievances against the modern Romanian establishment. In tandem, Caion publicized his comparison of historical and psychological determinism, with a topical booklet. His first synthesis, Studii istorice (\\"Historical Studies\\"), was also available in 1901.Teodorescu et al., p.703 Caion also affiliated with the eclectic journal Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, where he published historical documents of dubious authenticity\\"Procesul...\\", p.2 and, in 1902, the essay Din umbrƒÉ. Moravuri antice (\\"From the Shadows. Antique Morals\\"). \\"Bibliografie\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 4/1902, p.3 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library); Teodorescu et al., p.702 From 1900 to 1903, he was employed by the Bucharest Conservatory, lecturing in \\"selective world history\\", and publishing his conferences as a university textbook. According to at least one account, Caion first encountered Caragiale's irony when he sent him a couple of Symbolist poems. The senior writer picked up on their involuntary humor, and proceeded to ridicule Caion. Cosmin Ciotlo»ô, \\"MarcƒÉ √ÆnregistratƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22/2011 Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes that Caion was especially infuriated when Caragiale's magazine, Moftul Rom√¢n, made a public mockery of his Secessionist prose poem.Vianu, p.188 In his gibe, Caragiale feigned enthusiasm about the young writer's debut. Parodying Caion, he suggested that the young poet carry on writing a \\"lyrical-decadent-symbolist-mystical- capillary-secessionist\\" novel about a hairdressers' art society, whose members glue strands of hair onto canvasses or carve soap into human figures.»òtefan Cazimir, Caragiale fa»õƒÉ cu kitschul, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 1988, p.101-102. =Caragiale scandal= Caion followed an elaborate recipe for revenge, with exposes in the Symbolist Revista LiterarƒÉ review, of which he was by then the co-editor.Gheme»ô, p.125 The owner, Th. M. Stoenescu, had been Caragiale's adversary since the 1880s.Simion, p.7 Described by Vianu as \\"a real pathological character\\",Vianu, p.188. Vianu also calls Caion a man \\"of inexplicable perversity\\" (p.373) Caion claimed to expose Caragiale's drama, NƒÉpasta, as plagiarized. In his report, Caion suggested that the real author was a Hungarian, Kem√©ny Istvan‚Äîwho, in fact, never existed.\\"Procesul...\\", p.2; Gheme»ô, p.125; Stamatoiu (2000), p.49; Vianu, p.188, 373-374 In order to back his claim, Caion published quotes from NƒÉpasta alongside a supposed translation from Kem√©ny. Reading these fragments in good faith, Caragiale was astonished by what he took to be a bizarre coincidence. Macedonski followed the developments with enthusiasm, granting further exposure to Caion's claims. For Macedonski, the young accuser embodied \\"the aspiration for beauty\\", \\"the new aesthetics\\", \\"courage and selflessness\\".Cioculescu, p.139 As commentators have suggested, the poet responded to Caragiale's satires of him and his Symbolist salon, and attacking, in Caragiale, the entire anti-Symbolist club Junimea.Cioculescu, p.132-140; Vianu, p.188 At Revista LiterarƒÉ, Stoenescu began suspecting a canard, and asked Caion to present further proof for his accusations. The latter produced two sheets printed in Romanian Cyrillic, which reportedly included fragments from an 1884 Romanian translation.Cioculescu, p.132-133 Unconvinced, the editor promptly suspended his collaboration with Caion.Cioculescu, p.133, 134 The latter soon changed his statements, arguing that \\"Kem√©ny\\" was a pseudonym used by Leo Tolstoy, and that Caragiale was guilty of copying The Power of Darkness. Although Stoenescu was a disciple of his, Macedonski favored Caion in this dispute, and employed him to write more denunciations of Caragiale in the magazine For»õa MoralƒÉ.Cioculescu, p.133-134, 135-140; Vianu, p.374 For»õa MoralƒÉ expanded on the initial accusations, claiming to have discovered an entire history of plagiarism in Caragiale's writings (from Victorien Sardou to Alfred Duru).Cioculescu, p.136-139 Following Macedonski's intercession, Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu, who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian Atheneum conference (January 24, 1902).Cioculescu, p.137 Rom√¢nul newspaper, put out by the entrepreneur VintilƒÉ Rosetti as an anti- Junimist outlet, also stood by Caion. Its columnist, N. »öinc, had prepared a piece describing Caragiale and his Junimist colleagues as obsessed with their own role in culture. Unpublished until 2006, »öinc's article noted that \\"the poor Caion\\" had unwittingly struck a blow against \\"the youngest, sickest and therefore most innocent of the [Junimea] megalomaniacs.\\"Filitti, p.9 Rosetti's paper was hosting its own campaign against Caragiale, headed by Caragiale's former employer Fr√©d√©ric Dam√©. Cristian Stamatoiu, \\"Caragiale sub trilogia blestemelor de percep»õie\\", in the T√¢rgu Mure»ô Drama School Symbolon, Nr. 1-2/2001, p.111 Meanwhile, Caragiale found his core group of journalist sympathizers in the Junimist fief of Moldavia. Adina-»òtefania Ciurea, \\"Oglinzi fidele »ôi contrafƒÉcute\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 44/2003; Constantin Coroiu, \\"Caragiale »ôi presa din capitala Moldovei\\", in Convorbiri Literare, November 2010 Caragiale had by then proceeded to research the matter on his own, and came to the independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was held without a jury. Caragiale's legal representative was the fellow writer Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, and noted that the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between NƒÉpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial.Gheme»ô, p.125-126 The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs.\\"Procesul...\\", p.3; Gheme»ô, p.125 However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial.Vianu, p.374 The court eventually acquitted Caion. Caragiale showed little surprise at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: \\"They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, for those who are more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?\\" Vladimir Simon, \\"Profilul »ôtiin»õific al moftangiului\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 43/2009 The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.Cioculescu, p.139-140; Vianu, p.374 =Rom√¢nul Literar= Caion was still carrying on as a publicist and historian, with a study about the ancient Bacchanalia. It was simultaneously published in Paris and Bucharest (1901). That year, with Carol G√∂bl press, he also published a devotional text, Isus, fragment (\\"Jesus, A Fragment\\"). The theme of decadence continued to fuel Caion's essays: in Carmen magazine (September 1902), he covered Castanier's Lotus du Gange, implicitly advertising the book's lewd content and titillating illustrations.Mitchievici, p.293-294 His take on the Caragiale affair was outlined in the Carol G√∂bl essay Moravuri literare √Æn 1902 (\\"Literary Morals as of 1902\\"). In 1903, Caion himself began working at Rom√¢nul, where he was an editor, Vera Ghedrovici, \\"Rom√¢nul Literar\\", in Alexe RƒÉu, Petru Soltan, Andrei E»ôanu, Aurel Marinciuc, Ion Madan, Iurie Colesnic, Valeria Matvei, Elena SƒÉndu»õƒÉ (eds.), Calendar na»õional 2005, National Library of Moldova, Chi»ôinƒÉu, 2004, p.13. corresponding with VintilƒÉ Rosetti over the newspaper's publicity deals.Filitti, p.8 He returned to belles-lettres with a 1903 short story, Korinna. His fiction reflected his growing interest in Early Christianity, illustrated by another story, itself published in 1903: Pentru cruce (\\"For the Cross\\"). This was followed in 1904 by a volume of \\"Christian short stories\\", Triumful Crucei, which he submitted for consideration to the Romanian Academy awards committee. \\"Premiile Academiei Rom√¢ne\\", in Familia, Nr. 46/1904, p.550 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Christian subjects infused his parallel work for the stage, as well as his historical research. In 1904, he published a Byzantine-themed tragedy, Legionariƒ≠ Cruceƒ≠ (\\"Legionaries of the Cross\\"), and an essay on \\"The Rivalry between Jesus and Saint John the Baptist\\" (La rivalit√© de J√©sus et de saint Jean-Baptiste). A split occurred at Rom√¢nul in late 1904: on January 10, 1905, Caion issued Rom√¢nul Literar as a separate weekly, announcing to the world that all his links to Rom√¢nul had been severed (this even though Rom√¢nul Literars first issue was introduced as \\"Issue 1, Year 3\\"). The director himself signed the column Note critice (\\"Critical Notes\\"), and four others which reviewed books local and foreign; they were collected in book form in 1905. Caion's sheet was irregularly published for the next three years, and, in December 1908, became a tri-monthly. Rom√¢nul Literar was a voice of anti- nationalist and anti-traditionalist sentiment, rejecting the school formed around SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul magazine, and promoting the Symbolists; its agenda has been summarized as \\"anti-SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist\\", and in step with modern French literature. It played host to many Romanian writers, most of them Romanian Symbolists: Macedonski, Mihail Cruceanu, Mircea Demetriade, Al. Gherghel, Dumitru \\"Karr\\" Karnabatt, Eugeniu Sperantia, Caton Theodorian, alongside the epigrammatists Cincinat Pavelescu and I. C. Popescu-Polyclet.Cruceanu, p.18 Cruceanu, who joined the literary club while still a high school student, recalls being impressed by Caion's status as \\"a literary historian and critic\\", \\"his restrained demeanor and his intelligence, with its inscrutable pursuits.\\" However, Caion seemed \\"ill and troubled\\", and had \\"an unnatural and mean passion for going after those people who had made a name for themselves in our cultural life\\", with his \\"venomous weaponry\\".Cruceanu, p.17-18 Other Symbolists took distance: Moldavian poet and literary reviewer »òtefan PeticƒÉ made a mockery of Caion, exposing him as a sciolistic amateur.Ana-Maria Tomescu, \\"Barbu Fundoianu, »òtefan PeticƒÉ - personalitƒÉ»õi cu orgoliul singularitƒÉ»õii\\", in the December 1 University of Alba Iulia Philologica Yearbook, 2006, p.124 In addition to receiving contributions directly from France, Rom√¢nul Literar published translations of poems by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral (translator: Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu), Jean Mor√©as (Demetriade) and Albert Samain (Popescu-Polyctet). Other than poetry and fiction, Rom√¢nul Literar hosted literary and scientific essays, including ones by Caion, »öinc, Ioan Tanoviceanu, Orest Tafrali and others. The journal also enlisted contributions from poet Cornelia \\"Riria\\" Gatovschi and her husband, the formerly Junimist historian A. D. Xenopol. Rom√¢nul Literars founder was especially enthusiastic about Riria. Against mainstream critics, who derided her poetry as stale and ungrammatical, he proclaimed the dawn of a new era, with Mrs. Xenopol as its herald. Alex. Cistelecan, \\"Poeta Riria\\" , in Vatra, Nr. 4/2009, p.13 Caion, Tocilescu and the Xenopols were members of a small professional association, called \\"Romanian Society for Arts and Literature\\". Victor Durnea, \\"C√Ænd s-a √Ænfiin»õat Societatea Scriitorilor Rom√¢ni?\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 28/2005 Around 1907, Caion's paper was hosting poems by the young Symbolist author George Bacovia (including \\"Sonnet\\" and \\"Pulvis\\") and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel. Bacovia described their first encounter, in November 1903, as follows: \\"Caion [...] was very depressed after his recently completed trial with Caragiale. My solitary presence, without any sort of recommendation from another author, made him receive me with significant reserve. I then communicated the purpose of my arrival, asking for the address of his collaborator, the poet Macedonski. Nevertheless, he still asked me for a handful of poems, the ones later published by his magazine.\\"George Bacovia, Plumb, Editura Litera International, Bucharest & Chi»ôinƒÉu, 2001, p.264. =Caion and the Transylvanians= Ionescu-Caion was unrelenting in his accusations of plagiarism, and a section of the press, in both Romania and abroad, still credited him as a whistle-blower. His Romanian supporters called him a David fending off Caragiale-Goliath, while the Revue de Paris referred to his stances as \\"courageous\\".Simion, p.7-8 By that time, the formerly nationalist journalist had made himself new enemies outside the Junimea circles. These were ethnic Romanian writers from Transylvania, region that was then still part of Austria-Hungary, including many traditionalists published by SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul. Early signs of this conflict showed up during the Caragiale trials, when Caion and Macedonski nominated SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul founding figure George Co»ôbuc as another successful plagiarist.Cioculescu, p.137, 139; Radu DrƒÉgulescu, \\"Legenda\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 2-3/2004, p.86 Around the same time, he reputedly stated that Transylvanian literature was \\"a monstrous apparition\\". Un alegƒïtor, \\"Secretarul sƒïrmanei 'Asocia»õiuni' \\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 224/1901, p.4 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Caion's dispute with the Transylvanian poets covered several fronts. In 1905, his newspaper joyfully announced that »òtefan Octavian Iosif (whom he called by his Magyarized legal name, Istv√°n G√°bor J√≥zsef) had been expelled from the Romanian academic scholarship program.CƒÉlinescu, p.604 According to Caion, Octavian Goga's father-in-law, politician Partenie Cosma, was \\"the tyrant of Transylvania\\",CƒÉlinescu, p.607 and Co»ôbuc's ally, the literary chronicler Ilarie Chendi, was a \\"Romanianized\\" Hungarian, with little authority in local literature. These reactions did not prevent Caion from becoming a co-author of the first Transylvanian (and Romanian) encyclopedic dictionary, put together by Cornelius Diaconovich. To the indignation of other Transylvanians, \\"Ionescu-Caion, C. A., publicist, Bucharest\\" is a contributor of historical entries in Diaconovich's second tome.\\"Autorii tom. II al Enciclopediei Rom√¢ne\\", digitized by the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu The ideological conflict involved various aspects of literary theory and activism, including the differences of opinion about reforming the literary language. Transylvanian political leader Alexandru Vaida-Voevod noted that the neologistic dialect favored in the Old Kingdom was symptomatic, since \\"Caion and the likes\\" were popularly identified as the literary professionals. \\"Unificarea ortografiei »ôi limbei literare. IX\\", in Transilvania, Nr. VI/1902, p.219 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Linguist Sextil Pu»ôcariu also commended Transylvanian literati for standing up to the \\"unhealthy currents\\" promoted by Caion, Macedonski and Karnabatt. Sextil Pu»ôcariu, \\"Scrisoarea a III-a\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 16-18/1903, p.272 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Caion's indignation reached a peak in September 1909, when the Romanian Writers' Society (SSR) was officially established as a compromise between the Symbolists and the Transylvanians, doing away with the Romanian Society for Arts and Literature. In Rom√¢nul Literar, Caion described the club as a mass of \\"d√©class√©s\\", concluding: \\"With the likes of Her»õ, Kendich, IvƒÉciuk, Demetrius [that is: A. de Herz, Chendi, I. Dragoslav and Vasile Demetrius], for sure the new society shall uproot the old one, where one comes across respectable people such as A. D. Xenopol, Riria, N. Petra»ôcu, Pompiliu Eliade, Gr[igore] Tocilescu etc.\\" Another controversy shook the literary community when the SSR decided to exclude those authors who could not prove their belonging to the Romanian ethnic group. Although Rom√¢nul Literar was itself suspected of antisemitism, Caion decided to stand by the Jewish Romanians who were thus excluded.Durnea (2006), p.62, 64 In a March 1910 article, he sided with the Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ owner Constantin RƒÉdulescu- Motru (a critic of antisemitism) and journalist Eugen Porn (a Jew), noting that Porn's acceptance into Romanian literature was at least as justified as Ilarie Chendi's. Rom√¢nul Literar tried to keep up with the latest developments in literary form, and Caion was among the first Romanian reviewers of Futurism. \\"LiteraturƒÉ universalƒÉ »ôi comparatƒÉ. D.

It was reestablished as a bi-monthly on November 1, and again ceased publication in December. It was restored a third and final time in June 1912, but went out of business soon after. Meanwhile, Caion focused on his Francophile essays, writing about the French influence on Romania. The fragment √énr√¢uriri franceze mai vechi (\\"Older French Influences\\") saw print in the \\"encyclopedic magazine\\" Ilustra»õia, whose director was Nicolae G. RƒÉdulescu-Niger, the comedic poet. \\"Bibliografie\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 155/1912, p.10 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) With Riria and the Symbolists, Caion began putting out a French- language literary journal, called La Revue Roumaine (first issue: February 1912). The Transylvanian rivals at LuceafƒÉrul were unimpressed. According to them, La Revue Roumaine was beneath all other Francophone periodicals, either Romanian or Hungarian, unwitting evidence of \\"the inferiority and impotence of our [national] literature\\". \\"√énsemnƒÉri\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 14/1912, p.280 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) When, in 1912, Macedonski made his publicized return to literary life, the Transylvanians reacted with astonishment. In Arad, the journalist Ovidiu BƒÉsceanu covered the comeback of \\"an enemy\\" as \\"Caion's triumph\\". He believed that the Symbolist offensive was presided upon and propagated by Caion, under the slogan: \\"I cursed, I libeled, I vanquished.\\" Ovidiu BƒÉsceanu, \\"Isb√¢nda lui Caion\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 188/1912, p.8-9 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Caion himself focused on his academic career, and, in 1913, took his Ph.D. with the thesis √éndrumƒÉri nouƒÉ √Æn via»õa politicƒÉ »ôi culturalƒÉ a Fran»õei contemporane »ôi √Ænr√¢urirea lor asupra noastrƒÉ (\\"New Directions in France's Political and Cultural Life and their Influence on Us\\"). It was published, in 1914, by Poporul Typographers. =World War I and death= By the start of World War I, while Romania was still neutral territory, Caion supported France and the other Entente Powers. He was \\"a Francophile to the uttermost\\" (according to Boia), publishing the booklet Rolul Fran»õei √Æn istoria omenirii (\\"France's Role in World History\\"). Two other books on this subject saw print in 1915: Gallia »ôi √Ænr√¢uririle ei (\\"Gaul and Her Influences\\"), Sparte contre Ath√®nes (\\"Sparta against Athens\\"). As noted by a Universul Literar columnist, Caion did not glorify the French Republic, but was rather a fan of the Ancien R√©gime. Caion cited a wealth of French authors, even obscure ones (\\"who would not be great were they not the intellectual friends of the author\\"), to prove that German culture was \\"anarchic and worthless\\". Albert, \\"Ex-libris\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 32/1915, p.4-5 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The Central Powers' invasion of Romania surprised Caion and made him reconsider his options. He stayed behind in occupied Bucharest, and, as Germany's victory seemed certain and Romania signed the Peace of Bucharest, timidly embraced the \\"Germanophile\\" cause. From August 17, 1918, Ionescu-Caion put out the magazine Cronicarul (\\"The Chronicler\\"), which enlisted contributions from noted Germanophile writers, such as Gala Galaction and Duiliu Zamfirescu.Boia, p.128, 224 Its theater chronicler, Radu Pralea, was among the first to cover the Jigni»õa Summer Theater of Isidor Goldenberg, a mainstay of Yiddish dramaturgy in Romania. Vera Molea, Teatrele din grƒÉdinile de varƒÉ ale Bucure»ôtilor de altƒÉdatƒÉ, Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Bucharest, 2011, p.56-57. Another Cronicarul employee was the female journalist Aida Vrioni, who became Caion's friend and, in time, his apologist. Gabriela G√Ærmacea, \\"Aida Vrioni ‚Äì Jurnal din vremea rƒÉzboiului\\", in Ateneu, Nr. 49/2012, p.12 The magazine, noted by Boia for its \\"high literary standing\\", publicized Caion's reformed views about the course of the war. He wrote that the new Germanophile Prime Minister, Alexandru Marghiloman, embodied \\"Romania's national energy\\", much like the figures in Thomas Carlyle's On Heroes. His stances, like those of Marghiloman, had their dose of ambiguity. As Marghiloman recounts, Caion circulated an anti-German manifesto put out by the revolutionary Social Democrats and the \\"Socialist Women of Romania\\".Alexandru Marghiloman, Note politice. Vol. II: 1916-1917, Editura Institutului de Arte Grafice Eminescu, Bucharest, 1927, p.478 Moreover, Caion still revered the anti-Germanophile Xenopol. In issue 27 of Cronicarul, he referred to Xenopol's memoirs as a masterpiece of Romanian prose. Alexandru Zub, \\"Memorialistica lui A. D. Xenopol\\", in the Romanian Academy Anuar de LingvisticƒÉ »ôi Istorie LiterarƒÉ, Vol. XXIII, 1972, p.134 (digitized by the Alexandru Philippide Institute) Caion died only a few months later, in liberated Romania. As Lucian Boia notes, he had lived long enough to see all prophecies about a German victory being nullified by the November 1918 Armistice. According to bibliographer and educator Tudor Opri»ô, his was a \\"heroic death\\", which served to clear his tarnished reputation. Legacy =Ignominy= The various scandals involving Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion have left distinct marks on Romania's cultural life. Boia writes: \\"Caion [...] secured himself an unwanted fame in the history of Romanian literature\\". In early 20th-century Transylvania, \\"Caion\\" was adapted into a common noun and a term of contempt. Listing its \\"Transylvanophobe\\" enemies, LuceafƒÉrul noted the existence of \\"all sorts of Caions, those little puppies raised by the obscure magazines.\\" \\"CronicƒÉ. Ardeleanofobiƒ≠\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 4-5/1907, p.87-88 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Also in LuceafƒÉrul, priest-publicist Alexandru Ciura stated: \\"We live in the epoch of the Caions, for whom all things are permitted\\". Alexandru Ciura, \\"Quo vadis?\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 1/1903, p.2-3 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Caion's poor reputation also rubbed off on Macedonski: Caragiale's disciple Alexandru Cazaban coined the word Macaionski, as a hybrid of both writers. The scandal continued to reverberate, and Caion soon earned condemnation from critics not directly involved in the early 20th-century disputes. A liberal and a modernist, Eugen Lovinescu, dismissed Caion's entire career in letters as a footnote. It likened Caion to a \\"squid\\" that leaves behind \\"a long trail of ink\\", and judged his brand of literary criticism to have been \\"one of the illnesses of that time.\\"Eugen Lovinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne contemporane. Vol. II: Evolu»õia criticei literare, Editura Ancora S. Benvenisti & Co, Bucharest, 1926, p.205 In contrast, Cronicaruls Vrioni spoke of her friend's attack on Caragiale as a \\"mistake\\", noting that his career from 1901 was of genuine importance. Caion, she writes, created \\"true works of art\\", without sparing a thought for \\"glory or money.\\" According to literary historian Alexandru Dobrescu, Caion is the prototype \\"detractor\\" in Romanian culture, \\"born of frustration\\", the Zoilus to Caragiale's Homer. Dobrescu writes: \\"In the common definition, the detractor is someone consciously working to debase (or destroy) one's good standing. The cobbler envious of his neighbor, the cordwainer, who will go lengths to besmirch the latter in hopes of 'helping' him lose his clientele, is a detractor.\\" Constantin Coroiu, \\"Detractorii lui Eminescu\\" , in Cultura, Nr. 80, July 2007 His verdict about Caion's unicity in a Romanian context is placed in doubt by another author, Constantin Coroiu, who finds it unrealistic. Various commentators believe that Caragiale's ultimate relocation to Germany was at least in part prompted by the Caion affair. This was notably suggested by Caragiale's actor friend, Ion Brezeanu. Ion (Iancu) Brezeanu, \\"Cuvinte! cuvinte!\\", in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Nr. 6/2004, p.9-10 Moreover, literary rivals as well as third parties have noted that Caion's calumnies shed focus from his own dubious creative methods. In his speech of 1902, Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea openly accused Caion of forging historical records during his stint at Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ. More than fifty years after the fact, »òtefan Cazimir discovered that the poems Caion claimed to have authored, and which Caragiale found especially entertaining, were in fact poor-quality translations from Charles Baudelaire. In 2007 Ionescu-Caion's name was returned to circulation, amidst allegations of plagiarism brought up against philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu. Writer Andrei Ple»ôu defended Liiceanu against his accusers at Ziua daily, and argued that Romania was still \\"Caion's land\\".Andrei Ple»ôu, \\"»öara lui Caion\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 160, March 2007 Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Filosoful √Æn oglindƒÉ\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 111, April 2007, p.10 Noting that Caion had entered press history with a m√¢rlƒÉnie (\\"yokel's deed\\"), Ple»ôu described Ziua journalism as partisanship and \\"hysteria\\", assessing that Romania was going through \\"an epileptic fit\\". Liiceanu critic Gheorghe Grigurcu also took distance from the Ziua accusers, noting that their \\"libel\\", \\"puerile\\" in content, made it hard to sustain a serious debate about Liiceanu's faults. =Other literary echoes= Caion's presence at the center of literary and political controversies was treated with much sarcasm by his various peers, even before the 1901 face-off. In addition to the \\"lyrical-decadent-symbolist-mystical- capillary-secessionist\\" parody, Caragiale may have attacked Caion in an 1899 Universul sketch, as Superintendent LazƒÉr Ionescu-Lion. Gelu Negrea, \\"Aglae Poppesco\\" , in Cultura, Nr. 116, April 2008 Both writers were satirized in a revue, officially written by restaurateur G. A. Mandy (but probably authored by RƒÉdulescu-Niger). The work focuses on the 1901 stock market panic and its political consequences in Romania; Caragiale (as Gearacale) and Caion (Crayon) appear alongside scheming politicians or journalists‚ÄîTake Ionescu, George D. Pallade, Luigi Cazzavillan‚Äîand the runaway embezzler Andrei Vizanti.Cioculescu, p.321-323 The legal scandal between Caion and Caragiale is traditionally considered one of Romania's most famous trials. The legal professionals' magazine Curierul Judiciar and lawyer-editor Octav Minar published the court records in its Biblioteca marilor procese (\\"Great Trials Library\\"), May‚ÄìJune 1924.Cioculescu, p.132, 133 Theater scholar Cristian Stamatoiu finds Delavrancea's plea not just a \\"shattering\\" proof of erudition, but also a guide to understanding the issues of artistic personality and intellectual property.Stamatoiu (2000), p.49-50 As a personal witness of the proceedings, Brezeanu noted that Delavrancea spoke like a modern Demosthenes. \\"Caion\\" was a breakthrough role for Gheorghe DinicƒÉ, ensuring his move from stagehand to award-winning thespian. This was in a 1962 stage reconstruction by David Esrig, with Jules Cazaban playing Caragiale and Mircea »òeptilici as Delavrancea.

La Internacional Sonora Balkanera formed in Mexico City in 2008, alongside the local Balkan beat scene, a movement inspired in the music and aesthetics of Eastern Europe; in the beginning, the band was formed by DJ Sult√°n, the guitar player Watty, and percussionist Chukupaka, and most of its repertoire were live remixes, with a few original tracks. Eventually a two clarinet players (Enrique P√©rez y Pablo Ram√≠rez) joined the band, as well as a second percussion player (Mario Salas) and a VJ (Mi+Mo). Since then they started creating original pieces and created a version of Pan√≥ptica's \\"Pico Selector\\", which woke the Tijuana musician's interest to produce the band. For their 2012 concert at the Feria Nacional de San Marcos, the band announced the entrance of a new guitar player, Zabad Castro. Since then, the band has performed throughout Mexico, as well as in London, Barcelona, and New York. La Internacional Sonora Balkanera was signed in 2011 by LOV/RECS, a label directed by the legendary Canadian Hi-NRG artist Pascal Languirand, a.k.a. Trans-X, creator of the 1980s hit Living on Video. In 2013 the band released their second album, \\"Balkanazo Tropical\\", under the Mexican indie label Casete Upload, founded and co-directed by Camilo Lara, creative head behind the Mexican Institute of Sound.

The selected fellows work with experienced NGOs on challenging grass root development projects. The fellowship is an initiative to sensitize and provide avenues for the more privileged sections to become aware of ground realities and contribute through their personal efforts towards building strong cohesive communities; a pre-requisite for a stable socio-political environment, which in turn would lead to economic regeneration. The focus of the fellowship has been in generating interest of the educated youth towards the social sector and in incubating the spirit of social entrepreneurship.  History  The SBI Youth for India Fellowship was launched on 1 March 2011, in partnership with three reputed NGOs: M.S.Swaminathan Research Foundation, BAIF Development Research Foundation and Seva Mandir. All the three NGOs have more than two decades of experience in the development sector. The second batch was launched in September 2014 comprising 51 fellows. Currently the seventh batch is running with 52 fellows across 10 NGO's in India. The fellowship and its work has been appreciated by eminent personalities like Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (ex-President of India), Mr. Ratan Tata (Chairman, Tata Group), D.S. Subbarao (Governor, Reserve Bank of India), Mrs. Rajashree Birla (Director of the Aditya Birla Group of Companies), Mr. O. P. Bhatt (Chairman, State Bank of India), and Professor M.S.

The Fellows have worked in a range of sectors including information technology, education, infrastructure, non-profit, healthcare and others and at leading organisations such as Tata Group, Cap Gemini, IBM, Mindtree, among many others. The flagship batch of the fellowship had 27 fellows selected out of about 4000 applicants, who worked for a year on various projects in the areas of agricultural supply chain and linkages, education, public policy and awareness, rural tourism, tribal development and environment in eight states and union territories (namely, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Orissa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry).

It is predominately in Japan and perhaps endemic (unique). It is now distributed widely and cultivated in Jilin, China, Korea, Taiwan, p.25 and Indonesia. The common name of Angelica acutiloba is known as ' in Japanese. The root was used as a substitute for the crude drug in Kamp≈ç medicine (Êº¢ÊñπË£ΩËñ¨ Kanp≈ç Seiyaku), which is a Japanese adaptation of Traditional Chinese medicine. The Traditional Chinese medicine uses the root of a different species A. sinensis, . The Latin pharmacological name for the crude drug, Radix Angelica sinensis, refers to the dried roots of A. sinensis. In China, as a substitute species, A. acutiloba, is known as . Literally ‚Äú‰∏ú‚Äù means ‚Äúeastern‚Äù or ‚Äú‰∏úÊ¥ã‚Äù, which is equivalent to the meaning of Japan. So the medicine is also called as Japanese Angelica root.

The crop cultivated in Nara Prefecture has been known as Yamato t≈çki or ≈åfuka-t≈çki (the latter after ≈åfukach≈ç in Goj≈ç, Nara), reputedly superior to the Hokkaido-grown Hokkai t≈çki, and though the latter has been classed as a subspecies in the past, it is assigned a senior category of variety: * A. acutiloba Kitag. var. sugiyamae Hikino () * A. acutiloba forma tsukubana Hikino in Act. Phytotax. Geobot. XVII 84 (1958). () Description A. acutiloba grows to about 0.3-1 meter high. The color of the stems is from reddish to purplish. The stems are erect, glabrous and thinly ribbed. The leaves are deep green, and alternately arranged, often in a leathery or fleshy texture. In most cases, the lower and basal leaves are petiolate or perfoliate. The petioles attached to them are about 10‚Äì30 cm in length. The mature blades are one or two pinnatified. Young blades are usually three pinnatifid. The leaves are of variable sizes. The upper leaves are simplified to oblong, with lanceolate and dentate incised blades. The leaf lobes are about 2‚Äì9 cm long and 1‚Äì3 cm wide. Most leaves are sessile, but sometimes they bear short stalks. The tips of the mature leaves are acuminate to acute and the bases of them are cuneate to truncate. Angelica acutiloba subsp. iwatensis Flowers and fruits Angelica acutiloba subsp. iwatensis The flowers are characterized as the inflorescence: a compound umbel. A. acutilobas flowers are perfect or hermaphroditic and actinomorphic, with distinct calyx and white corolla. However, the calyx is often reduced with obsolete calyx teeth. The flowers have five petals, sepals, and stamens. The white petals are often obovate to oblong. The inflorescences contain fifteen to forty-five pubescent rays, 1‚Äì10 cm in length, which surround about thirty small disk flowers. The peduncles which hold the entire inflorescence are glabrous or pubescent and 5‚Äì20 cm long. While the stalks of each single flower in the flower clusters called pedicels, are thin and often sessile. The whorl of bracts beneath the inflorescences is called involucre. It consists of phyllaries, modified bracts, which are linear-lanceolate or linear and 1‚Äì2 cm long. It also consists of smaller young phyllaries, which are glabrous and 5‚Äì15 mm long. The androecium contains five stamens, while the gynoecium contains two carpels fused into a single pistil with an inferior, glabrous ovary. The plant blossoms from July to August. When mature, flowers secrete nectar. The strong floral scent attracts pollinators like insects. The fruits are schizocarps of two mericarps derived from mature fused carpels, often narrow-oblong with 4‚Äì5 mm in length and 1-1.5 mm in diameter. A single seed is formed with each mericarp. When mature, it is dispersed by wind. The cremocarp of the fruit is narrow-oblong and slightly flat. The oil tubes in the fruit, 3 or 4 vittae, form in wrinkles of ridges of the fruit, while 4 to 8 vittae can be found in commissure. The plant bears fruit from August to September. Roots The color of the roots is dark brown to red-brown. The roots are cylindrical, 10‚Äì25 cm long and 1‚Äì2.5 cm thick in diameter. Numerous lateral horsetail-like branched roots, which are nearly fusiform and 0.2‚Äì1 cm in diameter, sprout out from the main tap root. The externals of the roots are covered with horizontal protrusions, numerous scars of fine rootlets, and longitudinal wrinkles, which are about 1.5‚Äì3 cm in diameter. Dried roots are easy to break, while, moist roots are relatively soft. The roots contain yellow-white or light brown xylems. The roots have a pungent aromas and they have a slightly sweet taste and followed by a bitter taste. Cultivation and propagation A. acutiloba grows in moist clay soils. It prefers sunlight, but can grow in shady woodland. Cool climate is suitable for its optimal cultivation. The sowing season is usually the spring during March and May. The plant may be affected by a variety of diseases. As a result, the leaves may wilt or become yellow. Pests like aphids, worms and mites may affect the plant growth as well. Cold temperature, water and sunlight are preferred for seed germination. In the spring, the seeds may germinate slower than in winter because of the warmer temperature. In some cases, the seeds of A. acutiloba are sown in the first winter and moved to their permanent position at the beginning of next spring for their best germination. Chemistry The extract of A. acutiloba roots contains many chemical constituents. It may contain about 2% volatile oils, such as ligustilide, n-butylidenephthalide, folic acid, linoleic acid, safrole, and isosafrole. Uses =Traditional medicine= The extract of A. acutiloba roots is used in traditional Chinese medicine and is considered a substitute for dang gui, Angelica sinensis. In Kampo medicine, A. acutioloba roots are used to treat gynaecological diseases in the female reproductive system. left =Other uses= The leaves of the plant are edible. A. acutiloba is used as an ornamental plant in gardens. The root extract can be used in cosmetics and act as a moisturizer, which may help to prevent the aging of the skin. Toxicity and insecticidal properties Angelica acutiloba contains furocoumarins, which increase skin sensitivity to sunlight and may cause dermatitis. The furocoumarins produced by plants are toxic and often utilized as a self-defense mechanism to prevent plants from predators. According to a study, phthalides and furanocoumarins extracted from the A. acutiloba root can be utilized as a natural insecticide, and against larvae and adult Drosophila melanogaster. Etymology The Japanese name t≈çki (ÂΩìÂ∏∞) is directly derived from the same Chinese characters or Tang Kuei.(See wiktionary) It is sometimes confusing between two species: A. sinensis and A. acutiloba. A. sinensis is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and known as ‚ÄúÂΩìÂΩí‚Äù. Chinese denote A. acutiloba as ‚Äú‰∏úÂΩìÂΩí‚Äù, meaning Japanese Danggui. However, A. sinensis in Japanese is known as , meaning Chinese Danggui. While Japanese have given name for A. acutiloba as '. The Chinese characters \\"ÂΩìÂΩí\\" or \\"Áï∂Ê≠∏\\" literally mean ‚Äúreturn‚Äù. In 'Sh√©nn√≥ng Bƒõn C«éo Jƒ´ng' (), Angelica plant had been recorded as a very important herbal medicine in traditional Chinese medicine. In ancient times, a husband might leave the house if his wife was suffering from a gynecological disease. The wife drank the medicine made from Angelica root. Surprisingly, her disease was cured. Meanwhile, her husband believed he should go home as his wife became healthy again. As a result, people gave name of the plant with the meaning of ‚Äúreturn‚Äù. But the fact is still uncertain. Bencao Gangmu (Êú¨ËçâÁ∂±ÁõÆ), written by Li Shizhen in the 17th century, provides an explanation of the original name of the plant. In ancient days, married women were responsible for bearing the offspring. Angelica root was a great medicine that could help to regulate women's blood flow, so it implied that her missing for her husband and she was ready to marry him., „ÄåÂç≥„Å°ÂΩìÂ∏∞„ÅÆÂêç„ÅØÊùéÊôÇÁèç 15 „Å´Âæì„Åà„Å∞Â∏∞„ÅØÂ∏∞Â´Å„ÅÆÂ∏∞,Â§´„ÇíÊÄù„ÅÜ„ÅÆÊÑè„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä,Â§´ÂΩì„Å´Â∏∞„Çã„Åπ„Åó„ÅÆË´∫„Å´„Çà„Çã„ÄÇ„ÄçÊú¨ËçâÁ∂±ÁõÆ The meaning of the plant might also refer to \\"wedding or marriage\\" or \\"ÂΩíÂ´Å/Â∏∞Â´Å\\".

Biography After studying art in Germany at Nuremberg and Munich, he practiced engraving until 1848, in which year he came to the United States and taught for a time in Newark, New Jersey. In 1851, he married Julia Adelaide Torrey. They eventually had four children. After his marriage, he engraved plates for bank notes, painted portraits and colored photographs. In 1857 he was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design. In 1857 he moved to Madison, New Jersey, where he painted Lament of the Fallen Spirits and Redemption. George III, New York City, ca. 1859 About this time, he was invited to assist in preparing new decorations for the capitol in Washington. In 1861 he transferred his studio to Westerly, Rhode Island, where he painted Father Time and his Family and The Final Harvest (1862), The Dispensation of the Promise and the Law (containing 150 figures, 1863), Walk to Emmaus, The Walk to Gethsemane, Easter Morning, Magdalen at the Sepulchre, The Rock of Ages, and others (1868).Downes 1934 His painting Rock of Ages became enormously popular and was reproduced in millions of photographs and chromolithographs for sale both in the United States and England. American Civil War \\"Convalescent Soldiers Passing Through Washington to Join their Units\\" by Johannes Adam Simon Oertel, 1864 During the American Civil War, Oertel accompanied the Army of Virginia under General Burnside for several months in 1862. His Virginia Turnpike and other landscapes were the fruit of this military experience. He also did some historical battle scenes, such as the \\"Battle of Sullivan's Island\\" that happened during the American Revolutionary War, and some illustrations for Harper's Weekly, such as the cover for November 15, 1864 issue, of \\"Convalescent Soldiers Passing through Washington, DC, to Re-join their Units\\" and \\"The Union Scout\\". While residing at Westerly, he prepared himself for orders in the Episcopal church, and he was made deacon in 1865, and subsequently presbyter. He then confined himself almost entirely to the domain of Christian art, and painted pictures that he presented to churches in Glen Cove, New York, New York City, Washington, D.C., North Carolina, and elsewhere. He was in Washington, D.C., during the funeral of President Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1865, and left an eloquent account of the event. St James Episcopal Church \\"The Union Scout\\" by Johannes Adam Simon Oertel, 1866 The Rev. Johannes Oertel served as the priest of St James Episcopal Church in Lenoir, North Carolina, from 1869 to 1874. He was one of the first in the valley to offer a school for African American children, and offered religious services to those recently freed from slavery, including baptism, confirmation, marriage and funeral rites.Oertel Art & Tours St. James Episcopal Church. The Reredos in front of the church is an outstanding example of his woodworking skills. Made from over four hundred pieces of chestnut, oak, poplar, holly, cherry, beech, and pine, they were often carved during missionary trips to the Chapel of Rest in Happy Valley, North Carolina, and the Chapel of Peace in Witnel, North Carolina The architectural design is Gothic perpendicular from the 14th and 16th centuries. While Rev. Oertel carved other reredos and altar rails, the one in St. James is considered to be the most intricate and notable. The altar painting (1872) is layered oil on canvass with gold gilt, and depicts Jesus administering Holy Communion to male and female communicants. While at St. James, friends in New York donated the 100-year-old pump organ from Christ Episcopal Church (Tarrytown, New York). The organ, dating from about 1770, was the first instrument to enhance the service in Lenoir. Rev. Oertel rebuilt the damaged organ, making new pipes, and a new wind chest and bellows. He then carved an illuminated case for the organ works. By the main church door of the church is \\"Father Time and His Family\\", (1862, charcoal and pen on paper), which was completed in Westerly, Rhode Island. It depicts Father Time, his wife (the year) and their children (the months). Each child carries an item from the Cornucopia representative of their month.\\"Father Time and His Family.\\" By Johannes A. Oertel. [New York]: [publisher not identified], 1860.

Many of his head and bust portraits were popular after the Civil War, and he did a number of them for prosperous clients in New England. He made an interesting portrait of the Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, Thomas A. Doyle, as a young man on his way up. He would later serve eighteen years as the mayor, and brought Providence, Rhode Island from a manufacturing town to a small metropolis. The Rev. Oertel is also known for his head of St Paul, held today by the St. James Episcopal Church, and portrayed as a weary but stern man. Later years Oertel was an instructor of art at Washington University in St Louis, in 1889‚Äì91. He spent the last 18 years of his life in a town near Washington DC, where he made many religious paintings and wood carvings. He painted a series of four large pictures entitled The Plan of Redemption which he presented to Sewanee (the University of the South in Tennessee). His last major work came in 1906‚Äì07 when he created the paintings and designed the new woodwork for the altarpiece of the Cathedral at Quincy, Illinois. Oertel's grave, Flint Hill Cemetery, Oakton, Virginia Oertel died in Vienna, Virginia, where he was living with one of his sons, and is buried in Flint Hill Cemetery in nearby Oakton. Collections of his papers are held by the libraries of George Washington Universityhttps://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms2138.xml and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Papers. 1863. Abstract: Diary, 386 p., with entries dated 1868 to 1882, and about sixty enclosures from the diary, including some twenty letters to Oertel and copies of letters from him to others, newspaper clippings, and writings, chiefly poems and sermons, by Oertel and others. Among the topics covered in diary entries are the difficulties Oertel experienced in balancing church duties and the creation of religious art; his poverty; his frustration with an art-buying public that appeared to prefer foreign to American religious art and portraits of themselves and paintings of animals to religious art in general; his annoyance with the art establishment in New York and other major centers and with art agents and publishers; his confrontations with church officials in North Carolina and New York; and his difficulties with parishioners, especially in Morganton. In these entries, there is much about Oertel's efforts to make his family comfortable, but little about the activities of individual family members, except for their involvement in the Orange Springs, Fla., sawmill venture. Few friends and acquaintances are named. Two who were involved in his work were William Cullen Bryant, whose poems Oertel illustrated, and Sarah Rebecca Cameron of Hillsborough, N.C., with whom Oertel was involved in an aborted effort to produce an illustrated volume of religious stories.

In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport. STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sports for Women status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports. As of June 2020, the NCAA Division I Strategic Vision and Planning Committee did not recommend introducing a STUNT proposal into the next legislative cycle. https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/committees/d1/council/June2020D1Council_Report.pdf\\"Cheer's New Sport \\"Stunt\\" Reaches Major Milestone For NCAA Emerging Sport Status\\" by Valerie Ninemier, About.com  STUNT History  From 2011‚Äì2013 University of Louisville were the National Champions for Division I Stunt. Oklahoma State University broke their streak in 2014 and have remained the Division I champion every year since. As for Division II, University of Central Oklahoma won the championship from 2012 to 2014, then Davenport University won in 2015 and has continued to claim the title in subsequent years. Not only is STUNT a college sport but starting in 2014, high school teams adopted the new sport as well. In 2014, more than 160 girls from 11 high schools from New York's Public School Athletic League (PSAL), competed in NY's first STUNT competition. The competition was held at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. Many other teams have been practicing and competing in this sport across the nation. The four Quarters of Play, Competition Formats and Routines =The four quarters of play= There are four quarters in Stunt: 1.Partner Stunts 2.Pyramids and Tosses 3\\\\. Group Jumps and Tumbling 4.Team Performance. There are four rounds in the first three quarters, and three rounds in the fourth quarter. The order of competition is determined each round by the team who has control of possession. The two teams will play on opposite sides of the floor and perform routines against each other in all four quarters. Each quarter has its own level of difficulty to demonstrate. =Competition format= There are two formats for the STUNT game 1.Head to Head Includes two teams playing and competing against one another. Usually the game takes about 40 minutes. 2.STUNT tournaments tournaments where multiple teams compete head to head. A regular three-team tournament game finishes in 1 hour, and a four-team tournament game takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. =STUNT routines= Every year the USA Cheer STUNT Competition Committee develops STUNT routines and publishes them. They are responsible for determining the number of athletes and the skills needed in each routine. The difficulty in skill of each stunt is ranged from one to seven. Play one has the least difficult skill to seven having the highest difficulty skill. General STUNT framework =Staff= ‚Ä¢One head coach, and maximum of three assistants. ‚Ä¢Game play can consist of a maximum of 20 athletes, and 30 on a team roster per team. =Season/Post-season= ‚Ä¢Spring sport season commences play in January, but scrimmages start prior to this. ‚Ä¢Teams participate in competitions among national regions. ‚Ä¢During the 2012 season, it is mandatory for each participating team in STUNT to attend at least three regular season games/tournaments. However, it will be increased to a minimum of 12 regular season games/tournaments upon the establishment of STUNT as an NCCA Emerging Sport. ‚Ä¢Postseason play: Regional winners and top ranking ‚Äúat-large‚Äù teams are invited to the National Championship Tournament. ‚Ä¢National rankings are based on each team's win-loss record, strength of schedule, and a coach/judge's poll. =Field of play= ‚Ä¢A completion floor with a size of 54 ft √ó 42 ft consists of nine non-spring, carpet bonded, foam mat panels with a minimum 1-3/8 in. Thickness. Each mat panel, 6 ft √ó 42 ft in size, will be connected along its seams using 4 in. Widen Velcro strip. ‚Ä¢Each side of the mat will be used for teams‚Äô seating and two mat panels for team warm-ups. ‚Ä¢In a two team game, each team will have the entire surface of the 2 mat panels as a team practice area. ‚Ä¢In a three or four team tournament, the 2 mat panels will be divided in half using white Velcro strips, or white athletic tape. Each team will use a practice area that is 12 x 21 feet size. =Equipment= ‚Ä¢Competition floor and additional mat panels for team practice area ‚Ä¢Scoreboard ‚Ä¢Audio and public address sound system ‚Ä¢Team branches ‚Ä¢Necessary table and chairs for staff ‚Ä¢Water stations =Event staffing= The host team or event producer is expected to supply the following: ‚Ä¢A minimum of three judges ‚Ä¢One game official ‚Ä¢Scoreboard operator ‚Ä¢Music/Audio operator ‚Ä¢Announcer ‚Ä¢Appropriate medical personnel (EMT, medical doctor and / or certified athletic trainer) =Skill rules= STUNT teams are required to comply with the College STUNT Safety Rules published by AACCA. =Game/ tournament timeline= ‚Ä¢Team Warm up: Before the game begins, each team will be given 15 minutes for warm up skills on the performance area completion floor. Teams may continue to warm-up on their practice mats as needed. ‚Ä¢Team Introductions: The visiting teams(s) will be introduced first followed by the home team. ‚Ä¢Coin Toss or Draw for Possession: Before the play begins, the team head coaches will determine the initial possession for any game or tournament through a random drawing which is administered by the game official. ‚Ä¢National Anthem Game rules =Scoring= Quarters 1, 2 and 3 There are three scoring officials who individually rank the teams according to the number of execution mistakes and the degree of those mistakes. For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash ‚Äú/‚Äù) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an ‚ÄúX‚Äù) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error. The decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official's rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same number of points as there are teams competing. Quarter 4 In the fourth quarter, teams make their own routines based on their unique skill level and talents. The routine performed in the fourth quarter is a combination of elements of the first three quarters and necessitates that each of the preceding categories must be represented so as to get full points. The scoring officials individually score the elements based on the team's performance by category, considering the difficulty of skills executed. The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine. In order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter. At any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction. =Timeouts= ‚Ä¢Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half. ‚Ä¢Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a ‚ÄúT‚Äù figuration. ‚Ä¢During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area. =Possession= ‚Ä¢Start of the Game A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game. ‚Ä¢Quarter Change The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score. ‚Ä¢Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round. ‚Ä¢Forfeits If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round. ‚Ä¢Ties If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession. ‚Ä¢Quarter Change If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time. If a tie persists, possession is determined by the pre-game drawing results. ‚Ä¢Second and Third Rounds of each Quarter If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the pre-game drawing results. =Playoff for final score tiebreaker= If a tie for 1st place occurs at the end of regulation, a playoff will determine the winner of the game/tournament. The playoff period consists only of quarters 1, 2 and 3. Judges will, at the end, rank the tying teams. =Final score= Points are given and declared at the end of each quarter with the game total being displayed on the event scoreboard. The game/tournament winner is the team that has accumulated the most total points for the game. Other definitions Game Two teams will compete Head to head, involving four quarters and halftime. Halftime is in between quarters 2+3. Completion of a Round This part shows that each round is finalized after the round is scored and announced. Halftime It is a pause of 10 minutes that is given in between 2nd and 3rd quarters of a game. Head-to Head A competition including two people or teams with a similar routine on different sides concurrently. = Neutral Zone It is a midpoint or borderline. The neutral zone is where the officials stand and is defined by 4‚Äùextensive white Velcro strips which distinguish the area from proximity mat sections. Practice Mats Practice mats consist of two mat sections and their extent is 6 feet by 42 feet appropriate to teams for warm- up areas in juxtaposition to their team bench. Quarter Break Quarter break only consists of two minutes breaks and each player takes in between quarters of play. Round It is duration of time and each team decides 6 pre-arranged procedures for performing. The rounds are divided into three part including quarters 1, 2 and 3. The 4th quarter is related with the performance of each team and involves one round. Routine Call The team with possession will decide the routine which is performed in a certain round.

Due to her role in the Bahraini uprising, she was arrested for 149 days, allegedly tortured, and sentenced to 3 years in prison. On 21 September 2012, her sentence was reduced to six months' imprisonment by an appeals court. Biography Jalila al- Salman worked as an educator for 25 years. According to Human Rights First, she worked to reform the Bahrain education system, and as a result \\"faced numerous threats and was passed over for promotion\\". At the time of her imprisonment, she was the vice president of the Bahrain Teacher's Association (BTA). Role in the Bahraini uprising In February 2011, large-scale pro- democracy protests began in Bahrain as part of the international Arab Spring. Al-Salman was active in organizing teachers‚Äô strikes in support in February and March. On 20 February, the BTA called for a three-day strike demanding reforms in Bahrain's educational system and protesting killing and suppression of protesters, of which students made a high percentage. More than five thousand teachers participated in the strike. When martial law was imposed on 16 March, BTA called for another strike, this one lasting ten days. On 16 October, she participated in a symposium organised by Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party asking teachers to raise their voice and speak about the violation they went through \\"like doctors\\". =Arrest= On 29 March, over two dozen security officers in balaclavas, armed with machine guns and batons, raided al-Salman's house after midnight and arrested her in front of her family, including her three children, while she was wearing her nightdress. \\"They pulled me from my neck, weapons pointed at my head and asked me not to be afraid, because they were police\\", al-Salman said.\\"ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ≠ÿ©: ŸÑŸÖÿßÿ∞ÿß ŸÑÿß ŸäŸÜÿßŸÖ ÿ£ÿ∑ŸÅÿßŸÑ ÿ¨ŸÑŸäŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑŸÖÿßŸÜÿü\\".

Names I can‚Äôt bring myself to repeat.\\" According to al-Salman, in the first week, she was taken to the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) in Adliya, where she was kept in solitary confinement for 10 days, forced to stand for prolonged periods, investigated in harsh conditions and forced to sign papers she was not allowed to read. She was also threatened with sexual assault. Al-Salman was then transferred to Al Qurain military prison where she remained for two months. After that, she was moved to Isa Town female detention center, at which point her family learned her whereabouts.\\"Jalila al-Salman and Mahdi 'Issa Mahdi Abu Dheeb: Possible Prisoners of Conscience\\" Amnesty International, Retrieved 7 April 2012 They were only allowed few visits, which were \\"under very strict surveillance\\". =Trial= Al-Salman's first hearing was at a special military court on 6 June. She was only allowed to see a lawyer for five minutes before the hearing. Al-Salman, along with BTA president Mahdi Abu Deeb, pleaded not guilty to \\"inciting others to commit crimes, calling for the hatred and overthrow of the ruling system, holding pamphlets, disseminating fabricated stories and information, leaving work on purpose and encouraging others to do so and taking part at illegal gatherings\\". However, the Judge said their \\"statements, investigations and technical information are enough to blame them\\". Their case was postponed to 15 June. They had two other hearings on 22 and 29 June.

He held the position of professor from 1880 at the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle and from 1883 he was professor at the Paris Agricultural Institute, teaching at the Sorbonne during the same period. His main area of study was water transportation in plants. In 1880 he stated that the movement of water in plants is due to both transpiration and root pressure. He was also interested in the effect of temperature on root absorption of water from the soil. Vesque proved that water moved through the cavities of the vessels and not along the walls of plant vessels. During his research he invented laboratory instruments for studying transpiration in plants. He is denoted by the author abbreviation Vesque when citing a botanical name.

Route description Spur 194, known as Railroad Avenue within the city of Fort Stockton and Old Alpine Road (proposed FM 3531) beyond, begins at a point southwest of Fort Stockton where TxDOT takes over maintenance of the former highway to Alpine from the county. The route begins as a two-lane road, then becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane just outside the city limits. The spur follows to the northeast along the north side of the South Orient Rail Line before ending at US 385. History Most of Spur 194 follows the original alignment of US 67 between Fort Stockton and Alpine along Old Alpine Road from 1932 until the current US 67 roadway was constructed to the west sometime after 1940 and before the creation of the spur. Spur 194 was designated on December 10, 1946 following a longer route that began at its present southern terminus at a former stockyard near a railroad crossing and extended further along the present US 385 terminating at what was then US 290 and now Business Interstate 10-G. In 1949, the stretch of the current US 385 south of US 290 was designated as Farm to Market Road 1214 (FM 1214) over a route that eventually was extended to Marathon. On October 24, 1956, FM 1214 was incorporated into a southern extension of State Highway 51 (SH 51) On August 28, 1958, SH 51 was cancelled and changed to US 385, and Spur 194 was truncated to avoid a dual designation over US 385 on December 10, 1959.

She is based at Petersburg, Alaska and is responsible for law enforcement, search and rescue, and maritime defense. Design and characteristics The Island-class patrol boats, including Anacapa, were constructed in Bollinger Shipyards in Lockport, Louisiana. Their design is based on the British Vosper Thornycroft patrol boats and have similar dimensions. Anacapa has an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at full load. The patrol boat has a displacement of 155 tons at full load and 138 tons at half load. Anacapa was launched on September 8, 1989. She was the 35th Island-class vessel completed. The Coast Guard purchased 49 Island-class cutters, and over the course of their construction made several modifications. The ships are grouped into A, B, and C classes depending on their design. Anacapa is a B-class ship and thus has heavier bow plating to prevent hull cracking in heavy seas, among other enhancements. Anacapa is powered two Paxman Valenta 16 CM Diesel engines which drive two 5-blade propellers. She has two Caterpillar 3304T diesel generators for electrical power. Her hull is constructed of high-strength steel, and her superstructure and main deck are constructed of aluminium. Stern flaps were retrofitted to reduce hull friction, and increase speed and full efficiency. Anacapa has active fin stabilizers to improve her seakeeping characteristics. The Island-class patrol boats have maximum sustained speeds of . They are fitted with one 25mm machine gun and two Browning .50 Caliber Machine Gun. They are equipped with satellite navigation systems, collision avoidance systems, and surface radar. They have a range of at 8 knots, and an at-sea endurance of five days. Anacapa carries one 18-foot rigid hull inflatable boat with seating for 8 crew. Anacapa's complement is 2 officers and 14 enlisted crew. Anacapa's namesake is Anacapa Island, one of the Channel Islands off the Southern California coast. Operational history USCGC Anacapa directs streams of water into the Japanese derelict Ryou-Un Maru to sink it after shelling it. Holes from the Mk 38 25 mm chain gun are clearly visible in the side of the boat. The Anacapa has been homeported in Petersburg, Alaska for her entire career. She was commissioned there on January 13, 1990. She replaced USCGC Cape Hatteras at that station. Her primary missions are law enforcement, including safety and fisheries laws, search and rescue, and maritime defense operations. The ship's law enforcement duties have included policing the international border with Canada. The United States and Canada disagree on the location of the maritime border in Dixon Entrance. This led to a series of seizures of Canadian fishing boats by Anacapa in the disputed waters. Western Eagle was fishing 300 yards into U.S. waters when she was seized on July 15, 1991. The troller Barbarella was seized 800 yards north of the border claimed by the U.S. on July 14, 1991. A 1990 agreement between the two countries reduced fishing conflicts when it became effective in 1992. Nonetheless, patrols of the disputed waters continued and on June 22, 1995 Anacapa seized the Canadian fishing vessel Chi Dona 300 yards north of the border. Anacapa also enforces fishing, safety, and other regulations on U.S.-flagged vessels. On August 11, 1993 a boarding party from Anacapa removed 15 illegal immigrants working aboard the fish processing ship Ocean Pride. She conducts routine safety inspections of vessels in her patrol area. In the summer of 2018, for instance, Anacapa's boardings found three vessels in violation of various regulations. Anacapa's search and rescue missions frequently involve the sizable local fishing fleet. For example, on May 8, 1992 Anacapa towed the fishing vessel Justy back to Petersburg with a malfunctioning propeller shaft. The next day she towed the disabled fishing vessel Sirius to Petersburg with a bad oil pump. In July of 1996 Anacapa rescued the four-man crew of the capsized fishing vessel Baranof Queen. While assisting the local fishing fleet may be the norm, Anacapa has responded on a wide range of search and rescue missions. For example, on January 20, 1990, a week after her commissioning, the Canadian tanker Frank H. Brown went aground in Wrangell Narrows and spilled 57,600 gallons of gasoline into the waterway. USCGC Anacapa in 2011In December 2008 Anacapa sailed to the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland for a major renovation under the Mission Effectiveness Program. The renovation was intended to extend the service life of the cutter. Significant portions of corroded hull plating, air-conditioning, water makers, and fire systems were replaced, and a number of major systems, including main engine control, were upgraded. The cost of the upgrade was between $7 and $9 million. On May 31, 2011, Lieutenant Matthias Wholley was relieved of command of the Anacapa six weeks ahead of schedule. On June 30, 2011, the Coast Guard announced that an investigation had confirmed Wholley had been intoxicated while on duty. Wholley received a letter of reprimand, 60-day restriction, and forfeiture of half months pay for two months. On 5 April 2012, the Anacapa intercepted the derelict 165 ft Japanese squid fishing boat Ryou-Un Maru in the Gulf of Alaska 180 miles (290 km) off the coast of Southeast Alaska. It had been washed away from its mooring in Aomori Prefecture, Japan by the March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, and had drifted unmanned for more than a year across the Pacific Ocean. The Coast Guard concluded that it was safer to sink it deep water rather than let it continue to drift and possibly become a hazard to navigation or the environment. The Anacapa fired on the ghost ship with her Mk 38 25mm autocannon, holing it and eventually sinking it with fire hoses in approximately 1,800-metre (6,000 ft) of water. Anacapa has earned the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Special Operations Service Ribbon.  Replacement plans  As early as the mid-2000s the mechanical reliability of the aging Island-class ships became an issue. The Coast Guard began retiring Island-class cutters in 2012, replacing them with Sentinel- class fast-response cutters. The Coast Guard has indicated that it plans to replace Anacapa with a Marine Protector-Class coastal patrol boat rather than a fast response cutter.

Cook County, 506 U.S. 56 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a seizure of property like that which occurs during an eviction, even absent a search or an arrest, implicates the Fourth Amendment. The Court also held that the Amendment protects property as well as privacy interests, in both criminal as well as civil contexts. Finally, saying that \\"certain wrongs affect more than a single right\\", the Court left open the possibility that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections against deprivation of property without due process of law may also be implicated.  Background  Plaintiffs Edward and Mary Soldal and family owned a mobile home, and lived on a lot of land that they were renting in a trailer park in Elk Grove, Illinois. In August 1987, Terrace Properties, the owner of the park, filed suit to evict the Soldals, and a court hearing was scheduled. Two weeks before the hearing, however, the park manager called the Cook County sheriff's office and told them that she was planning to evict a family on that day, and requested the presence of deputy sheriffs, fearing that Soldal might resist being evicted. Such so-called \\"self-help evictions\\" (without a court order to evict) are illegal in many states, including Illinois. That afternoon, two Terrace employees, accompanied by a deputy sheriff, began wrenching the sewer and water boxes off the side of the mobile home, causing damage to it. When Soldal approached, the deputy sheriff said that he \\"was there to see that [Soldal] didn't interfere with the workers.\\" The workers disconnected the phone, tore off the skirting and canopy of the trailer, and hooked a tractor to it. Soldal called his lawyer, who called the sheriff's office ‚Äì which at first denied that there was any deputy sheriff on the scene. When Soldal returned to the scene, two more deputy sheriffs had arrived. He demanded that they file a criminal complaint against Terrace, and they referred him to their lieutenant, who was meeting with the manager in her office. After making Soldal wait outside for nearly a half-hour, the lieutenant came out and told Soldal to talk to the states attorney, then went back inside. After another half-hour, he told Soldal that he would not accept his complaint because \\"it was between landlord and tenant.\\" Yet another two deputies arrived, and the workers pulled the trailer free of its moorings and towed it onto the street. Five days later, the judge who had been scheduled to hear the eviction case ruled that the one just described was unlawful, and ordered the home returned to the lot. The home, however, was badly damaged. Soldal brought an action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, codified as 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, alleging a violation of their civil rights under the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment. The named defendants were Terrace Properties (the manager of the park) together with several Cook County deputy sheriffs and the Cook County State's Attorney. Soldal alleged a conspiracy to unreasonably seize and remove the family's trailer home. However, the District Judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, on the grounds that the Soldals had failed to cite any evidence to support their conspiracy theory. Without that, a \\"state action\\" ‚Äì which is fundamental to claims arising under ¬ß 1983 ‚Äì was non-existent. = Appeal = At appeal, a panel of three judges split 2‚Äì1 to affirm the dismissal. On rehearing, a majority of the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc with a full complement of 11 judges, reaffirmed the panel decision by a narrow 6‚Äì5 margin. This time the Court found that while the deputies did not actively participate in the eviction, their presence did prevent Soldal from exercising his common law right to use reasonable force to protect his home from private action ‚Äì an action that the officers knew (or should have known) to be illegal. At face value, therefore, the appeals court accepted Soldal's contention that all defendants, public and private, were acting together in conspiracy (e.g., to get rid of a pesky tenant), and that all of them were acting \\"under color of state law\\".Soldal, 942 F. 2d, at 1075. However, citing the existence of adequate legal remedies for an illegal eviction ‚Äì \\"state remedies if they are adequate, a federal remedy under the due process clause if not\\" ‚Äì the Appeals Court was loath to \\"bend\\" the Fourth Amendment into yet another remedy. \\"Bent it would have to be, because the amendment was never intended to regulate garden-variety commercial disputes of the sort involved in this case.\\"Soldal, 942 F. 2d, at 1076. While acknowledging that a \\"seizure\\" had occurred in the literal sense, they found that no \\"search\\" had occurred ‚Äì nobody ever entered the home, or conducted an investigation seeking to make an arrest, or invaded \\"private space\\" under a law enforcement context. They feared that using the literal interpretation of \\"seizure\\" to \\"make every repossession and eviction with police assistance actionable under ‚Äì of all things ‚Äì the Fourth Amendment would both trivialize the amendment and gratuitously shift a large body of routine commercial litigation from the state courts to the federal courts.\\"Soldal, 942 F. 2d, at 1077. The Appeals Court reasoned that \\"the police did, of course, take Soldal's home away, and that was a grave deprivation. But it was a deprivation purely of property; there was no invasion of the Soldals' privacy.\\" Therefore, they concluded, no seizure had occurred, at least not in the context of the Fourth Amendment. Saying that the Soldals may have prevailed had they brought their claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment instead of under the Fourth Amendment, the Appeals Court finished by saying that \\"the Soldals, to repeat, had remedies; they chose the wrong one.\\"Soldal, 942 F. 2d, at 1080.  Supreme Court  Soldal next petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, both of which were granted on March 9, 1992.Soldal v. Cook County, 503 U.S. 918 (1992). = Questions presented = * Is a repossession or eviction that is conducted or assisted by state officers actionable under the Fourth Amendment? * Can there be a 'seizure' without a 'search'? In other words, must there be an infringement of privacy rights before property rights can implicate the Fourth Amendment? * Does the right to be free of unreasonable seizure apply only in the criminal context, or does it apply in the civil context as well? =The ruling= In their unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court Justices said, \\"As a result of the state action in this case, the Soldals' domicile was not only seized, it literally was carried away, giving new meaning to the term 'mobile home'.\\"Soldal, 506 U.S., at 61. The Court emphatically disagreed with the Appeals Court, and found that: * The Fourth Amendment protects both property as well as privacy interests. * Even absent a search or an arrest, a seizure of property implicates the Fourth Amendment. * The Fourth Amendment applies not only to seizures made within a criminal context, but also to those made within a civil context as well. The case was reversed and remanded.  Privacy rights vs. property rights  The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment),Ker v. California, . provides that: As was defined by United States v. Jacobsen, the first Clause of the Fourth Amendment: The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person, or of any person's home (including its curtilage) or personal property without a warrant. Although much of the recent body of Fourth Amendment cases have turned on privacy issues, there is nothing in the case law that says that a seizure must invoke a privacy concern in order to implicate the Fourth Amendment. In fact, the Amendment protects both property and privacy, both together and separately.  Seizures without invasion of privacy?  In United States v. Place, although the Court found that subjecting luggage to a \\"dog sniff\\" did not constitute a search for Fourth Amendment purposes because it did not compromise any privacy interest, they also found that taking custody of Place's suitcase was deemed an unlawful seizure, for it unreasonably infringed upon \\"the suspect's possessory interest in his luggage.\\"United States v. Place, . Although lacking a privacy component, the property rights in both instances nonetheless were not disregarded, but rather were afforded Fourth Amendment protection. Likewise, Soldal's possessory interest in his home must be protected. The Court held that: What is more, the Court reasoned, their decisions involving the \\"plain view doctrine\\" go against the notion that the Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizures of property only where privacy or liberty is also implicated. Suppose, for example, that police officers lawfully enter a house, by either complying with the warrant requirement or satisfying one of its recognized exceptions (e.g., through a valid consent or a showing of exigent circumstances) ‚Äî If they come across some item in plain view and seize it, no invasion of personal privacy has occurred.Horton v. California, . If the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment were defined exclusively by rights of privacy, \\"plain view\\" seizures would not implicate that constitutional provision at all. To the contrary, however, the existing case law surrounding plain view seizures shows that such cases have been scrupulously subjected to Fourth Amendment inquiry.  Criminal vs. civil context  The Court took issue with the inference of the Appeals Court that different rules apply, depending on whether a seizure takes place within a criminal context or a civil context. The court dismissed this theory, as they have before,Camara v. Municipal Court of San Francisco, ; see also O'Connor v. Ortega, ; New Jersey v. T. L. 0., . saying that it is \\"anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.\\"  'Dominant character' of a claim?  The Court also dismissed the lower court's theory that the Soldal's claim was more akin to a Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the deprivation of property without due process of law than against an unreasonable seizure, and therefore the Soldal's should not be allowed to bring their suit under the guise of the Fourth Amendment. To that, the Court said:  Floodgates?  Responding to the lower court's fears about transferring cases involving routine repossessions and evictions into the Federal Court system, the Court instructed that \\"reasonableness is still the ultimate standard\\" under the Fourth Amendment.Camara, 387 U.S., at 539. Saying that \\"we doubt that the police will often choose to further an enterprise knowing that it is contrary to the law\\",Soldal, 506 U.S., at 72. the Court rejected the notion that this case will unleash a wave of new litigation.

Mariana Yampolsky (September 6, 1925 ‚Äì May 3, 2002) was one of the major figures in 20th-century Mexican photography, specializing in capturing photos of common people in everyday situations in the rural areas of the country. She was born in the United States, but came to Mexico to study art and never left, becoming a Mexican citizen in 1958. Her career in photography began as a sideline to document travels and work in the arts and politics, but she began showing her photography in the 1960s. From then until her death in 2002, her work was exhibited internationally receiving awards and other recognition both during her lifetime and posthumously. Biography Interview with artist Helen Bickham on her relationship with the photographer Mariana Yampolsky was born September 6, 1925 in Chicago, Illinois. Her mother was Hedwig Urbach. Her father, Oscar Yampolsky, was a Russian Jewish sculptor and painter who had immigrated to the United States to escape anti-Semitism. She was raised on her paternal grandfather's farm in Illinois until she finished high school. Her mother was from an upper-class German Jewish family whose family would later immigrate to Brazil to escape the Nazis. Her maternal grandfather was Franz Boas, who established the field of anthropology in the United States. Her family was intellectual, cultured, socialist with a worldview that was later defined as \\"global humanism.\\" She received her Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences from the University of Chicago in 1944. That same year, her father died and her mother moved to New York. The following year, Yampolsky went to Mexico to study and where she would spend the rest of her life, becoming a Mexican citizen in 1958. She died on May 3, 2002, survived by her husband Arjen van der Sluis. Career While best known for her photography, she did printing, lithography and painting. She also worked as a curator and editor. Yampolsky's career began when she arrived to Mexico City to study painting and sculpture at the National School for Painting, Sculpture and Graphics, commonly known as La Esmeralda. She met Pablo O'Higgins, who would introduce her shortly thereafter to Leopoldo M√©ndez. She became a member of the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (People's Graphics Workshop) in 1945 as the only woman at the time. This was an organization dedicated to creating and promoting art with a political slant, especially anti-fascism, for the masses, founded in 1937 by Leopoldo M√©ndez, Pablo O'Higgins and Luis Arenal. She was a printmaker with this group until 1960, and the first member of its Executive Committee. Through the Taller she exhibited her printmaking work from between 1945 and 1958. Her work with this group includes images of Emiliano Zapata and Zapatista soldiers. Her work with the Taller, as well as her relationships with the other members helped her \\"fall in love\\" with Mexico, its people, its folk art its vegetation, politics and culture. She learned to dance many of the folk dances of the country. She met other artists of her generation including Francisco Mora, √Ångel Bracho and Alberto Beltr√°n who helped her learn Spanish and encouraged her to draw everything she saw in Mexico, both in Mexico City and other Mexican states. She also worked as a curator, organizing exhibitions in Mexico and in other countries such as Sweden, Japan, and France. Yampolsky began her work in photography in 1948, initially to record her personal travels and the activities of the Taller in the 1940s and 1950s. She studied photography at the San Carlos Academy with Lola Alvarez Bravo and Manuel Alvarez Bravo. Influence from these photographers can be seen in works such as \\"The Blessing of the Corn\\" (1960s) and \\"Apron\\" (1988). In 1951 she was a founder-member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana at the National School for Painting, Sculpture and Graphics. Her first exhibition of photography occurred in 1960. For three years in the late 1960s, she traveled Mexico's rural areas to photograph for the Fondo de la Pl√°stica Mexicana publishing house. These pictures include images of murals, the work of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada, European painting in Mexico and folk art. From the 1970s to the 1990s, her photographs were shown in solo exhibitions in the Netherlands, England and Mexico. Over her lifetime, Yampolsky took over 66,000 photographs. Yampolsky was a graphic arts editor for primary school textbooks, which used many reproductions of paintings, graphics, sculpture and photography. These included texts dedicated to mathematics, literature, the natural and the social sciences. These numbered about 550 million books. In the 1960s and 1970s, she worked with Leopoldo M√©ndez on a book called \\"The Ephemera and the Eternal of Mexican Popular Art.\\" She worked as an illustrator for the newspaper \\"El D√≠a\\" in Mexico City and a publication of the Mexican Ministry of Communications called \\"Annals.\\" She collaborated on illustration for a children's book called \\"Colibr√≠\\" as well as natural science textbooks in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1980, she created the book \\"Ni√±os\\" (Children), which is a heavily illustrated art book with images of children in various stages from pre-Hispanic to modern times, published by the Mexican Ministry of Public Education. Through the rest of the decade she edited various art books related to Mexican artists, food, toys, customs and ceremonies. Her work can be found in 15 monographic books and in numerous public and private collections in the world, including those of the Museo de Arte Moderno, Centro Cultural de Arte Contempor√°neo, The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Fototeca Nacional of INAH in Pachuca. It has been exhibited in over 50 one-woman exhibitions and approximately 150 group exhibitions internationally, in countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Italy. Yampolsky played an important role in building collections of images about Mexico, such as the Wittliff collections, the largest in the United States. She promoted the project in Mexico and introduced the Witliff Foundation to almost every important photographer in Mexico. Artistic inclination Yampolsky's influences as a photographer include Tina Modotti, Manuel and Lola √Ålvarez Bravo, Nacho L√≥pez and H√©ctor Garc√≠a. The classic division of Mexican art into pre Hispanic, colonial and post Independence periods appears frequently in her work along with classic Mexican images such as cacti, agave plants, horses, field workers, masks, women working and skulls with themes such as scarcity, death and poverty. Most of her work focused on rural life in Mexico in the 20th century. It focuses on common people, which was not fashionable at the time. Yampolsky is quoted as saying that her art reflects \\"‚Ä¶ moments, in the lives of people that others perhaps don't see or don't value.\\" Her work shows the influence of her professors, the Bravos, as they show pride in the indigenous flora and people of the land, with frequent reference to the dignity of agrarian work. Her work is part of the Mexican photographic tradition of documenting the complexity of Mexican culture, including the negative aspects such as poverty, disease, resignation and lack of sanitation. Her photographs are not staged. She convinced people to go about their normal lives as she photographed. These photographs reflect her family's global humanism and anthropological background with important examples being The Exterminating Angel (1991); Waiting for the Priest (1987); Orange Stand (1969); Stacked Pi√±ata Pots (1988) and Jailhouse Patio (1987), with the aim of showing the various causes and aspects of poverty in Mexico. As part of her focus on rural life, an important aspect of her work was the promotion of Mexican handcrafts and folk art, of which she amassed a collection of over 3,000 pieces over her lifetime and was featured in some of her work. An exhibit dedicated to her collection was shown in 2012 at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. Recognition Yampolsky was recognized by the Sistema Nacional de Creadores of the Secretariat of Culture. She received Miguel Oth√≥n de Mendiz√°bal Prize from INAH in 2000. She was honored posthumously by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 2012 for her life's work. Mariana Yampolsky Foundation The Mariana Yampolsky Foundation (Fundaci√≥n Mariana Yampolsky in Spanish) was founded to honor the photographer's memory and to promote her life's work. It is led by her husband, Arjen van der Sluis, who donated their house in the Tlalpan borough of Mexico City to the Foundation. The Foundation has over 70,000 negatives of photographs related to Yampolsky and her life. It also maintains a complete collection of the \\"Colibr√≠\\" series which Yampolsky edited.

It arose from cross-cultural lexical studies that showed a six-factor model of personality that was slightly different from, and more predictive than, the previously accepted and still widely used Big Five and Five-Factor models of personality. It has been shown to predict workplace delinquency, risk-taking behavior, vengefulness, creativity, and several other personality traits and life outcomes that are not accounted for by five-factor questionnaires. Subscales Like the other facets of the HEXACO model, Honesty-Humility has four subscales: *Sincerity - this subscale measures a person's (un)willingness to be manipulative or dishonest in their dealings with other people in order to achieve a desired outcome. High scorers are unwilling to be dishonest or manipulative towards others. *Fairness - this subscale measures (un)willingness to cheat or steal in order to get ahead, as well as people's tendency to use fraud, be corrupt, or take advantage of others. High scorers have integrity and behave in a manner that treats all parties fairly and equitably. *Greed Avoidance - this scale measures the value a person places on things like wealth, status, and expensive \\"toys\\". Low scorers wish to display their money and luxury, whereas high scorers are less concerned with obtaining wealth and status. *Modesty - this scale measures a person's beliefs about him/herself in relation to others‚Äîhigh scorers see themselves as \\"no better\\" than anyone else, whereas low scorers feel they deserve special treatment and more respect than others. Each subscale contains items that measure both the trait and the opposite of the trait (e.g. the sincerity scale has items that measure both sincerity and insincerity, with insincerity scores being reverse coded). Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree, 5= Strongly Agree). In the 100-item version of the HEXACO questionnaire, each subscale has 4 items, which are averaged together to get individual subset scores, that are then averaged together to get each facet score. History Kibeom Lee and Michael C. Ashton began development of the HEXACO model of personality structure in 2000, after cross- cultural research using the same lexical measures that gave us the Big Five began to show a sixth facet of personality. The addition of this sixth factor changed several of the existing factors of the Five-Factor Model. It also integrated several items that did not fit well with the five-factor model and provided further evidence for the idea of reciprocal and kin altruism. Relation to the Big Five and Five Factor Models The Honesty-humility factor (and the HEXACO model in general) is only moderately correlated with the Big Five model of personality, but is highly correlated with the Agreeableness factor of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), which is one of the factors of the Five-Factor model of personality. This correlation is mainly due to the Straightforwardness and Modesty subscales of the NEO-PI-R. However, forcing the NEO-PI-R to extract separate factors for Honesty and Agreeableness allows experimenters to better predict Social Adroitness and Self-Monitoring. Another study found that adding the HEXACO Honesty-humility factor to personality measures improves predictive validity for both self- and other-reports of personality, and that simply creating an honesty factor from the FFM measures improves predictive validity for some measures (mainly social adroitness and sexuality measures), but not all (e.g. materialism and delinquency), which indicates that the HEXACO model is a better measure of personality than either the Big Five or the FFM. Honesty- Humility as a predictor for other aspects of personality Honesty-Humility has been shown to be positively associated with many desirable traits and negatively associated with many undesirable traits. Honesty-Humility is generally associated with pro-social behavior, treating people fairly and being unconcerned with self-promotion. =Antisocial behaviors and traits= Recent research has shown that the Honesty-Humility factor is strongly negatively correlated with the \\"Dark Triad\\" of personality (i.e. narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism). These 3 traits in tandem describe a person who is self-centered, manipulative, and un-empathetic, someone willing to use or hurt others for personal gain. Conversely, a person who is high on Honesty- Humility is sincere and honest in their dealings with others, concerned with obtaining a fair outcome for all parties involved, unselfish, and modest. Another study has shown that Honesty-Humility is significantly negatively correlated with displaced aggression and vengefulness. It is also negatively correlated with immediate or premeditated forms of reaction/revenge against a transgressor.Lee, K. & Ashton, M.C. (2012). Getting mad and getting even: Agreeableness and Honesty-Humility as predictors of revenge intentions. Personality and Individual Differences, 52, pp. 596-600. People who are high in Honesty-Humility are unlikely to exhibit displaced aggression or vengefulness or to immediately pick a fight or plan to \\"get even\\" with someone who has wronged them. Although forgiveness and tolerance are aspects of agreeableness, a reluctance to engage in anti-social and vengeful behaviors seems to be a hallmark of Honesty-Humility. =Political attitudes= In a similar vein, Honesty-Humility has been shown to be negatively correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). This effect is moderated by interest in politics, such that people who were high in Honesty-Humility and very interested in politics scored at half the levels on the SDO scale as compared to their low interest counterparts, Both groups, though, with high Honesty- Humility scores were below baseline on SDO. =Risky behavior and sensation seeking= Honesty-Humility has also been shown to be negatively correlated with Sensation Seeking and Risk Taking behaviors, as well as Thrill and Adventure Seeking, Experience Seeking, Boredom Susceptibility, and Disinhibition.de Vries, R.E., de Vries, A., & Feij, J.A. (2009). Sensation seeking, risk-taking, and the HEXACO model of personality. Personality and Individual Differences, 47, pp. 536-540. This indicates that people high in Honesty-Humility are likely to be fairly reserved and level-headed individuals who do not take unnecessary risks, act on impulse or engage in dangerous or reckless behavior out of boredom. =Workplace behavior= Logically, Honesty- Humility is also strongly negatively correlated with workplace delinquency (e.g. stealing from your employer, vandalism, absenteeism, alcohol use at work). It is also strongly positively correlated with the Employee Integrity Index, which is a measure of attitudes about and admissions to theft.Lee, K., Ashton, M.C., de Vries, R.E. (2005). Predicting workplace deliquency with the HEXACO and five-factor models of personality structure. Human Performance, 18(2), pp. 179-197. People high in Honesty-Humility have strict, negative views about theft/thieves, and also report that they have stolen lesser amounts of money than their low Honesty-Humility counterparts. Additionally, Honesty-Humility predicts supervisor ratings of workplace performance, above and beyond ratings of the other five aspects of personality.Johnson, M.K., Rowatt, W. C., & Petrini, L. (2011). A new trait on the market: Honesty- Humility as a unique predictor of job performance ratings. Personality and Individual Differences, 50, pp. 857-862. Notably, it is still a significant predictor of job performance when controlling for the effect of conscientiousness, which is typically the strongest predictor of job performance (although it was nonsignificant in this particular study, both before and after Honesty-Humility was added to the regression model). =Creativity= Honesty-Humility also has a negative relationship with self- reported creativity; though, no relationship between creativity and Agreeableness was found. Previous research found a strong, negative correlation of the Agreeableness factor of the five-factor model of personality with creativity, however the HEXACO model of Agreeableness is a different construct. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between the NEO-PI-R facet of Agreeableness and the HEXACO facet of Honesty- Humility.Silvia, P. J., Kaufman J.C., Reiter-Palmon, R., & Wigert, B. (2011). Cantankerous creativity: Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and the HEXACO structure of creative achievement. Personality and Individual Differences, 51, 687-689. =Sexuality= Honesty-Humility is also related to the \\"Sexy Seven\\"Schmitt, D. P., & Buss, D. M. (2000). Sexual dimensions of person description: Beyond or subsumed by the Big Five? Journal of Research in Personality, 34, 141‚Äì177. measures of Relationship Exclusivity (e.g. faithfulness vs. adulterous) and restricted Sociosexuality (willingness to engage in non-committed sexual acts). These findings indicate that people who score highly on the Honesty-humility measures value fidelity in their relationships and require emotional or psychological bonds to engage in sexual relationships. They are unlikely to cheat or exploit a sexual or romantic partner.Bourdage, J.S., Lee, K., Ashton, M.C., & Perry, A. (2007). Big Five and HEXACO model personality correlates of sexuality.

About 10,000 Asian workers came to Korea under this program in 1992, and there were about 57,000 trainees in Korea in June 1996. However, the trainee program experienced problems: the trainees became undocumented workers due to a difference in wages and since they were not classified as laborers, they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law. The Employment Permit Program for foreigners (the government‚Äôs foreign-labor policy since 2004) is a product achieved by a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers. However, these issues have more details to be resolved. On the legal front, the Korean state still allows foreigners to apply for low-wage jobs and excludes them from social benefits. The social dimension of nationhood is shown by public-opinion polls of Korean citizens' attitudes towards foreign workers, which demonstrate discrimination.

A TLUD pyrolyzes organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly carbon as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create terra preta. Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s. A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a rocket stove in its more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.  The Technology  A TLUD gasifier stove is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers. The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet. The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model. Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up. The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas.

One of his most famous hero's friend roles was in Dil Deke Dekho (1959). The 1960s was a period of transition. Due to his age and displacement from hero's friend roles by comedians, Randhir began to experiment with character roles. He had done such roles in the 1950s and 1940s as well. In the mid-1960s, he frequently played Maharajas in costume films. Randhir began adopting the moneylender 'lala' role around the end of the 1960s. His role in Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (1967) may be one of his earliest in this form, but it was a rough exhibition of what was to come. He firmly put himself into the role with Do Raaste (1969). Afterwards he would be cast almost exclusively as a Lala or a similar merchant. His role in Do Chor (1972),Zanjeer (1973) is an example of this typecasting. Little information is available about his life. The 1982 release Khud-Daar credits Randhir as \\"late\\", implying he died before its release. The release preceding this was in 1980.

Plot Putin's Kiss presents, through interviews and archival footage, Masha Drokova's experiences in Russian youth organisation Nashi, which declares itself to be a democratic, anti-fascist, anti-'oligarchic-capitalist' movement. From the age of 16 through to 19 she is heavily involved in the organisation, working her way up into a position of influence and authority, eventually becoming the host of a youth oriented, state funded television program. She idolises Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the film's title refers in an incident in which, while receiving a medal from him, Drokova spontaneously hugged and kissed him. As the film goes on, Drokova becomes friends with several other journalists, many of whom are critical of the Russian ruling party. Her views are called into question and she becomes increasingly torn between the two. The situation reaches a head when her friend and fellow journalist Oleg Kashin is violently beaten; though his attackers are never identified, it is speculated by many that they were working for the Kremlin in some capacity. By the end of the film, though Drokova remains an ardent supporter of Putin, she is no longer a member of Nashi, and she is shown discussing her views freely with Kashin.

She was at the capture of Saint Lucia in May of the next year, but the French re-captured her a year after that. Capture and captured Lacedemonian on 9 March 1796 to the windward of Barbados. She was described as a privateer brig of 14 guns and 90 men. The British took her into service and commissioned her in May under the command of the newly promoted Commander George Sayer.Winfield (2008), p.336. Service She was part of the expeditionary force under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby and Rear-Admiral Sir Hugh C. Christian at the capture of the island of Saint Lucia in May 1796.

Lacedemonian gave chase for much of the day, when towards late afternoon another sloop appeared and started to chase Lacedomonian, while firing some random shots from long range. Lacedemonium gave up her chase and turned her attention towards her pursuer. Eventually, the newcomer caught up and Wrench stopped, with his crew at quarters. The newcomer did not display a flag but replied to queries in English. Lacedemonians crew relaxed, so when the newcomer sent over a boat with armed men, and ran into Lacedemonian, they were taken by surprise. Wrench tried to organize resistance but the attackers knocked him down and took over the brig. The subsequent court martial ordered a severe reprimand for Wrench for having allowed himself to be caught unprepared.

Born near Vienna, he was educated at Technische Hochschule in Vienna and Graz. He developed an interest in rocketry, building and testing model rockets in 1927. In 1928, he proposed the idea of building a space station in low Earth orbit (LEO) for fueling vehicles to travel to the other planets. He published detailed calculations for this type of mission. For this reason, he (together with Herman Potoƒçnik) is considered the \\"father of the space station\\". Along with Rudolf Zwerina, he founded the Austrian Society for Rocket Technology in 1931. His interest in rocketry waned following the Anschluss in 1938. Guido von Pirquet is one of several scientists working in the pre-spaceflight era (1920-1957) who fully understood the promise of the gravity assist method for reducing flight time and increasing payload to the outer planets. He gave detailed formulas showing how close passage of Jupiter could be used to make a large change in the velocity and orbital energy of a spacecraft. His vector diagrams clearly show the gravity assist mechanism that are identical to those used later by Krafft Ehricke (1956) and much later by Minovitch (1961). Minovitch claims incorrectly that he is the \\"inventor\\" of the gravity assist space flight technique.. Pirquet crater on the Moon is named after him. He was inducted as an honorary fellow of the British Interplanetary Society in 1949, their highest honor. In 1976, he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame. His brother, Clemens von Pirquet, became a scientist and pediatrician.

He appeared in over 250 films. These films spanned the parallel cinema of Guru Dutt to the wrestler films of Dara Singh. He is known for his big stomach. The first known appearance of Moolchand is in 1950. He was often featured in the films of the directors Guru Dutt and Raj Kapoor, working on 6 of the former and 8 of the latter. Other actors he was often seen with were Dev Anand, B. R. Chopra, Dara Singh and I. S. Johar, who featured him in most of their movies. Most of Moolchand's early roles were small ones. He only began to get significant roles in the 1960s. Padosan (1968), where he plays the servant of Om Prakash's character featured a lot of close-ups of Moolchand and showed him to be an able comedic side actor. This comedic side would be further explored in the 1970s with a scene stealing appearance in Yaadon Ki Baarat, with fellow fat man Ram Avtar as a tortured businessman and in Don, as the village medicine man who dances with Amitabh and beckons Zeenat Aman to participate.

The concept is primarily used by couples' therapists to describe intimate relationships. When a relationship is emotionally safe, the partners trust each other and routinely give each other the benefit of the doubt in questionable situations. When emotional safety is lost, the partners are inclined to be distrustful, looking for possible hidden meanings and potential threats in each other's words and behaviors. Origins The emotional safety model of couples therapy was developed by psychologist Don R. Catherall. The model focuses on the two realms of \\"attachment\\" and \\"esteem\\", contending that each partner measures their safety by their perception of the other partner's feelings in these two realms. If each perceives the other partner to be securely attached and each holds the other high regard, they feel emotionally safe. But if one perceives threat in either realm, then he or she will lose emotional safety and may react. If he or she reacts in a negative fashion (usually by either attacking or distancing from the partner), then said reaction can constitute a threat to the other partner's emotional safety. If the other partner responds in a similarly negative fashion, a vicious cycle may begin in which each partner's reaction to a perceived threat creates a reciprocal threat to the other partner. Once caught in these cycles, partners have considerable difficulty re-achieving emotional safety. Evidence Research on couples has identified a sudden, abrupt shift in physiological functioning (the fight-or-flight response) that occurs when a partner suddenly perceives something amiss in the intimate relationship. Proponents of the emotional safety model contend that these shifts are precipitated by a partner's perception of change in the other's affective tone regarding their emotional relationship (i.e. the partners' feelings about themselves, each other, and their relationship). Theoretical foundation The emotional safety model utilizes the affect theory of Silvan Tomkins to explain the ways in which partners influence each other through their affective tone. Attachment is based on attachment relationships as identified by John Bowlby, while esteem is based on Nathaniel Branden's work on self-esteem and Donald Nathanson's work on shame. Implications The emotional safety model differs from other models of couples' therapy in its emphasis on each partner's perception of the other's feelings regarding the emotional relationship. The model emphasizes that each partner has more influence on the other partner's state of emotional safety than on their own, which can lead to an impasse referred to as the \\"couple's conundrum\\"; i.e. the couple remains stuck because each partner needs to feel safe before they can make themselves vulnerable and take the appropriate steps to make the other partner feel safe.

Major League Soccer, 284 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 2002), was an antitrust suit filed by eight Major League Soccer players against MLS, the league's investors, and the United States Soccer Federation. The Court found that Major League Soccer was a single entity and therefore legally incapable of conspiring with itself. Arguments Through the Sherman and Clayton Acts, the plaintiffs claimed that MLS and its investors acting as a single entity unlawfully lessens the value of players' services and that MLS and the USSF conspired to monopolize the Division 1 professional soccer market. Major League Soccer ‚Äì through precedence set in Copperweld v. Independence Tube ‚Äì argued that as a single entity with its investors, it could not conspire with itself because it functioned as a single business enterprise. MLS argued that controlling player salaries was critical to MLS's success.Brief for Defendants Major League Soccer LLC, et al, 2001 WL 36006544 District Court and Trial The players filed their lawsuit in the fall of 1996, and the Court held summary judgment hearings in January 1998. The District Court ruled in summary judgment on April 19, 2000 that MLS was a single entity and therefore cannot conspire with its investors and its investors cannot conspire with each other. A trial was held during the fall of 2000. Testimony included Deputy Commissioner Ivan Gazidis, who testified on behalf of MLS that \\"the biggest challenge we have as a league is keeping our talented players within the league and not having them leave us for other opportunities overseas.\\" Each of the eight players who were plaintiffs conceded that he had played non Division 1 professional soccer at some point in his career. The jury found that MLS competes for player services with soccer leagues other than Division 1, and MLS competes with soccer leagues in other countries, meaning that MLS could not be found guilty of monopolizing a market for Division player services in the U.S. Court of Appeals The Court of Appeals upheld the district court's prior ruling that MLS is a single entity only in that it acts as a \\"single economic actor\\" and may continue to sign players under its current system. However, the decision also distinguished MLS from Copperweld and remained intentionally inconclusive as to whether the league's corporate structure really qualifies as a true single entity. The court concluded that \\"MLS and its operator/investors comprise a hybrid arrangement, somewhere between a single company‚Ä¶and a cooperative arrangement between existing competitors.\\" The Court of Appeals upheld the jury's finding that the plaintiffs did not prove that Major League Soccer illegally monopolized the market for player services, and failed to prove the product market and geographic market, because MLS competed with other soccer leagues in the U.S. for players, and MLS competed with soccer leagues in other countries. On the charge of a reduction in competition under the Clayton Act, the Court of Appeals held that \\"the creation of MLS did not reduce competition in an existing market\\" because no active market for Division 1 soccer previously existed in the United States.

The design is an amalgam of two periods, the first two floors built in 1875-6 designed by noted architects Reed & Barnes, with the top three floors added in matching style along with a new chamber in 1929‚Äì31, designed by A&K; Henderson. The Bank of Australasia merged with the Union Bank of Australia to form the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 1951, and the new bank sold the building in 1974. Since 2013 it has been a rental apartment building known as Treasury on Collins. It was amongst the first buildings listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 9 October 1974, and later on the Register of the National Estate in 1983. Design  The history of this building is dominated by the fact that it was designed in two stages 55 years apart by two different architectural firms. The architects for the first stage, Reed & Barnes, designed a restrained two storey Renaissance Revival building, with a heavily rusticated ground floor, an ashlar upper floor, grouped corner pilasters, and a prominent cornice. The use of the Doric order expressed as square piers, creating a trabeated system superimposed over the arched windows, the whole being rusticated, creating an impression of strength and solidity, demonstrates the growth of the Victorian economy during the 1870s. Though only two floors, they were impressively tall, with the total height reaching 20.7 meters, over 890m2 area of land. The fa√ßade uses Oamaru free stone imported from New Zealand, on a base of local bluestone. Bank of Australasia, original two storey Reed & Barnes design. The main entrance was on Collins Street, leading to a lofty banking chamber in the centre, with windows from a court on the west side, and main offices facing Queen Street. The basement was mainly occupied by the bank‚Äôs vault (strong rooms), while two smaller vaults were on the ground floor to help the daily business of the bank. Offices and rooms for the clerks occupied the top floor. A major alteration took place in the boom years of the late 1920s, just before the great depression. The building area was multiplied by adding three extra storeys on top of the original two, a move not uncommon during that period, since the relatively low Victorian era buildings were often capable of supporting new floors, but the architecture was admired enough to retain it. The architects were A&K; Henderson, chosen perhaps because the elder Anketell Henderson (who had died in 1922) had worked for Reed & Barnes when the original building was constructed. The additions also used Oamaru stone, and were designed to continue rather than radically change the original conception - the third storey was slightly shorter than the one below, the fourth level was conceived of as an attic level, and the fifth level was set back. A subtle change was making the first floor windows, which were arched like the ground floor, into square headed ones, with the new upper level having arched windows instead. The interior was completely rebuilt, with a light well through the centre of the building lighting a new board room on the second floor, and a skylit dome to a huge new banking chamber occupying almost the whole of the ground floor area, in restrained classical mode of fluted pilasters and columns with a surrounding mezzanine. Later renovations saw the light well filled in, and the addition of two intermediate floors between the first and second floor, and between the third and fourth floor, and finally another top floor in and conversion to an apartment-hotel in about 2001. Significance The Heritage Victoria citation notes that the former Bank of Australasia is of architectural significance for its use of superimposed trabeated architectural systems and the groupings of pilasters at the corners, creating the impression of a classical three dimensional presence, while only actually decorating two faces. The use of imported stone from New Zealand demonstrates the resources available and the ties the bank had in the 1870s. The 1929-31 additions are significant as a skilful solution to the problem of adding levels to an already complete classical design. The former Bank of Australasia is of historical significance as the headquarters of a major banking company within Australia for nearly a century, from 1876 to 1974. It is significant for its position on a corner site within the centre of the banking precinct in Melbourne, which was the most important business centre at the time in Australia due to its growth and wealth. The architectural expression of the bank served as a metaphor for the impression the company wanted send out to the community, an image of solidity and confidence. The layout of the banking chamber, the vaults, the board room and the managers office are of historical significance as they reflect the operations and hierarchy of a major banking headquarters. The 1929 boardroom is illustrative of the banking business culture during from that period, and a rare example. Gallery File:The Verticality of the Bank.JPGEntry from Collins Street.

(2011). The R&B; song was written by Lopez, Anesha Birchett, Antea Shelton and Emile \\"D'Mile\\" Dernst II, the song's producer. \\"One Love\\" was initially written and presented to Lopez by A-Plus (Birchett and Shelton) and D'Mile to record, however, upon hearing the demo of the song, she was not pleased with its verses. Liking the chorus and idea of the song, Lopez wrote new verses to the song with the song's original writers. \\"One Love\\" received generally positive acclaim from music critics, who cited it as a stand-out track on Love?. Critics made note of the song's indirect manner, which according to them contains references to Lopez's ex-boyfriends and husbands, such as Sean Combs and Ben Affleck. Following the release of Love?, it was revealed that Lopez's first husband, Ojani Noa, intended to bring her to court over the song, claiming that it contained lyrics about him without his prior knowledge ‚Äì violating agreements made between the two following their divorce. Despite this, it has been noted that Noa is not referenced in the song and the lawsuit never transpired.  Production and lyrical interpretation  \\"One Love\\" is a R&B; song, with a length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds (3:54). It was written by Lopez, along with A-Plus (Anesha Birchett and Antea Shelton) and the song's producer Emile \\"D'Mile\\" Dernst II. A-Plus (Birchett and Shelton) and D'Mile wrote and presented the song to Lopez, who loved the idea of it, but thought the track to be \\"very generic\\". In response, she asked: \\"Why don't we make it more 'me'?\\". Lopez then sat with them and wrote new verses for the song, going through every major relationship she had, asking the question: \\"is there one love?\\". Lopez described the song as being about \\"if we can ever have one true soul mate\\". She recorded her vocals for the song with Kuk Harrell at Record Plant Recording Studios, with additional vocal production from Josh Gudwin, Jim Annunziato and Birchett. John Kercy was responsible for Lopez's vocal editing on \\"One Love\\", which was later mixed by Mike \\"Handz\\" Donaldson at Chalice Recording Studios. Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that \\"One Love\\" examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not \\"trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life. She honestly thought you might be curious about Ben Affleck and whatever happened to that huge engagement ring he gave her all those years ago, during Bennifer‚Äôs dark reign.\\"  Critical response and lawsuit  \\"One Love\\" received generally positive acclaim from music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated that beyond \\"One Love\\", \\"Love? doesn't dig very deep into its titular query\\". Monica Herrera from Billboard wrote in her track-by- track review of Love?: \\"'One Love' ‚Äì \\"What's wrong with a girl wanting everything?\\" Jennifer wonders over this slow roller,\\" and responded with \\"Nothing, when you're a triple-threat superstar.\\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy called the song generic, while Poppy Reid of The Music Network complimented the song for its lyrical content; stating that apart from other songs on Love?, Lopez is acting her age in \\"One Love\\", the album she wrote herself. After the release of Love?, it was reported that Lopez's former husband Ojani Noa had filed a lawsuit against Lopez over \\"One Love\\", claiming that it contained lyrics about him without his prior knowledge. Noa's business partner Ed Meyer released a statement saying that the song violates agreements between Noa and Lopez in their divorce. He further stated that: \\"I have a conference with the attorney for J.Lo's partners in the publishing rights for this song on Monday, as we will be adding the dispute over One Love to the lawsuits [...] Any negative reference to Ojani Noa is prohibited by contract, and J.Lo would be in breach to Ojani Noa. Ojani Noa will be bringing a separate civil action over the song, as soon as the album is released, so as to avoid prior restraint, which we are accusing J.Lo of in our case.\\"  Live performances  Lopez performed \\"One Love\\" live on October 22, 2011 at an anniversary concert for the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, as part of a medley with her debut single \\"If You Had My Love\\".

The courthouse was destroyed by a fire on the evening of May 4, 2016. History The land the courthouse is built on was purchased by the county in 1885 from John Randall, one of the city's founders, for $100. The courthouse was built by George E. Hunter from July 1888 to May 1889 at a cost of about $3800. Two wings housing vaults for the county clerk and treasurer were constructed in 1908. The building gained a water supply in 1891 and was electrified in 1917. The courthouse was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on August 13, 1971, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1972. A Michigan State Historic Site informational marker was erected in 2001. It burned on May 4, 2016. Architecture The courthouse is a two-story, rectangular front-gable building. Currently clad in aluminum, the building originally had white clapboard siding. The building is fronted by a projected bay topped with a hip-roofed steeple. The entrance is fronted by a pedimented portico beneath a fanlight on the second story. One-story wings extend from both sides of the courthouse. The courthouse was designed by architects Pratt and Koeppe in the Classical Revival style.

Crowley (November 27, 1921 ‚Äì February 24, 1998) was an American art historian and cultural anthropologist who focused on the cultural expressions of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, with particular focus on the interconnectedness of carnivals, festivals, the arts and folklore. Crowley also became a strong advocate for disability studies in anthropology.  Early years  Crowley was born in the St. Francis Hospital in Peoria, Illinois. He was one of two children born to Michael Bartholomew Jeremiah Crowley and Elsie Magdalena Cecilia Schnebelin. He remained in Peoria into early adulthood. After receiving a B.A. in Theory and Practice of Art from Northwestern University in 1943, Crowley served time with the U.S. Navy during World War II (1942‚Äì1947) as a Lieutenant JG with the USS American Legion. In April 1946, he contracted poliomyelitis and was left a partial quadriplegic.  Academic career  = General history = After spending 10 months recovering from his bout with polio, Crowley continued to pursue his education. He received an M.A. In Art History from Bradley University in 1948, followed by a Ph. D. In Anthropology (African Studies) from Northwestern University in 1956 under the supervision of Melville Herskovits and in the intellectual tradition of Franz Boas. Much of Crowley's scholarship was perpetuated by his love of travel as many of his university appointments took him all over the world. Crowley was hired as a member of The University of California, Davis faculty as a double Professor of Anthropology and Art in 1961. He continued to teach at the university after his retirement in 1992. Between the years of 1968‚Äì1971, Crowley received the UC Centennial Citation and became the founding director of the UC Education Abroad Program in partnership with the University of Ghana-Legon. Throughout his career, Crowley was a member of the National Commission for UNESCO (1974‚Äì1980), served on many journal editorial boards, published 4 books, a commercial recording, and approximately 350 articles and reviews. Many university and national archives benefited from the donation of art and cultural memorabilia which he accumulated from places such as Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Aboriginal Australia. According to his curriculum vitae, he conducted field research in: the Bahama Islands; Trinidad, Tobago, St. Lucia; Western European Ethnographic Museums; Zaire, Angola, Zambia, Tanzania; Southern Africa; Mexico; Ghana, Togo, Dahomey; Senegambia; Brazil; India; Guinea-Bissau; the Canary Islands; Cape Verde; Australia; New Guinea, Melanesia, Polynesia. His research interests included: African and African- derived societies; graphic and plastic arts, folklore, music; the role of artists in culture; multi-cultural societies; ethnoaesthetics, comparative aesthetic values; festivals and carnivals. Through his experiences, Crowley identified himself as a Boasian particularist Folklorist. Crowley felt his contributions to the sub-discipline of folklore were one of his more successful academic achievements. = Sub-Saharan Africa = Crowley's fieldwork in Sub-Saharan Africa was about rehabilitating \\"the image of Africa denigrated to justify slavery\\". = The Caribbean = The majority of Crowley's fieldwork in the Caribbean was mainly undertaken in Nassau, The Bahamas. \\"I Could Talk Old-Story Good: Creativity in Bahamian Folklore\\" was reprinted in 1987 and utilized by the performance-oriented school of Folkloristics. Field work was also conducted in Trinidad, and it is here that Crowley met his wife, Pearl. Crowley's 1956 paper, \\"Plural and Differential Acculturation in Trinidad\\" is an essential work to review on the Caribbean and one of his more influential works.\\" = Disability studies = The American Anthropological Association, in conjunction with the Crowley family, stated that Daniel was, \\"a pioneer and advocate for the disabled and role model for all who sought to overcome any kind of handicap.\\" Although he published little on disability, he was a tireless advocate for travelling to engage with his field work and sharing that information upon return that identified Crowley as a primary inspiration for disability studies. Richard Curley of The University of California emphasized this in a statement on Crowley: \\"Dan became a splendid, and early, role model for the disabled. He spoke candidly of his disability and was a great friend and supporter of many disabled people. His wheelchair never deterred him from visiting the most remote mountain village or attending conferences in out-of-the-way spots. Crowley traveled to the most remote locations, having been in every country of the world, with the exception of Iraq (but not from lack of trying). As John Michael Vlach and Phillip M. Peek have said in the Journal of American Folklore (1999), \\"He cleverly and bravely negotiated innumerable physical barriers the likes of which would have caused the able bodied to turn back.\\" In 1978, the Guinness Book of World Records listed Crowley as \\"The Most Travelled Disabled Person,\\" ‚Äì a category that was eventually discontinued.  Personal life  Crowley's maintenance of humour and the positive view he spun on the human condition has been unanimously praised among numerous organizations and publishers. He met Pearl Ramcharan on his first trip to Trinidad and married her soon after. They had three children together ‚Äì Peter, Eve (Eyzaguirre), and Magdalene.  Death  Crowley and a research expedition team from the University of California travelled to Oruro, Bolivia to study the major carnival there. Mardi Gras was celebrated in conjunction with Martes de Ch'alla, which commemorates the earth goddess, Pachamama. All of the research had been conducted and the team was about to make the journey home when he died. Crowley died of congestive heart failure in his sleep on February 24, 1998. The date of his death fell on Fat (Shrove) Tuesday, the last day of the celebrations.

The Army Mutiny was an Irish Army crisis in March 1924 provoked by a proposed reduction in army numbers in the immediate post-Civil War period.Garret FitzGerald Reflections On The Foundation of the Irish State , University College Cork, April 2003Irish Times March 10th, 1924 10 Mar 2012 A second grievance concerned the handling of the Northern Boundary problem.The Times, The Irish Mutiny. New Commander Of Free State Forces. 11 March 1924 As the prelude to a coup d'√©tat, the decisions made by influential politicians and soldiers at the time have continuing significance for the Government of Ireland. National Army In the early weeks of the Civil War, the National Army comprised 7,000 men. These came mainly from pro-Treaty IRA brigades, especially the Dublin Guard, whose members had personal ties to Michael Collins. They faced around 15,000 anti-Treaty IRA men and Collins recruited experienced soldiers from wherever he could. The army's size mushroomed to 55,000 men, many of whom were Irishmen with combat experience in World War One ‚Äì 20,000 National Volunteers had joined the British Army on the urgings of Nationalist leader John Redmond. Likewise, Irishmen who had served in the British forces accounted for over half of the 3,500 officers. W.R.E. Murphy, second-in-command (January‚ÄìMay 1923), had been a lieutenant colonel in the British Army, as had Emmet Dalton. Two more of the senior generals, John T. Prout and J.J. \\"Ginger\\" O'Connell, had served in the United States Army. Collins promoted fellow-members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood but was slow to put Squad members in high positions. Irish Republican Army Organisation In December 1922, following Collins's death, Liam Tobin formed the Irish Republican Army Organisation (IRAO), taking in Dublin Guard and other Irish Army officers who shared his view that \\"higher command...was not sufficiently patriotic\\". President W. T. Cosgrave, head of the government attempted to appease the IRAO. He met with them several times before the September 1923 Election and persuaded the opposing IRB faction of generals under Richard Mulcahy to keep quiet.The Times, Irish Mutiny. Officers Abscond With Arms, 10 March 1924 With the election over, Mulcahy now ignored the IRAO as he started the process of demobilising 37,000 men. In November, sixty IRA officers mutinied and were dismissed without pay. The IRAO now pressurised the Government to establish a Committee to supervise future demobilisation. The Committee, consisting of Eoin MacNeill, Ernest Blythe, and IRAO sympathiser Joseph McGrath, effectively undermined the authority of the Army Council. Ultimatum On 7 March 1924 a representative of the IRAO handed a demand to end demobilisation to W. T. Cosgrave. The ultimatum was signed by senior Army officers, Major-General Liam Tobin and Colonel Charles Dalton.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 6‚Äì11 March 1924 Tobin knew his own position was to be scrapped in the demobilisation. Frank Thorton and Tom Cullen were also involved. That morning 35 men of the 36th Infantry Battalion had refused to parade and the preceding week officers had absconded with arms from Templemore, Gormanstown, Baldonnel Aerodrome and Roscommon. The immediate response was an order for the arrest of the two men on a charge of mutiny; this caused alarm throughout Dublin when announced.The Times, \\"Index\\" 10 March 1924 On 8 March General Mulcahy made an announcement to the Army: > Two Army officers have attempted to involve the Army in a challenge to the > authority of the Government. This is an outrageous departure from the spirit > of the Army. It will not be tolerated...officers and men...will stand over > their posts and do their duty today in this new threat of danger in the same > wonderful determined spirit that has always been the spirit of the Army. Leader of the Opposition, Thomas Johnson issued a statement of support for the Government. In contrast Minister for Industry and Commerce, Joseph McGrath, whose home Mulcahy ordered to be searched, resigned because of dissatisfaction with the government's attitude to the IRAO officers and support for their perception that the Irish Army treated former British officers better than former IRA officers.http://www.oireachtas- debates.gov.ie:80/D/0006/D.0006.192404030029.html Fearing an incendiary speech by McGrath, Cosgrave first offered the IRAO an inquiry and an amnesty before then taking sick leave thus making Minister for Justice, Kevin O‚ÄôHiggins, de facto head of the Government. Kevin O'Higgins Observers at the time have provided insights into the motivations of Cosgrave and O'Higgins. Cosgrave was an \\"unpretentious and modest man\\",David Harkness, ‚ÄòCosgrave, William Thomas (1880‚Äì1965)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 O'Higgins \\"redoubtable\\".The Times, Irish Election Results. 30 August 1923 Generals Costello and MacEoin recounted that Cosgrave feigned illness, hoping O‚ÄôHiggins would talk himself into resigning. Mrs Mulcahy and Mrs Cosgrave agreed O'Higgins wanted Cosgrave to resign. On 18 March, 40 armed men assembled at Devlin's Hotel in Parnell Street, Dublin. Two lorry loads of troops were sent to surround the premises and a standoff developed with the mutineers. McGrath and Daniel McCarthy were allowed access as intermediaries. O'Higgins moved to resolve the problem. Strong reinforcements were dispatched. Tobin & Dalton were able to escape using an old path of retreat across the roofs, known from the days when Devlin's had been a safehouse for Michael Collins The Times, New Irish Army Crisis, 20 March 1924 The cabinet, already wary of the Free State Army, ordered an inquiry and appointed Garda Commissioner Eoin O'Duffy to the army command. The cabinet demanded the resignation of the army council and the generals resigned.Richard Mulcahy, Oxford DNB The crisis within the army was solved but the government was divided, Richard Mulcahy, the Minister for Defence, resigned and O'Higgins was victorious in a very public power struggle within Cumann na nGaedheal. However the events re-affirmed the subservience of the military to the civilian government of the new state. McGrath and eight other TDs resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal then resigned their seats to contest by-elections, running as the National Party. However, Cumann na nGaedheal won seven of these and Sinn F√©in won the other two. Charlie Dalton Charlie Dalton had started as an assassin with The Squad along with his brother, Emmet. He followed Michael Collins joining the pro-Treaty side and now held the position of colonel in the Army. Dalton was born in 1903 and grew up around Columba's Road, Drumcondra, Dublin.

It originally aired on January 27, 1983, on NBC. It is co-written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs and directed by James Burrows. This episode's narrative deals with homosexuality, coming out, and homophobia. It was inspired by the coming out story of former Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player, Glenn Burke. In this episode, Sam's former teammate, Tomportrayed by Alan Autryreveals his homosexuality and Sam slowly becomes supportive of him. The bar's regular customers express their disdain toward Sam's support and fear that because of Sam's support of Tom, the bar will become a place full of homosexuals. The episode's Nielsen ratings at its initial airing were low but improved after subsequent airings on NBC. This episode has received more attention since.  Plot  Tom Kenderson (Alan Autry), an old friend and baseball teammate of bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson), announces in his forthcoming autobiography that he is homosexual. At a press conference held at the bar, Sam, having not read the book in advance, is shocked by Tom's revelation. Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) helps Sam to calm down, and they discuss Tom. Moments later, Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality, which local newspapers report on their front pages. The next day, as they read the newspaper, the bar's regular patrons‚Äîincluding Norm (George Wendt)‚Äîexpress their disdain toward homosexuals. They worry that Sam's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar. Diane criticizes their homophobia telling them that gays are normal people and reveals there are two gay men in the bar as they speak. Alan Autry portrays Tom Kenderson, a Boston Red Sox player coming out as gay in this episode. The regulars conclude that three male newcomers are homosexual and try to persuade Sam to escort them from the bar. Sam becomes concerned about dividing his loyalties between his regular customers and potential gay customers. Employees and regulars‚Äîpulled in by Diane‚Äîargue over the three newcomers in the billiard room. When the newcomers congratulate Sam for supporting Tom, Sam decides not to eject them to avoid discriminating among his customers. Norm and the other regulars trick the three men into assuming that 7:00 pm is the last call for drinks at and escort them from the bar. Diane tells the regulars that the men they escorted out are not homosexual and that the two gay men are still present. The two men in question kiss Norm on his cheeks.  Production  \\"The Boys in the Bar\\" was co-written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs and was directed by James Burrows. The coming out story of former Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player Glenn Burke was the inspiration for the plot. Levine wanted to explore homophobia in a sports bar in this episode. However, NBC deemed the story \\"too risky\\" for Cheers, whose Nielsen ratings were low during its first season in 1982‚Äì83. Nevertheless, the production of this episode went ahead for five days; rehearsals were problem- free and some minor tweaks that did not have major effects on the script were made. The cast rehearsed for the first three days of production, the camera crew rehearsed on the fourth day and a studio audience were present on the fifth. The cast‚Äîincluding Ted Danson, who advised Levine not to change a word‚Äîloved this episode, and the crew found it‚Äîespecially the cheek-kissing scene at the end‚Äîhilarious. However, according to Levine, the live studio audience remained silent during filming; the ending was reshot with Norm given an extra line, \\"better than Vera\\", referring to the character's wife's kissing. Background actors portraying bar customers are John Furey, Michael Kearns, Kenneth Tigar, Lee Ryan, Jack Knight, and Tom Babson. Shannon Sullivan and John Bluto portray reporters at the press conference. Harry Anderson reprises his role of Harry \\"the Hat\\" Gittes in the cold open.

According to the book What's Good on TV, Sam's concerns about losing regular, anti-homosexual bar customers if Cheers were to become a gay bar is depicted as sympathetic towards regulars and \\"a practical argument\\" instead of a \\"strong moral argument\\". Stephen Tropiano called this episode \\"the definite highlight of Season One\\" in PopMatters and, in the 2002 book The Prime Time Closet, Tropiano called it a moral lesson about judging a person based on appearances. Nevertheless, Tropiano said that the fictional baseball player Tom Kenderson is typical of gay characters related to a series regular, appear just once, are exploited for delivering a message about homosexuality to the audience, and are then discarded, never to be \\"seen, heard, or mentioned again\\". The A.V. Club critics discussed this episode in 2012. Phil Nugent found it unfunny and intended as a message to tolerate homosexuals by making Norm and other regulars appear \\"ridiculous\\". Noel Murray said that the episode's \\"bifurcated structure\\" prevented more development for Sam's old baseball teammate, and he found the \\"stereotypes\\" of gay men dated. He and Donna Bowman considered it to be more about men securing their own machismo than tolerating homosexuality. Ryan McGee found the studio audience's reactions to this episode ambiguous, especially years after this episode aired. Decider critic Brett White wrote in 2017 that this episode is \\"structured to deconstruct the notion of stereotypes\\" and shows that despite some regular bar patrons' lack of \\"open-minded[ness], Cheers is a bar for everyone\\". White also noted that Norm's gaydar is tainted with \\"uninformed stereotypes\\". However, White also wrote: > As progressive as this episode is for 1983, it still falls short in the same > ways that most sitcoms of the 20th century did when handling LGBT issues. > There are no regular LGBT characters in the cast, so Cliff, Norm and Carla > aren't challenged to grow after this episode. Sam's friend Tom disappears > after the press conference, never to be seen again. Even the supposedly gay > guys turn out to probably not be gay. In the absence of any actual dynamic > gay characters, it's Diane that takes on the ally role and acts as the voice > of gay rights. Screen Rant critic Simone Torn wrote in 2019 that the characters' homophobic remarks would \\"[make] this episode uncomfortable to modern audiences\\" and is one of \\"ten things from Cheers that have not aged well.\\" Joseph J. and Kate Darowski in their 2019 book Cheers: A Cultural History rated the episode three out of four stars (\\"good episode\\"). = Accolades = This episode was nominated for \\"Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series\\" at the 1983 Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost to \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\"‚Äîthe pilot episode of Cheers.

The company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. It was located in New York City until 2016, when its offices were moved to Los Angeles due to closer proximity to Knowles- Carter's' primary residence. Its involvements include products for music production, motion pictures and television specials related to Beyonc√©. The company's first release was the film Cadillac Records (2008).  History  Parkwood Entertainment was founded in 2008 as a production unit for videos and films by American singer, actress, producer, and director Beyonc√©. Parkwood is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyonc√© once lived. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyonc√© starred and co-produced. In 2009, she starred in and executive produced the thriller Obsessed. During a private screening held at New York's School of Visual Arts Theatre following the release of her fifth self-titled studio album, Beyonc√© briefly discussed her decision to found Parkwood Entertainment in front of her fans and the press, saying: > \\"I started my own company when I decided to manage myself. It was important > that I didn't go to some big management company, I felt like I wanted to > follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire, > and show other women when you get to this point in your career you don't > have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success‚Äîyou > do it yourself.\\" In December 2013, Parkwood Entertainment released Beyonc√©'s fifth self-titled visual album. The surprising release caused \\"hilarious, honest and hysterical\\" reaction among Beyonc√©'s fans, and \\"shock\\" among other musicians. According to data provided by Twitter, the release generated over 1.2 million tweets in 12 hours. Peter Robinson of The Guardian hailed the shock release as \\"Beyonc√©geddon\\", describing it as a \\"major triumph ... a masterclass in both exerting and relinquishing control.\\" Beyonc√© was released digitally to the iTunes Store without prior announcement or promotion. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, earning Beyonc√© her fifth consecutive number-one album in the country. The record sold 617,000 copies in the US, and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of availability, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store at the time. It was reissued in November 2014 as part of a platinum edition, along with an extended play of new songs. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, and Beyonc√©'s vocals. As of November 2016, Beyonc√© has sold 8 million copies worldwide and has spawned the singles \\"XO\\", \\"Drunk in Love\\", \\"Partition\\" and \\"Pretty Hurts. In October 2014, Beyonc√© with Parkwood Entertainment formed a large collaboration with Topshop, creating the subsidiary Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd, to produce an athletic, streetwear brand. The company and collaboration is a 50/50 split, with both parent companies owning half of this new division. Beyonc√© commented on the collaboration stating \\"I could not think of a better partner as I continue to grow the Parkwood business\\". In November 2018, Parkwood Entertainment confirmed that the company had acquired total ownership of the Ivy Park brand from co-founder Sir Philip Green following allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse. In 2015, Parkwood expanded into managing the careers of upcoming artists and signed Chloe x Halle, Sophie Beem and Ingrid. In 2016, Steve Pamon, from JP Morgan Chase took office as the COO and President of the company. Within that same year, Parkwood entertainment released Beyonc√©'s critically acclaimed sixth studio album Lemonade. The album was accompanied by the release of a 60-minute film of the same name, which premiered on HBO on April 23, 2016. Parkwood Entertainment has been listed twice by Fast Company as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Music (2015 and 2017).

Page accessed 20 November 2010. The species are A. toetoe, A. fulvida, A. splendens, A. richardii and A. turbaria. They were recently reclassified in 2011 from the genus Cortaderia,Barker, Nigel P. & Linder, Hans Peter 2010. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 97(3): 343‚Äì344 in English with short Latin diagnosis although their distinctiveness had been recognized as early as 1853.Steudel, Ernst Gottlieb von 1853. Synopsis Plantarum Glumacearum 1: 34‚Äì35 The name toetoe comes from the MƒÅori language. Two closely related South American species are Cortaderia jubata and C. selloana (Pampas Grass), which have been introduced to New Zealand and are often mistaken for toetoe. These introduced species tend to take over from the native toetoe and are regarded as invasive weeds. Among the differences between Pampas, Toetoe has a drooping flower head, a cream coloured plume, and the leaves do not break when tugged firmly. Toetoe also has a white, waxy bloom on the leaf-sheath and conspicuous veins between the midrib and leaf margin. Common uses The MƒÅori used the toetoe leaves to make baskets, kites, mats, wall linings and roof thatching. It was also used to make containers to cook food in hot springs. The flower stalks were also useful - as frames for kites, and in tukutuku panelling. The seed heads themselves were used on fresh wounds to stop bleeding. Other medicinal uses included treatment of diarrhoea, kidney complaints, and burns. Toetoe is New Zealand's largest native grass, growing in clumps up to 3m in height. Other names MƒÅori names for toetoe to its varieties include: toetoe-kƒÅkaho, toetoe-mokoro, toetoe-rƒÅkau. The flower stem is kƒÅkaho. Toetoe is also known as 'cutty grass', especially among children, because the serrated leaf edges can cut the skin. Cutty grass is also used in New Zealand to refer to Gahnia setifola (mapere), Cyperus ustulatus (upoko tangata) and Carex geminata.

It was rumored that Wang presented evidence of a corruption scandal, whereby Bo sought to impede a corruption investigation against Gu.John Garnaut, 'Bo intrigue deepens over death of Briton', The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 March 2012. Specifically, Wang stated that Gu had been involved in a business dispute with British businessman Neil Heywood, who died in Chongqing under disputed circumstances; Wang alleged he had been poisoned. The Wall Street Journal reported that Wang may have fallen out of favor with Bo for discussing the Heywood case.Jeremy Page, Brian Spegele, and Steve Eder, 'Jackie Kennedy of China' at Center of Political Drama, The Wall Street Journal, 6 April 2012. Following the Wang Lijun incident and Bo's removal from key Communist Party posts, Gu was placed under investigation for Heywood's death.Chris Buckley and Benjamin Kang Lim, \\"China says Bo Xilai's wife suspected of murder China suspends Bo from elite ranks, wife suspected of murder\\", Reuters, 10 April 2012.

In an unusual move, state media appended her husband's surname in front of her own (rendering her name as Bo Gu Kailai), extremely unusual for married women in People's Republic of China, without any explanation. Some speculate that it may imply that Gu may have acquired citizenship of a foreign country, and as a result \\"Bo Gu Kailai\\" appeared on her official documents; Others suggest that this is because authorities wanted to emphasize that Gu's alleged crimes were linked to misconduct by her husband. =Trial and verdict= On 26 July 2012, Gu was formally charged with murdering Heywood, based on what the prosecutor claimed was \\"irrefutable and substantial\\" evidence.Bogu Kailai, Zhang Xiaojun charged with intentional homicide, Xinhua News Agency, 26 July 2012. On 9 August 2012, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, Gu admitted during a one-day trial that she was responsible for Heywood's murder. She claimed that her actions were due to a \\"mental breakdown\\", and stated that she would \\"accept and calmly face any sentence\\". On 20 August 2012, Gu received a suspended death sentence, which is normally commuted to a life sentence after two years, but she could be released on medical parole after serving nine years in prison. The trial lasted one day, and Gu did not contest her charges. Zhang Xiaojun, a Bo family aide, was sentenced to nine years in jail for his involvement in the murder following his confession. After the media published footage of the trial, claims that the woman shown in court was not in fact Gu, but a body double, quickly became popular on Chinese Internet fora, and Chinese authorities attempted to censor them. Experts did not agree: the Financial Times cited \\"security experts familiar with facial recognition software\\" that the person who stood trial was not Gu,Kathrin Hille, Gu Kailai verdict set for Monday, Financial Times, 19 August 2012. whereas a facial recognition expert contacted by Slate was of the opinion that the woman most likely was Gu. The practice of rich people paying others to stand trial and receive punishment in their place, called ding zui, is relatively widespread in China. Following the verdict, the United Kingdom announced that it welcomed the investigation, and said that they \\"consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied.\\" BBC News commented that \\"informed observers see the fingerprints of the Communist Party of China all over this outcome\\", stating that the trial's conclusion was \\"all too neat and uncannily suited to one particular agenda\\", that of limiting the scandal's damage. The New York Times suggested the verdict \\"raised questions about official corruption and political favoritism within the Communist Party.\\" Officially, Neil Heywood was murdered because he demanded $22 million from Gu after a real estate venture failed, and after Heywood sent an email which threatened her son, Gu decided to neutralise the threat. At a hotel in Chongqing, Gu gave Heywood whiskey and tea. Heywood became drunk and vomited. When he tried to go to bed, Gu poured animal poison into his mouth and she placed pills next to him to make it appear as though he had overdosed on drugs. However, according to Reuters, at the end of 2011, Gu asked Heywood to move a large amount of money out of China. Heywood agreed to do that if Gu paid him a certain amount of money. But Heywood asked for a larger cut of the money than Gu expected. When Gu told Heywood he was being greedy, Heywood threatened to expose what Gu was doing. Gu was outraged and decided to kill Heywood. An academic close to the Bo family said Wang Lijun had written two letters to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection which accused Gu of moving several hundred million dollars out of the country. The CDIC did not act immediately but the letters increased pressure for a deep probe. On 14 December 2015, Gu Kailai's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. The prison authorities said Gu had expressed repentance and had made no intentional offences during their review.  Popular culture  In the 2019 film The Laundromat, Gu was portrayed by actress Rosalind Chao.

Frederick Wolseley's innovations to sheep shearing machinery revolutionised the entire wool industry. The wool industry was much reduced by the advent of synthetic textiles. Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company was obliged to diversify into heating equipment then building materials. Its name and business has continued, supplemented since 1982 by Ferguson Enterprises, a large American supplier of building materials. A Jersey holding company was set up in 2017 named Ferguson plc and under that name and ownership the original Wolseley business remains listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The British and Canadian operations are still called Wolseley. Ferguson plc's global headquarters is in Zug, Switzerland. History =Origins= 1888 (Shearing the rams) the hard work revolutionized by Wolseley 1895 The English business was founded by Frederick York Wolseley in London in 1889 and a company was incorporated there with a capital of ¬£200,000 to better realize the potential of his sheep shearing invention patented in March 1877. Herbert Austin, who had worked on the product's development in Melbourne Australia from 1887, was appointed its manager and received a share of its equity. Wolseley, owner of a large sheep station, had set up a business of the same name in Sydney, Australia, in 1887. He manufactured the sheep shearing machinery largely by assembling bought-in components. Impressed by Austin, who managed one of the suppliers, Wolseley employed him at this business. His first sheep shearing machinery was driven by horse power replaced later by stationary engines. Following wide demonstrations in eastern Australia and New Zealand in 1887-1888, a woolshed in Louth, N.S.W., was set up with the machinery and was the first to complete a shearing with the machines. Eighteen more woolsheds were equipped with Wolseley's invention in 1888. The Australian incorporation was wound up and the business's ownership transferred to the new London company in 1889 but operations were retained in Australia. During the early 1890s Austin studied Wolseley's shearing machinery in use on a large sheep station and patented several improvements. By 1893, however, they were facing a crisis when it was discovered they had sold a large amount of defective machinery, brought about by the failure of local suppliers to meet the required specifications. Austin was sent to England to open a manufacturing operation there. In November 1893 Wolseley and Austin arrived in England, where Austin managed the business from a small workshop in Broad Street, Birmingham. Wolseley, with his Australian pastoral interests, resigned in 1894 because of poor health. =Wolseley Shearing Machine= Traditional sheep shears Wool was clipped from the sheep's back by hand shears from time immemorial. Wolseley invented and developed the first satisfactory mechanical method using a power source away from the shearer's hand. The first power source was a horse gin connected by belt and pulley and a carefully designed driveshaft to a handpiece held by the shearer. As well as relieving the shearer's hand of the cutting effort, the machine clips the wool at its full length, which often doubles or triples its value. It also removes the wool in a fleece instead of chopping it into small pieces like the shears. Sir,‚ÄîIt may interest some of your readers to know how sheep are shorn by machines. Before writing about them, it will be as well to say something of hand shearing. Shearing on a sheep station is the one busy time of the year; and if there are from 30,000 to 50,000 sheep to get through, there will be 16 or 20 shearers. Amongst these there are sure to be some men who are what is termed rough‚Äîthat is they do not take off the wool clean, make lots of second cuts, and cut the sheep badly. Even good shearers make second cuts in the wool when going over the back, in the flank and about the neck; and when wool is cut up in small pieces it must deteriorate the price. No one who has not seen it would believe the way some sheep are cut and gashed with the shears. Every shearer cuts more or less‚Äîmost of them more; and your readers could judge of how sheep are shorn by the number some men get over in the day. Merino ewes are fine in the wool and very tender in the skin; yet most ordinary shearers do from 150 to even 200 a day. It is impossible to do such a number well. For the last five or six years managers have been more exacting; but the rule of the station always is, \\"Get the shearing through,\\" so that the sheep may get quickly back to the hills. Shearing is the best paid and worst done work in the colony. Just now it is 15s per 100 sheep. The shearing machines are worked on the principle of a horse clipper; there is a comb with slightly elevated teeth, made of steel, the knife works on the top of the comb; a three horsepower engine will work 16 machines in the following manner:‚ÄîThere is a shaft running the whole length of the shearing floor, about 7 feet from the ground. At each shearer's stand there is a wheel(which turns the machinery) that is connected with the knife. This part is above the shearer's head, and a leather pipe, about an inch in diameter, incloses a piece of sheep gut, which gives the knife 1600 revolutions a minute. There is a universal joint in the handle of the machine, and any one can soon learn to use it. There is a handle at the wheel of each of the driving machines, by which the shearing machine is put in or out of gear. A shearer catches a sheep and brings it to his stand; he then pulls the handle and his machine is ready. With two or three cuts he has the brisket clean, he then runs the machine across the belly, cleans the hind legs and round the tail; then up the neck and round the head, finishes the neck, down shoulder and side, and over backbone, then down the other side, and stops the machine, and lets the sheep go. The machine runs through the wool quite easily. It is just guided to any part, and goes round the ears the same as down the side; you can shear either very close, or can leave wool on by altering the comb. They are made in several thicknesses; in cold parts it is a great advantage to leave a little wool on the sheep. A careful man with the machine will never cut a sheep. The only way they are cut is from a broken comb, or when shearing, letting the skin get in a wrinkle, which sometimes gets through the teeth of the comb, but the cut is only the top skin. Then the wool is splendidly taken off; there is not a break in the fleece all over. Even thin-woolled old ewes‚Äîwhich the best hand-shearer could not shear without breaking the fleece across the back‚Äîare done just the same as heavy woolled sheep. When the fleeces are thrown out to the table to be skirted, they do not take nearly so much room as hand-shorn ones. A hand-shearer has always to be pulling the fleece out of his way, but with the machines it just falls over as it is cut. I think that for anyone connected with sheep, the machines are the most wonderful thing ever invented. This is the first year they have been in New Zealand, but I believe in short time they will be universal. I saw them at work at Messrs James Smith and Sons of Greenfield, and they most kindly showed me everything about them. They have 14 machines, and when I was there had been using them about 10 days, and the shearers were doing on an average over 100 per man. One man did 160, and when you consider the superior way the sheep are shorn, and, you get every ounce of wool taken off as it grows on the sheep, I should think that the expense of getting the machines fitted up would repay itself in two years by the extra price of the wool and the far less knocking about the sheep get. The only part of the machines that seems to get out of order is the gut connection. If the pipe gets bent or twisted by careless men, the friction is so great that the gut is burnt through; but this never happens if it is kept straight, and I have heard that they are to have a connection made of steel ribbon twisted and jointed, but even at present they are near perfection.

National Museum of Australia There is a Wolseley brand two-stand portable shearing plant in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. Manufactured in Birmingham, England, around 1930, the shearing plant is powered by a three horse-power single-cylinder petrol engine, mounted on a wooden trolley base with four cast iron wheels. The plant incorporated a revolutionary mechanised shearing handpiece, one of which is also in the museum‚Äôs collection. The engine is painted green and inscribed with the brand name Wolseley, and has a metal manufacturer's plate which reads: Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Ltd Birmingham England. The plant, weighing 550 kg, was used on a sheep property named 'Emoh Ruo' in the Rockley-Black Springs area of New South Wales. It was used by Roy and George Keogh between 1948 and 1976.

It is in the north perimeter region of the Sonoran Desert. The Arizona transition zone mountain ranges lie north and northeast, just north of Wickenburg, Arizona. The Yarnell Hill, about north of Wickenburg, rising into the Weaver Mountains to Yarnell, marks the dramatic elevation rise from the desert. It is also a viewpoint southwest and southeast of the desert regions, including the Vulture Mountains. Description and geography The Vulture Mountains are about long, and east of center, about wide; the range is somewhat crescent shaped, mainly trending east‚Äìwest, and narrowing westwards. The northeast is followed by the course of a southeast stretch of the Hassayampa River; the river turns due-south west of Morristown, on US 60, making the east terminus of the range about 7 mi wide, at the rivers floodplain. The Hassayampa enters the north of the Hassayampa Plain, so a small river canyon region lies at the Vulture Mountain's northeast, with the Wickenburg Mountains northeast, and the Hieroglyphic Mountains east. The high point of the range is Vulture Peak, (),Arizona Road & Recreation Atlas, p. 40. at the center east of the range. Another major peak anchors the west region of the range, Black Butte, at ).Utah DeLorme Atlas, p. 48. Access The major access to the north and east foothills of the Vulture Mountains is by way of U.S. Route 60. The route traverses from Aguila at the northwest, Wickenburg at the northeast, and a southeast stretch at the mountains northeast, with the route paralleling the Hassayampa River. A paved route dissects the range on a south-southwest direction from Wickenburg, which lies on the mountain range's foothills, with the route being east of the mountain range center. Numerous unimproved routes exit from the route into the mountain areas, or they access the southern side of the mountain range-(the north of the Hassayampa Plain). Unimproved routes are restricted on the east side foothills, since it is the floodplain, watershed region of the Hassayampa River, where the riverbed has widened to up to 1.5 miUtah DeLorme Atlas, p. 48. in some locales. One major unimproved route crosses the Hassayampa west from Morristown. Historic structures of the Vulture Mine and City In 1863, after Henry Wickenburg discovered the Vulture Mine, Vulture City a small mining town was established in the area. The town once had a population of 5,000 citizens After the mine closed the city was deserted and became a ghost town.

He plays in the fullback (and occasionally wing or centre) position and most recently played for Kintetsu Liners of Japan, and previously played for the Wellington-based Super Rugby franchise, the Hurricanes. He has played for New Zealand's MƒÅori international side, the MƒÅori All Blacks. Also a former New Zealand under-20 rep, Taylor endeared himself to Hurricanes' fans with a superb Super Rugby season in 2012. Starting at fullback, he became a regular try-scoring threat, drawing comparisons with the great Christian Cullen. At provincial level he began his career with Manawatu, his home province before making the switch to Taranaki in early 2010.  Early life  Born in Palmerston North, Taylor originally came out of the town of Ashhurst, just out of Palmerston North and attended the local school. He possibly made his way into Palmerston North as he grew older. Domestic career Taylor came to the attention of rugby selectors at the age of 18, after he was selected in the Manawatu team to take part in the inaugural 2006 Air New Zealand Cup season while still at school. Taylor made his provincial debut for the side later that year against Taranaki. The following year he was signed by the Super Rugby side the Hurricanes to feature in their wider training squad. Taylor first joined the Hurricanes in 2010 on the back of an exciting Air New Zealand Cup season in which he proved a constant threat for opposition defences. Taylor capped off an excellent season by scoring 27 points in the Turbos‚Äô final game of the 2009 season against North Harbour. He earned five caps for the Hurricanes in his first season, making his starting debut on the wing against the Sharks. Taylor returned for another full season with the Hurricanes in 2011, and then helped his second province Taranaki to third place in the ITM Cup and reaching the Ranfurly Shield. At home at either wing or fullback, he chimed in with another big points scoring haul of 19 in the win over Tasman. The Hurricanes had scored 58 tries in 2012 and Taylor was part of many of these. He scored ten tries in 2012 and assisted in several more sharing the top try scorer of the season with Bjorn Basson of the Bulls. Taylor's form in 2012 for Taranaki in the No 15 jersey was limited due to injury, he played five matches and recorded seven points. He made another 10 appearances at fullback with the Hurricanes in 2013. International career In 2008 Taylor was selected in the New Zealand under-20 which won the world championship. Previously Taylor had played for the New Zealand Secondary Schools and New Zealand under-17 sides. Taylor had also been part of the triumphant New Zealand MƒÅori side that won the 2010 MƒÅori centenary series against the New Zealand Barbarians, Ireland and England. Taylor rejoined the New Zealand MƒÅori in their 2012 end of year tour, crossing the line once in three matches.

In 1979, he was awarded the lifetime achievement award by the Japanese Medical Association for his contributions to oriental medicine.Muroga[2003:81]Mayanagi[2003:50:62]Mayanagi[2003:33:93]Kanpoigaku[2002:49,1541] Life Yakazu was born in 1905 as Shir≈ç, the fourth son of Tatsunosuke Yakazu and Sute Yakazu, in Omiya (currently Hitachi≈çmiya, Ibaraki Prefecture). He graduated from Mito Commercial School and entered Tokyo Medical University majoring in traditional Chinese medicine under Professor Mori Dohaku along with his elder brother Kaku. He graduated in 1930, and less than a year later, he adopted the art-name D≈çmei Yakazu. In 1933, he started his own clinic, Onchido Iin, in Tokyo, with his younger brother Yudo. Restoration Movement of Chinese Medicine In 1933, Yakazu's younger brother Yudo was diagnosed with typhoid fever. Western medicine seemed to do little for his health so he sought the help of Keisetsu Ohtsuka, another kampo physician. Yudo recovered, which D≈çmei considered a miracle. This became an important meeting of the two schools of kampo medicine. Yakazu belonged to the new school, while Ohtsuka belonged to the more classical one. After this meeting the two schools were united, which marked the beginning of the restoration of kampo medicine. Yakazu, Ohtsuka and the physician Totaro Shimizu formed a Japanese Kampo Medicine Association in 1934.a They began the publication of a monthly journal titled Kampo and Kampo Drugs. Other important members included Kyushin Yumoto and Kenzo Okuda of the classical school; Chokyu Kimura, Anshu Anzai, Yasuaki Nakano, and K≈çmon Morita of the intermediate school; K≈çz≈ç Kurihara and Y≈´shiro Kimura in pharmacology; Sorei Yanagiya in acupuncture; and Yasuhide Ishihara in medical history. However, the promotion of kampo medicine as a branch of medicine was prohibited by the Interior ministry, which corresponds to the present Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan). Although kampo medicine was not popular at that time, more than 1000 people joined the association. =Lectures in Kampo Medicine at Takushoku University= In 1936, D≈çmei, Ohtsuka and others began lecturing at Takushoku University. The calligraphy for the opening ceremony was written by T≈çyama Mitsuru (1855‚Äì1944), who was a political leader in early 20th century Japan. A total of 61 people attended the first lectures.Yakazu[1980:742] The president of Takushoku University formally accepted the lectures in 1937 as the aptly named Takushoku University Kampo Medicine Lectures. These lectures were followed by the Kampo Medicine Lectures of Kampo Tomonokai, with the assistance of President Tsumura Juntendo. These were replaced by the present Institute of Kampo Medicine. =Traditional Medicine, Asia and Manchuria= In 1938, following a proposal by D≈çmei, the Asia Medicine Association was established. It began publishing the journal Toa Igaku (Asian Medicine) in 1939. According to policy at the time, it was classified as Kampo and kampo drugs. Later, in 1954, Domei restarted Toa Igaku and became its chairman of directors. He also published the monthly Kanpo no rinsho (Clinics of Kanpo). In 1940, he attended a conference on traditional medicine in Manchurian medical universities, and proposed the continuation of traditional medicine there. His proposal was subsequently accepted. The Practice of Kampo Medicine In 1941, D≈çmei of the post-classical school, Keisetsu Ohtsuka of the classical school, Nagahisa Kimura of the intermediate school, and Fujitaro Shimizu of pharmacology completed a book entitled Practice of Kampo Medicine, published by Nanzando after 3 years of preparation. This was a revolutionary textbook because it was written so that those who had studied Western medicine could learn kampo medicine on their own. This book has also been translated into Chinese. The second edition was published in 1954. Imperial Japanese Army In October 1941, D≈çmei was drafted and became a doctor of the Imperial Japanese Army. He was sent to Rabaul and Bougainville Island in the Philippines. There, he learned the local method of kampo, in which a local plant, sago, is eaten. This is reported to have saved the lives of many soldiers. He returned to Japan in March 1946. In 1973, D≈çmei revisited the island and presented an organ to the local village. He wrote a book, The records of Bougainville Island Army Hospital, in 1976. Postwar Years After returning to Japan, he worked at his office in Ibaraki Prefecture. In 1949, he became a member of the Japan Oriental Medicine Association preparatory committee. In 1951, he established the Onchido Yakazu doctor's office in Ogawacho, Shinjuku, Tokyo. In 1950, he assumed a post as one of the directors of the Japan Oriental Medicine Association, and between 1959 and 1962 he was the chairman of its board of directors. The Japan Oriental Medicine Association was allowed to join the Japan Medical Association later in 1991. At long last, kampo medicine was accepted in 2008 as one recognized branch of medicine. This also included kampo internal medicine, kampo surgery and kampo allergy medicine. University education, Ph.D. and Awards In 1953, Yakazu lectured on oriental medicine at Tokyo Medical University. The following year he started his Ph.D. studies under the guidance of professor Sabur≈ç Hara (pharmacology). He completed his studies on the pharmacological uses of Aconitum. In 1960, he joined the board of trustee of the Japanese Society for the History of Medicine (Nihon Ishi Gakkai). In 1988, he established the \\"Yakazu Medical History Award\\" using his retirement grant. In November 1979, he received the Career Excellence Award (Saik≈ç Y≈´kosh≈ç, by the Japan Medical Association for his contributions to oriental medicine. In 1980, he assumed the top post of the Kitasato University Oriental Medicine Research Center, and in 1982, he became a member of the communications committee of eight oriental medicine centers. In 1981, he received a Doctor of Letters by Keio University for his studies on medical history, especially Manase D≈çsan (1507-1594) and his school. Yakazu is known to have inspired many physicians to study the history Japanese medicine. On October 21, 2002, he died of natural causes.

A reporter at the Yogyakarta, Java, daily newspaper Bernas, he published a series of articles on corruption in the Bantul Regency in the months before his death. On 13 August, he was attacked at his house by two unidentified assailants using a metal rod and taken to the hospital. He died three days later without regaining consciousness. His murder became a national cause c√©l√®bre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing to a lack of evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder. Life and journalism Udin was born on 18 February 1963, a date considered unlucky in the Javanese calendar as it fell on a kliwon Monday. His father was Wagiman Dzuchoti, a mosque watchman, and his mother was Mujiah; Udin had five siblings. As a young man, Udin had wanted to join the Indonesian military, but was unable due to his family's lack of political connections. Instead, he worked various manual labour jobs, including stonemason. In the ten years prior to his death, Udin was a freelance reporter for Bernas, a daily newspaper of Yogyakarta, Java, owned by the Kompas Gramedia Group. He was known for writing about crime and local politics, and would also take pictures to illustrate his articles. Aside from his reporting, Udin and his wife Marsiyem owned a small store which developed pictures and sold stationary; Marsiyem would usually manage the store. In 1996, Udin began a series of articles reporting on corruption in the regency of Bantul, a suburb of Yogyakarta, focusing particularly on the activities of Bantul's regent Colonel Sri Roso Sudarmo. In one report, Udin stated that Sudarmo had paid a bribe of Rp. 1 billion (US$111,000) to President Suharto's Dharmais Foundation to secure his reappointment that year. Udin also reported that Sudarmo had demanded that village heads guarantee a \\"200 per cent\\" victory for Golkar (President Suharto's party) in the upcoming legislative elections. Following the publication of these articles, Udin began to complain of what he considered a campaign of official harassment. Some district officials had reportedly spoken to him about his writings, and others had threatened him with a libel action. As a result of this perceived harassment, Udin had filed multiple complaints with the Legal Aid Institute () in Yogyakarta. Udin had also been offered bribes to cease his reporting and received threats of violence. When his wife asked him about the threats, he responded, \\"What I write is the facts. If I have to die, I will accept it.\\" The night of his murder, two men came to the Bernas office looking for him, but a secretary sent them away. Murder On 13 August 1996 at around 10:30 pm local time (UTC+7), Udin received two visitors outside his home in Bantul, off Parangtritis Road. The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping, and reportedly had come the day before as well. While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea, the men attacked him with a metal rod, striking him in the head and stomach. The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had parked in front of his home. Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground, bleeding from his ears. With the help of six youths passing in a jeep and a neighbour, Marsiyem took Udin to a small hospital nearby. The hospital was not equipped to treat Udin's wounds, so he was transferred to Bethesda Hospital, a Protestant institution in Yogyakarta. In a coma, he was diagnosed with a fractured skull; a shard of bone had also punctured his skull. Initially, coverage of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred too late in the evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi ‚Äì due to press censorship ‚Äì was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and the front page of the 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted. After his death, Udin's body was autopsied then brought to the Bernas office for a quick memorial service, in which the staff sang \\"Gugur Bunga\\" (\\"Fallen Flowers\\"). The following day, Udin was buried in a small cemetery in Trirenggo, Bantul; his burial attracted 2,000 people. Udin was survived by his wife Marsiyem and two children, Krisna and Wikan. Investigation and cause c√©l√®bre A Bernas sketch of the murderer, based on a description by Marsiyem Investigation into the assault began even before Udin's death. The police began their investigation on 13 August, but were hampered as the crime scene had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault. Under the command of Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto, the police began by collecting Udin's notes and blood from his family; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and were planning to bury it with the body. Meanwhile, five members of the Indonesian Journalists' Association (Perhimpunan Wartawan Indonesia, or PWI) formed a fact-finding team on 14 August under the leadership of Putut Wiryawan and Asril Sutan. The team read the articles written by Udin in the previous six months, looking for any coverage which could have led to the attack; they concluded that most of his articles could have been a trigger. The committee eventually focused on the bribery allegations against Sudarmo, as those were the only ones exclusively covered in Bernas, as well as a case of election rigging. Another team, from Bernas, known as the \\"White Kijang\\" team for the type of car they drove, investigated the case independently when the PWI team failed to share the information they had gathered. Udin's death swiftly became a national cause c√©l√®bre, with the circumstances of his death and the resulting investigation covered extensively in national media. Muslim prayer services held by Bernas seven days after Udin's death attracted hundreds of mourners and saw several community leaders give speeches on politics and Udin's death. Others, such as Goenawan Mohamad, wrote poems and flowery obituaries. Though police ruled out Udin's political reporting as a motive in the early stages of the investigation, many reports focused on the theory that his killing had been related to his reporting on Sudarmo. One journalist quoted the regent as having said shortly before the murder that he would like to teach Udin \\"a lesson\\". The police focused instead on allegations of infidelity; in late August the police stated that Udin had been murdered by a jealous husband as a result of an extramarital affair with a woman named Tri Sumaryani, a Citizens Band radio enthusiast who had once dated Udin's younger brother. However, Sumaryani soon admitted to the press that she had been paid to fabricate this testimony by a nephew of Sri Roso. Meanwhile, the PWI and Bernas teams concluded that Udin had been murdered by a government official intent on saving face. By late September, Bernas was under political pressure to cease coverage of the case. One of the PWI team members, Putut, reported that his daughter had been nearly kidnapped and his home broken into. Several journalistic and human rights organisations stated their belief that the murder was likely connected with Udin's reporting, including Amnesty International, which expressed its concern that allegations about the involvement of government officials had \\"not been properly investigated\\". The Committee to Protect Journalists sent a letter to President Suharto that demanded a full investigation into Udin's death, with the results made public. An independent report by the Indonesian Alliance of Independent Journalists praised the courage and neutrality of Udin's reporting, stating, \\"he was not an NGO activist, nor was he involved in the student movement. He was just an ordinary journalist who did an average job for a regional newspaper.\\" However, the regent denied these reports and rumours; in a press conference on 23 August 1996, he said that he was \\"at the receiving end of over-dramatization\\". Arrest of Dwi Sumaji On 21 October, the police arrested Dwi Sumaji, an advertising company driver, for the murder; they alleged that Sumaji had killed Udin for having an affair with his wife, Sunarti. After Sumaji confessed to the crime, police announced that an iron bar and a T-shirt, both stained with Udin's blood, had been found in Sumaji's home. Though Sumaji's police-appointed lawyer agreed that Sumaji had confessed to the crime, within a week Sumaji obtained independent counsel through whom he attempted to withdraw the confession. Marsiyem, who had seen her husband's attackers, insisted that Sumaji was innocent. On 23 October, Bernas published a sketch of Udin's attacker, drawn soon after the murder based on Marsiyem's description, with a picture of Sumaji; under Sumaji's photograph, they wrote \\"Ditolak\\" (\\"rejected\\"), drawing attention to the dissimilarities between the two. Sumaji withdrew his confession, then alleged that police had encouraged him to confess after plying him with alcohol and bribing him with money, a prostitute, and a better job if he confessed to the crime. Sunarti, incredulous that her husband could be a murderer, wrote letters to several high-ranking officials and bodies, including President Suharto. Only one, to the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), received a reply: on 28 October, the commission announced that it would investigate irregularities in Sumaji's arrest and internment. Meanwhile, Sumaji's counsel and the White Kijang team located several witnesses to corroborate Sumaji's account, including the prostitute. The police continued the investigation, under pressure to finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji playing the role of the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence. Mishandling charges On 7 November, Udin's family announced their intention to sue the city for improper use of evidence. This announcement followed a report from police chief Mulyono that Udin's blood had been disposed of in the southern sea off Parangtritis Beach as an offering to Nyai Roro Kidul, the area's deity, to ensure quick resolution of the investigation. Marsiyem's lawyers from the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum) filed a case in January 1997 against the police (national, provincial, and local), and Edy Wuryanto. The lawsuit demanded Rp. 1 million (US$36,400) in damages. The police countered that the blood had been given voluntarily, and that Marsiyem hoped to exploit the situation. The hearing began on 21 January 1997, under the supervision of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only a small percentage of the damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family ‚Äì whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case ‚Äì was ineligible. Trial of Sumaji Shortly before Marsiyem's case concluded, the members of the White Kijang team were assigned to other, distant cities. After a final, unsuccessful, plea by Sumaji's council on 5 May 1997 to drop the case, the prosecutor's office appointed Amrin Naim to lead the case against Sumaji. On 15 July, after the legislative elections, the office filed charges; the trial began on 29 July, with two members of the three-judge panel that served in the Marsiyem case. After a failed attempt by the defence to question the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned over a period of several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it. On 2 October 1997, the prosecution began to call more witnesses. Although attendance did not abate, most observers were police officers or paid spectators. One witness, who claimed to have participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, the prosecution withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial. Aftermath On 6 June, several weeks after President Suharto resigned, Sudarmo was ousted from his office after students conducted a sit-in at the Bantul Assembly House. He was soon convicted of corruption for his payment to the Dharmais Foundation, but the conviction was overturned by a higher court, after which Sudarmo retired. Wuryanto never served time for his disposal of Udin's blood. Sumaji's defence initially prepared a legal case for wrongful imprisonment, but the driver chose not to pursue it. He was unable to work for three years due to the infamy he had acquired from the case, but by 2000 was driving a public bus near Mount Merapi. By 2000, Marsiyem had married a neighbour, with whom she had a child. The Alliance of Independent Journalists created the \\"Udin Award\\" in Udin's honour, \\"given for exceptional contribution to press freedom\\". In 2010, the organisation also petitioned the National Police to take over the case, noting that under Indonesian law, the case could be declared \\"expired\\" in 2014.

The choir was founded with 20 members in 1973 by Douglas Parnham, who wanted to \\"provide a vehicle for young boys to develop their vocal and musical talents and at the same provide the community with another dimension of education and entertainment.\\" Throughout its history, the boys have performed in several different countries, for royalty and with internationally known performers such as Metropolitan Opera baritone Allan Monk, Gordon Gietz, lyric tenor Mark DuBois, the Canadian Brass, Natalie Cole, David Foster, Kenny Loggins, and Jos√© Carreras. Past directors include Gerald Wirth, the current artistic director of the Vienna Boys' Choir; Tyrone Paterson, Canadian opera conductor (approximately 1985‚Äì1987); Peter Togni, Canadian composer; and Jean-Louis Barbier. Distinguished alumni include Gordon Gietz, actor and Heebee-jeebees member Jonathan Love, and New York-based actor/singer Alex Birnie. The current artistic director of the Calgary Boys' Choir is Paul Grindlay.  Groupings of Singers  The Calgary Boys' Choir's flagship choir is the Gentlemen's Choir, which is for boys in Grades 5 and up, including boys whose voices have changed. The Gentlemen's Choir was formerly known as the Touring Choir. Boys sing in multiple parts and learn music in various languages and music styles. The Gentlemen's Choir collaborates often with other community partners and will also go on tour. The Masters Choir, formerly known as the Performing Choir, is for boys in Grades 2 through 5. This choir level was created to develop talent and prepare boys for the Gentlemen's Choir. Boys in the Masters Choir continue to work on choral tone and matching vowels, but will also experiment with singing in two parts. They also sing in a language other than English, and through collaboration with the Young Singers, will be exposed to leadership and mentorship skills. Over the years, the Calgary Boys' Choir has offered a Young Singers program, which accepted boys as young as age six. Currently, the Young Singers accepts boys as young as kindergarten. Members of the Young Singers work on choral tone and matching vowels by singing in unison. They sing folksongs in English with limited words so they can focus on matching pitch and tone, and working together as a group. They also tend to move and interact with each other through games and activity. In its first year, the Calgary Boys' Choir recorded 14 boys but grew to around 100 by 1991. At times throughout its history, the Calgary Boys' Choir has included an Early Childhood Music (ECM) division for preschool-aged boys and girls, an Alumni Choir for boys with changed voices, and was briefly affiliated with the Calgary Girls Choir as well as a choral music school.

It was established in 1918 in Baghdad and has been offering classes in science and literature in addition to Arabic, English and French. History The idea to establish Al-Markaziya High School goes back to April 16, 1918, when the Iraqi Ministry of Education (Ÿàÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿßÿ±ŸÅ) expressed its intention to found a secondary school for the teaching of modern science and literature for three years post elementary school. Dawood Niazi was then appointed principal of the School and Al- Khatooniyah School‚Äôs building (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ©ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿ™ŸàŸÜŸäÿ©) located in Abbas Afandi area on Al-Jimhouriyah Street (ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ©) of Baghdad was chosen to temporarily host the School. However, the opening of the School was long overdue, and following the end of the elementary school year, a number of teachers met at the home of Mohammed Naji Al-Qishtini, Principal of Al-Baroodiyah School to discuss the matter. They agreed on opening one secondary school class at Al- Haidariyah School building, which was then run by Abdul Majeed Zeedan. When this class was opened, 15 students who had just finished elementary school applied for admission. However, the British authorities soon closed the class, but pressure and perseverance from parents resulted in Major Bauman, Warden for Education in Iraq, agreeing to reopen the class for the academic year 1919-1920. The class had 7 students only, and teachers were brought for them from the American University of Beirut. However, when the first school year concluded, it was decided to open an inclusive secondary school, and the building of Old Missions Department (ÿØÿßÿ¶ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿπÿ´ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØŸäŸÖÿ©) was allocated for the School. The School was provided with Iraqi and Arab prominent teachers such as Abdulmajeed Khoja, Muhiddin Al-Nasiri, and Abdulaziz Al-Pachachi. The School was soon moved to the building of Al-Ittihad School, which was later named Al-Ma‚Äômooniyah (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ£ŸÖŸàŸÜŸäÿ©), until it was allocated a building that it continues to occupy today. The current building of Al-Markaziyah was built in 1789 during the days of Abdulrahman Pasha, the Fourth Pasha of Baghdad in the reign of Sultan Abdulaziz. He [Abdulrahman Pasha] served for a second term in the reign of Sultan Murad, son of Sultan Abdulmajid, and was the seventh among the 28 Pashas of Baghdad, whose last was Khalil Pasha, during whose term, Baghdad was occupied by the British. Students and the School System In the early years, the number of students was very limited, especially when only the remarkably smart students or the sons of merchants and elite families were admitted. Around 20% of the students were Jewish. The system applied at the School was at first military-based, then became civilian. Every student was charged a fee that amounted to one Rupee (as of September 11, 1920). The School‚Äôs student uniform consisted of a dark suit, bow tie, and Sidara Faisaliyah (Sudarp ‚Äì small black hat), which was later changed to the Tarboosh (fez). One of the prerequisites for admission at the time was that the student had to submit a certificate of good conduct signed by the police station. The tuition fee for one school year was 2.250 dinars and was collected in three installments throughout the year. A student whose father's monthly income was less than 16.875 or whose father was a teacher was exempt from paying the tuition fee, and any student who brought a testimony from the mayor that his family was underprivileged was exempt from paying for textbooks. The school developed a student file system that included detailed information about each student, including name, date of birth, and father‚Äôs occupation, in addition to a health book, which included a record of physical examination of head, eyes, mouth and hallmarks of all students. For example, Abdulkarim Qassim‚Äôs (Founder of the Republic of Iraq) file, who was admitted to the School in 1926, mentions a scar on his upper lip, and 150 cm height) in addition to records of his performance. The School had 31 principals, starting with General Nadhif Al-Shawi and ending with Mazen Fadhil Al-Muttalibi (current principal). Ala‚Äôaldeen Al-Rayis has spent the longest period as principal of the School (1947‚Äì1958). The first play in Iraq was performed at the School‚Äôs theatre (Ms. Bell‚Äôs Theater), which was then the only one in Iraq. The play was directed by Hakki Al-Shibli. King Faisal I, used to visit the School on the first day of the school year and sign on the teachers book to honor them. In addition to maintaining academic excellence, the School was known for having wide athletic activities. It had teams for soccer, basketball, volleyball, boxing, wrestling, and equestrian, and contended different famous teams in the thirties and forties of the last century, including the Royal Guards and Air Force. The School offered classes on many branches of literature, science, business, languages, including Arabic, English and French, and many extra-curricular activity such as music and acting. The School‚Äôs library was founded with the establishment of the School and contains a variety of books and publications that cover all branches of knowledge and it used the Dewey decimal method for classification.

As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. It is based in the city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.  History  1 Medical Battalion Group can trace its roots back to the Militia units of old Natal, dating back to 1895,1 Medical Battalion Group. The Citizen Soldier: History of the Reserve Force Units. when the Ambulance detachments of Durban Light Infantry, Natal Mounted Rifles and Natal Carbineers were merged to form the Natal Volunteer Medical Corps (NVMC).  Anglo-Boer War and early years ‚Äì 1914  1899 saw the first active mobilisation of the Natal Volunteer Medical Corps in the Anglo Boer War where the Corps served with distinction with Imperial forces including the Seaforth Highlanders, their first association with the Highland Tartan. The Militia Act of 1904 saw the change in name to Natal Medical Corps and as such they saw active service in the Bhambatha or Poll Tax Rebellion of 1906. The Natal Medical Corps was called up again in 1914 at the outbreak of the Rand Strikes until released from service in 1915 with thanks from the Government.  The Great War 1914‚Äì1918  The Natal Medical Corps was mobilised in 1914 and served in the South West African Campaign where they formed the 6th Stationary Hospital at Swakupmond and manned the hospital ship 'Ebani'. Another section took part in the battle for Gideon against German forces. At the conclusion of the SWA Campaign the Field Ambulance was attached to the 1st Infantry Brigade and departed aboard HMT Kenilworth Castle from Cape Town for training at Royal Army Medical Corps Twezeldown on 10 October 1915. Following training the unit was shipped to Egypt aboard HMT Corsican, reaching Alexandria on 13 January 1916. As the 'Natal Corps' of 1st South African Field Ambulance the unit was involved in most major battles including the Somme, Deville Wood, Ypres and Menin Road. The Natal Medical Corps was again mobilised with other Natal Regiments and sent to the Reef during the Rand Strikes of 1922. In the 1935 the Natal Medical Corps was designated 1st Field Ambulance and in 1939, and following the motivation of the Officer Commanding, Col. G.D. English, authority to wear the Mackenzie Tartan was granted to the unit. This unique honour was authorised by the Surgeon General and the Union Defence Force, after approval by the British War Office, The Countess of Cromach (Cromartie) as Head of Clan, and the Seaforth Highlanders.  World War II  All medical units were pooled and new units numbers from 10 upwards. The members of 1st Field Ambulance formed the major component of 10 and 11 Field Ambulances wearing the Mackenzie Tartan behind their cap badges to maintain their identity. 10 and 11 Field Ambulances saw service in the Western Desert and Italy. 17 Field Ambulance which was formed during the war saw service with the Australians and was captured at the fall of Tobruk in 1943. After the war, the Field Ambulances reverted to their original numbering.  Internal unrest in South Africa  The Unit was mobilised in 1959/60 as part of Ops Duiker during the Cato Manor Riots. During Ops Letaba in Voortrekkerhoogte in 1961, helicopters were used for casualty evacuation for the first time, and members of 1st Field Ambulance were told they were in the 'forefront of modern warfare'.  The Border War and the formation of 1 Medical Battalion Group  After the Second World War the activities of the Unit were confined to reorganisation and training camps. The reinstated 17 Field Ambulance did Border duties and conventional operations in Angola in the late 70's. 1st Field Ambulance members were involved in detached duties in Northern Natal along the Mozambique border, and deployed in full strength in 1978 to test the new Field Ambulance system in Thabazimbi. On 1 July 1979, the South African Medical Corps (SAMC), until that time a Corps of the Army, became the South African Medical Service (SAMS), the fourth arm of the South African Defence Force (SADF). On 6 July 1979, 1 Field Ambulance was awarded the Freedom of the City of Durban and in this year also provided the Guard of Honour for the first Durban Military Tattoo. In 1980, the new Medical Battalion concept was tested during Ex Jumbo with the formation of 11 Medical Battalion, an amalgamation of all field ambulances. This concept was approved and adopted, and in November 1981, the two Durban Field Ambulances, 1 and 17, were merged into 1 Medical Battalion Group.  Inherited traditions  All the traditions and history of both units were inherited by the new battalion, including the wearing of the Mackenzie TartanThe Scottish Connection- Based on an original article written by Ken Gillings, Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal, 29 October 2007.

Known for his conceptual art and social activism in Argentine politics, most of his work is collaborative such as his displays in Experiencias and participation in Tucum√°n Arde.  Biography  Jacoby was born to immigrants in Buenos Aires in 1944. He graduated from Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires (CNBA) and studied sociology at the University of Buenos Aires. He is a member of the so-called \\"generaci√≥n del Di Tella\\" and is considered one of the first conceptual artists in the world. He is particularly known for his participation in many controversial and political exhibitions, such as \\"Experiencias 68\\" and \\"Tucum√°n Arde\\". In 1966, along with Eduardo Costa and Ra√∫l Escari, he worked to promote the use of alternate mediums for art such as communications media. His work reflects this, including a vast array of mediums such as installations, performances, drawings, viewer participation, comics, photographs, videos, and more, with very few of his works holding any visual similarities to each other. Later, he largely left the Argentine art scene to engage in more directly political subjects such as social conflict and political epistemology. He would later write a book, though it currently remains unpublished- Storming Heaven (El asalto al cielo)- containing information about the research he did on those. To counter the rising fear over political crisis in Argentina, he began to make some artistic contributions once again, such as writing for the Argentine band Virus that began a new Argentine rock wave on the 1980s. Happening for a Dead Boar Together with Costa and Escari, the three artists collaborated to make Happening para un jabal√≠ difunto (Happening for a Dead Boar) in 1966. Inspired by Oscar Masotta's declaration that 'the medium is the message', their purpose was to use mass media as their primary art medium so as to question its power in society. In a piece that would later be seen as crucial in Jacoby's conceptualist works, he published his essay Against the Happening which called into question the reliability of media narrative. The trio spread word of a 'Happening' distributed through traditional media outlets, only to reveal months later, that there was not, in fact, any such event. Their art seemed to render not only the object medium of art, but any art event superfluous, a new 'genre' of art they referred to as Arte de los Medios de Comunicaci√≥n de Masas (art of the mass media). This 'exhibition' was meant to draw public attention to the failings of media- specifically photographic media- and the dangers of assuming its honesty or accuracy. Experiencias del '68 In 1967, a man named Romero Brest decided to try and change the barriers or wealth required to enjoy art in the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella (ITDT); he decided to try and do this with Experiencias. These works, like many beginning conceptualist works at the time, were meant to be pieces where the viewer could see the fusion of life and art. Brest wanted the viewers to directly interact the artist's experiences rather than view those experiences through the lens of their art. Roberto Jacoby was one artist chosen to participate in this exhibition. The project fit well into his values ‚Äì especially that of using and allowing art to reach wide audiences ‚Äì displaying Message in the Di Tella (Mensaje en el Di Tella) in the '68 exhibition. The piece criticized art world standards and culture, and predicted that in the near future that art and life would not stay segregated: \\"The future is linked not to the creation of works but to the design of new forms of life\\". When the exhibition was censured, he, along with his fellow artists, destroyed their work in the streets before Di Tella to protest police intervention in what would be seen as the breaking point between the artists and the Di Tella art institution. Tucum√°n Arde Tucum√°n Arde (Tucum√°n is Burning) was an art exhibition that took place in 1968 meant to protest the Argentinian government and create political conversations about the events and tragedies occurring at the time. The exhibition consisted of a group of artists spreading knowledge and insight into the misfortunes and social injustices which threatened the Argentine public at the time. took place in Rosario and then later in Buenos Aires. Due to the controversial nature of the exhibition, shortly after it began, many of the works were removed or destroyed in order to protect the identities of those who participated. Much of this erasure happened before the art exhibit was recorded; as a result, while it is commonly acknowledged that Jacoby participated in Tucum√°n Arde, very little is known about what his artistic contribution to the exhibition was exactly. Departure From Art Near the end of 1968, Jacoby left the art scene. He believed that art had explored all possible avenues possible in order to make a meaningful impact in politics. He said that the artists of Argentina had worn art to the limits, both as a way to create cultural change, and in terms of what could be thought. Jacoby felt that his work for the Happening and with Masotta himself \\"had reached a sort of maximum degree of abstraction\\", so there was nothing left for it to say. However, despite his withdrawal from the art scene, Jacoby was far from finished with the political sphere. Around 1969, he started working with the Centro de Investigaci√≥n en Ciencias Sociales (Center for Research in the Social Sciences) or CISCO in an attempt to bridge the gaps between knowledge and action. Strategy of Joy Nearing the end of the dictatorship, Jacoby began to engage in artistic avenues once again. This was a part of his so-called \\"Strategy of Joy\\". In his own words: > ‚Äú...the strategy of joy was directly tied to a superabundance of fear. At > that time, I first understood how wonderful it was that there were people > dancing and making such joyous music‚Ä¶ I realized that that‚Äôs infectious‚Ä¶ Joy > keeps you going when you are in situations steeped in terror, which we had > been in, right?‚Äù Jacoby hoped that by promoting joy, people would begin to overcome the pervading fear within the populace. His strategy was about the celebration of being alive and disobeying disciplinary norms. To this end, he collaborated with singer Federico Moura to wrote songs and helped design shows- including small, subversive details, like standing and dancing during the concert, which was outside of the norm at the time- for Moura's Argentine rock band known as Virus. The music and shows were not without political impact however, and often contained criticisms of the r√©gime.  Works  * Maqueta de una obra (Scale Model of an Artwork), 1966 A pre-working for a sculpture that was never produced. This piece includes a sketch, a text, and a scale model, but the point of the piece was that it was never finished. Instead, the viewer must become an active participant and use their imagination to \\"finish\\" the work. * Mao y Per√≥n, un solo coraz√≥n (Mao and Per√≥n, A Single Heart), 1967 During gathering in Central Park, Jacoby pinned photographs of Mao Zedong and of Juan Per√≥n (who the Argentine Left believed would lead a socialist revolution upon his return from exile) to his chest.

As part of the protest movement, a series of widespread student strikes were organized, involving half of Quebec's student population by April 2012. A third of Quebec students continued to participate in the strike by its 100th day, while a quarter million had participated during its peak.Marquis, Eric, \\"Quebec government escalates campaign to break student strike,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 1 March 2012. Other students continued to attend their courses. Left-wing groups endorsed the student protests, which evolved into generalized demonstrations against the provincial government. Opposition parties (Parti Qu√©b√©cois, Qu√©bec solidaire, Option nationale), workers unions (Conf√©d√©ration des syndicats nationaux, Canadian Union of Public Employees) and many groups demonstrated alongside the students in April and May 2012. On May 18, the Government passed Bill 78, an emergency law forbidding picketing or protest near university grounds, and requiring police approval for large public protests anywhere in Quebec. The law was mainly repealed by the Marois government in September 2012Gouvernement du Qu√©bec, ¬´ D√©cret 924-2012 ¬ª, September 21, 2012, Gazette officielle, , , . and expired in 2013. In the Fall of 2012, with a new school term beginning, student participation in the strikes and demonstrations dwindled. The Quebec nationalist Parti Qu√©b√©cois was later elected as minority government and halted any tuition increases in line with its campaign promises. These protests are sometimes named Maple Spring, from the which alludes to (Arab spring) as well as the maple tree which symbolizes Quebec and Canada.Printemps √©rable : cinq choses √† savoir sur le conflit des √©tudiants au Qu√©bec Sophie Malherbe, L'Express, 23 May 2012  Historical context  = Higher education in Quebec = In the 1960s, the provincial government took over responsibility for higher education. Changes included the creation of a separate pre-university college level, a publicly funded college system, and providing universities enough funding so that it would be affordable to anyone who wanted to attend. These changes in education access gave birth to a Quebec middle class and transformed the possibility of upward mobility in the province. As a result of the Quiet Revolution, university tuition fees in Quebec were frozen at $540 per year from 1968 to 1990. In 1994, annual tuition rose to $1668, after which it was frozen until 2007, when it grew by $100 per year until 2012, making it $2168. Overall, tuition increased an average of $37 per year or 300% between 1968 and 2012, not including other fees that are paid to universities (e.g. administration fees, student service fees, etc.). The overall cost living inflation as measured by an aggregate inflation index commonly used by economists rose 557% from 1968 to 1990, while Quebec maintained the lowest tuition fees in Canada. = Student protests in Quebec = The province's student associations have a mandatory membership and dues structure. These associations depend on the size and level of the institution. In smaller colleges and universities, strikes will be campus wide, but at larger schools they usually happen by department so the entire campus is rarely shut down. For example, if engineering students voted to strike, the picket lines would focus only on engineering students. Student associations usually call for strikes over local issues and set a limited time period. The student strike movement persists in Quebec because it is one of the only places where student associations hold regular general assemblies. Most student strikes in Quebec won at least a partial victory. These previous student strikes demanded free tuition, democratic administration of the universities, the expansion of French instruction and facilities, elimination of more stringent aptitude tests, and an increase in bursaries.  Events  One of the many night protests in the streets of Montreal, 27 May 2012. = March 2011 = In March 2011, Quebec decided to pursue planned five year tuition increases, prompting protests from student groups, and the occupation of the office of the Finance minister. = Summer 2011 = In July, student leaders accused police of brutality and repression against protesters, whose numbers swelled to 30,000 by November, leading to the occupation of McGill University's administrative building. = December 2011 = CLASSE (Coalition large de l'Association pour une solidarit√© syndicale √©tudiante, or ‚Äúbroad coalition of the Association for Student Union Solidarity‚Äù) was founded, and announced the intention to strike. A few weeks later, the F√©d√©ration √©tudiante coll√©giale du Qu√©bec (FECQ) and the F√©d√©ration √©tudiante universitaire du Qu√©bec (FEUQ) stated they would also strike. = February 2012 = The strike officially began on February 13, 2012, with students at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM) and University Laval voting massively in opposition to augmentation of university tuition fees. Beginning late February 2012, nine per cent of Quebec students, or 36,000 students, went on strike, using a square red flag for protest. On February 23, students are pepper-sprayed by police after occupying Montreal's Jaques Cartier bridge. = March 2012 = On March 7, 2012, during a sit-in demonstration blocking front of the Loto-Qu√©bec (lottery) head office, police deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades against over 1,000 protesters. One student named Francis Grenier had his eye seriously wounded by what he and other demonstrators stated was a flash-bang grenade launched by police. According to the student's father, police investigators sought to demonstrate the wound was caused by a snowball. Students begin to wear patches over their left eyes in solidarity with Grenier. During the morning rush hour on March 20, 150 student demonstrators blocked the Montreal-bound entrance ramp to the Champlain Bridge in Brossard using concrete blocks. Upon the arrival of S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec police officers, the protesters fled through the streets of Brossard to coaches waiting for them at Terminus Panama. When officers arrived at the Terminus, they surrounded the buses and arrested around 100 demonstrators. Each was identified and fined C$494. On March 22, an estimated 200,000 people came together for a massive peaceful protest in downtown Montreal. At its peak, the parade stretched up to 50 blocks. While there was no violence, the police confiscated sticks carried by some participants. By this time, over 310 000 students (out of 400 000 in the province) were on strike. On March 27, protesters block access to the Quebec Liquor Board offices as students begin to target economic symbols. = April 2012 = On April 2, the outside of Line Beauchamp's office is painted red. This building becomes a popular rallying point at marches. On April 18-19, more than 300 people are arrested in Gatineau, Quebec during confrontations between the police and protesters at Universite du Quebec's Outaouais campus. = May 2012 = In April and early May, 185,000 Quebec students went on strike, with an additional 90,000 students threatening to strike. Quebec education minister Line Beauchamp called on students to negotiate while refusing to negotiate with CLASSE, which she accused of instigating violence. Students demanded that university administrative costs be reduced by $189 million, to pay for teaching and research. On May 5, after a marathon negotiating session, student groups and government reach deal to delay increases in cost of education for a few months pending a study by a new body. Student assemblies massively reject the offer, while some student faculties vote to end walkout and return to school. On May 6, 2012, a demonstration took place in Victoriaville, which eventually turned into a riot when vandals started throwing projectiles at the crowd. At least ten people were injured, including some police officers who were attacked by protesters. Two protesters were very seriously injured. The first one lost an eye. The second one sustained head trauma and a skull fracture. On May 14, 2012 Line Beauchamp announced that she would resign from her position as Quebec Education Minister and Deputy Premier. Beauchamp stated that she \\"lost confidence in the student leaders' will to end this conflict.\\" Later that same day, Premier Charest announced that Michelle Courchesne would replace Beauchamp as Education Minister and Deputy Premier. On May 18, 2012, Bill 78 passed in the National Assembly of Quebec during the early hours of the morning and the municipality of Montreal passed a law prohibiting mask-wearing during any organization or demonstration. The nightly protest being held in downtown Montreal ended in violence and 69 arrests. There were reports of projectiles being launched by protesters, as well as molotov cocktails, and police responded by firing rubber bullets and using tear gas and noise bombs against the protesters. Police declared the protest to be illegal. On May 19, 2012, Montreal-based band Arcade Fire wore the \\"red square\\" solidarity symbol during a performance with Mick Jagger on the season finale of Saturday Night Live. On May 20, 2012, during an evening protest that turned violent, a protester was seriously injured by police officers in riot gear. Upon attacking an officer, the victim was beaten by five officers with their clubs and forcibly neutralized. On May 22, 2012, in response to the passage of Bill 78 and in commemoration of 100 days since the beginning of the student strike, another march took place, with tens of thousands of marchers and approximately 1,000 arrests Organizers spun this event as \\"The single biggest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history.\\" By May 24, 2012, the \\"Casseroles\\" series of nightly protests had rapidly expanded to most Montreal residential neighborhoods outside of the usual protest routes. These protests, in which people stood on their own balconies banging pots and pans, emerged as a way of subverting the ban on unannounced street protests. Inspired by the cacerolazos of Chile in 1971, these involved residents banging on pots and pans from their windows or taking to the streets with their kitchenware at 8 o'clock. A viral amateur video of one such protest in the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood further fueled this phenomenon. On May 31, the Quebec government stated that it was pulling out of talks meant to end the protest after four days of negotiations with student leaders, without having reached a stable consensus. By that day, more than 150,000 students were estimated to be on strike. = June 2012 = Strikes continued as more thousands more joined the movement to directly protest Bill 78. Since this bill effected all Quebec citizens, groups including trade unions, teachers and professor unions, the Quebec Bar Association, jurists, and hundreds of others joined the protests. Police were now arresting dozens of people each night. During the Canadian Grand Prix weekend (June 9-10, 2012), Montreal police carried out mass preventative arrests. = August 2012 = Bill 78 was repealed in August 2012. After the announcement by ministerial decree of tuition freeze on September 5, 2012, the remaining student associations on strike voted to return to class.  Bill 78  On May 16, soon after the appointment of Michelle Courchesne, she and Premier Charest announced their plan to introduce Bill 78. The bill is titled \\"An Act to enable students to receive instruction from the postsecondary institutions they attend,\\" and restricts freedom of assembly, protest, or picketing on or near university grounds, and anywhere in Quebec without prior police approval. The bill also places restrictions upon the right of education employees to strike. After 20 hours of debate, the National Assembly passed Bill 78 on May 18, 2012. This bill was criticized by the United Nations, with the UN High Commissioner stating that: \\"In the context of student protests, I am disappointed by the new legislation passed in Quebec that restricts their rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly\\". The bill was also denounced by opposition parties.  Symbols  = Red square = The red square, symbol of the Quebec student protest against tuition fee increases. = Other squares = After the red square became a well-known symbol in Quebec, other groups decided to use squares of varying colours to promote their own viewpoints.   Controversies  On April 18, 2012, a group of 300 protesters broke windows and ransacked rooms at the University of Montreal and injured a security guard. Among the six that were arrested, Yalda Machouf-Khadir, the daughter of Quebec solidaire's Amir Khadir, was sued by the University of Montreal for CAD$100,000 in damages. Students were later sentenced to probation and community service. On May 23, 2012, at around 23h45, about 500 civilians suspected to be protesters were arrested by the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al at the intersections of Sherbrooke Street and Saint-Denis at Montr√©al. They were not informed as to why they were arrested, police claiming the protest had been declared illegal, but the victims argued that at no occasion had they been informed that the protest was illegal or that they could disperse. The 500 suspected protesters were detained inside buses for 3 to 8 hours. Documents used in court against the city describe people suffering hypothermia and hypoglycemia. Also the 500 citizens were not permitted to use bathrooms for up to 8 hours, the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al would ask people to urinate at the back of the buses because they said the number of officers was insufficient to safely bring everyone to the bathroom one by one. In the end, no one in those buses would have any tickets or accusations. On June 12, 2012, some protesters were referring to local police authorities as SS and anti-police pamphlets using the swastika were distributed. The use of the Nazi symbolism was quickly decried in the Montreal Gazette by several Jewish organizations. Although it is said that protesters were using these symbols to condemn the recent tactics use by the local police, the CLASSE has implored its members to stop using these symbols. Legacy The protests inspired directors Mathieu Denis and Simon Lavoie to make the 2016 film Those Who Make Revolution Halfway Only Dig Their Own Graves. Denis and Lavoie said they often wondered what happened to these students in later years. Lavoie was particularly influenced by mug shots of four young people who placed smoke bombs on the Montreal Metro during the protests.

Mubarak Ali Khan was succeeded by his son, Babar Ali Khan after his death on 6 September 1793. Life =Early years= Mubarak ud-Daula Nawab of Murshidabad Nawab Nazim Mubarak Ali Khan, better known as Mubarak ud- Daulah was the son of Mir Jafar by Babbu Begum. He succeeded his half brother, Ashraf Ali Khan, at the age of 12 years, after Ashraf Ali Khan's death on 24 March 1770.

In 1790, the Queen of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, asked, through Lord Cornwallis, for one of Nawab Mubarak ud-Daulah's daughters in marriage with her son. The Nawab rejected the offer in the following terms, in a letter to Lord Cornwallis: Please request the Queen to pass over the matter. I cannot, by any means, accede to the proposal. there are many obstacles in the matter. Moreover, there is a longstanding usage in my family, that our daughters can never be given in marriage to any one other than Sayyids. If I act contrary to this, my family custom, I shall be ruined. At all events, my mother and I cannot accept the offer. ‚ÄîNawab Nazim Mubarak ud-Daulah of Bengal Although, the Nawab, then had 13 daughters, and to some extent regarded himself as a servant of the Emperor, he, for family reasons, did not allow the marriage of one of the 13 with even such an honourable prince as the Prince of Delhi. =Death and succession= Tomb of Mubarak Ali Khan at Jafarganj Cemetery.

Life Forster was born at Colchester, Essex, on 11 June 1769, the only son of Nathaniel Forster, D.D., rector of All Saints in that town. After receiving some instruction at home, he was sent to Norwich grammar school, then under his father's close friend Samuel Parr. On 5 May 1788 he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford. To renew contact with Parr, Forster took a house at Hatton, Warwickshire, where he resided for some time. Having married, he ultimately became a member of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. on 21 February 1792, and entered Lincoln's Inn on 15 June of the same year. Deciding, however, to become a clergyman, he was ordained priest by Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, in 1796. He proceeded M.A. on 16 February 1797. In 1803, Forster was presented to the rectory of Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire, by an old friend, Lord Somerville, who had procured for him the appointment of chaplain to the Duke of Newcastle in 1796. There was no parsonage-house on the living, and Forster settled in London, where his pulpit oratory was in demand. He was from 1800 to 1814 successively morning preacher at Berkeley and Grosvenor chapels; and at Park Street and King Street chapels, in which he shared the duty with Sydney Smith, Stanier Clarke, Thomas Frognall Dibdin, and other fashionable preachers. After the peace of 1815 Forster moved with his family to Paris, his finances having suffered by losses on his publications. About a year later he began to preach in the Temple Protestant de l'Oratoire du Louvre, and eventually obtained a grant from the consistory for the use of the church when it was not required for French service. Here he officiated until the autumn of 1827, when ill- health compelled him to resign. In 1818, he was appointed to the post, founded at his suggestion, of chaplain to the British embassy, which he continued to hold until his death. In 1824, the Earl of Bridgewater made him his chaplain. Forster had been elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 10 December 1801, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also an active supporter of the Royal Institution from its foundation, was appointed honorary librarian by the directors, and was engaged to deliver lectures there during three successive seasons. Death and burial Forster died in Paris on 18 February 1828, after a lingering illness, and was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Works Engraving after Robert Smirke for Edward Forster's translation of the Arabian Nights Forster entered into an engagement with a bookseller, William Miller of Old Bond Street, subsequently of Albemarle Street, to issue tastefully printed editions of the works of standard authors, illustrated by the best artists of the day. His first venture was an edition of Charles Jervas's translation of Don Quixote (1801). Having been successful in this, he published some lesser works of less importance, while he was preparing for the press a new translation, from the French of Antoine Galland, of the Arabian Nights (1802), with twenty-four engravings from pictures by Robert Smirke, R.A. During the same year he brought out an edition of Anacreon, for which William Bulmer furnished a Greek font; the title-plates and vignettes were by Lavinia Forster. Editions of dramatic authors followed, under the titles of British Drama, New British Theatre, and English Drama. An edition of Rasselas, with engravings by Abraham Raimbach from pictures painted by Smirke, was issued by Forster in 1805; it was followed in 1809 by a small privately printed volume of verse, entitled Occasional Amusements, which appeared without his name. Forster's major publication was the folio serial entitled The British Gallery of Engravings, consisting of highly finished line engravings. Descriptions in English and French accompany each engraving. The first number of this work appeared in 1807, and in 1813 the first volume only was completed, when it was abandoned for financial reasons. When he left for Paris, Forster was engaged in publishing a Plautus. Three volumes were completed when it was stopped by the sudden death of the printer. Family Towards the end of 1790 Forster married Elizabeth, widow of Captain Addison, and youngest daughter of Philip Bedingfeld of Ditchingham Hall, Norfolk; his wife, by whom he had no children, lived only four years after their union. On 3 August 1799, then resident at Weston, Oxfordshire, he married as his second wife Lavinia, only daughter of Thomas Banks, R.A., the sculptor. He left a widow and three daughters, for whose benefit were published Sermons preached at the Chapel of the British Embassy, and at the Protestant Church of the Oratoire, in Paris, by Edward Forster, with a short Account of his Life, edited by Lavinia Forster, 2 vols.

Preserved in the Ghent University Library. The Vandal Kingdom () or Kingdom of the Vandals and Alans () was established by the Germanic Vandal people under Gaiseric. It ruled in North Africa and the Mediterranean 435‚Äì534 CE. In 429 CE, the Vandals, estimated to number 80,000 people, had crossed by boat from Hispania to North Africa. They advanced eastward, conquering the coastal regions of what is now Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. In 435, the Roman Empire, then ruling North Africa, allowed the Vandals to settle in the provinces of Numidia and Mauretania when it became clear that the Vandal army could not be defeated by Roman military forces. In 439 the Vandals renewed their advance eastward and captured Carthage, the most important city of North Africa. The fledgling kingdom then conquered the Roman-ruled islands of Mallorca, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica in the western Mediterranean. In the 460s, the Romans launched two unsuccessful military expeditions by sea in an attempt to overthrow the Vandals and reclaim North Africa. The conquest of North Africa by the Vandals was a blow to the beleaguered Western Roman Empire as North Africa was a major source of revenue and a supplier of grain (mostly wheat) to the city of Rome. Although primarily remembered for the sack of Rome in 455 and their persecution of Nicene Christians in favor of Arian Christianity, the Vandals were also patrons of learning. Grand building projects continued, schools flourished, and North Africa fostered many of the most innovative writers and natural scientists of the late Latin-speaking Western Roman Empire. The Vandal Kingdom ended in 534, when it was conquered by Belisarius in the Vandalic War and incorporated into the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine Empire). History View from the Gibraltar strait to North Africa where the Vandals crossed into Africa. = Establishment = The Vandals, under their new king Gaiseric (also known as Genseric or Geiseric), crossed to Africa in 429. Although their numbers are unknown and some historians debate the validity of estimates, based on Procopius's assertion that the Vandals and Alans numbered 80,000 when they moved to North Africa,Procopius Wars 3.5.18‚Äì19 in Peter Heather estimates that they could have fielded an army of around 15,000‚Äì20,000. According to Procopius, the Vandals came to Africa at the request of Bonifacius, the military ruler of the region.Procopius Wars 3.5.23‚Äì24 in However, it has been suggested that the Vandals migrated to Africa in search of safety; they had been attacked by a Roman army in 422 and had failed to seal a treaty with them. Advancing eastward along the African coast, the Vandals laid siege to the walled city of Hippo Regius in 430. Inside, Saint Augustine and his priests prayed for relief from the invaders, knowing that the fall of the city would spell conversion or death for many Nicene Christians. On 28 August 430, three months into the siege, the 75-year- old St. Augustine diedNewadvent.org ‚Äî perhaps from starvation or stress, as the wheat fields outside the city lay dormant and unharvested. After 14 months, hunger and disease were ravaging both the city's inhabitants and the Vandals outside the walls. The city eventually fell to the Vandals, who made it their first capitol. Peace was made between the Romans and the Vandals in 435 through a treaty between Valentinian III and Gaiseric, giving the Vandals control of coastal Numidia and parts of Mauretania. Gaiseric chose to break the treaty in 439 when he invaded the province of Africa Proconsularis and laid siege to Carthage. The city was captured without a fight; the Vandals entered it while most of the inhabitants were attending the races at the hippodrome. Gaiseric made it his capitol and styled himself the King of the Vandals and Alans, to denote the inclusion of his Alan allies into his realm. Conquering Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, and the Balearic Islands, he built his kingdom into a powerful state. Averil Cameron suggests that the new Vandal rule may not have been unwelcome to the population of North Africa, as the previous landowners were generally unpopular. The impression given by sources such as Victor of Vita, Quodvultdeus, and Fulgentius of Ruspe was that the Vandal takeover of Carthage and North Africa led to widespread destruction. However, recent archaeological investigations have challenged this assertion. Although Carthage's odeon was destroyed, the street grid remained the same, and some public buildings were renovated. The political centre of Carthage was Byrsa Hill. New industrial centres emerged in towns during this period. Historian Andy Merrills uses the large amounts of African red slip ware discovered across the Mediterranean that dates from the Vandal period of North Africa to challenge the assumption that Vandal rule of North Africa was a time of economic instability. When the Vandals raided Sicily in 440, the Western Roman Empire was too preoccupied with war in Gaul to react. Theodosius II, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, dispatched an expedition to deal with the Vandals in 441, but it progressed only as far as Sicily. The Western Empire under Valentinian III secured peace with the Vandals in 442. Under the treaty, the Vandals gained Byzacena, Tripolitania, and part of Numidia and confirmed their control of Proconsular Africa. =The grain trade= Historians since Edward Gibbon have seen the capture of North Africa by the Vandals and Alans as the \\"deathblow\\" and \\"the greatest single blow\\" to the Western Roman Empire in its struggle to survive. Prior to the Vandals, northern Africa was prosperous and peaceful, requiring only a small percentage of the Roman Empire's military forces, and was an important source of taxes for the empire and grain for the city of Rome. The scholar Josephus in the 1st century CE said that North Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year, with the other four months of needed grain coming from Egypt.Rickman, G.E. (1980), \\"The Grain Trade under the Roman Empire,\\" Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol 36, The Seaborne Commerce of Ancient Rome, p. 264. Downloaded from JSTOR; Heather, pp. 275-276. The Roman need for grain from North Africa may have declined by the 5th century because the population of the city of Rome had fallen, and the number of Roman soldiers had decreased. Moreover, the 442 treaty between Rome and the Vandals seems to have ensured that grain shipments continued.Linn, pp. 298-299, 317-321 However, in terms of halting hostilities between Rome and the Vandals, that treaty was honored more in the breach than in the observance, and the Romans placed a high priority on recovering North Africa and regaining their control of grain from the Vandal Kingdom. The location of Carthage, the Vandal capitol. = Sack of Rome = Sack of Rome, by Karl Briullov. The peace treaty of 442 did not halt Vandal raids in the western Mediterranean. Over the next 35 years, Gaiseric used his large naval fleet to loot the coasts of both the Eastern and Western Empires. After Attila the Hun's death in 453, however, the Romans turned their attention back to the Vandals, who were now in control of some of the richest lands formerly ruled by Rome. In an effort to bring the Vandals into the fold of the Empire, Valentinian III offered the hand of his daughter, Eudocia, in marriage to Gaiseric's son Huneric when both Eudocia and Huneric were children. However, they had not yet wed when in 455, Valentinian III was murdered by accomplices of the usurper Petronius Maximus, who sought control of the Empire. Maximus immediately married Valentinian's widow, the Empress Licinia Eudoxia, and he also canceled Eudocia's betrothal to Huneric and married her instead to his own son, Palladius. Diplomacy between Rome and the Vandal Kingdom broke down. Eudoxia wrote a letter to Gaiseric, begging him to come to her aid. Claiming that the broken betrothal between Huneric and Eudocia invalidated his peace treaty with Valentinian, Gaiseric sacked Rome, rescuing Eudoxia, Eudocia, and Eudoxia's younger daughter Placidia (the latter was married to the future unrecognised emperor Olybrius). Maximus and Palladius were killed by an angry mob while fleeing the city. The chronicler Prosper of AquitaineProsper's account of the event was followed by his continuator in the 6th century, Victor of Tunnuna, a great admirer of Leo and quite willing to adjust a date or bend a point (Steven Muhlberger, \\"Prosper's Epitoma Chronicon: was there an edition of 443?\\" Classical Philology 81.3 (July 1986), pp 240-244). offers the only 5th-century report that on 2 June 455, Pope Leo the Great received Gaiseric and implored him to abstain from murder and destruction by fire, and to be satisfied with pillage. The Vandals departed with countless valuables, including the spoils of the Temple in Jerusalem booty brought to Rome by Titus. Eudoxia and her daughters were taken to Carthage, where Eudocia married Huneric shortly thereafter. =Later years= Map of the operations of the Vandalic War. The Vandal sack of Rome, piracy in the Mediterranean, and the Roman need to recover control of the grain trade made the destruction of the Vandal Kingdom a priority for the Roman Empire. The Western Roman Emperor Majorian began to organize an offensive in the summer of 458. A maritime force staged from Cartagena in Spain would take Mauretania and then march on Carthage, while a simultaneous assault, commanded by Marcellinus, would retake Sicily. The Emperor assembled his fleet in 460, but Gaiseric learned of the impending assault and \\"put a scorched earth policy into effect in Mauretania - scouring the land and poisoning the wells in advance of the planned imperial offensive.\\" In addition, Gaiseric led his own fleet against Majorian's force and defeated the Romans at Cartagena. In 468, both the Western and Eastern Empires attempted to conquer Africa again with the \\"most ambitious campaign ever launched against the Vandal state.\\" Primary sources suggest that the fleet numbered 1,113 ships and carried 100,000 men, but this figure has been rejected by modern historiography, with Heather suggesting 30,000 troops and 50,000 soldiers and sailors combined, based on 16,000 Roman soldiers conveyed on 500 ships in 532. Andy Merrills and Richard Miles have asserted that the operation was undoubtedly extensive and \\"deserves admiration for its logistical brilliance.\\" At a naval battle in Cape Bon, Tunisia, the Vandals destroyed the Western fleet and part of the Eastern fleet through the use of fire ships. Following up the attack, the Vandals tried to invade the Peloponnese but were driven back by the Maniots at Kenipolis with heavy losses. In retaliation, the Vandals took 500 hostages at Zakynthos, hacked them to pieces, and threw the pieces overboard on the way back to Carthage. In the 470s, the Romans abandoned their policy of war against the Vandals. The Western Germanic general Ricimer reached a treaty with the Vandals, and in 476 Gaiseric was able to conclude a \\"perpetual peace\\" with Constantinople. Relations between the two states assumed a veneer of normality. From 477 onward, the Vandals produced their own coinage, although it was restricted to bronze and silver low-denomination coins. Although the low-denomination imperial money was replaced, the high-denomination was not, demonstrating in the words of Merrills \\"reluctance to usurp the imperial prerogative\\". Gaiseric died on 25 January 477, 88 years of age. According to the law of succession which he had promulgated, the oldest male member of the royal house was to succeed. Thus he was succeeded by his son Huneric (477‚Äì484), who at first tolerated Nicene Christians, owing to his fear of Constantinople, but after 482 began to persecute Manichaeans and Niceanian.Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, \\"Vandals\\". Gunthamund (484‚Äì496), his cousin and successor, sought internal peace with the Niceanians and ceased persecution once more. Externally, Vandal power had been declining since Gaiseric's death; Gunthamund lost large parts of Sicily to Theodoric's Ostrogoths and had to withstand increasing pressure from the native Berbers. Gunthamund's successor Thrasamund (496‚Äì523) was a religious fanatic and hostile to Niceanians, but he contented himself with bloodless persecutions. = Conquest by the Eastern Roman Empire = Thrasamund's successor Hilderic (523‚Äì530) was the Vandal king who was most tolerant of Trinitarian Christians. He granted religious freedom, and consequently Catholic synods were once more held in North Africa. However, he had little interest in war and left it to his nephew Hoamer. When Hoamer suffered a defeat by the Berbers, the Arian faction within the royal family led a revolt, and Hoamer's cousin Gelimer (530‚Äì534) became king. Hilderic, Hoamer, and their relatives were thrown into prison. In 533, Hilderic was executed when the Byzantine army approached Carthage. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I declared war, with the stated intention of restoring Hilderic to the Vandal throne. While an expedition was en route, Gelimer's brother Tzazo led a large part of the Vandal army and navy to Sardinia to deal with a rebellion by the Gothic nobleman Godas. This enabled the armies of the Byzantine Empire, commanded by Belisarius, to land unopposed from Carthage. Gelimer quickly assembled an army and met Belisarius at the Battle of Ad Decimum, in the Vandals were prevailing until Gelimer's brother Ammatas and nephew Gibamund fell in battle. Gelimer then lost heart and fled. Belisarius quickly took Carthage as the surviving Vandals fought on. On December 15, 533, Gelimer and Belisarius clashed again at the Battle of Tricamarum, some from Carthage. Again, the Vandals fought well but broke, this time when Tzazo fell in battle. Belisarius quickly advanced to Hippo, second city of the Vandal Kingdom. In 534 Gelimer, besieged at Mount Pappua by the Herulian General Pharas, surrendered to the Byzantines, ending the Kingdom of the Vandals. The Vandals' territory in North Africa (which is now northern Tunisia and eastern Algeria) became a Byzantine province. The best Vandal warriors were formed into five cavalry regiments, known as Vandali Iustiniani, and stationed on the Persian frontier. Some entered the private service of Belisarius. Gelimer himself was honourably treated and granted large estates in Galatia, where he lived to be an old man. He was also offered the rank of patrician but refused it because he was not willing to convert from Arianism to Nicene Christianity. Most Vandals remained in North Africa and were absorbed into the native Berber population. In the words of historian Roger Collins: \\"The remaining Vandals were then shipped back to Constantinople to be absorbed into the imperial army. As a distinct ethnic unit they disappeared.\\" Religious policies From their invasion of North Africa in 429 onward, the Vandals, who were predominantly followers of Arianism, persecuted Nicene Christians. This persecution began with the unfettered violence inflicted against the church during Gaiseric's invasion, but, with the legitimization of the Vandal Kingdom, the oppression became entrenched in \\"more coherent religious policies.\\" Victor of Vita's History of the Vandal Persecution details the \\"wicked ferocity\\" inflicted against church property and attacks against \\"many‚Ä¶ distinguished bishops and noble priests\\" in the first years of the conquest; similarly, Bishop Honoratus writes that \\"before our eyes men are murdered, women raped and we ourselves collapse under torture.\\" Citing these and other corroborating sources, Merrills has argued that there is \\"little doubt\\" that the initial invasion was \\"brutally violent.\\" He has also argued along with Richard Miles that the Vandals initially targeted the Nicene Church for financial rather than religious reasons, seeking to rob it of its wealth. Once Gaiseric secured his hold over Numidia and Mauretania in the treaty of 435, he worked \\"to destroy the power of the Nicene church in his new territories by seizing the basilicas of three of the most intransigent bishops and expelling them from their cities.\\" Similar policies continued with the capture of Carthage in 439 as the Vandal king made efforts to simultaneously advance the Arian church and oppress Nicene practices. Heather notes that four major churches within the city walls were confiscated for the Arians, and a ban was imposed on all Nicene services in areas in which Vandals settled; Gaiseric also had Quodvultdeus, Bishop of Carthage, and many of his clergy exiled from Africa and refused \\"to allow replacements to be ordained‚Ä¶ so that the total number of Nicene bishops within the Vandal kingdom suffered a decline.\\" Laymen were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their property. However, diplomatic considerations took precedence over religious policy. In 454, at the request of Valentinian III, Gaiseric installed Deogratius as the new Bishop of Carthage, a position that had been left empty since Quodvultdeus's departure. Heather argues that this accession was intended to improve Vandal‚ÄìRoman relations as Gaiseric negotiated the marriage of his son Huneric to the Princess Eudocia. However, after Valentinian was killed and Vandal relations with Rome and Constantinople worsened, Gaiseric renewed his oppressive religious policies, leaving the bishopric empty once again when Deogratius died in 457. Heather has argues that Gaiseric's promotion of the Arian church, with the accompanying persecution of the Nicene church, had political motivations. He notes a \\"key distinction\\" between \\"the anti-Nicene character\\" of Gaiseric's actions in Proconsularis and the rest of his kingdom; persecution was most intense when it was in proximity to his Arian followers. Heather suggests that Arianism was a means for Gaiseric to keep his followers united and under control; wherever his people interacted with Niceanians, this strategy was threatened. However, Heather also notes that \\"personal belief must have also played a substantial role in Gaiseric's decision making.\\" Huneric, Gaiseric's son and successor, continued and intensified the repression of the Nicene church and attempted to make Arianism the primary religion in North Africa; indeed, much of Victor of Vita's narrative focuses on the atrocities and persecutions committed during Huneric's reign. Priests were forbidden to practice the liturgy, Homoousian books were destroyed, and almost 5,000 bishops were exiled into the desert. Violence continued with \\"men and women‚Ä¶ subjected to a series of torments including scalping, forced labour and execution by sword and fire.\\" In 483, Huneric issued a royal edict commanding all Catholic bishops in Africa to attend a debate with Arian representatives. In the aftermath of this conference, he forbade Nicene clergy from assembling or carrying out baptisms or ordinations and ordered all Nicene churches to be closed and Nicene property confiscated. These churches were then turned over for the royal fisc or for Arian clerical use. While primary sources reveal little about Gunthamund's religious policies, existing evidence does suggest that the new king was \\"generally better disposed towards the Catholic faith than his predecessor [Huneric] had been\\" and maintained a period of tolerance. Gunthamund ended the desert exile of a bishop called Eugenius and also restored the Nicene shrine of Saint Agileus in Carthage. Thrasamund ended his late brother's policies of tolerance when he ascended to the throne in 496. He reintroduced \\"harsh measures against the Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy\\" but \\"worked to maintain positive relations with the Romano-African lay elite,\\" his intention being to split the loyalties of the two groups. Except for Hilderic, most Vandal kings persecuted Niceanians (as well as Donatists) to a greater or lesser extent, banning conversion for Vandals and exiling bishops.

Biography  The Atanasijeviƒá family was of Tzintzar origins and in kinship with the Karamata family from Zemun. Slavka was born in Osijek, Croatia, a daughter of the Osijek physician and cultural activist Vasilije Atanasijeviƒá (Be≈°enovo, Srem, 1795 ‚Äì Osijek, 1877), a collaborator and friend of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá. Her mother, Persida von Duka, was from Arad (Romania). Slavka's sister, Marija (Osijek, 1842 ‚Äì Sombor, 1891), married Veselinoviƒá, was a painter. Slavka and Marija had five more siblings, three brothers and two sisters, all of whom were educated. Since her childhood, Atanasijeviƒá received general and music education from her father. She studied mainly privately with respected Osijek pedagogues: sciences with Dr. ≈Ωivko Vukasoviƒá (1829‚Äì1874), zoologist and entomologist, a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb, and drawing with the painter Hugo Conrad von Hoetzendorf (1807‚Äì1869). Beside her native language, she was fluent in German, French, and Hungarian languages. Slavka Atanasijeviƒá studied music privately in Osijek: voice with Ivan Nepomuk Hummel (1820‚Äì1896), violin with director of the Croatian Vocal Society \\"Linden\\" (\\"Lipa\\") Theodor Machulka (1848‚Äì1920), and piano with ƒêuro Trischler. She specialized in piano performing on her own and during her studies in Vienna. Effectively self- taught, Atanasijeviƒá acquired composition skills through the renowned textbook by Adolf Bernhard Marx (1795‚Äì1866) Theory and Practice of Musical Composition (Die Lehre von der musikalischen Komposition praktisch-theoretisch, I‚ÄìIV, 1837‚Äì1847). She began her concert career in 1874 at social and charity events where she performed popular pieces by other composers as well as her own. Atanasijeviƒá gave concerts in Sombor, Osijek (with the ‚ÄûLinden‚Äù Vocal Society), Novi Sad, Subotica, Zagreb, Pest, Graz, and Vienna. She also performed at various spas in Austria (e.g., Bad Aussee, Gleichenberg, Karlsbad, Marienbad, and Bad Ischl). Following her unfortunate marriage to the Polish painter Andrzej Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, who was on duty as a land surveyor in cadastre registry in Bosnia, she withdrew from the public spotlight in 1882, and died in Vienna, aged 47. As a composer and pianist, Slavka Atanasijeviƒá received recognition from pedagogues, artists, and critics of her time (e.g., Franjo Kuhaƒç and Antun Schwartz). While she started composing in her early childhood, only three of her compositions, piano variations and fantasies on folk and town melodies, survived. Influences of virtuoso, salon-style of Alexander Dreyschock and Franz Liszt in Atanasijeviƒá‚Äôs works were noted in articles by music critics and historiographers. The partially preserved musical legacy of Slavka Atanasijeviƒá is kept in the archives of the Croatian Vocal Society \\"Linden\\" in Osijek. The biographical materials about Atanasijeviƒá, collected by Franjo Kuhaƒç for his unpublished Biographical and musicological dictionary (Biografski i muzikografski slovnik) are located at the Archive of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb.

After his death, he was succeeded as Grand Master by his brother, Nicolas Cotoner. During Cotoner's reign, the Order of Malta sent troops to Candia, besieged by the Ottomans. Reign as Grand Master Mattia Preti started work in St. John's Co-Cathedral during Raphael's reign. During his 3-year reign, the Order of Malta sent reinforcements to support Venetians besieged by the Ottomans in Candia (Candia eventually fell after a siege lasting more than two decades in September 1669, almost 6 years after Cotoner's death). To show their gratitude and appreciation, the Republic of Venice passed a decree allowing members of the Order to appear armed within the Republic's dominions, something which had never been granted to the Republic's subjects themselves. It was during Raphael's tenure as Grand Master that the Italian Baroque artist Mattia Preti started work in Valletta's St. John's Co-Cathedral.

Rebuilt in 1936 with marine railways to launch rescue surfboats, the historic facility was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 30, 1979. The station continues to function as an important asset of the United States Coast Guard in the Coast Guard Group/Air Station Humboldt Bay. History =Early history= Humboldt Bay was listed as one of the most dangerous harbor entrances in California due to the narrow wide channel with tidal currents and shifting sandbars plus unpredictable weather with high winds and heavy fog. In 1851, the United States Congress appropriated $15,000 for the Humboldt Harbor Light which entered service in 1856. The vegetable oil burning light shone from a tall tower whose keeper lived in a Cape Cod style house at the base. The first keeper in 1856 was J. Johnson whose wife, Sara, operated the light after his death in 1859 until 1863. Fog, however, kept the light from being seen well and so other sites were sought. The lighthouse was damaged in 1877 and 1882 by earthquakes and in 1885 by a flood and was abandoned in 1892, when the entire facility, including the Fresnel lens, was relocated to the Table Bluff Light on October 31. Years later, the top of the tower was found in the sand and relocated to the Humboldt Bay Maritime Museum. Other aids to navigation including bells on boats and fog whistles, including one on the north side of the channel, were in operation by at least 1908. The fog keeper and assistant keeper lived at the actual station. There was nearby housing for their families although none of the buildings remains. Humboldt and six other Life Saving Stations were built in California. The others were (in alphabetical order) Arena Cove, Fort Point, Golden Gate Park, Point Reyes, Point Bonita, and Southside (in San Francisco). The entire Pacific coast had 20 Life Saving Service stations. =Paysonville= In 1883 Alexander Ballantyne and Albert Henry Payson, working for the United States Lighthouse Board designed a wharf, stone-cutter's shed, mess hall and housing adjacent to the Humboldt Harbor Lighthouse to prepare and dress hundreds of 2.5 ton granite boulders transported from the Mad River Quarry on railroad flatbed cars transported on barges across the bay. After the stones were cut precisely to full scale templates with a mortise and tenon such that each would fit only one adjacent block precisely, they were wrapped in rope netting, loaded on a narrow gauge railway by steam-driven crane and moved to the wharf from which they were loaded by another steam crane to specially fitted steamer ships to be taken to form the foundation of the St. George Reef Light, on the site of the fatal Brother Jonathan wreck offshore Crescent City, California. It cost $117,000 to quarry and ship, operate the facility and pay the help in 1884, a figure which was higher than expected due to the non-stop rain. The quarry operated from 1884 to 1891, commanded by Chief Payson from 1887 after whom the settlement was named. Paysonville remained idle from 1891 until World War II when it was turned into a Navy seaplane base and is now the Samoa Boat Basin. =First station= Emblem of the U.S. Life-Saving Service In 1878, Congress authorized the United States Life-Saving Service although stations were to be built only where navigation conditions were extremely hazardous. The Humboldt Bay station was the second to be built in California after that in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. It began operating in November 1878 just to the south of Paysonville. The original station was to the north side of the present building and tasked to rescue wrecked and stranded ships and patrol the beaches. The station was manned by a keeper and six volunteers. Later \\"surfmen\\" would be hired, living at the station which could also house rescue victims. After the 1892 closure of the Humboldt Harbor Light, surfmen used the tower of the old lighthouse as a lookout until the tower collapsed in 1933. By 1896 there were eight surfman each working a six-day week, and in 1901 a telephone was installed to assist in rescue work. In 1910, the first power- driven boat was used for rescue on Humboldt Bay although hand-rowed boats were still used. =Second station= In 1936, as part of the national New Deal upgrade of Coast Guard facilities, a new Humboldt Bay Station was built to replace the original. The U.S. Coast Guard, Civil Engineer's Office, Washington, D.C., drew up the plans of the building dated February 1936; less than a year and $78,000 later, the building was occupied in January 1937. Chief Garner Churchill commanded the station from 1937 until he retired in 1966. During his tenure, more than 300 people were saved by the station. The new station housed and fed a 25-man crew and had living quarters for the Chief and his family. Two marine railways were built, originally without handrails, from the bay side boat room to seven feet below mean low tide line. These permitted surf boats to be launched rapidly into sheltered water, and equally important hauled out of the water, sometimes full of rescued people. During Prohibition, the station stopped rum runners. After the Japanese submarine I-17 shelled the offshore Cape Mendocino killing five sailors on December 20, 1941, the station was charged with foot and horse patrols operating along the coast and beaches. During World War II, a Navy seaplane base and Blimp facility for K-type depth charge blimps were built to the north of the station at Paysonville. After World War II, the fog station closed and the facility was removed. The blimp station became part of the Eureka Municipal Airport and the circular blimp pads are still visible in aerial photos. =Rescues= Crew from the Humboldt Bay Life-Saving station rescuing sailors from the wrecked U.S.S. Milwaukee, January 13, 1917. Note how many sailors line the rails. In the 28 years from 1850 to 1878, nearly two dozen ships were wrecked either on or near the bar at the mouth of Humboldt Bay, California. Notable rescues include: *Passenger Steamer Corona 1906, all 96 passengers and 60 crew saved, two surfmen lost. *U.S. Navy H-3 submarine grounded offshore with 27 crew and live torpedoes on December 14, 1916. Local contractor Mercer-Fraser later rolled the submarine over the sand dunes and back into the water on giant logs. *U.S.S. Milwaukee sent to recover the H-3 was also stranded on January 13, 1917. 421 enlisted and 17 officers were saved. *Yacht Rena swamped on June 23, 1939, within sight of the bar. Four were saved and the Chief and his crew received the Silver Medal, the second highest award for lifesaving for the rescue. *The Brookley, the Tiverton and the Yellowstone, were three schooners which stranded, although all their passengers were saved. Buildings and railway The Station received National Register status for significance in helping navigation and saving lives in the area of Humboldt Bay. It is considered the best example of 'Roosevelt Style,' a Colonial Revival station design that was used across the country from the late 1920s through the late 1940s, in the western United States. The Station has two long marine railways from the Station's rollup doors to below the low tide mark in the water to launch heavy surfboats. Marine railways were built starting in the early 20th century but became obsolete when larger steel lifeboats came into use in the 1970s. They represent the only set still in a functional Coast Guard Building on the Pacific coast. Since 1994, the marine railway has displayed Motor Lifeboat #36515, which was decommissioned in 1982, donated to the Humboldt Bay Maritime Museum and returned as a monument. It has been used \\"from the late 1950s to the early 1980s.\\" Minor alterations were made to the west facade of the building in 1977, but the other faces are either not modified, or only slightly from the original plans. The interior was extensively altered from working spaces such as the boat room and a garage to offices, reception and classroom space. Upstairs the individual bedrooms have been combined to a single room and the mess hall and kitchens were also turned into office spaces. Current use The Station continues in active use by the U.S. Coast Guard. Before 1977, summer air rescue in the area was done from the Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco, but the two-hour response time was too long for victims floundering in the typically 40‚Äì50 ¬∞F water so, on June 24, 1977, the Coast Guard Group / Air Station Humboldt Bay was commissioned with headquarters at a new $3.5 million facility at the Arcata-Eureka Airport in McKinleyville, California. The old Life-Saving station is an active part of the new search and rescue infrastructure.

He was involved in mining ventures in Derbyshire and Cornwall, and in assaying the black ore, thought to be gold-bearing, brought back to England from Baffin Island by Martin Frobisher. He later practised as a physician in London, where he enjoyed a mixed reputation, and is said to have attended Elizabeth I when she contracted smallpox. He is alluded to in several literary works published during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Early career Derwent near Duffield, where Kranich erected a watermill for his lead mining operations in 1554 Kranich's surname is spelled variously in extant documents; contemporary spellings include Cranye, Cranach, Cranicke, Cranegh, Craneigh, Craneighe, Craunighe and Kranyke. He is also referred to in some documents as 'Burchard', as though it were his surname, and later as 'Doctor Burcot'. He is said to have been born in southern Germany, and according to Bennell his surname suggests that he came from Kronach in upper Franconia near the Erzgebirge, a mining area. He came to England during the reign of Mary I, and is first heard of in the State Papers on 3 June 1553 ('The suit of Burghard touching the mines'). According to Wallis he was perhaps a Catholic attempting to avoid the vicissitudes of the Protestant Reformation on the continent. On 29 May 1554 he was given licence for twenty years to 'mine, break open ground, melt, divide (i.e. separate metals) and search for all manner of metals' in accordance with an indenture which he had entered into on 18 May of that year. The grant included a prohibition preventing others from making use of his methods for a six-year period.Committee of the Association of American Law Schools, Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1909), Vol. 3, Chapter 53: Hulme, Edward Wyndham, 'The Early History of the English Patent System 1' Retrieved 7 November 2013 He initially worked at Makeney in Derbyshire, where he erected a watermill on the opposite bank to Milford, close to the current bridge, north of Duffield, and built a smeltmill, the first of its kind, to extract lead from ore obtained at Burrel Edge, that is Barrel EdgeFord TD.

Depositions taken in 1582 state that he left Derbyshire in 1554, having heard of better mining opportunities in Cornwall and Devon. In Cornwall he rented the former Benedictine priory of St Cyric and St Juliett near St Veep,'Parishes: St Veep ‚Äì Zennor', Magna Britannia: volume 3: Cornwall (1814), pp. 317‚Äì329 Retrieved 7 November 2013. and at a cost of ¬£300 converted a 14th- century flour mill at nearby Lerryn to a smelting house for silver-bearing ore.St Cadix ‚Äì Penpoll Creek Retrieved 7 November 2013. To finance the enterprise he was granted a loan by the Duchy of Cornwall. In 1557 John Trelawny, John Tredeneck and Thomas Treffry were directed to take charge of the mines Kranich had discovered, and the Duchy of Cornwall advanced a loan of ¬£600 to finance the enterprise. Although considerable lead was produced, the anticipated production of copper and silver did not materialise. The lead was sent to Treffry, who died in 1563, at which time it passed into the hands of his son, John, who refused to deliver it to Carnsew and Tredeneck, who had taken over the mines and were responsible for repayment of the loan. The outcome of a Chancery suit for recovery of the lead is not known.Carnsew, William (by 1497‚Äì1570), of Bokelly in St. Kew, Cornwall, History of Parliament Retrieved 7 November 2013.Between 1556 and 1583 at least 2,000 ounces of silver were smelted, with ore coming from Tregardock mine and mines in Padstow, St Delion, Portysyke, Peran and St Columb; . At some point Kranich is said to have been arrested for debt, and imprisoned in the Marshalsea in London, perhaps in connection with this loan. During his years in Cornwall, Lewis credits Kranich with introducing useful innovations at Sir Francis Godolphin's tin works, among them the hydraulic stamp mill and improved methods of dressing ore, as well as the use of charcoal as fuel for smelting instead of the traditional peat. However Lewis also allows for the possibility that these innovations should be credited to Daniel Hoechstetter. Richard Carew, on the other hand, mentions the 'rubble of certain mines and remains of a fining house' which demonstrate Kranich's 'vain endeavour in seeking of silver ore' in Cornwall. After Kranich had left Cornwall, a 16-page memorandum was prepared by William Carnsew 'relating to silver and lead mines in Cornwall and activities of Dr Burchard Kranich' in response to a request for information about the potential profitability of the mines from Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele.Edgecombe, Peter (c.1536‚Äì1608), of Mount Edgcumbe and Cotehele, Cornwall, History of Parliament Retrieved 7 November 2013. Among the matters covered in the memorandum were 'the many disputes and arguments Kranich had with his sponsors'.Memorandum on silver and lead mines in Cornwall ME/2508, Cornwall Record Office Retrieved 7 November 2013. According to Wallis, Kranich's mining enterprises in the West Country were ultimately a failure, and he moved to London. On 14 June 1561 Kranich was granted denization by Elizabeth I. In London he practised medicine, and became known as 'Dr Burcot'. His abilities as a physician were well thought of by some, including John Somers,Clerks of the Signet c.1539‚Äì1660, Institute of Historical Research Retrieved 7 November 2013. who wrote from court to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton on 29 August 1562 that 'My Lady Marquis' was seriously ill with jaundice, and that although some physicians had despaired of her, 'Burcot, the Dutchman, at a pinch is like to do some good if he may be suffered'. In October 1562 the Queen was stricken with smallpox, and several modern sources state that she was cured by Kranich. The story runs that Kranich was summoned when the Queen first fell ill on 10 October. Kranich diagnosed smallpox, whereupon she 'dismissed him as a fool'. However, by 16 October she was so grievously ill that she lapsed into unconsciousness, giving rise to alarmed talk among her councillors of the succession. Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, is said to have forced Kranich, 'some said at the point of a dagger', to resume his treatment of the Queen. Kranich ordered that she be given a potion he had devised, and be wrapped in red flannel and placed close to the fire. Within two hours the Queen is said to have regained consciousness. According to Foot, she rewarded Kranich with a grant which was stopped by Sir William Cecil; however other sources note that in 1562 he was given 100 marks. Doubt has been cast on this story, however. Bennell terms the tale that Hundson threatened Kranich with a dagger 'a later invention', and Brooks notes that the ultimate source of the story of Kranich's cure of the Queen is the memoirs of Sir Richard Carew, son of the author of The Survey of Cornwall (1602). Carew, writing after 1628, recalled a dinner at his father's home in 1601 or thereabouts at which his father and three other kinsmen of his recounted stories about Kranich, including his treatment of the Queen's smallpox. But Erickson notes that there are 'major discrepancies' between Carew's account, written decades after the fact, and the Spanish ambassador De Quadra's dispatches at the time; she concludes that while it is possible that Burcot treated the Queen for smallpox, Carew's narrative cannot be accepted as accurate. John Nettleton also recorded that Kranich was sent by the Queen to treat Elizabeth Plantagenet (d.1569), the daughter of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, in her final illness.Elizabeth Plantagenet (c.1521‚Äì1569), A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: P, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 6 November 2013. Kranich is said to have collaborated with Christopher Schutz in developing the use of calamine lotion in the treatment of burns from the furnaces used in smelting. On 22 June 1563 he was given license for twenty years to make engines 'for the draining of waters' according to a new design he had lately perfected. His licence was similar to an earlier grant to John Medley, but Kranich was given additional powers involving drainage in old and abandoned mines. Final years Martin Frobisher, who is said to have favoured Kranich In 1573 Richard Eden, in the course of requesting licence from the Queen to 'compound the admirable medicaments of Paracelsus from metals and minerals', cited a certain 'Brocardus' as one of a number of foreigners permitted to do so. According to Campbell, 'Brocardus' is a Latinized form of the name 'Burchard', and Eden's petition is therefore evidence that Kranich was engaged in alchemy in England at the time.Campbell, James Stuart, 'The Alchemical Patronage of Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley', PhD thesis, Victoria University of Wellington, 2009, p. 124 Retrieved 13 November 2013. In 1577 Kranich was involved in assaying the tons of black ore brought from Baffin Island during Sir Martin Frobisher's voyages to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 another German metallurgist working in England, Christopher Schutz, performed three 'great proofes' of the ore. Kranich and a Venetian metallurgist working in England, Giovanni Battista Agnello, were also brought in to assay the ore. Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Martin Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. Numerous documents survive showing Kranich's involvement in the assaying of the ore, including a letter of 26 November 1577 in which Kranich reported to Sir Francis Walsingham on the amount of gold found in his tests. Amid growing doubts about the value of the ore, Kranich insisted that it contained a significant amount of gold, and asked for ¬£200 and a daily wage of ¬£1 to refine it. He also designed a furnace for smelting the ore.Drawing of two furnaces, inscribed by Lord Burghley respectively 'Old Order' and 'Burchardes Furnise', MPF 1/304, National Archives Retrieved 6 November 2013. However the ore eventually turned out to be worthless iron pyrite, and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to ¬£50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok,PRO SP 12/122/62. one of the principal proponents of the Frobisher expeditions; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions. Although his reputation suffered, Kranich nonetheless appears to have survived the Frobisher debacle relatively unscathed. However investors, including a number of prominent courtiers,'East Indies: December 1577', Calendar of State Papers Colonial, East Indies, China and Japan, Volume 2: 1513‚Äì1616 (1864), pp. 27‚Äì30 Retrieved 4 November 2013. lost ¬£20,000, and the lawsuits which followed ruined Michael Lok. In 1578 he is said to have been included in a list of Papists. Kranich made his will on 7 October 1578. The chief beneficiary was his wife, Agnes, who was to have his house in St Clement's churchyard near Temple Bar, London, and, after payment of his just debts, the proceeds of the sale of his lands and tenements in Holborn in the parish of St Giles in the Fields, as well as the residue of his goods and chattels after the payment of legacies to the poor and to his servants. By a codicil dated 19 October he bequeathed to one of his servants, William Deane, any proceeds in excess of ¬£700 received from the sale of his lands in Holborn as well as his medical books and instruments. A silver bowl which had been given him by 'my Lord', went to another servant. He was buried at St Clement Danes on 22 October 1578. On 21 November 1578 probate was granted to his sole executrix, his widow Agnes. Marriage and issue He married a wife named Agnes, about whom nothing further is known, by whom he had a daughter, Susan, who was buried at St Clement Danes on 20 September 1578. According to William Fleetwood, his daughter's death hastened Kranich's own end. Allusions to Kranich in Elizabethan and Jacobean literature familiars Kranich is alluded to, both favourably and unfavourably, in published works by several Elizabethan and Jacobean authors. He is satirised under the anagram 'Dr Tocrub' in the 1573 and 1578 editions of William Bullein's A Dialogue Against the Fever Pestilence, although there is no Dr Tocrub in the original edition of 1564. In The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), Reginald Scot disparagingly described Kranich's purchase, for monetary gain, of a familiar spirit from a juggler and conjurer called Feats:According to Foot, Kranich was both a fortune teller and a healer, these powers being linked to his having a familiar, and is said to have cured William Mohun and Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon. > And though Saul were bewitched and blinded in the matter, yet doubtless a > wise man would have perchance espied her knavery. Methinks Saul was brought > to this witch (i.e. the Witch of Endor) much after the manner that Doctor > Burcot was brought to Feats, who sold Master Doctor a familiar, whereby he > thought to have wrought miracles, or rather to have gained good store of > money. Gabriel Harvey was also critical of Kranich. In a marginal note in his copy of Georg Meier's In Iudaeorum Medicastrorum Calumnias (1570), he compared Kranich to the Queen's physician, Doctor Lopez, whom he termed 'none of the learnedest or expertest physicians in the court, but one that maketh as great account of himself as the best'. Harvey added: 'Doctor Burcot was in a manner such another; who so bold as blind Bayard?'. In Kind-Heart's Dream (1593) Henry Chettle featured Dr Burcot ('though a stranger, yet in England for physic famous') as one of the five apparitions who appear to him in his dream. Thomas Nashe also alluded to Kranich in the dedicatory epistle of Have With You To Saffron Walden (1596): > Memorandum, I frame my whole book in the nature of a dialogue, much like > Bullen and his Doctor Tocrub. Thomas Deloney referred to him in his epistle to the readers in the second part of The Gentle Craft: > Notwithstanding, if you find yourself overcharged with melancholy, you may > perhaps have here a fit medicine to purge that humour by conferring in this > place with Doctor Burket. Gervase Markham considered Kranich an excellent physician, and in the 1631 edition of The English Housewife specifically mentioned 'Dr Burket and Dr Bomelius' as a source for the prescriptions in his first chapter, stating that they had given a manuscript containing the remedies to 'a great worthy Countess of this land'. According to Best, however, there is no evidence that either Kranich or Bomelius contributed to the manuscript upon which Markham relied for his prescriptions.

Chartered by the New Zealand Company for this voyage the ship was carrying Scottish settlers, under the charge of the Rev. Dr. Thomas Burns. Construction The Philip Laing was a wooden barque rigged sailing ship of 459 tons. The ship was approximately 55 metres long with a beam of 12 metres with square rigs on the foremast and mainmast and fore and aft rigging on the mizzen mast.Church, page 86. The ship was built with the yard number 167 by the James Laing yard at Deptford in Sutherland for Laing & Ridley of Liverpool. She was launched on 23 July 1846. Service history =Voyage to Otago= On 22 September 1847 an advertisement was posted by William Cargill of the New Zealand Company calling for tenders for two vessels of not less than 450, nor more than 650 tons, to transport immigrants to Otago in New Zealand one of which was to sail from London, and one from Glasgow about 30 October. Merrington, pages 147, 158-170. The Philip Laing was chartered from Laing & Ridley for approximately ‚Ç§1,800 to deliver immigrants from Glasgow. The other chartered ship was the John Wickliffe. The price for passage varied from 16 guineas for steerage, 20 guineas for a cabin and from 35 to 60 guineas for a full cabin. The ship was under command of Captain Andrew Jamieson Elles with Surgeon-Supt Dr Robert Ramsay responsible for the health of the crew and passengers. The immigrants were under the charge of the Rev. Dr. Thomas Burns who was to become one of the leaders of the new Dunedin settlement. The voyage of the settlers was extensively recorded in a diary kept by Burns. Most of the immigrants boarded in Greenock on 20 November 1847 and it left port on the 26 November 1847 under the tow of a steamer as far as the Tail of the Bank, where it anchored while the captain and company representatives went back on shore. On 27 November the captain returned and ordered the anchor up at 2 p.m. Once underway the wind soon died away, and at midnight the ship was only three miles below the Clock Lighthouse. On 28 November the ship anchored in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde. The next day there was a suitable wind but the ship couldn‚Äôt take immediate advantage of it, as it was necessary to trim the ship, overhaul some of the stores and source some water casks from shore. Thomas Burns took the opportunity to arrange for timber to be purchased and bought on board so that it could be used to enclose the open galley used to prepare the food for the steerage passengers. Not only was the existing arrangement uncomfortable for the cooks but it was very difficult to start the fires. While a violent storm prevented departure the ship lay in anchor in Lamlash Bay for 10 days before they managed to sail until worsening conditions again forced the ship to take shelter, this time in Milford Haven in Wales where they dropped anchor at 7 a.m. on 12 December. For eight days the ship lay at anchor during which time the passengers were able to make visits ashore. Burns also had a plumber make repairs on the ship, in the interests of the emigrants. Finally, the ship was able to depart on 20 December 1847 for New Zealand. The Philip Laing carried 26 crew, 247 emigrants, of which 12 were in cabins and 235 in steerage. Among the passengers were 93 children under 14 years of age. Steerage passengers were in one open cabin, 45 metres by 11 metres which was lined down each side with narrow bunks. Once underway the ship‚Äôs best day's run was 216 miles, which occurred on 24 February 1848. Other runs referred to include 172 miles,188 miles, 204 miles. The ship‚Äôs log records that at times it reached speeds of 9, 9¬Ω, and even 9¬æ knots.Brett, pages 80-85. The ship arrived at Port Chalmers in Otago Harbour on 15 April 1848 after a passage of 117 days. Here she found already anchored, the John Wickliffe, which had arrived three weeks earlier. Despite being somewhat smaller than the 662-ton John Wickliffe, the Philip Laing carried the majority of the immigrants (247, to John Wickliffe's 97), the larger ship having largely been laden with provisions for the new settlement. Following her arrival at Port Chalmers at least three of the ship‚Äôs crew deserted. Captain Elles married Clementine Burns the eldest daughter of the Thomas and Clementina Burns on 14 June 1848. The wedding certificate, signed by Thomas Burns, is preserved in the historic Bible of the Philip Laing, which is one of the most sacred relics in the Otago Early Settlers' Library. The courtship had begun on the voyage out. On 15 June the ship departed for Wellington arriving there on 19 June. =Subsequent service= Subsequently the Philip Laing was employed in 1854 as a transport in the Crimean War. In the following year, she was at Hobart, having brought out government stores and ammunition. From Hobart she sailed in ballast to Madras, India. In 1856 the ship brought out passengers and cargo from London to Wellington and Lyttelton. During the voyage she caught fire just after having called at Cape of Good Hope, but it was quickly extinguished. When leaving Lyttelton, bound for Singapore, she was struck by a squall and nearly capsized, but she righted herself, but not before it had been mistakenly reported that she had sunk with the loss of all of her crew. The ship made several trips between the United Kingdom and the East. On one occasion she was stranded on an island in the Java Sea for 36 hours, until the crew were able to refloat the ship. The Philip Laing is last mentioned in the Lloyd's Register with her captain given as J. S. Cadenhead. The ship ended its days as a coal hulk at Hong Kong. Notes References *.

At least 41 male high school students gang raped several middle school and high school girls over the course of 11 months. The case provoked controversy due to police mistreatment of the victims and lenient handling of the offenders. Assaults The victims lived in Ulsan and Changwon, while the perpetrators were from Miryang and Changwon. The perpetrators were initially believed to be members of a high school gang, but little evidence for this was found. They met the first 14-year-old victim over the phone. When she visited them, she was sexually assaulted, with the scene being filmed for blackmail. According to police, she was raped up to 10 times by 3 to 24 high school boys in each occurrence, with at least 41 boys being involved over 11 months. The girl was ordered to bring her 13-year-old sister and 16-year-old cousin to Miryang, where the cousin was raped. The original police report stated that the younger sister was sexually assaulted as well, but it may only have been a physical assault. The boys were also accused of raping two other girls. They allegedly extorted money from their victims. Press Coverage =Netizens' Anger= When the case was first reported on December 7, 2004, netizens started making posts criticizing the realities of education and stating that the perpetrators should be severely punished. Reports came out on December 8 that among the 41 perpetrators, an arrest warrant was applied for only three, to which netizens responded \\"arrest all of the perpetrators,\\" and they began to turn loose on the police. Aftermath After the sisters' aunt reported the rapes to the police, three of the boys were arrested. Following protests from the victims and public, another nine students were arrested, and 29 booked without detention. Family members of the perpetrators threatened the victims, warning them that they should \\"watch out from now on for reporting our sons to police.\\" In a television interview, a parent of one of the offenders stated, \\"Why should we feel sorry for the victim's family? Why don't you consider our suffering? Who can resist temptation when girls are trying to seduce boys? They should have taught their daughters how to behave in order to avoid this kind of accident.\\" One girl reportedly quit school after repeated visits and verbal attacks from the offenders' parents. A controversy erupted over allegations that the police had mistreated the victims, culminating in a candlelight vigil by 150 protesters. The victims had asked to be questioned by a female police officer, but their request was ignored. One police officer allegedly said to the victims, \\"Did you try to entice the guys? You ruined the reputation of Miryang. The boys who would lead the city were all arrested. What are you going to do? [...] I am afraid that my daughter will be like you.\\" Police also leaked enough information to the media for the victims to be identified. Furthermore, they forced the victims to identify the suspects face-to-face, rather than through a one-way mirror, with the officer asking the victim, \\"Did he insert [it] or not?\\" One of the victims had to be hospitalized for psychiatric treatment after these experiences. In August 2007, the Seoul High Court found the Miryang police officers guilty of negligence in protecting the victims, and ordered them to pay damages totaling 50 million won to two of the victims and their family. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of South Korea in June 2008, which set the compensation at 70 million won. Prosecutors sent most of the accused to Juvenile Court or dropped charges. Ten others were formally accused of group sexual assault, with prosecutors asking for two to four years imprisonment with a three-year stay of execution. Citing the young age of the offenders and the fact that some had already been admitted to college or hired for jobs, the judges refused the charges against even these ten, instead sending them to Juvenile Court. One factor in this decision was that the father of one of the victims formed an agreement with some of the offenders to plead for leniency after receiving a large sum of money. The father was an alcoholic who had divorced the victim's mother three years prior due to his domestic violence, but retained parental rights over his daughter, and persuaded her to accept the agreement. Ultimately, only five suspects were sent to a juvenile detention center, and none were convicted of criminal charges. In 2012, it emerged that the girlfriend of one of the perpetrators had become a police officer.

It is the cathedra of the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly and stands on the site of earlier chapels, which were the only Roman Catholic churches in Thurles. Following the English Reformation, many archdiocesan assets, including the cathedral at the Rock of Cashel were appropriated by the Established church. James Butler II (1774‚Äì91),Catholic Encyclopedia on being appointed by the Holy See moved his residence and cathedra from Cashel, favouring Thurles instead, where his successors continue to reign today. History Following the appropriation of church assets by the Church of Ireland, the majority population who adhered to Roman Catholicism were obliged to conduct their services elsewhere. From the time of the English Reformation onwards, those archbishops appointed by Rome had to make their throne in whichever house in Tipperary would hide them from the forces of the crown. This state of affairs continued until the late 18th century when some of the harsher provisions of the Penal Laws were relaxed. In 1857 Archbishop Patrick Leahy revealed his plan to replace the 'Big Chapel' which had been used as parish church in town since, with as Archbishop Bray explained \\"a cathedral worthy of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly\\" Work commenced in 1865, and the impressive Romanesque Revival architecture building, with its fa√ßade modelled on that of Pisa Cathedral, in Italy, was consecrated by Archbishop Thomas Croke on 21 June 1879. In the Church of Ireland, the historic cathedral on the Rock of Cashel was closed for worship in 1721. A new Georgian cathedral was completed in 1784 - St. Peter the Rock Cathedral, Cashel. Architecture The architect was J.J McCarthy; Barry McMullen was the main builder. J.C. Ashlin was responsible for the enclosing walls, railings and much of the finished work. The building has many architectural features, including an impressive rose window, a baptistery, and its most important possession is a tabernacle of Giacomo della Porta, a pupil of Michelangelo. The tower holds a set of eight bells, cast by John Murphy of Dublin in 1867. Originally intended to be hung for Change ringing, they are now unringable and chimed by hammers. It is thought that the tower is too weak, and the bells are hung too high in the tower, to deal with the forces associated with full-circle ringing.Core.ac.uk. (2018).

Wedel is an American anthropologist and university professor in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and a senior research fellow of the New America Foundation. She is the author of several books and many articlesArchive of all articles by Janine Wedel on the Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janine-r-wedel on some key systemic processes of the day. She is the first anthropologist to win the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order.  Biography  Wedel received a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley. She writes about governing, corruption, foreign aid, and influence elites through the lens of a social anthropologist. A university professor in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, Professor Wedel has contributed many articles and opinion pieces to more than a dozen major outlets, including The New York Times, The Financial Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal Europe, The Nation, The National Interest, The Los Angeles Times, The Christian Science Monitor, Salon, The Boston Globe, Washington Times, and Politico. Wedel has been a pioneer in applying anthropological insights to topics that are typically the terrain of political scientists, economists, or sociologists. After 25 years studying the role of informal systems in shaping communist and post-communist societies, Wedel also turned her attention to the United States, and has identified some parallels. Wedel's work has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Serbian, Hungarian, Danish, and Chinese. She has testified before Congressional committees and subcommittees and appeared on television and radio programs, including BBC, CNN, NPR, and PBS's Frontline, and associate- produced three PBS documentaries. Her stops on the university lecture circuit include Harvard, Yale, Columbia, MIT, Chicago, Berkeley, Princeton, Oxford, Central European University, and the Free University of Berlin. Her non- university audiences include TEDx (Berlin), the Bruno Kreisky Institute (Vienna), the European Journalism Observatory (Lugano, Switzerland), the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the National Press Club, and National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences workshops.

Shadow Elite - review of the book by Janine R. Wedel. Dec. 2011. http://janinewedel.info/ShadowElite_review_PAR2011.pdf Wedel explores the nontransparent ways in which, in her view, many of today's top power brokers operate. She explores what she suggests are the rules of the game these contemporary power elites are writing to benefit themselves and their social networks, and what she sees as the negative implications for democracy, the rule of law and the free market. Her work assesses what she claims is the significant extent to which the new rules take us beyond traditional corruption and conflict-of-interest ‚Äî and into an accountability- challenged era. Labeling the new breed of U.S. and international political operators \\"flexians,\\" Wedel finds these ultra-nimble players moving seamlessly among roles in government, business, think tanks, and media, advancing their own personal agendas and those of their associates (not the public and private organizations they are paid to serve), at the expense of democracy and accountability. Examples include retired four-star army general Barry R. McCaffrey and financial advisor Larry Summers, among many others, both foreign and domestic. By a flexian wearing several hats simultaneously (think tanker, retired military or government official, corporate representative, so-called \\"objective\\" expert), as did Barry R. McCaffrey in the run-up to the Iraq war, Wedel claims to show how a flexian can gain extraordinary insider knowledge and influence in order to custom-tailor a version of the \\"truth\\" benefitting the highest monetary bidder. In this way, flexians not only \\"co-opt public policy agendas\\" but \\"craft policy with their benefactors' purposes (monetary profit) in mind.\\" Some flexians work together in what Wedel calls ‚Äúflex nets,‚Äù close-knit networks that guard and share information. Like flexians, flex nets arose to fill a new niche. Wedel writes that, just as flexians cannot be reduced to mere lobbyists, neither can flex nets be reduced to interest groups, lobbies, old-boy networks, mafias, and other such groupings in society, government, and business. Like interest groups and lobbies, flex nets serve a long-established function in the modern state, mediating between official and private. And, like the mafia networks, flex nets have their tentacles in both state and private organizations. But, unlike mafia, many of their activities are not secret, but open, as members of flex nets make their case all over the airwaves. Thus while flex nets incorporate important aspects of other such groupings, they also differ from them in crucial ways‚Äîand those ways are precisely what make flex nets less visible and less accountable. Examples include the dozen or so players around neo-conservative cold-warrior Richard Perle, some of whom have long been working together in various incarnations for as long as 30 years to change American foreign policy according to their own ideology. Flexians and flex nets are the consequence of an unprecedented confluence of four transformational 20th and 21st century developments: government privatization, outsourcing and deregulation; the end of the Cold War; the growth of new information technologies; and \\"the embrace of 'truthiness.'\\" The book seems to be a work of investigative anthropology. In Wedel's view, today's American and, more generally, Western socio-economic and \\"democratic\\" political systems look increasingly similar to many communist and post-communist societies in the ways that they merge state and private power. In a 2009 Salon article she wrote: ‚ÄúThe way that government and business now interlock in the U.S., notably in the wake of Wall Street‚Äôs meltdown, is beginning to resemble the tangle of self-interested government- business ‚Äúclans‚Äù and other such informal networks that emerged during the East's transition to a market economy in the 1990s. I have come to this conclusion after spending the better part of three decades studying communist and post-communist societies ‚Äî observing first how people circumvented the communist system, and when it was coming undone, how players positioned themselves to wield power and influence and thereby helped create the emerging order. This century, as I‚Äôve turned much of my energy homeward, my prior experience has ‚Äî to my surprise ‚Äî proved ideal preparation for looking into similar issues in the United States.‚Äùhttp://www.salon.com/writer/janine_r_wedel/ =Reviews= The book was generally well received. Publishers Weekly gave Shadow Elite a starred review.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-465-09106-5 The Huffington Post selected it as a monthly Book Club selection and described it as a \\"gripping, disquieting book\\" that exposes and explains why it's been so hard to bring about any real change in our country---why Washington \\"no longer seems capable of addressing the problems our nation faces.\\" The Financial Times described the book as \\"a serious study of global affairs ... and the top-level politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen who make up the global elite. Janine Wedel's argument is that political culture at the beginning of the 21st century has changed in such a way\\" as to make it easier, and even obligatory, for individuals to mask their true agendas and conflicts of interest in creating policies. Public Administration Review described Shadow Elite as making \\"an important contribution to the effort to conceptualize the increasingly problematic role of elites in American government and politics.\\" This review determined that the book finds a \\"startling, if not alarming,\\" congruence between off-the-books governing practices in Eastern Europe upon the fall of the Soviet Union and government policy \\"entrepreneurship\\" in the United States. Contemporary Sociology called Shadow Elite ‚Äúan example of the cutting edge of the discipline [of anthropology].\\"http://janinewedel.info/shadowelite_reviews_CS.pdf Choice wrote that \\"Wedel (George Mason Univ.) presents an arresting theory of power that deserves wide attention....as a thinker she is in the same league as John Kenneth Galbraith and Charles Lindblom.\\"http://janinewedel.info/choice_july2010.pdf  Collision and Collusion  Collision and Collusion: The Strange Case of Western Aid to Eastern Europe was generally well received, despite being controversial. In granting the book and Wedel's work on the subject the 2001 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order, the selection committee noted: \\"This is a book that is bound to have a long-term impact on the practice and politics of foreign aid from the West to non-western economies.‚Äù Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security advisor, wrote about Collision and Collusion: \\"Very critical and troubling analysis of the shortcomings of Western aid policy, particularly to Russia. The implications of Wedel's critical assessment need to be seriously taken into account.\\" The book was named \\"impressive and informative\\" by Foreign Affairs while American Ethnologist called it ‚Äúa tribute to the high caliber of Wedel's journalistic and anthropological abilities alike and a reminder of the need for a re-envisioned and effective anthropology brought to bear on pressing social issues.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal wrote that \\"Janine Wedel's admirable new book... argues convincingly that the lack of accountability on both sides ultimately compromised all those involved....Aid, it seems, can hurt as well as help.\\" Other academics have recently given the name FOZZ affair collectively to scandal of Polish corruption at the time. Wedel's research about western aid in former-Soviet states may in the future help to shed light on the untimely death in 1991 of the president of the Polish Supreme Audit Office, Walerian Panko.  The Private Poland  Wedel's first book was The Private Poland: An Anthropologist's Look at Everyday Life (1986) which Osteuropa Wirtschaft called ‚Äúa brilliant account of contemporary Polish society‚Äù. Ernest Gellner, the noted University of Cambridge social anthropologist, wrote that \\"Her book...makes an extremely valuable contribution.\\" The Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote: \\"In spite of its engrossing readability this is a serious piece of research by a Berkeley-trained anthropologist.‚Äù = Monographs = # Building Accountability into International Development Advising in an Age of Diffused Governance.

It takes place in the setting of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game. The game was successfully crowd funded through Kickstarter, and was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android in 2013. An expansion pack titled Shadowrun: Dragonfall, was released in 2014. It was later converted to a standalone release and as Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut. In 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched another Kickstarter campaign to partially fund their next game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong. Similar to the Dragonfall - Director's Cut edition, Hong Kong was released in 2015 as a standalone release built using an upgraded version of the Shadowrun Returns engine. Gameplay isometric graphics, similar to 1993's Shadowrun for the SNES =Character generation= The player is able to customize their character's gender and appearance. There are five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and trolls. The player can choose to play as one of six classes, Street Samurai, Mage, Decker, Shaman, Rigger, or Physical Adept, or the player can choose to play as no class at all. Street Samurai focus on combat and weapons, Mages use various spells including attack spells, healing spells and others, Deckers focus on hacking into computer systems, Shamans can summon spirits to aid in battle, Riggers control robotic drones that can specialize in combat or healing, while Physical Adepts use their magic spells to make themselves stronger in various ways. As the story progresses, the player is given Karma to spend on improving their characters. While classes control what skills and equipment the character starts with, the player can choose to gain any skills they wish (e.g., Deckers can spend Karma to gain a Shaman's summoning abilities). The main statistics are Body, Quickness, Strength, Intelligence, Willpower and Charisma. Besides the player-character, the player can hire up to three other runners to aid the player-character during missions. Some non- player-characters are required to follow the player-character during certain missions. =Exploration= While gameplay is mostly linear, some small amount of exploration is possible while completing objectives. The player can enter dialogue with various characters, with different statistics and skills giving new dialogue options. The player can also choose for their character to have various Etiquettes to add more dialogue options. The higher one's Charisma is, the more Etiquettes their character can have. The player can also interact with the environment in some ways. For instance, pushing aside objects or hacking terminals to find hidden rooms, gaining access to new routes to their main objective or finding items to use or sell. Mages are also able to see magical ley lines, which enhance their abilities while standing over them, while Shamans can see points that allow them to summon spirits. Finally, Deckers are able to \\"Jack In\\" to the Matrix at specific points. This results in them entering a different, virtual world while still controlling the characters in the real world. In the Matrix, their stats are determined by the cyberdeck they have equipped and their abilities by the programs they have installed. In the matrix, they can fight ICs and enemy deckers while trying to gather data and hack devices, such as elevators or auto turrets. =Combat= Combat is turn based, with the player controlling the actions of their team followed by the enemies taking their actions. All characters can move based on their Action Points (AP). Characters start with a base of 2 AP per turn (3 after a certain point in the story) but can gain or lose AP based on abilities, spells or items used on them. AP is used on such actions as moving, firing a weapon, reloading, or using a spell or item. Each character carries up to three weapons and can switch between them at no AP cost. Weapons are divided into ranged combat (pistols, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and rifles) and close combat types. Weapons also have different attacks, depending on the weapon itself and the character's skill with that weapon. Ammunition is unlimited but ranged weapons need to be reloaded when their magazines are emptied. Riggers can equip drones the same way as weapons, taking manual control of them during combat. While this gives the Rigger less AP, the drones are capable of attacking enemies or healing allies. Those with Shaman abilities can summon additional allied spirits to the field, either through items they carry with them or special points where spirits linger. Each turn, these spirits are given a certain number of AP chosen by the player. The longer the spirit has been summoned for and the more AP it is given, the greater chance it will escape the Shaman's control, at which point it will either begin attacking anyone at random or simply flee. Plot The game ships with a campaign called \\"Dead Man's Switch\\" that allows for any sort of newly created character. Further campaigns can be downloaded from Steam Workshop or external websites. =Dead Man's Switch= The player assumes the role of a shadowrunner who receives a pre-recorded message from his or her old shadowrunner accomplice, Sam Watts, which was triggered by a dead man's switch embedded within his body. Sam's message states that he has 100,000 nuyen being held in escrow as a reward should he bring whomever was responsible for his death to justice. Upon arriving in Seattle, the runner discovers that Sam is the latest victim of the Emerald City Ripper, a serial killer who has been surgically removing organs from his or her victims. Afterwards the runner meets Jake Armitage, the protagonist of the SNES Shadowrun game, who provides some leads to investigate. After receiving help from Coyote, a female human bartender/shadowrunner who first asked for assistance in a private war against those who make \\"Better-Than-Life\\" (\\"BTL\\") chips, the runner discovers that the Ripper is a male elf named Silas Forsberg whose victims were those who had a transplanted organ from Sam's mother. After killing Silas, the player learns he was directed to commit the Ripper murders by Jessica Watts, Sam's twin sister. Sam and Jessica had lived a comfortable life before their father's passing, and despite his best efforts early on to live a decent life, he cracked under the pressure and spent the family savings on drugs and alcohol. He eventually became a shadowrunner to make ends meet, and to further fuel his self-destructive habits. The runner confronts Jessica but she escapes. The runner finds that Jessica is a high-ranking member of the Universal Brotherhood, an international New Age organization that attracts the disenfranchised. The runner and Coyote investigate the restricted areas of the facility and discover that the Universal Brotherhood is itself a front for a cult trying to create an insect spirit hive. Jessica is revealed to be a shaman who is one of the few who are aware of the Brotherhood's true nature and she unleashes extra-dimensional insect spirits that cannot be killed. The team flees, rescuing a woman named Mary-Louise who is designated to become \\"the queen\\", similar to a queen bee. Mary-Louise connects the team with her boyfriend, a decker going by the alias Baron Samedi, who organizes a shadowrun on Telestrian Industries to steal a sample of Project Aegis; a chemical weapon capable of killing the insect spirits. The runner acquires the sample but is captured while trying to escape and is brought before James Telestrian III. When it is revealed that the runner rescued Mary-Louise, who is Telestrian's daughter, he decides instead of punishing the runner to hire him or her to lead a team to deploy Project Aegis along with the immortal elf Harlequin. Telestrian explains that Jessica's ritual to bring an insect spirit queen into this world requires a blood relative. His father had an affair with Melinda Watts, Sam and Jessica's mother, thus Mary-Louise was a viable candidate since they shared the same grandfather. Should Jessica perform the ritual on a blood relative, it would result in a full-scale invasion of the extra-dimensional insect spirits. Telestrian gives the runner and Harlequin each a shotgun able to fire capsules filled with the remaining Aegis compound, which can kill the insect spirits. The team infiltrates the hive and they fight their way into the heart of the inner sanctum where Telestrian's sister, Lynne, has volunteered to let the queen take over her body, as she is also a blood relation to Jessica. The team disrupts the summoning by seriously wounding Jessica and killing most of the insect spirits inside the hive. The queen spirit abandons Jessica, and the player is given the option to kill her or arrest her. Lynne survives, but is arrested and eventually sent to a mental hospital. The game concludes with Armitage, Coyote, Harlequin, and James Telestrian III discussing the fallout of the raid, with Harlequin musing that other Brotherhood chapters across the world also hold hives similar to the one in Seattle. When the runner tries to collect the money for bringing Sam's killer to justice, Sam's prerecorded message asks the runner to apologize to Jessica for what he put her through, and reveals that he never actually had any money in escrow. An epilogue describes the immediate events after the game, tying in with the larger Shadowrun canon. Media coverage of the events left out details of shadowrunners and insect spirits, likely due to the influence of the Brotherhood. Aegis was eventually developed into a product called \\"Fluorescing Astral Bacteria-3\\", or \\"FAB-3\\". The Chicago Universal Brotherhood hive is botched and the city is largely sealed up behind a wall to keep the rampaging insect spirits inside the city. FAB-3 is used some time later to cleanse Chicago of its insect spirit infestation. =Dragonfall= In the main campaign of the game's first expansion, players assume the role of a Shadowrunner who has recently arrived in the anarchic free state of Berlin to join a team headed by an old colleague, Monika Sch√§fer. =Hong Kong= In 2056, the player travels to the Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone, meeting with their foster brother Duncan and his superior officer Carter, who agree to investigate their foster father's mysterious message, are ambushed by the HKPD, and escape to and continue their investigation from a small boat village built on the outskirts of a modern Kowloon Walled City, a nightmarish slum built on the ruins of the original. Development The game's lead designer is Jordan Weisman, the creator of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game, who was inspired to create a game with a \\"more authentic tone\\" after the release of the 2007 Shadowrun first-person shooter, which he was not involved with. Weisman was originally inspired to create a video game in the Shadowrun universe after reacquiring the rights to it from Microsoft through his Smith & Tinker startup company in 2007. Unfortunately, due to restrictions on the license, he could not obtain the backing of other publishers for new Shadowrun projects. The success of crowd funding financing models then motivated him to obtain funding for his project, Shadowrun Returns, through the Kickstarter crowd funding platform. The project was opened to pledges in March 2012 and met its funding goal of $400,000 within 28 hours. Upon reaching the $1 million mark, Weisman recorded a video for the Kickstarter project stating that if the project were to reach $1.5 million, the developers would develop a \\"backers- only exclusive mission which will tie together the stories of the SNES title and the Sega Genesis title.\\" This goal was achieved but Kickstarter backers demanded that the mission be made available to everyone, so Harebrained Schemes announced that the mission would be available to them for a limited amount of time before being available to the public. The funding period ended on 29 April 2012, by which time the project had gathered $1,895,772 worth of pledges. The success of the campaign made Complex rank it number eight on their list of the biggest video game wins and fails on Kickstarter in 2012.The 10 Biggest Video Game Wins And Fails On Kickstarter This Year, Complex.com, December 28, 2012 The game was developed for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, as well as the iPad and Android tablets. Weisman justified the addition of tablets as a development platform alongside more traditional development for the desktop because \\"the style of game we want to make lends itself best to these platforms,\\" and \\"the gameplay determined the platform.\\" Weisman announced the game as a \\"graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly- contextual tactical combat.\\" It is accompanied by a level editor for players to create their own content. The game implements character types from the role-playing game, including Street Samurai, Combat Mage, Decker (i.e. hacker), Shaman, Rigger and Adept. In collaboration with Cliffhanger Productions, characters and plotlines of Shadowrun Returns will be carried on to Shadowrun Online, which is set approximately 20 years later and will be based upon the video game multiplayer aspect Shadowrun has potential for. The music was composed by Marshall Parker and Sam Powell who were involved in the original SNES and Sega Genesis iterations, as well as the independent composer Gavin Parker, whose previous work includes Test Drive Unlimited, Viva Pi√±ata and Scene it?. The official launch trailer was released on July 18, which included voice talent by Charles Legget and music by composer Jon Everist, who went on to compose the majority of the music for Shadowrun: Dragonfall and all of the critically acclaimed score for Shadowrun: Hong Kong.http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/shadowrun-hong-kong-review Release The game originally had an estimated delivery date of January 2013, but the designers stated that the additional content to be added after meeting stretch goals will require more time. On June 18, 2013 the developers announced an official release date of July 25, 2013. It was released on July 25, 2013 through Steam, with a DRM-free download available to Kickstarter backers only. Initially the DRM-free version was only available to backers as the developing team managed to get an exception only for Kickstarter backers while licensing the Shadowrun brand, but on November 12, 2013 Harebrained Schemes announced that they had reached an agreement to release DRM-free versions of Shadowrun Returns and future expansions, as well as sell them through GOG.com. Reception Shadowrun Returns received generally favorable reviews upon release, garnering a 76/100 on review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN reviewer Dan Stapleton stated that the game's best days were ahead of it, and they will be more interested in it \\"a year from now, after the community has used the included mod tools to build on it, than in what it is today.\\" Several reviewers criticized the game's save system, which saves the game only at area transitions. Functionality to allow the player to save the game at any time was omitted because of development resource constraints, but was later added in the Shadowrun Dragonfall expansion.

He is the founder of the capoeira Angola group, Africa Bantu, and one of the founders of the Grupo de Capoeira Angola Pelourinho (GCAP). Formative years Braga began practicing Capoeira in the early 1970s when at age 14 he joined the Capoeira Regional Palmares Group in Rio de Janeiro. There he encountered Mestres Roni, Z√© Macaco and Cabelo Vermelho. After the group disbanded, he continued his practice of Capoeira with Mestre Touro and Dentinho (Grupo Corda Bamba). In 1975 during the Rio de Janeiro carnival, Braga met Mestre Moraes at a roda in Central do Brazil. This would be the turning point in his evolution towards Capoeira Angola. Through Mestre Moraes, Braga discovered Capoeira Angola, a strand of Capoeira that originated from the teaching of Mestre Pastinha. Mestre Moraes‚Äô Rio de Janeiro school was the first school to teach Capoeira Angola outside of Bahia. It was founded by Mestre Moraes after he moved from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro for his military practice. Mestre Braga trained in Capoeira Angola with Mestre Moraes and, on 16 December 1978, he received the title of mestre along with his colleagues Neco and Z√© Carlos. In December 1979, together with Mestre Moraes, Mestre Braga made a trip to Salvador de Bahia where he visited Mestre Pastinha. Foundation of GCAP In 1980, the GCAP association was founded. The idea behind the association originated from Mestre Neco; the association aimed to fight the Brazilian government‚Äôs prosecution of the African culture at the time. The label of the group, with a berimbau and two zebras fighting (as a reference to the African origins of Capoeira), was created by Braga. The association was meant to unite under the same label the masters of capoeira Angola from Rio (Moraes, Braga, Neco and Z√© Carlos). In 1982, Moraes returned to Salvador Bahia, leaving the three young masters full autonomy and the responsibility to continue his teachings. Prior to his departure, Mestre Moraes promoted Marco Aurelio to the rank of mestre. Present day In 1994, Braga left GCAP and founded his own group, Grupo Africa Bantu G/ECAAB (1995). In 1997, after moving to Denmark, he established an Africa Bantu group in Aarhus and Copenhagen. Later, in 2002 he set up the Africa Bantu group in Geneva, Switzerland, where he still teaches today.

Shahi qila on the bank of Tapti river Royal bath or hammam Shahi qila Burhanpur History of the Shahi Qila states that it was originally built by the Farooqui rulers and resided by Shah Jahan, at a time when he was the governor of Burhanpur. Shah Jahan became so fond of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the first three years of his ascending the throne. Shah Jahan spent a considerable time in this city, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila. The Shahi Qila, Burhanpur is mostly in ruins now, except a few beautifully carved parts of the palace that still stands as a symbol of the glorious Qila it was in the olden days. The locals call the Shahi Qila 'Bhulbhulaya' (that means a labyrinth) because the architecture of the Shahi Qila is puzzling and perplexing for a casual visitor. The main attraction at the palace is the hamam or the royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, Begum Mumtaz Mahal, so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath in water scented with khus, saffron and rose petals. Hammam Khana was constructed during Mughal Period. The baths bear an inscription of Khan Khana Mirza Abdul Rahim Khana, the famous minister of Akbar and Jahangir. The rooms have domed roof. The Hammam is beautifully decorated with paintings on honey comb work. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. One of the amazing facts is that the Taj Mahal was originally supposed to have been built at Burhanpur. The site chosen for it still lies vacant near the tapti river.

Ecology The Mkhomazi State Forest and the Mkhomazi Wilderness Area are protected areas in the upper course of the Umkomazi River.Mkhomazi Wilderness Area The scaly yellowfish (Labeobarbus natalensis) is a fish found in the Umkomazi River System as well as in the Umgeni, Umzimkulu, Tukhela and the Umfolozi. It is a common endemic species in KwaZulu-Natal Province and it lives in different habitats between the Drakensberg foothills and the coastal lowlands. Activities on the river An annual two-day canoe (kayak) race is held on the river. \\"The Umko\\" is the second-oldest river marathon and the only one which neither starts nor finishes in a city or town. First held in 1966 the race was initially over three days. The overall distance has varied from 145 km down to the present length of 68 km. Famed as the roughest water race to be paddled in sprint boats which make negotiating the category 1 - 4 rapids tricky, it also had the longest daily sections when the distance was 130 km over two days. The race is held in a remote and rugged valley which makes access difficult and walking out a challenge if one should break a boat irreparably. Stories of paddlers spending a night in the valley before being able to walk out the next day have regularly made the national press and national radio. This premier wildwater race is organised by Kingfisher Canoe Club of Durban and attracts around 180 to 300 paddlers annually. 2016 saw the 50th running of the event and, remarkably, the 50th consecutive participation of the winner of the very first race, Charles Mason. Mason has completed 49 marathons, failing only in the 1970 event when he broke up 19 km into the 145 km race (one of the \\"four long years\\" in which the longest course was paddled from Hella Hella to the sea). The race has had two starting points: Josephine's Bridge on the Richmond-Ixopo road, and Hella Hella bridge on the Richmond-Donnybrook road. The river between Hella Hella and the Number Eight rapid 20 km downstream has the steepest gradient (a fall of 7,6m per kilometre) and contains the toughest series of rapids. This section has been included in most, but not all, the races. The race has had many finishing points over the years depending mainly on weather, logistics and overland access. The race has been run for 50 consecutive summers. In the 1971/1972 summer the race was moved to March 1972 resulting in no race in calendar 1971, but no summer has been missed. The current Umko champion Hank McGregor is also the current World Canoe Marathon champion, having won the 2016 world champs in Brandenburg, Germany. History Surf near the Umkomazi River mouth at Umkomaas The first recorded trip down the river was in 1951 when Ian Player and Fred Schmidt paddled down from Josephine's bridge to the sea at Umkomaas village where the river flows into the Indian Ocean. Player was at the time famous for having won the first Dusi Canoe marathon earlier that year and later became famous in wildlife conservation, especially for having saved the white rhino from extinction. They took seven days to complete the 113 km distance and were supported by friendly inhabitants of the valley when they ran out of supplies. Various other trips were undertaken culminating in trips in 1965 and 1966 aimed specifically at the feasibility of holding a race, which necessitated scouting the river and roads along the banks for two accessible overnight campsites. Charles Mason was instrumental in that undertaking, succeeding in the scouting of the river and the access roads and in persuading the powers-that-be to sanction the new race on the South African canoeing calendar. He went on to win the first race with Tank Rogers, narrowly beating Paul Chalupsky and Jimmy Potgieter. Chalupsky went on to win the race seven times up to 1977. Other multiple winners include Tony Scott (six times to 1984); Robbie Herreveld (nine times to 2000); Deon Bruss (six times to 2008); Hank McGregor (seven times to 2016). Staying overnight in a temporary camp in the remote valley was a compulsory part of the race for many years but in latter years this has changed with the overnight stop now being easily accessible at the Hella Hella bridge (now the start of the second day in a reverse-order format since 2009 which has greatly simplified the challenging logistics of the race and hopefully ensured its survival).

Pakistan promised to dig out every body from under the avalanche. On 7 April 2012, an avalanche hit a Pakistan Army base in Gayari Sector, near the Siachen Glacier region, trapping 140 soldiers and civilian contractors under deep snow. The incident occurred at an altitude of about 4,000 meters and 300 km northeast of Skardu (capital of Baltistan). It was the worst avalanche that the Pakistani military has experienced in the area. On 29 May 2012, Pakistan declared that the 129 soldiers and 11 civilians were killed. Background The Siachen Glacier region in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalaya mountains has been the site of intermittent conflict between India and Pakistan for several decades. In 1949, a ceasefire line was negotiated between the two countries in an effort to resolve the competing territorial claims of the violent Kashmir conflict. The agreement, however, did not clearly delineate Siachen as either Indian or Pakistani, and competing claims to the barren, unpopulated area began to escalate. Both sides issued numerous mountaineering permits for the area during the 1970s and 1980s, fearing that the other's expeditions indicated plans to formalise control over the glacier and its surroundings. Thus, both India and Pakistan began planning military operations to pre-empt the other's designs. On 13 April 1984, India launched Operation Meghdoot with the objective of taking control of the area, fearing it would fall into Pakistani hands. The operation was successful, and India extended its control over much of the triangle of mountainous, icy land, up to and including the passes of the Saltoro Ridge situated west of the Siachen Glacier, while Pakistan retained control over the western slopes and foothills of that ridge. Although the Pakistani military launched numerous attempts to wrest the region from Indian control until the 2003 ceasefire, the situation on the ground changed little, and the front stagnated along the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL), which trends northward from the northern end of the Line of Control between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region. With troops deployed at elevations up to 6,700 metres (22,000 feet) above sea level, the glacier region has come to be known as \\"the world's highest battlefield\\". Thousands of troops from both sides remained stationed in at least 150 bases on the glacier and surrounding mountains and valleys. The simmering conflict over the glacier region costs both countries millions of dollars each year. Avalanches are known to occur frequently in the Siachen region, though casualties from them are generally low due to the fact that they normally strike remote, high-altitude \\"forward bases\\" with only a handful of troops. The most devastating one prior to this occurred in 2010, in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. The winter of 2011‚Äì2012 in Kashmir was unusually harsh, marked by numerous heavy snowfalls and sharp temperature drops. Avalanche left Around 2:00 am Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) on 7 April 2012, a massive ice avalanche struck a Pakistani military headquarters at Gayari, 30 km west of the Siachen Glacier terminus, near the disputed Siachen glacier region. Located in a deep valley at 3,775 metres (12,400 feet) above sea level, the Gayari base is one of the most important Pakistani bases in the area. It is a vital supply hub for troops and materiel passing through to more remote bases, and is not far from a military hospital. At the time of the ice avalanche, the base was occupied by soldiers of the 6th Northern Light Infantry battalion, a unit \\"trained in mountain operations\\". Avalanches are uncommon in the area of Gayari; due to the low avalanche risk, Gayari was a bigger complex and housed many more soldiers than other bases in the Siachen region. The glacier avalanche broke off at an elevation of around 4560 meters above sea level in a distance of around 1300 m from the camp. Initial reports indicated that at least 100 Pakistani soldiers, including a colonel and a commander, had been trapped under an estimated 21 metres (70 feet) of snow, covering an area of 1 square kilometre. The number of people missing was later stated to be at least 135: \\"at least 124 soldiers and 11 civilian contractors\\". No communication with any person from the base was reported after the avalanche. A list of 135 names of those missing was later released by the Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Armed Forces. The army declared all victims of the avalanche as 'Shuhada' (martyrs), as the nature and magnitude of the disaster indicated minimal chances of recovering any survivors.Gayari victims declared martyrs The News International, 29 May 2012 Rescue operation An avalanche rescue operation was quickly launched by the Pakistani military. Over 150 soldiers‚Äîusing helicopters, rescue dogs, and heavy machinery airlifted from the main garrison in Rawalpindi‚Äîbegan searching the area for the missing soldiers and contractors, with \\"a team of doctors and paramedics\\" standing by. Local reports initially indicated that the operation had recovered at least 12 bodies by the end of the day, but official reports stated that no victims had been found, dead or alive. Ghanche District highlighted in maroon Due to the remoteness and extreme weather conditions, rescue operations were expected to take several days to complete. Nevertheless, official Pakistani military sources remained \\"hopeful\\", and an anticipated improvement in weather conditions was expected to quicken the operation after initial efforts on the night of 7‚Äì8 April were cut short due to bad weather and darkness. However, other sources expressed a much more grave view of the situation. An unnamed senior military officer said \\"All we can do now is pray. It is such a desperately tough place that it [would] need a miracle for someone to have survived.\\" Pakistani Army Colonel Sher Khan, an expert in mountain warfare sent by the military to oversee the rescue operation, said that \\"there is no hope, there is no chance at all\\" for those buried under the snow, and noted that any survivors of the avalanche itself would have died within minutes from exposure to the elements. By 9 April, rescue crews working at the scene of the disaster had managed to clear an area of snow measuring approximately 12 metres (40 feet) in length, 9 metres (30 feet) in width, and 3 metres (10 feet) in depth, but despite initial hopes for clearer conditions, inclement weather continued to hamper the operation. A team of eight US military experts sent to Pakistan to assist the over 300 Pakistanis‚Äî286 soldiers and 60 civilians by this time‚Äîalready working at the disaster area was unable to make it to the far northern site due to the weather, and official military statements still indicated that no bodies or survivors had been found by rescuers. The Pakistan Army had dispatched its chief of staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, to the Siachen region to lead the operation. Two additional groups of foreigners were also expected to arrive in Islamabad on the evening of 9 April the country to provide further aid: three Swiss \\"experts\\" and a six-member German \\"disaster management team\\" with additional equipment. By 10 April, the rescue crew had increased to 452 people, 69 of them civilians, with nine pieces of heavy machinery pressed into service for digging out the avalanche site, and had begun excavating five points on the disaster site in search of victims‚Äîtwo with heavy machinery, two without. The teams from Germany and Switzerland had arrived in Rawalpindi, joining the American team, which had still not yet reached the site due to weather. A seven-man specialist team was using life detection kits and thermal imaging cameras in an attempt to detect any residual body warmth from those buried under the snow and debris. The Pakistan Army released a revised list of those missing, the number climbing to 138. Snow was expected for the next two days, further frustrating rescue efforts as the possibility of finding survivors dwindled to next to none. On 18 April 2013, the army resumed the search operation for the remaining bodies of the victims of April 2012 avalanche in Gayari sector near the Siachen glacier after improvement of weather and melting of snow. The search operation was suspended on 27 November 2012 due to winter season. 121 bodies were recovered in 2012 whereas 19 bodies are yet to be found. As of 8 June 2013, search & rescue teams of the army had recovered 131 dead bodies while search for the remaining nine continued. On 2 October 2013, Pakistan Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani said that 133 bodies had so far been recovered from Gayari sector while search for the remaining seven continued. Speculation about causes Experts advanced various theories as to the cause of the disaster. The president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, Manzoor Hussain, suggested that a piece of the main glacier had broken off and obliterated the camp. However, retired Pakistani Colonel Sher Khan said that the disaster was likely a landslide caused by heavy precipitation, not an avalanche: \\"In this case a huge flood of water is coming down from the sky and creates a lot of mud and loose earth on the mountain. Mostly boulders, mud and water ran down the mountain.\\" He predicted that freezing temperatures would have hardened the mass of snow and debris, complicating digging efforts. A Pakistani newspaper article using Pakistan Meteorological Department data accused India of carrying out extensive military activities that caused the avalanche. The article cited melting of ice at the terminus of the Siachen Glacier and suggested that large carbon deposits from Indian military activity led to increased solar radiation as one of the prime causes of the incident. However, there are no Indian troops within 15 km of either the avalanche site or the avalanche source basin, and no part of the Siachen Glacier itself is within 30 km of the avalanche site, separated from the Siachen system by the 5000 to 7500 meter high Saltoro Ridge. A study by a non-governmental organisation revealed poor waste collection mechanisms by Indian forces, almost entirely located in the Siachen Glacier basin, who produce 1000 kilograms of waste a day that is packed in drums. These drums of waste are thrown in crevasses, at the rate of about 4000 drums a year. However, the avalanche site is 15 km west of any part of the Siachen basin, near the Gayari (Ghyari) River just below the Bilafond La , neither of which flow from or connect with the Siachen Glacier system.See Google Earth or the 1990 \\"Orographic Sketch Map: Karakoram: Sheet 2\\", Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich. Reactions =Pakistani reactions= Then-Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani expressed his shock at the incident, and said it \\"would in no way undermine the high morale of soldiers and officers\\". Speaking to Al Jazeera, Shaukat Qadir, a retired Pakistani Brigadier and current political analyst, called the incident \\"the biggest casualty that has ever happened\\", and noted that more soldiers have died from the extreme elements than from combat during the entire Siachen conflict: \\"[T]he fact of matter is that 70 per cent of the people have died because of natural causes, and I think this is the time we ended this damn conflict, which has absolutely no explanation.\\" He also expressed hope that the incident would help bring an end to the Siachen conflict, and that a meeting in India, between Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on 8 April could help \\"settle this issue for both sides\\" . Zardari was ostensibly visiting India for a day to make a personal religious pilgrimage to the Sufi shrine at Ajmer Sharif, but took the opportunity to meet informally with Singh to discuss matters of state. Zardari has presided over a considerable thaw in Indo-Pakistani relations, repudiating the official Pakistani \\"first nuclear strike\\" position, granting \\"most favoured nation\\" status to India, and declaring that both countries should \\"freeze the issue of Kashmir for a generation\\". Expressing great sorrow and extending condolences to the families of the victims, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) demanded that \\"conditions in which the soldiers were stationed at the glacier\\" be investigated to assess the adequacy of the safety measures in place to protect those troops stationed in Siachen. The HCRP also urged India and Pakistan to continue to pursue a resolution to the Siachen conflict. The army declared all the victims of Gayari sector as martyrs.Siachen Tragedy: Army declares buried troops martyrs Geo News Pakistan, 30 May 212 =International reactions= * During the Zardari-Singh talks, which Zardari described as \\"fruitful\\", Singh offered humanitarian assistance to aid the Pakistani rescue effort.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description Spider Cave is a water-cut cave located above the base of Burnt Bluff, a limestone cliff on the shore of Big Bay de Noc. The bluff contains multiple wind- and water- cut caves. Spider Cave was formed approximately 4000 years ago, and is long and deep. The cave contains four pictographs within the cave and on the walls near the entrance. The most distinctive is a pictograph of a man connected to what appears to be a spider by a spiral umbilical cord. The \\"Spider Man\\" paint colors vary from red-violet to blue-violet, and were most likely applied using colorful mineral dyes mixed with grease, along with binders from fish roe or animal hooves and skins. However, these pictographs have been fading, due in part to natural wind and water erosion, and in part to tourists applying water to the images to view them better. As of 2009, the \\"spiderman\\" image had only two of the \\"spider legs\\" visible, the remainder being hidden under lichen and precipitated salts. History The caves on Burnt Bluff were probably first occupied by humans sometime around 1200 BC. There were at least 165 caves and shelters that were in use to some extent. There are a number of theories on what importance this archaeological site had to the people who lived at the site. These theories include suppositions that it may have been the site of Midewiwin rituals, the home of a Wendigo, a boundary marker, a place for demonstrating warrior prowess, a winter camp, a burial location, or the site of a murder; however, none of these theories has proved conclusive. The earliest historical recording of people in the Burnt Bluff area are the Noquet people, who inhabited the land before European settlement, and likely as early as 1500. Ojibwe people living in the area still trace their heritage back to these people, and among these communities there are multiple oral histories discussing the Burnt Bluff site and pictographs. In 1867, much of the Garden Peninsula was deeded to the Jackson Iron Company, which planned to build furnaces at Fayette. Starting in the 1880s, multiple private parties owned the land around Spider Cave. The earliest record of the pictographs within Spider Cave is in Hinsdale's Primitive Man in Michigan. The cave was first excavated by Charles E. Cleland and G. Richard Peske in 1963. A number of artifacts were collected from the cave, most of which were Middle Woodland period projectile points. Most of the projectile points had shattered tips, suggesting they were fired into the cave from without and had shattered against the rear wall. The abundance of projectile tips and lack of other artifacts associated with normal occupation suggests that Spider Cave was not used as a normal living site. Of the private owners of the land, Ruth and Henry Lang, who purchased the land in 1947, advertised the Spider Cave pictographs as a tourist attraction. The area around Burnt Bluff was acquired by the State of Michigan in the 1970s, and are now part of Fayette Historic State Park. They are closed to the public.

The company began in a horse barn that had been converted into a makeshift laundry and its equipment consisted of a single washing machine and a delivery truck. It served Boston area factory workers and other laborers, whose heavy soiled work clothing needed to be cleaned frequently. The National Overall Dry Cleaning Company was incorporated in Massachusetts on October 6, 1950. In the 1980s, UniFirst was sued by residents of Woburn, Massachusetts in a class-action lawsuit. The residents alleged that Unifirst, along with two other firms, had released pollution that had leaked into the water supply, and that this was a cause of increased instances of leukemia in the town. UniFirst settled with the residents without going to trial, for a sum of one million dollars. This episode was featured in the non-fiction book A Civil Action by Jonathan Harr. As of 2009, UniFirst's environmental record has improved; it has received awards for its water treatment processes from the Missouri Water Environment Association and the Water and Wastewater Utility Special Service Division of Austin, Texas, among others. In 1991 Ronald Croatti became the chief executive officer of the company. He continued his rise in 1995, when he became the company president, and again in 2002, when he became the chairman of the board. In 2011, UniFirst featured in an episode of the reality television series Undercover Boss. In May 2017, Ronald Croatti died and Steven S. Sintros became President & CEO.

It was the culmination of the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, the ninth edition of the tournament. England won the final by four wickets, clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup ‚Äì England won their previous final contest in 1993. Both teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand captain, Haidee Tiffen, won the toss, and opted to bat first. Her side were bowled out for 166 runs. The all-rounder Lucy Doolan, batting at number nine, was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. Nicky Shaw, one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening partnership of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 balls to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been in the England starting lineup, was named player of the match having replaced the injured Jenny Gunn minutes before the game started. Background The 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup was the ninth edition of the tournament, and the first to be organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first had been held in 1973, pre- dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 2009 tournament included eight teams; six of which (Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and the West Indies) qualified automatically due to finishing as the top six teams at the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup, while the other two (Pakistan and South Africa) qualified through the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Matches, which consisted of 50 overs-per-side, took place at several cricket grounds in Australia between 7 and 22 March, featuring 25 matches over 16 days. Although the ICC had successfully developed and expanded the women's game, from 15 member countries in 2005 to 42 in 2007, there was a growing gap between the top four teams‚ÄîAustralia, England, India and New Zealand‚Äîand the rest. In 2008, England, and then Australia, became the first teams to introduce contracts for some of their women's players; Charlotte Edwards, England's captain, said that this allowed the players to \\"commit to training without worrying about our jobs outside cricket.\\" Before the competition, Jenny Roesler of Cricinfo suggested England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition. Haidee Tiffen, the captain of New Zealand, said that she thought \\"Australia, New Zealand, England and India are of equal strength and any team can beat the other on its day. It is an open tournament with no clear-cut favourites.\\" England's Claire Taylor said that she thought that Australia might struggle after losing key members of their 2005 World Cup-winning squad. Route to the final =Group stage= New Zealand were drawn in Group A of the competition, along with Australia, South Africa and the West Indies. They started their campaign against Australia. Tiffen scored a cautious half-century for New Zealand, but her dismissal triggered a collapse in which the team lost seven wickets for the addition of 34 runs. In their reply, Australia regularly lost wickets, and a six over bowling spell by medium pacer Kate Pulford, in which she took three wickets for 30 runs, slowed the run chase. After an initial rain delay held up the game, a second downpour finished the match, with Australia 13 runs short by the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis method. Tiffen missed New Zealand's second match, against the West Indies, with an injury, and Aimee Mason deputised as captain. For the second time in as many matches, New Zealand suffered a collapse, losing their first six wickets for 104 runs. A seventh-wicket partnership of 57 between Mason and Sarah Tsukigawa helped New Zealand to remain competitive in the match, and they completed their 50 overs with 192 runs. According to Cricinfo, the West Indian reply \\"was devoid of momentum\\". Spin bowlers Mason and Lucy Doolan took three wickets apiece to limit the West Indies to 136 runs for the loss of eight wickets from their overs. In their final group stage match, a win over South Africa ensured that New Zealand won the group. Amy Satterthwaite, Sara McGlashan and Nicola Browne all scored half-centuries as their team reached a total of 250 for five. South Africa struggled in their chase: only Cri-Zelda Brits reached double figures in an innings dominated by the bowling of Mason and Suzie Bates, who collected four wickets each, helping New Zealand earn a 199-run victory. alt=Claire Taylor battingEngland were placed in Group B, alongside India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In their first contest, against Sri Lanka, they scored 277 runs, aided by a 95-ball century from Claire Taylor, and a half-century by Caroline Atkins. Sri Lanka batted their full allocation of overs, but lost by 100 runs. Laura Marsh took three wickets, and three of the Sri Lankan batters were run out in their chase. Following the match, Jenny Gunn's bowling action was reported to the ICC as being potentially illegal, but she was cleared a few days later. England faced India in their second match, in a contest billed as the battle for top spot in the group. England won the match easily, bowling India out for 169: Gunn and Holly Colvin each took three wickets, while both Atkins and Claire Taylor scored unbeaten half-centuries. Another large win, over Pakistan, guaranteed that England finished as group winners. Marsh took a career-best five wickets to help bowl Pakistan out for just 78 runs, a total which her side reached in less than half of their allowed overs. =Super Sixes= After the initial league stage, the bottom team from each group was eliminated, and the remaining teams progressed into the Super Sixes. During this stage, results and points from matches between the teams that had qualified were carried over, and each team played a further three matches, against those teams that had advanced from the other group. England and New Zealand met each other in the first match of the Super Sixes. England batted first, and despite being 96 for four at one stage, 57 runs from Edwards, and a rapid 22 runs from Gunn, helped their side recover to post a total of 201 for five. In response, New Zealand began positively, and were boosted by a half-century from their captain, Tiffen, but the spin bowling of Edwards, Marsh and Colvin controlled the run rate, and New Zealand were eventually bowled out for 170, Edwards taking four wickets. England's following match was against the West Indies, and they once again surpassed 200 runs after batting first. Sarah Taylor, Claire Taylor and Atkins all scored half-centuries to propel England to their total of 236 for eight. The English bowlers then dismissed the West Indies for 90 runs, Marsh collecting three wickets. The win secured England a place in the final, irrespective of the result of their final Super Sixes match against Australia. After losing their first Super Sixes match to England, New Zealand faced an Indian side which had beaten Australia in their first Super Six contest. India batted first and scored 207, during an innings in which they lost four batters to run outs. New Zealand began their response well, putting on a partnership of 78 runs for the first wicket between Pulford and Tiffen. After Tiffen's dismissal, Bates supported Pulford, who eventually fell for 71 runs, and New Zealand reached their target with 14 balls to spare. New Zealand set a record partnership for the second wicket in women's ODIs in their final match: Bates scored 168 and Tiffen 100 as the pair put on 262 runs together. Bates played an aggressive innings, scoring her runs from 105 balls, including 6 sixes and 19 fours. New Zealand reached 373 from their overs, and bowled Pakistan out for 150, earning themselves a 223-run victory, and qualifying for the final. England were outplayed by Australia in their final Super Six match: Shelley Nitschke slowed the run rate during her bowling, taking two wickets and restricting England to just 14 runs from her 10 overs. England were bowled out for 161, a total Australia chased down within 34 overs. England's loss to Australia ended a 17-match unbeaten run. Build-up The final was a repeat of the 1993 tournament, when England won at Lord's. Both sides had won the World Cup previously, but only when hosting the tournament. New Zealand achieved the feat in 2000, while England were winners in both 1973 and 1993. As well as losing the 1993 final to England, New Zealand were also finalists in 1997, losing to Australia in India. England had contested five previous finals; losing to Australia in subsequent tournaments in 1978, 1982 and 1988. Huw Richards, writing for the International Herald Tribune, described both England and New Zealand as worthy finalists, and noted that he was disappointed with the performance of Australia, who finished fourth. Simon Wilde of The Times cited England as favourites: \\"In Edwards they have the ICC player of the year, in Claire Taylor the No 1-ranked batsman and in Isa Guha the No 1 bowler.\\" The New Zealand Heralds Mark Geenty concurred that England were favourites, describing them as \\"the form side of recent years\\". England had beaten New Zealand in their most recent four matches, including their victory over them during the Super Sixes stage of the competition. New Zealand's coach, Gary Stead, said that his team would aim to play their normal \\"aggressive style of play and although that may be a bit more high risk, I think it's the style that we play best.\\" After the Australian team was knocked out, local press coverage for the match diminished; only three journalists attended the pre-game press conference for the final. A reporter for the BBC, Alison Mitchell, said that in the Australian newspapers, \\"the nationals and even most of the locals I flicked through on Saturday carried nothing except one slim column\\". The 2009 World Cup was the first to be televised globally; ESPN Star Sports provided coverage from seven matches, including the final. As well as being available on television, the matches were streamed on the ESPN Star Sports website. The match was also broadcast on the radio; Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the BBC provided joint coverage. England all-rounder Gunn aggravated a calf-strain during the warm-up, and 10 minutes before the start was replaced by the team's vice-captain, Nicky Shaw. Match =Summary= alt=Lucy Doolan leaving a cricket field The final was played on a fine day at the North Sydney Oval, a multi-purpose stadium in North Sydney, New South Wales. The ground had hosted matches earlier in the tournament, and during the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, but, as of 2020, has not hosted men's international cricket. Played in front of a crowd of 2,300, the match began at 10:00 AEDT (23:00 GMT), with a scheduled lunch interval from 13:10 to 13:55. Steve Davis, of Australia, and the South African Brian Jerling were appointed as the on-field umpires for the match. Davis was a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, the highest designation for an umpire, while Jerling was on the International Panel of Umpires and Referees, the next most senior designation. Tyron Wijewardene and Jeff Brookes fulfilled the off-field roles of third and fourth umpires respectively, and Brian Aldridge served as match referee. Aldridge had previously umpired the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final. Despite conditions conducive to swing bowling, New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, chose to bat first after winning the toss. England opened the bowling with Katherine Brunt and Isa Guha. Brunt's bowling spell was described by the BBC's Aimee Lewis as \\"superb\\", and teammate Shaw credited her with putting the New Zealand batters under pressure. The New Zealand opening batters, Pulford and Tiffen, put on 26 runs together before Pulford was caught by Claire Taylor off the bowling of Guha, having scored 8 runs. According to Roesler, players on both teams showed some early nerves: Tiffen played some uncertain shots, while Guha bowled some wide deliveries. New Zealand progressed to 46 for one before England made their first bowling change. The England vice-captain, Shaw, was brought on, and made an immediate impact. In her first over, Bates attempted a loft over mid-on, and was caught by Atkins. The following ball, Satterthwaite fell for a duck, edging a delivery to the wicket-keeper, Sarah Taylor, leaving New Zealand 49 for three. Four overs later, Tiffen was also dismissed by Shaw, caught behind by Sarah Taylor. McGlashan was described by Lewis as looking \\"in fine touch\\", but after scoring 21 runs from 20 deliveries, she was caught at mid-wicket by Greenway off the bowling of Colvin. After 20 overs, New Zealand were 74 for five, their most prolific batters of the tournament having been dismissed. Marsh subsequently bowled Mason for 13, while Tsukigawa edged a delivery from Brunt for 2: New Zealand's innings collapsed to 101 for seven. Doolan joined Browne at the crease, and the pair helped to recover the innings somewhat: Doolan scored 48 runs in a partnership of 63 to help New Zealand to their total of 166. After the dismissal of Doolan, who was stumped off a wide delivery, New Zealand subsided rapidly, losing their final two wickets for just two more runs. The New Zealand Herald criticised the batting as being \\"indifferent\\", while Richards credited England for their \\"tight bowling and fielding\\" to restrict New Zealand. Simon Briggs of The Daily Telegraph described the start of England's chase as being \\"smooth and confident\\": opening batters Atkins and Sarah Taylor built a partnership larger than any managed by New Zealand, scoring 74 runs. Taylor was the first batter out, caught by Tiffen at mid- wicket from the off-spin bowling of Doolan for 39 runs. Claire Taylor came to the crease upon Sarah Taylor's dismissal and played with a similar attacking intent, striking four boundaries during her 21 runs before she was bowled by Mason, with England 109 for two. Atkins played a patient innings, and scored the most runs for her side, accruing 40 from 85 balls, eventually being caught by Sophie Devine from the bowling of Dooley. England's middle order suffered their own collapse against the spin bowling of Doolan and Mason; their scoring rate slowing significantly from 4.78 runs per over at the end of the fourteenth over to 3.58 twenty overs later. Edwards became Dooley's third wicket when she was given out after being caught by wicket-keeper Rachel Priest for 10 runs, though Cricinfo suggested that she had not actually hit the ball. Despite their struggles through the middle overs, Richards opined that \\"England never looked like losing.\\" Greenway and Morgan were both dismissed for single-figure totals: Greenway had survived an early appeal when she was caught after the ball had hit her pads, but was later caught by Satterthwaite off the bowling of Mason for eight runs, to leave England on 139 for five; Morgan was the victim of a what Lewis described as a \\"sloppy run out\\" shortly thereafter, moving the score to 149 for six. It was Shaw who once again galvanised England, batting with a more attacking style than those that had struggled before her. Her score of 17 not out pushed England towards the winning target, and a single from Colvin secured victory for England with 23 balls remaining in the innings. Shaw's contribution earned her the player of the match accolade. =Scorecard= { style=\\"text-align:center; width: 60%;\\" class=wikitable + New Zealand batting innings - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Batter ! scope=\\"col\\"  Method of dismissal ! scope=\\"col\\"  Runs ! scope=\\"col\\"  Balls ! scope=\\"col\\"  Strike rate - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text- align: left;\\"  Kate Pulford  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Claire Taylor b Isa Guha  8  23  34.78 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Haidee Tiffen  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Sarah Taylor b Nicky Shaw  30  56  53.57 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Suzie Bates  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Caroline Atkins b Nicky Shaw  2  7  28.57 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Amy Satterthwaite  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Sarah Taylor b Nicky Shaw  0  1  0.00 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Sara McGlashan  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Lydia Greenway b Holly Colvin  21  20  105.00 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Aimee Mason  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  b Laura Marsh  13  18  72.22 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Nicola Browne  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  lbw b Nicky Shaw  25  78  32.05 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Sarah Tsukigawa  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  c Sarah Taylor b Katherine Brunt  2  18  11.11 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Lucy Doolan  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  st Sarah Taylor b Laura Marsh  48  57  84.21 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Sophie Devine  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  lbw b Charlotte Edwards  0  5  0.00 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Rachel Priest  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  not out  0  1  0.00 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Extras  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  (2 leg byes, 15 wides)  17  colspan=\\"2\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Totals  style=\\" text-align: left;\\"  (47.2 overs)  166  colspan=\\"2\\"  3.50 runs per over } { style=\\"text-align: center; width: 60%;\\" class=wikitable + England bowling - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Bowler ! scope=\\"col\\"  Overs ! scope=\\"col\\"  Maidens ! scope=\\"col\\"  Runs ! scope=\\"col\\"  Wickets ! scope=\\"col\\"  Economy - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Katherine Brunt  10  3  33  1  3.30 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Isa Guha  5  0  24  1  4.80 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Nicky Shaw  8.2  0  34  4  4.08 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text- align: left;\\"  Holly Colvin  10  1  26  1  2.60 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Laura Marsh  10  3  34  2  3.40 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\\"  Charlotte Edwards  4  1  13  1  3.25 } { style=\\"text-align:center; width: 60%;\\" class=wikitable + England batting innings - !

Shaw, who had not expected to play, said after the match; \\"I started the day crying, I finished it crying, but we won a World Cup in between\\". New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, reflected after the match, \\"Maybe there were some nerves in amongst the camp. We didn't hype it up to be anything more than another day at the office, unfortunately it was a bad day at the office.\\" The team of the tournament included seven finalists: England's Edwards was selected as captain, and was joined by teammates Brunt, Marsh, Claire Taylor and Sarah Taylor. Bates and Pulford represented New Zealand in the team, while Devine was named as the team's twelfth woman. Claire Taylor, who finished the tournament as the leading run- scorer, was named as the player of the tournament. The month after the final, Taylor became the first woman to be selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. Both Taylor and Edwards were awarded MBEs for their services to cricket; Edwards received hers in the 2009 Birthday Honours, while Taylor's came in the 2010 New Year Honours. The England team flew back to the United Kingdom in economy class; Mitchell highlighted the contrast with the England men's team, who regularly flew business class. They held a reception at Lord's in London upon their return, but the former sports minister, Richard Caborn, lamented the low-key celebrations, saying that \\"I would have a Number 10 reception, a reception at the House of Commons, and, at the appropriate time, in the Lords.\\" In her history of women's cricket, Rafaelle Nicholson was critical of some of the reporting on the final, saying that \\"coverage increasingly appears to compare women's cricket with the men's game, and to treat the male version as 'real cricket'\\". The English journalists Simon Wilde and Lawrence Booth credited the contracts introduced in 2008 as being critical to England's success. Booth highlighted the contrast with New Zealand's captain, Tiffin, who had retired after the World Cup, claiming: \\"If I was paid properly, I'd still be playing.\\" The two sides met again three months later to contest the final of the 2009 Women's World Twenty20, which England also won. Each of the top four in the 2009 tournament automatically qualified for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup. Neither England nor New Zealand reached the final of that tournament, but instead met in the third-place playoff, which England won by four wickets.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and has public facing divisions, Gleeson Homes and Gleeson Strategic Land. History The business was founded by Michael Joseph Gleeson, the official date given by the company being 1903.Prospectus 1960 Having left his native Galway, Michael Gleeson worked for a small building firm in Sheffield, married the owner‚Äôs daughter and effectively took control of the business in 1903. The name of the business was changed to M J Gleeson in 1915.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. , Michael Gleeson operated as a contractor and a developer in the Sheffield area, and owned cinemas and a racetrack. The firm began taking contracts in southeast England in 1930 and in 1932 Michael sent his nephew John Patrick 'Jack' Gleeson to manage the embryonic housing developments. Gleeson began with building an estate of some 750 houses in Cheam, followed by smaller estates in Ewell and Sutton, all at the time in Surrey.Alan Jackson, Semi-Detached London, 1973 During World War II, Gleeson concentrated on the construction of aerodromes for military use, giving it civil engineering capability that was to be its strength after the war. Although the company again undertook housing and property development in 1955, the flotation of 1960 stressed civil engineering contracts which included power stations, sewage works and sea defences. Like his uncle before him, Jack had no sons and brought in his nephew to succeed him; Dermot Gleeson had been working in the political arena and first joined the Board as a non executive director in 1973; he joined the company full time in 1979, became deputy managing director in 1981 and chief executive in 1988. The group had been extending its property holdings, and it used the housing recession of 1990, to increase its commitment to private housing. The small quoted company, Colroy, was bought in 1991, followed by the residential business of the Portman Building Society in October 1994. In 2005, the group made a ¬£18m loss, primarily due to losses in the building division, which was then sold to the management. A strategic review was announced in March 2006. The civil engineering business would be sold (it was bought by the Black & Veatch) as would peripheral businesses; the investment properties would be put up for sale, and traditional speculative housing replaced by urban regeneration.Press statement 31 March 2006 By the end of the year, the group was concentrating on urban regeneration, residential property management and land trading. However, substantial losses were again incurred in 2008 and 2009; costs were cut and the geographical focus was narrowed to the north of England.Gleeson accounts 2008-11 Following the departure of CEO Jolyon Harrison, appointed in 2012, James Thomson, former CEO of Keepmoat Homes, was appointed chief executive officer on an interim basis in June 2019. Gleeson forecast a 45% fall in revenue for the financial year to 30 June 2020, due to the impact of the Covid19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom..

It has been built in several versions, with differing guidance systems, and is suitable for launching from ships or aircraft; in the latter form the weapons system is known as Marte. A sea-skimming, solid-propellant missile, it carries a semi-armour piercing warhead. It was initially developed during the 1960s and has been deployed by at least six countries. It was used during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, with at least six ships being hit. Development and design Contraves Italiana, an Italian subsidiary of the Swiss armaments company Oerlikon Contraves, began development of a short-ranged () ship-based anti-ship missile system, named Nettuno in 1963. Guidance of Nettuno was by beam riding for course control, with altitude controlled automatically by an onboard radar altimeter, allowing the missile to carry out sea-skimming attacks. Command guidance was an alternative guidance method if jamming made the beam-riding method unusable. In 1965, Contraves Italiana began work on an improved missile, Vulcano, which used the same guidance system, but included a two-stage (booster + sustainer) rocket motor to give a longer () range. Both missiles could be fired from a five-round trainable launcher.Pretty and Archer 1972, pp. 42‚Äì43.Pretty 1977, pp. 61‚Äì62. Testing of Nettuno began in 1966,Pretty 1977, p. 61. with a trial installation being made on the Freccia-class patrol boat Saetta of the Italian navy, with the five-round launcher replacing a Bofors 40 mm gun.Moore 1979, p. 279.

A Marte ER on display aboard an Italian FREMM multipurpose frigate The Marte ER, an improvement on the missile family, replaced the rocket motor with Williams WJ-24-8G turbojet propulsion and added a new ISO-caliber cylinder cell, which made it shorter in length but extended its range to over . Fitting trials of the Marte-ER onto the NH90 helicopter, which can carry two missiles, occurred in June 2014; a larger anti-ship missile like the Exocet was rejected for integration as physically too long and heavy.

He was mostly known for his activities as impresario for which he was eventually conferred upon as Doctor of Music. G√∂sta Schwarck was born into an artist family of Danish and German descent on September 14, 1915 in North East Germany. His father was a conductor Ernst Poul Schwarck and his mother an opera singer Marguerite Brian-Schwarck He was active since the early 1930s, first as a composer and later as a sales manager as well as touring choir leader. He became self-employed at an early age with an own sales organization. In the early 1950s and throughout the decade he organised Denmark's first national beauty pageants and became the official national representation of the Miss Denmark, Miss World and Miss Europe. From 1957 onwards he was also an international impresario for classical musical events through his company International Concert Management, later to be known as Dr. G√∂sta Schwarck International Ltd.  Early years  In the early years he led a twin career as composer and sales manager for the Hother Hellenberg perfume company. He published records and music scores in collaboration with Sven Rye, Gull-Maj Norin, Greta Keller and others  1946‚Äì1947 military service  During the serving of the Danish military service in the aftermath of World War II he created a soldier's singing choir with which he toured in Denmark and abroad. The choir performed in the State Radio and published a record of their own. HM Frederik IX, King of Denmark, expressed his gratitude for the actions as it helped restore morale in post-war Europe. In contemporary concerts organized by G√∂sta Schwarck Ib Sch√∏nberg appeared as well as a young teenager Bent Fabricius Bjerre, who played along with his newly established orchestra. Later in life, G√∂sta Schwarck was often heard referring to his experience from his time as a soldier as the learning period during which the seeds were laid out for his later work as impresario.  1947‚Äì1998 The G√∂sta Schwarck Sales Organization  Starting in 1946, he was self-employed and set up a nationwide sales organization (Salgsorganisationen G√∂sta Schwarck) based on Adelgade 18 and later Vesterbrogade 27. With the motto \\"a new article every week\\" the start-up provided Denmark with cosmetics, health, clothing, new inventions and imports. Items included The Invisible Comb, Grand Massette and Denmark's first Bikini bathing suit designed by his sister and artist Christel. The first Miss Denmark pageants and various types of Variety Shows organized by G√∂sta Schwarck during this time was used as a promotional platform for his company's products.  1954‚Äì1960 beauty pageants  During a business lunch at Dyrehavsbakken he became acquainted with Albert V. Unruh, a theatre director who owned a playhouse that suffered from a strongly declining turnover. With G√∂sta Schwarck helping with marketing, ideas, sales and promotion, long queues of visitors were seen only a few days later, in front of the theater, which would otherwise have gone bankrupt. In this period G√∂sta Schwarck organised national beauty pageants and his organisation was the Danish representative of Miss Europe, Miss World and Miss Universe. In 1958 MGM actor Errol Flynn accepted an invitation to come from the US and participate in the panel of judges - during this he discovered G√∂sta Schwarck's musical talent and promoted him to his own agents. According to G√∂sta Schwarck's own records he was offered career opportunities in Hollywood that he turned down.  1957‚Äì2010 concert management  After a serious car accident in Hamburg in 1954 G√∂sta Schwarck focused on classical music. A dedicated concert management organisation was established and the profits from his cosmetics company was funneled directly into making it possible for some of the greatest classical contemporary musicians to come to a small country like Denmark. Alexander Borovsky, Nikita Magaloff, Shura Cherkassky, Yury Boukoff, Walter Klien, Jakob Gimpel, Sviatoslav Richter, Adam Harasiewicz, Grigory Sokolov and others sat at the grand pianos in Danish concert halls and Victor Schi√∏ler wrote a long, open letter where he praised the actions by G√∂sta Schwarck with the introductory words \\"The Danish music scene owes much to you.\\" At the age of 40 years he refined his piano skills with an education at The Royal Danish Academy of Music and graduated as a concert pianist under the supervision of Herman D. Koppel. His musical studies were carried out alongside running his cosmetics company, newly established concert management and taking care of a growing family. In later years he moved away from the piano art and continued to moved to other art forms to organize nationwide tours for the Vienna Boys' Choir, Vlach and Janacek Quartet, Carlo Zecchi, Kyung-Wha Chung, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Alexander Lazarev and others and invited famous voices as Boris Christov Christa Ludwig Mirella Freni, Teresa Berganza, Ghena Dimitrova and others to Denmark. In 1975 he married the young Bulgarian pianist Assia Zlatkowa. In the mid-1980s, G√∂sta Schwarck was the first in Denmark to get the Soviet Bolshoi Opera to Denmark. Within the same year he announced that he would set up Verdi's Aida with 264 participants at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. In 1988, he became the first in Denmark - and Scandinavia - to persuade the late Luciano Pavarotti to visit the capital with the Royal Danish Orchestra as the orchestra. After experiencing several issues with the financing, he mortgaged his own house and put all of his personal belongings at risk to be able to make the event happen. After he had paved the way and shown that such spectacular events were possible in Denmark, the national Radio of Denmark and other large organisations followed in his footsteps years later with similar events. G√∂sta Schwarck was responsible for organizing thousands of unique cultural events, both within and outside of Denmark. All of this he achieved in parallel with the running of his wholesale company \\"Salgsorganisationen G√∂sta Schwarck\\" which later became the mail order company \\"Euro Pharma ApS\\" which all helped finance the cultural events. During the first 20‚Äì30 years, he set their own personal finances over the track and posted their own money into the music, only driven by the desire to create unprecedented and unparalleled events. = 1970‚Äì2008 international honors = Through the years he was shown honor with orders, medals and governmental acknowledgements from Germany, France, USA, Russia, the Soviet Union, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Israel and Hungary. In 1977, he was conferred upon with a degree of Honorary Doctor from the Chicago Conservatory. The greatest honor came in 2008 when he was awarded the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius by the Bulgarian president \\\\- The highest honor that can be assigned by the head of state in recognition of special efforts in art and science.Orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria#Orders 4 He was never granted similar honors in his home country, despite of his contributions to Denmark.

Appearance Mysis salemaai is a transparent shrimp-like crustacean, of less than length. It has two pairs of relatively long antennae, associated with rounded antennal plates; large, stalked compound eyes; the thorax covered by a coat-like carapace; a muscular, cylindrical abdomen; and a tail fan featuring a telson with a V-shaped terminal cleft. Reproducing females bear a prominent brood pouch (marsupium) between their legs. Mysis are often called opossum shrimp. Distribution Mysis salemaai is a North European species which lives both in fresh and brackish waters. It is found in ten lakes on the island of Ireland, including Lough Neagh, Lough Erne, Lough Corrib and Lough Ree. It is also found in several lakes of Southern Scandinavia, including Fureso in Denmark and the large lakes V√§nern and V√§ttern in Sweden, and also in the Republic of Karelia. Mysis salemaai is also common in the Baltic Sea, where it lives in offshore waters of the diluted northern parts of the basin. Previously M. salemaai was confused with Mysis relicta, which is a morphologically similar sibling species. The distributions of the two species overlap in the Baltic Sea and some lakes of Sweden, but M. relicta is not found in Ireland.

It opened in 1852. When the Tay Rail Bridge opened in 1878 residential travel to Dundee was encouraged. The railway was engineered as a low-cost line by Thomas Bouch and the company suffered adversely from that in later years, and sold their line to the larger North British Railway in 1877. The line was successful until road transport competition began to abstract traffic, and when the Tay Road Bridge opened in 1966, 40% of the line's passenger carryings were lost immediately. Decline continued and the line closed completely in 1969. History =Before the St Andrews Railway= Railtour train crossing the estuary of the River Eden in 1965The town of St Andrews is ancient. The University of St Andrews was founded in 1411, but there was relatively little industry in the town, linen weaving being the chief occupation., and agriculture; there was a paper mill at Guard Bridge.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The engineer Robert Stevenson was commissioned to survey a railway route crossing Fife in 1819; the route he selected was similar to the later Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, running some distance from St Andrews. However this would have been a long distance route and the steam locomotives of the day were not practicable, and the scheme was dropped. In 1835 John Geddes surveyed a line from Burntisland to Ladybank, forking there and running respectively to Perth and the location that became Tayport. This scheme too failed to develop into a proposal, but a revised survey of 1840 gained support as the economic situation improved, and as railways elsewhere had demonstrated that longer distances could be handled by railways. In 1840 the Edinburgh and Northern Railway was proposed, following this route, and the proposal led to an authorising Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845. There were some late changes to the proposed route, but the Edinburgh and Northern Railway's line opened on 20 September 1847 between Burntisland and Cupar by way of Kirkcaldy and Ladybank. The Company had changed its name on 27 July 1847 to the Edinburgh Perth and Dundee Railway (EP&DR;) on merging with its partner railway at Granton.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, It extended to Leuchars, not far from St Andrews on 17 May 1848. The Edinburgh and Northern was an immediate success, although the Forth had to be crossed by ferry from Granton: at this stage there was no question of bridging the Forth or the lower Tay. The original prospectus for the Edinburgh and Northern had included a branch line to St Andrews, but this was not included in the Parliamentary Bill; by November 1846 shareholders were asking if the St Andrews branch should now be addressed, and in the following Parliamentary session, a Bill was presented, and the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (St Andrews and Newburgh Harbour Railway Extension) Act was passed on 22 July 1847. At this stage, before the first train had run on the main line, the Edinburgh and Northern, soon to be the EP&DR;, was concentrating its resources on construction of its extensive original routes; completion to Ferryport-on-Craig (renamed Tayport) and giving ferry access to Dundee was only achieved on 17 May 1850 and by now the Company had run out of money.Andrew Hajducki, Michael Jodeluk and Alan Simpson, The St Andrews Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2008, =A local scheme= The St Andrews RailwayPeople in St Andrews, seeing the reality of the Edinburgh and Northern position, decided that independent action was called for, and on 19 December 1850 a meeting agreed to promote a local scheme. They moved quickly and obtained the authorisation for their railway by the St Andrews Railway Act of 3 July 1851,E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 with capital of ¬£21,000. It was emphasised that the subscribers to the line were local, avoiding getting involved in the contrary strategies of remote shareholders, and the directors of the new company had no previous railway experience. They engaged as their engineer Thomas Bouch, and the contractor was Kenneth Matthieson. This was Bouch's first commission in private practice, and he determined to make a name for himself by designing cheap local railways; he argued that the later profitability of heavily engineered lines was dragged down by large and unnecessary costs at the construction stage.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, Once again the Company moved quickly, for the contract for construction was signed with Matthieson on 11 August 1851. The new line was to make a physical junction with the Edinburgh and Northern line about a mile south of Leuchars station;There was no station at the point of junction until 1878; for the time being St Andrews trains continued along the EP&DR; line to Leuchars station. Thomas (page 12) refers to the 1878 Junction station out of chronological order, implying immediate provision, but that was not the case. the village of Leuchars was small at the time. There was to be one intermediate station at Guardbridge,Frequently spelt Guard Bridge. immediately west of the River Eden crossing. St Andrews was a considerable community at the time, and the station there was some distance short of the centre, at the \\"sheep park\\",James K Corstorphine, East of Thornton Junction: The Story of the Fife Coast Line, self published by Corstorphine, Leven, 1995, just beyond the seventeenth hole of the Old Course. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club had vigorously opposed a closer approach. =Completion and opening= Construction proceeded well and opening was anticipated for the end of June 1852. The line travelled over flat land which had been cheaply acquired.William Scott Bruce, The railways of Fife, Melven Press, 1980, , pages 80 - 84 An arrangement with the Edinburgh and Northern Railway whereby they would work the trains was concluded, to run for 25 years from 1 July 1852, with the E&NR; paying 4.5% on St Andrews Railway shares. Captain Laffan of the Board of Trade inspected the line on 24 June 1852 and approved it for opening. There was an official opening ceremony on 29 June 1852 and a full public opening on 1 July 1852.Hajducki and Thomas (NBR volume 1); Ross (page 38) says opening was on 29 May 1852.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The line had cost ¬£21,565 to construct.This was reckoned when there were still some payments due for land and final works; the gross cost of construction was probably ¬£25,314. The train services consisted of four trains each way daily except Sundays. Passenger traffic developed well, and there was a considerable volume of excursion traffic in to St Andrews. Coach services were run from some of the nearby towns, including Crail, Pittenweem and Anstruther, to St Andrews, enabling onward travel by train. The journey on the branch took twenty minutes. July saw a \\"monster\\" excursion to Glasgow. Goods traffic was less significant, reflecting the relative absence of industry at St Andrews. Although some improvements had been made to the Leuchars station (which had been built as a rudimentary wayside stop) there were complaints about the connectional arrangements there; the branch trains made poor connections with the main line trains, and delays were attributed to improper formation of the main line trains. =Poor quality of track and bridges= St Andrews Station with Railtour in 1965As early as 1853 the Company was experiencing difficulty with the permanent way; Bouch's scheme for cheap railway construction had included laying sleepers at a pitch of four feet, considerably wider spacing than was usual. There were two significant timber trestle bridges over tidal water, at the Water of Mottray and the River Eden. At this time they were considered to be deteriorating, and it was observed that they had not been treated with preservative at the time of construction: another of Bouch's cost-saving measures. On 29 July 1862 the EP&DR; was taken over by the North British Railway (NBR). The larger company reviewed the arrangements at St Andrews. Locomotive technology had developed over these early years, and heavier and more efficient locomotives were in common use;Thomas says that the engine concerned was to be a small Hawthorn four- coupled tank. the NBR wished to bring them on to the line, but the track and the bridges were considered not strong enough to accommodate them. It was said that ¬£16,000 to ¬£20,000 was required to replace the wooden bridges, and this was utterly beyond the financial resources of the St Andrews Company, which now began to think of selling their line to the NBR. Bouch was asked directly by the NBR Chairman to consider the matter and he estimated that ¬£12,561 was enough to relay the track in stronger materials and to replace the two bridges. When the St Andrews Railway Board discovered that this discussion had been taking place behind their backs, they were outraged: \\"No company would employ engines of 30 tons or upwards to work a branch 4¬Ω miles in length.\\" Hodgson, the Chairman of the North British Railway had been preparing plans to absorb the St Andrews Railway, but the Board of the latter made it clear that they would oppose any Parliamentary Bill for such an acquisition, and the NBR was obliged to let the matter drop. Notwithstanding the bad feeling between the two Companies, the contractual working agreements was still in force, and from June 1863 there were seven passenger trains each way daily, an eighth on Saturdays. On 16 May 1864 there was a derailment at Guardbridge. An afternoon train from Leuchars to St Andrews hauled by an 0-4-2 locomotive running tender first and hauling four passenger vehicles, derailed at a rail joint that had become displaced. The tender and locomotive left the track, but there were no injuries. Captain Rich of the Board of Trade reported on the accident, and he was extremely critical of the state of maintenance of the track; he concluded: \\"The accident ... was caused by the bad state of the St Andrews Railway.\\" He said that, \\"The line is of very light and poor construction,\\" and that the chairs \\"are weak, too narrow in the throat to admit a good key, and reported to be continually breaking\\". He added \\"I consider that the whole permanent way wants renewing.\\" He was also critical of the strength of the river bridges, and of the signals on the line.Report of Captain Rich to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade, dated 2 July 1864 The Board of the St Andrews company evidently did not agree, for they protested that the wooden bridges were never intended to be permanent, and at the next Shareholders' Meeting declared the customary dividend of 4¬Ω% instead of allocating any income to capital works improvements. =Sale to the North British Railway= The original working agreement with the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, inherited by the North British Railway, was due to expire on 31 July 1877, and this concentrated the mind of the St Andrews Company's proprietors on the difficulties of running a small railway company; they agreed to absorption by the North British Railway in 1877, ratified by the North British Railway (Amalgamation) Act of 1 August 1877.Hajducki, and Thomas (NBR volume 1); Carter and Corstorphine say 28 June 1877. This took effect in October 1877, with the ¬£21,000 capital of the St Andrews Company exchanged for 10.5% North British Railway St Andrews Lien Stock, earning a remarkable preference dividend of 10.5%. =Leuchars Junction station= The Leuchars station had been built at the village, but on 1 June 1878 the new line from near Leuchars to Dundee over the Tay Bridge was opened. This line made a junction with the Tayport line south of Leuchars station, but near the physical junction of the St Andrews line. The North British Railway opened a new station, Leuchars Junction, at the location and closed the original Leuchars station. This was all very well for interchange purposes, but was heavily criticised by the people of Leuchars, and on 1 December 1878 the earlier station was re-opened, being named Leuchars (Old). The opening of the Tay Bridge resulted in a considerable increase of passenger traffic to St Andrews, including an upsurge of excursion trains from Dundee. The passenger service on the branch was enhanced to 12 each way, and residential travel to Dundee began to grow significantly. However, there was never a Sunday service on the St Andrews line: it was said that to offer Sunday trains would only encourage vulgar day- trippers. =Connecting Anstruther= On 1 September 1863 Anstruther was connected to the Scottish railway network, from Leven. Anstruther is eight miles from St Andrews, and public opinion demanded that the two important towns should be connected directly by a railway. This was not immediately forthcoming, until the Anstruther and St Andrews Railway was authorised by Act of 26 August 1880. The terrain forced a circuitous route of 16 miles, with none of the intermediate stations close to the communities they purported to serve. The line was to run to Argyle, on the south-eastern side of St Andrews, and not close to the St Andrews Railway terminus. During construction of the Anstruther line, the contractor became bankrupt, and there was some delay in resuming the work. There were to be two St Andrews stations on opposite sides of the Burgh and the North British Railway proposed a payment of ¬£5,000 to a line connecting the stations and to the costs of the new through station That was agreed to, and was sanctioned by a second Anstruther and St Andrews Railway Act, of 16 July 1883. The Anstruther line approached rather slowly, reaching Boarhills in 1883, but it took until 1 July 1887 to open throughout to St Andrews.Hajducki and Corstorphine. Ross (page 134) says that the first passenger train was on 20 June 1887. The new through station was now the sole St Andrews passenger station; the former station was converted to a goods station, named St Andrews Links.First supplement to Quick (In August 1897 the proprietors of the Anstruther company sold their line to the North British Railway.) =Bouch's work replaced= Bouch's Tay Bridge collapsed on 28 December 1879, taking 59 lives with it, in the Tay Bridge disaster. The North British Railway built a replacement and it opened on 20 April 1887 to goods traffic. The first ordinary passenger train crossed on 20 June 1887, and there was a considerable resurgence of traffic to St Andrews.Dates from Ross, page 134; his narrative is difficult to follow. He says \\"... the main event of 1887 was the completion of the new Tay Bridge ... Its first passenger train crossed on 10 June with Directors and Guests [that is, not a public passenger train]. At North Queensferry [a] new locomotive was waiting to convey the party. The Board of Trade's final inspection of the bridge was not until the 16th, but goods trains were running across from the 13th. Opening for passenger services came on 20 June, the first southbound train being from Dundee to Burntisland via St Andrews and the newly opened Anstruther line.\\" On a much smaller scale, the two river bridges on the St Andrews line that Bouch had designed were by now in urgent need of replacement, and this was achieved in 1889. =1895 passenger service= The Tay Bridge encouraged much passenger business. The 1895 Bradshaw shows seventeen trains each way on the branch (and one extra on Wednesdays and Saturdays); the journey time from St Andrews to Leuchars was typically 15 minutes and Dundee could be reached from St Andrews in 38 minutes.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, =The twentieth century= Dismantled viaduct over the River Eden. This photograph was from a similar position to the first photograph)On 25 January 1909 the Newburgh and North of Fife Railway opened, giving a direct connection from Leuchars to Perth and St Andrews had a daily passenger train to Perth. In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" following the Railways Act 1921, and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). From 1925 bus services made serious inroads into passenger carryings on the St Andrews line. In 1948 the railways were again re-organised by Government, and taken into state ownership. The lines in the area were now part of the Scottish Region of British Railways. From this time, the goods traffic, already insubstantial, was also seriously hit by road competition. Diesel multiple units were introduced on the line from 15 June 1959. The decline in use of the lines accelerated, and the southward route from St Andrews to Crail closed to passengers on 4 September 1965, and to goods on 18 July 1966. In addition Guardbridge station closed to passengers on 4 September 1965,Gordon Stansfield, Fife's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 1998, and on 20 June 1966 Guardbridge and St Andrews Links stations closed to goods traffic. The opening of the Tay Road Bridge in August 1966 immediately led to a 40% reduction in passenger usage of the St Andrews line. In the midst of this depressing situation, the British Transport Commission built a new luxury hotel at St Andrews; it opened on 25 June 1968. The passenger business on the line was presumed to be terminal, and it was announced that the line would close in 1969. The Burgh Council protested, and British Railways offered to keep the railway open if the Council would make up the loss on the train service, ¬£20,000 annually. The Council declined the offer and the line closed to all traffic on 6 January 1969.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 There is no railway use of the former line and the original Links Station has been largely absorbed by the Old Course Hotel (although the Station Master's House remains - as a public house, The Jigger Inn); the platforms of the St Andrews New station have been removed, the station cutting partially in-filled and a car park and recycling facility now occupies the site.

The St Andrews Rail Link Campaign - 'StARLink' On 4 September 1989, a formal campaign was launched to reconnect St Andrews to the rail network. Operating under the acronym StARLink, the St Andrews Rail Link Campaign has advocated for the reconnection of St Andrews to the railway.

Shehki entered the music scene in the 1970s with his originally composed and written songs, with a touch of Persian music. He later earned a name for himself in Pakistani pop music and as a playback singer. Early life Though Shehki is Persian by origin but has been living in Pakistan as a Pakistani national for most of his life. His family name 'Shehki' comes from his Iranian father who used to work at the Iranian Consulate in Karachi. His father married a half-Iranian woman living in Karachi at the time. He studied engineering at the NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan and graduated from there in 1981. Later, he made a career in aviation. Due to his originality, Shehki is the first ever pop singer receiving national awards for consecutive years by Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), film and other national and international awards and recognitions. Playback singing Shehki's passion for music took him to the forefront of the Pakistani show business. Sohail Rana, a well-known Pakistani film and television music composer, conducted an audition for PTV, Karachi television station in 1973. Many boys and girls including Shehki participated in that audition. In fact, Shehki was Sohail Rana‚Äôs first choice because he had gained the top position in that audition. Career Shehki's debut song was ‚ÄòSambhal, sambhal kar chalna hai.‚Äô Music composer was Sohail Rana, the song was live telecast as an introduction by Karachi television station's program, 'Naghma Zaar'. Then a first full song \\"Mere pyaar ke tu sung sung\\" by TV music composer Niaz Ahmed and producer Ghazanfar Ali. Blessed with a good strong voice, trained in basics of music by his ustad Habib Ahmed Khan, and then Sohail Rana, Shehki soon gained public recognition. He lent his voice to Sehba Akhtar‚Äôs national song (quomi naghma), ‚ÄòMein bhee Pakistan hoon, tu bhee Pakistan hai.‚Äô a big hit of the time and 'Aye Watan Tere Betay Hain' by music composer, Sohail Rana. After doing a five years stint as a main feature in PTV Program \\"Jharney\\", produced by Shoaib Mansoor, he ended up as a highly popular artist, with many hits like \\"Meri Ankhon se iss dunya ko dekho, phir jo chaho tau chali jana\\", \\"Tumse bicharker\\", \\"Nazaray\\" and several other hit songs. He teamed up with Sultana Siddiqui doing a regular quarterly PTV show Dhanak as a singer and presenter. Then with Sahira Kazimi in PTV show Rang Tarang again for a long span of time. From that show, he piled up his hit songs like \\"Mere Bachpan Ke Din, Kitnay Achay thay Din\\" and \\"Ye Pehli Pehli Barish\\". He appeared with famous folk singer Allan Fakir to record this folk song, ‚ÄòTeray ishq mein jo doob gaya, Allah, Allah kar bhaiyya\\". \\"Ham Raat Bohat Roi\\" written by the poet Ibn-e-Insha again earned him the national award as the best singer. Due to his origin and fluency in Persian language, he did all Persian poetry programs on PTV of Allama Iqbal with its true essence. His numerous film songs are still remembered fondly, especially songs composed by Indian composer Babul Bose for film \\"Raaz\\". In Pakistani TV film Shorr with actress Babra Sharif, written and directed by Ghazanfar Ali, Shehki, besides playing the lead, also did the music score and film songs. Film career In his film career, he acted in a total of 9 films, his films achieved some success at the box office but the industry was already on the decline, so he left films.

Origins Jeremiah Milles' father was Rev. Jeremiah Milles (1675‚Äì1746), who was a fellow and tutor at Balliol College, Oxford from 1696 to 1705; became Rector of Riseholm, Lincolnshire in 1704; and was rector of Duloe, Cornwall for 42 years from 1704 until his death. The elder Jeremiah was the son of Rev. Isaac Milles (1638‚Äì1720) (youngest son of Thomas Milles of Carrington's Farm, Cockfield, Suffolk.Pishiobury. Accessed 26 November 2016.), vicar of Highclere, Hampshire, who was considered the model parish priest of his age ‚Äì there is a monument to him in Highclere Church. Isaac Milles' eldest son was Thomas Milles (1671‚Äì1740), Church of Ireland Bishop of Waterford and Lismore. Jeremiah Milles was his nephew and heir. Youth Milles was educated at Eton College and matriculated in 1729 as a gentleman-commoner at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (BA 1733, MA 1735, BD and DD 1747). In 1733 he went on his first grand tour of Europe visiting France and Italy with his cousin, the Rev. Dr. Richard Pococke, anthropologist, travel writer and diarist, later Bishop of Ossory and Meath. The two returned from their travels in 1734 earlier than planned to allow Milles to take up Holy Orders and to assume the position of Treasurer of Lismore Cathedral, in the Diocese of their mutual uncle, Thomas Milles, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore. Two years later Rev. Milles and Dr. Pococke set out on their second grand tour, this time visiting the Low Countries, Germany, Austria, Poland & Hungary. Milles returned alone in 1737 to attend the bishop, who was suffering from \\"the Gravel\\" (gallstones), leaving his cousin to continue his voyage to the East. Detailed accounts of their travels survive in a large collection of letters to Bishop Milles and Mrs. Pococke, as well as in a number of note-books, all in the British Library. Pococke published his travels in his pioneering book, A Description of the East (1743 & 1745), and the correspondence of the two cousins was published in 2011 as Letters from Abroad: The Grand Tour Correspondence of Richard Pococke & Jeremiah Milles. Career Milles became Precentor of Exeter in 1747 and in June 1762 Dean of Exeter, in succession to Dr Charles Lyttelton (1714‚Äì1768), who had been elected in 1762 Bishop of Carlisle. Lyttelton was President of the Society of Antiquaries, and had started a period of renovation of the fabric of Exeter Cathedral. Milles continued the work with great vigour. He succeeded Lyttelton also as President of the Society of Antiquaries from 1768 until his death on 13 February 1784. Milles completed the renovation of the choir and presbytery planned by his predecessor, and laid new paving in the choir and fitted new wainscotting and choir stalls. These were later removed by Sir Gilbert Scott, and parts remain in the Deanery. In 1763 Milles removed the grave-stones of former bishops and canons from the floor of the choir and replaced them scattered throughout the aisles to replace worn paving. He was careful to be present when workmen lifted the slabs but nevertheless did not observe one of them slipping into his pocket a sapphire ring found in a coffin. The sharp-eyed bell-toller informed him of the theft and Milles wrote to Lyttleton about the incident: \\"The workmen I daresay took me for a conjuror for I told them there was a ring taken out of the grave, that they must produce it, and the guilty person immediately drew it out of his pocket\\". It is now in the collection of the Cathedral Library. His next project was the re-glazing of the great west window with armorial glass made by William Peckitt of York between 1764 and 1767. The glass was removed in 1904 but some was replaced in the windows of the cloister room in 1922. He ordered much cleaning, colouring, gilding and varnishing in the 1770s and painted the magnificent Bishop's Throne in 1777. He donated three velvet cushions and a new Bible and Book of Common Prayer for use at the altar. In 1772 he had most of the old church plate melted down and re-made, but spared a pair of 1629 flagons and 1693 candlesticks from his renovation. In 1777 he added new pews to the nave to cater for the growing congregations. He was succeeded by Dean Buller. Parochial Questionnaire In 1753 when still a prebendary of Exeter Fox, Adam, Parochial Queries: Printed Questionnaires and the Pursuit of Natural:Knowledge in the British Isles, 1650‚Äì1800, Edinburgh University he sent out a questionnaire to all parishes of the diocese of Exeter, in Devon, generally known as \\"Dean Milles' Questionnaire\\" or \\"Dean Milles' Parochial Questionnaire\\", the returns to which formed the basis for his \\"Parochial Collections for Devon\\" or \\"A Parochial History of Devon\\", compiled in 1755,Williams, Michael Aufr√®re, Medieval English Roodscreens, PhD History Thesis, 2008, Exeter University but never published by him as a book as he had intended.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959, p.97 The 120 numbered questions on two folio sheets were very detailed and varied, and concerned the history of the parish and manors within it, the armorials of the leading families, the geology, archaeological remains, colleges, hospitals, agriculture, etc. 15 questions concerned the parish church itself, including descriptions of ancient monuments. The answers were generally supplied by the parish priest or occasionally by the schoolmaster, as for example at Pilton. The 263 returns he received, equating to a 57% response, he bound together with his annotations on each parish into five volumes arranged alphabetically by parish and these form valuable historical records.Reed, Margaret, Pilton its Past and its People, Barnstaple, 1977, pp.3‚Äì8 Milles' manuscripts were purchased by the Bodleian Library at Sotheby's in 1843 for ¬£90.

A pair of portraits of the couple painted circa 1780-83 by George Romney exists in the collection of the Huntington Library Art Gallery, California. Their only son Thomas Gardiner Milles died an infant in 1786 and their sole heiress became their daughter Rose Milles (d.1824) who in 1810 married Rowland Alston (b.1782), MP for Hertfordshire 1835-41, 2nd son of Thomas Alston (d.1823) of Odell Castle, Bedfordshire, nephew and heir of Sir Rowland Alston, 6th Baronet (d.1790).Burke's Landed Gentry, 1937, pp.28-29, pedigrees of Alston of Odell & Alston of The Tofte Legacy Milles was a pioneer of the circulated questionnaire, and until the end of the eighteenth century was the most successful user of the technique as a research tool. Milles had been a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in London since 1741, and it was possibly from his example that James Theobald, the Society's president, proposed the production by the Society of its own questionnaire on natural and civil history \\"Whereby such gentlemen of learning and industry as should be disposed to promote usefull and entertaining researches of those kinds, might be directed in their choice of materials, and the Society reap the fruits of their labours and knowledge\\". In June 1754 he read out at the Society a pamphlet entitled \\"Queries Proposed to Gentlemen in the Several Parts of Great Britain, In hope of obtaining, from their Answers, a better Knowledge of its Antiquities and Natural History\\".

Life He was the son of Alured Clarke, of Godmanchester in Huntingdonshire, who died on 28 October 1744, aged 86, by his second wife, Ann, fourth daughter of the Rev. Charles Trimnell, rector of Ripton-Abbotts, in the same county, who died on 26 May 1755, aged 88. Bishop Charles Trimnell was his uncle, and his only brother was Charles Clarke (died 1750), baron of the exchequer. Clarke's education began at St Paul's School, London and from 1712 to 1719 he held one of its exhibitions. On 1 April 1713 he was admitted a pensioner at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, taking the degrees of B.A. 1716, M.A. 1720, D.D. 1728, and being elected to a fellowship in 1718. About 1720 he contested the post of Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, unsuccessfully. He rose rapidly in the church, by the influence of Whig relatives: he was chaplain in ordinary to George I and George II. The living of Chilbolton in Hampshire and a prebendal stall in Winchester Cathedral were bestowed on him in May 1723. He was installed as prebendary of Westminster in July 1731, and as dean of Exeter in January 1741, with a prebend in the Exeter Cathedral. His cathedral dignities, and the position of deputy clerk of the closet, were retained by him until his death. Clarke was afflicted with illness for many years before his death. In 1732, he thought of applying for the position of British consul at Algiers, for the benefit of the climate. But he stayed England, and gradually wasted away. He died on 31 May 1742. He was buried, without a monument, in Westminster Abbey. In politics Clarke was a Whig; his religious opinions were those of Queen Caroline of Ansbach and her spiritual adviser Samuel Clarke. Letters in Katherine Thomson's Memoirs of Viscountess Sundon show he was avid for preferment. Legacy Winchester County Hospital, the first in England outside London, was established in Hampshire in 1736, largely by Clarke's efforts, and its constitution and rules were written by him. He laid the foundation-stone of the Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter, of which he has been called the co-founder, on 27 August 1741. He also expended large sums in repair of the decanal house at Exeter. Works Clarke's main literary work was An Essay towards the Character of her late Majesty, Caroline (1738, and in German at Altona in the same year), considered rose-tinted. His other works were sermons: * Sermon preached at St. Paul's, 25 January 1726, on the anniversary meeting of gentlemen educated at St. Paul's School (1726). * Sermon preached before the House of Commons, at St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 31 January 1731 (1731, 2nd edit. 1731). * Sermon preached in Winchester Cathedral, before the governors of the County Hospital, at its opening, on St. Luke's Day, 18 Oct. 1736 (1737, 2nd edit. 1737, 3rd edit. Norwich, 1769). With this sermon went A Collection of Papers relating to the County Hospital at Winchester (1737), introduction by Clarke. * Sermon preached before the Trustees of the Charity Schools at Exeter Cathedral, 13 October 1741 (1741).

His first piano teacher was his mother, a pupil of Vasily Safonov, the great Russian pianist. He completed his studies at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1912 with a gold medal and the Anton Rubinstein Prize, Career He created great attention in the 1912 Anton Rubinstein competition which he won. He received a degree in law from St. Peterburg University alongside his music studies. Alexander Borovsky taught master- classes at the Moscow Conservatory from 1915 to 1920. The May 11, 1916 Musical Courier writes from Moscow newspaper of March 1915, \\"Alexander Borowski is a pupil of Anna Essipova. He is a pianist of great skill, power and alluring charm, with strong rhythm and well modulated dynamics. Mr. Borowski respects the composer's design and has the gift of bringing the spirit of it. Scriabine's Tenth Sonata (the last composed), a most difficult work of account of its complexity and theosophical spirit, was performed by Borowski at his recital with rarely deep analysis, glowing with fire progressively in a climax.\\" \\"Occasionally, in the midst of scores of concerts, most of which are only of mediocre quality, we are reminded of the adage that while, \\"many are called, few are chosen.\\" \\"One of the chosen, musically speaking of course, is the Russian pianist, Alexander Borowsky, who is certainly a rising star in the tonal heavens. One must hear him play Bach in order to admire his precision, clear articulation, dynamics and colorful shading. But not only does he excel in the classics, but he seems also to be a born interpreter of modern music, especially of the young Russian school. His success here was a genuine one.\\" After winning fame here as a pianist of widely diversified programs, Borovsky returned to Europe where, in 1937, he first devoted himself almost exclusively to presenting the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. At the outbreak of the war, Mr. Borovsky first went to South America, where he continued his Bach cycles‚Äîthe first such recitals ever to be presented in many of the Latin- American capitals‚Äîand where he earned fresh laurels. He gave live Bach evenings in Buenos Aires, with marked acclaim, and, as a result, was invited to repeat his performances under the auspices of the Cutura Artistica of S√£o Paulo, in Brazil. Mr. Borovsky now brings his Bach programs to the United States. Decided to leave Russia after the October Revolution he started touring in Europe and eventually made his American debut in Carnegie Hall in 1923. He became a US national in 1941 and a professor at the Boston University in 1956. He was a soloist with all the major orchestras in Europe and North and South America, appearing as soloist in more than 30 concerts with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the late Serge Koussevitzky. At the same time he began to record some of the significant works of Bach and Liszt and he was the first artist to record Bach's 30 Inventions and all of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies. Mr. Borovsky's work was distinguished by his objective interpretation of classical and romantic music. His playing of Bach, critics said, was notable for its architectural quality. Mme. Scriabin's writes in Musical Courier, October 18, 1917, page 27 \\"I also propose the name of Alexandre Borowsky, a young professor of the Conservatory of Moscow, who plays almost all the works of Scriabine, and who has already acquired a great reputation as a pianist in Russia. Mr. Borowsky is a member of the Scriabine Society.\\" \\"Addresses on various aspects of Scriabin's art have been given by MM. Braudo, Makovsky, and Bryanchanimov, and the performance of the later works and also of some posthumous pieces has been in the hands of Borovsky's pianoforte music. Borovsky's position is the more honourable since no Russian recital programme is complete without Scriabin's name, and this artist has therefore no rivals.\\" In 1923 Borowski writes in \\"Modern Masters of the Keyboard,\\" by Harriette Brower, \\"Yes I have a very large repertoire and am constantly adding to it. While I was in South America I gave many concerts in various cities. In Buenos Aires I gave twelve entirely different programs in ten weeks. I play much Russian music, of course--Scriabine, Prokofieff and many others. But I play the music of all countries and all epochs. American music and MacDowell. Very little American music is known in Russia, I think. As for MacDowell, of course we know him by name, and a few of the more brilliant numbers, such as the Hexen Tanz, Polonaise and Concerto for piano, but not the Sonatas. I should like to do one or more of these, and also some works by other American composers. Now that I have been in America, the musical growth of your country interests me immensely. I have had a happy two months here, and I hope to return for a longer stay. But now, after our two happy months, Madame and I are on the point of returning to Europe, as I have a tour of forty concerts on the other side, which will take me to London, Paris, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Germany. But all the time I shall look forward to my return to your beautiful country--America!\\" The following Welte-Mignon piano rolls were probably recorded in Russia by Borowski in 1910 at Moscow and St. Petersburg: #2029 Tchaikovswsky: Sonata, Op 27, in G, Movement 1, #2030 Rachmaninoff's Elegie, fr \\"Morceaux de fantasie\\", Op 3 No 1 in E-flat minor (January, 1910), #2031 Arensky: Etude, fr. 24 Morceaux caracteristiques, Op 36 no 13 in F-sharp, #2032: Liadow: Barcarolle, Op 44 in F-sharp, #2033 Rachmaninoff: Prelude, Op 23 No 3 in D minor (January 1910).

The screenplay concerns a Grand Prix racing car driver.The Wild Racers at Fabianforten.net Plot Stock car racer Jo Jo Quillico goes to Europe after an accident. He is hired by a race-car tycoon to be runner-up for a more experienced racer on the European circuit, working with his mechanic Charlie. However, in his first race, Jo Jo can't help winning. He has a series of love affairs, including with a shallow Englishwoman, but cannot see himself in a long-term relationship ‚Äì until he meets Katherine. He falls in love and begins to support his racing-car partner. When his partner is injured, Jo Jo takes his chance and scores several victories. However, he breaks up with Katherine. Cast *Fabian as Jo Jo Quillico *Mimsy Farmer as Katherine Pearson *Alan Haufrect as Virgil *Judy Cornwell as Pippy *David Landau as Ian *Warwick Sims as Charlie *Talia Shire *Dick Miller Production The film was partly funded by Roger Corman. Tamara Asseyev was working as Corman's assistant when assigned to help produce the film. Haller later said, \\"That movie began when Roger asked me to develop the script with Chuck Griffith. That meant I drove Chuck to Santa Barbara in my car and wouldn‚Äôt let him out of the hotel room until he had a certain amount of pages done. Then we went to Palm Springs and he‚Äôd dry out there. We finally ended up in La Jolla writing for a day or so there. After a week, we came back with the finished script.\\" Haller said the original play was to go to Europe. Corman would direct the first unit and Haller would direct second unit ‚Äì namely, filming all the races on Sunday. However, when he got to Europe, Corman had already shot one of the races and told Haller since that Haller knew the script better than Corman did, Haller should direct first unit while Corman did second unit. Eventually Corman went home for portions of the shoot. Asseyev says Daniel Haller only agreed to direct it if Roger Corman agreed to also finance Haller's pet project, Paddy (1970). The Wild Racers was shot in six countries in five and a half weeks with two weeks preparation. Most of the movie was filmed on locations without permission. \\"We were one step ahead of the law the whole time\\", says Haller.Haller p 197 This was a method which had been used by Corman on The Young Racers (1963). Talia Coppola played the second lead, scouted locations and did the set dressings. During production the film was known as Hell's Racers. Mimsy Farmer was working in a hospital in Canada when director Dan Haller called asking if she wanted to be in the film. \\"I jumped at the chance to go to Europe and also to see my brother Philip, who was living in London at the time\\", she later recalled. \\"It was the best move I‚Äôd made up to then and I loved traveling in France, Spain, and Holland.\\"\\"Mimsy Farmer: From Spencer's Mountain to More\\" Sixties Cinema, April 6, 2014 accessed July 5, 2014 The racing advisers were Peter Theobald (English), Jan Pieter Visser (Dutch), Jean Pierre Arlet (French) and Carlos Diego (Spanish). The movie was shot by Nestor Almendros, and Daniel Lacambre worked as camera operator. Almendros later called the experience on the film influential in his career: > It was an insignificant movie. But the importance of the experience was we > learned to work very fast. It's a two fold area; we realized that because > you are faster, you are not necessarily worse in cinema; and because you > take a long time to prepare something, it's not necessarily going to be > better.

But by the time we got to Paris we were totally > exhausted because it was a really grueling schedule and I would never even > get to see a location. Talia Coppola was with us on the film and she would > be scouting locations for us, and I'd tell her when you get to Rouen, or > someplace like that, just go buy all the postcards you can and we'll use > that to find our locations. That's how we did a lot of it.Roger Corman Univ. > Press of Mississippi, 2011 p 195, accessed July 13, 2014 Part of the film was shot in Paris during the 1968 riots and also Spain. Haller said Alemndros, a fugitive from Franco's Spain, was highly anxious during the Spanish leg of the shoot for fear he would be arrested for leaving the country. Roger Corman said the film included \\"one of the greatest examples of co-ordinated shooting I've ever been involved with.\\" Corman: > When we were in Paris we wanted a scene by the eternal flame of the Arc de > Triomphe. Not only could we not get permission to shoot there, we didn't > even have permission to be shooting in France! (laughter) So we worked out a > sequence where I was in one car, Nestor was in one car, Chuck Hannawalt was > in one car, and the two actors, Fabian and Mimsy Farmer, were in another > car.

Nestor put the camera down and Fabian and Mimsy > knew exactly where to go. Dan got the shot and we jumped back in our cars > and took off.Haller p 196 author=Peter Gardiner, who had done film effects for Roger Corman on The Trip, provided special effects. One of the lead actors was dubbed by Corman regular Dick Miller, who appears in a cameo.Tim Lucas, \\"Dubs Come Unexpectedly!\\" Video Watchblog August 12, 2006 accessed July 7, 2014 Frances Doel worked as a script supervisor. Joe Dante who later worked for Corman at New World Pictures said that: > The idea is, the guy went from race to race, and they had to have the races > look different.

The Christian Science Monitor called it \\"unusually well- photographed... the film is aimed at teenagers but thwarts its own purpose by inclusion of too much sexuality.\\" Quentin Tarantino later described The Wild Racers as his favorite racing car film: > It's shot like an Antonioni movie, with very little dialogue, most of which > is voice-over.

He won an award for the best fight scene for the Australian made action movie Among Dead Men at International Film Festival in Pasadena, California. An athlete in Afghanistan, Sadiqi left as the Taliban arrived and landed in Australia as a refuge in 1999 at Port Hedland Detention Centre. Martial Arts expert Hussain Sadiqi was born on 1981 in the central highlands of Afghanistan in Urozgan (Daykundi). He began his Martial Arts training when he was 9 years old. He attained the top ranking Martial Arts position in Afghanistan at a young age and become the National Champion at the age of 16. At 18 he became the captain of Afghanistan National Team. In 1999 he had to flee Afghanistan because of war; he had become a Taliban target due to his high profile. His new journey began in 1999 when he left Afghanistan in search of a new homeland. His family paid US$5000.00 to a smuggler to get Hussain out of Afghanistan to safety. His journey entailed traveling from central Afghanistan to Pakistan, then moving to Indonesia, and finally boarding a fishing boat along with 147 other asylums. It took him three months to reach Australia. Soon after arriving in Australia he was sent to a Detention Center for six months until he was released on a temporary protection visa. After being released he was selected to compete for the Afghan Tae Kwon Do team at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and carry his country flag at the Opening Ceremony. A couple of days before the Games started the International Olympic Committee banned the Afghan team because the Taliban, which controlled Afghanistan at the time, would not allow women compete. Hussain gained many fans with his Martial arts based documentary \\"The Art of Fighting\\",https://vimeo.com/83818210 directed by Gavain Browne and produced by Alex Barnes. He carried into this role childhood memories of a desolate mountainous region of central Afghanistan and the battered photograph of Bruce Lee shown to him by his older brother. When Hussain was growing up in Afghanistan he harbored two dreams ‚Äì one to take part in the Olympic Games, and the other to become a star of a Martial Arts films like his childhood hero Bruce Lee. In 2008 he won an award for the best fight scene for in an action movie for \\"Among the Dead Men\\" at the Action on Film International Film Festival in Pasadena, California. The award was for the best action in a Feature Film and was selected from a field of 300 entries from around the world. Hussain said at the Festival \\"I feel blessed as somebody from Afghanistan because as soon as you hear about Afghanistan, people think war, poverty, and terrorism. But from such a country this is where I did very hard training to reach this level. Then beating all these people from around the world especially with many Chinese Masters, I feel great\\". As a Volunteer: Hussain has worked as a volunteer assisting new arrivals to Australia for the past ten years. He is a community leader and spokesperson for the Hazara community residing in Western Australia. Hussain has also been working as a sports officer to help refugee children from all around the world. He is a role model for them, engaging them with Australian Culture through sports such as Australian Football. As a refugee advocate he has visited a number of detention centers in Australia and Europe countries. In 2011 he was invited to Geneva as a guest speaker to talk about human rights and refugees to international law students. After visiting refugee camps in Greece, where he noticed the condition of refugees was desperate, he wrote a report calling on the UNHCR and Red Cross to take action. Awards and Achievements: At the age of 27 he achieved 2 gold medals in the field of Shaolin Kung Fu. In 2008 Sadiqi won the award for the Best Fight Scene for action movie ‚ÄúAmong Dead Men‚Äù at AOF International film festival in California beating 300 film worldwide.

During a short stint studying law at Hunter College, Parnis worked in sales for a blouse manufacturer. Because of her keen eye for design and her intuition for amending designs to be more appealing to consumers, she was quickly promoted. In 1933, Parnis and her husband, Leon Livingston, started a company called Parnis Livingston Inc. on Seventh Avenue in the Garment District that sold women's suits and blouses. This business drew from Parnis' design expertise and her husband's experience with fabrics and textiles. In the 1940s she began designing under her name only. Parnis achieved popularity through her conservative, feminine, flattering designs, which were available in department stores across the United States. In 1966 her business grossed $3 million, demonstrating her commercial success. Her designs were regularly featured in fashion magazines like Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, and Vanity Fair, and several articles in LIFE described her success, proclaiming that \\"When Mollie Parnis Thinks a Design Will Sell, It Goes.\\" Contributing to the increasing recognition of American fashion designers, Parnis often worked with noted publicist Eleanor Lambert in the Council of Fashion Designers of America and by being included in the International Best-Dressed List in 1967. = Patronage of First Ladies = Parnis is most remembered for her close relationships and frequent patronage from American First Ladies. Mamie Eisenhower frequently wore dresses and suits by Parnis, including a purple gabardine suit for President Eisenhower's 1957 inaugurationGarment in collection at the Eisenhower Presidential Library, Abilene, Kansas. and a black and white silk dress when she met Queen Elizabeth at the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. She also wore a 'silky purple Molly Parnis dress [with] a Peter Pan collar' to her sixtieth birthday party in 1956. The most publicized event in which Eisenhower wore a Parnis dress was in 1955, when a woman in a receiving line wore the same blue-green shirtwaist dress as the First Lady, an event that could have caused much embarrassment. Parnis is quoted saying, \\"I do not sell directly to any wearer, nor do I usually make one of a kind; that is what makes this country a great democracy. But I do feel that the First Lady should have something special.\\" Eisenhower and Parnis's dress, Model 448, were featured in a multi-page spread in LIFE titled \\"Blue-Green on the National Scene.\\" The feature included images of women across the country wearing the dress. Lady Bird Johnson also frequently wore Parnis' designs because she could wear them in her busy life and \\"still look like a lady.\\"Bess Abell, Oral History,1969, LBJ Presidential Library, Austin, TX The two developed a close relationship, and Parnis was often invited to the White House for state dinners and the Johnson's ranch in Texas.

His mother's monument survives in the Speke Chantry in Exeter Cathedral. Career He was educated at Exeter Grammar School and in 1628 entered Queens College, Oxford but later moved to Exeter College, Oxford, much frequented by Devonians. His first clerical appointment was by his father as Rector of Clovelly. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to King Charles II, after which he received the honour of a Doctorate in Divinity from Oxford University. At the bequest of the Lord Chamberlain he preached a Lent sermon before the king, for which was much thanked by the Archbishop of Canterbury.Prince, p.188 During most of his career he lived about 44 miles south-east of Clovelly, at Exeter, and at Shobrooke, near Crediton, 9 miles to the north-west of Exeter. Indeed it appears that until about 1702 Clovelly was occupied by his second cousins, the three brothers John Cary, George Cary (died 1702) and Anthony Cary (died 1694), sons of Robert Cary of Yeo Vale, Alwington,Vivian, p.158, refers to the brothers George Cary (died 1702) and Anthony Cary (died 1694) (sons of Robert Cary of Yeo Vale, Alwington) as \\"of Clovelly\\", and notes that the infant son of their eldest brother John Cary was buried at Clovelly near Clovelly.

It was also the chosen abode of Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle, Lord Lieutenant of Devon, for three weeks in 1675 and again during the Monmouth Rebellion. He was a liberal benefactor in assisting the Corporation of Exeter in the completion in 1699 of the cutting of a leat between Exeter Quay and Topsham, which fed into a pool which could shelter 100 ships. He twice refused offers of the Bishopric of Exeter made by King Charles II, on vacancies arising in 1666 and 1676. The reason for his first refusal, or profession of Nolo Episcopari, is unknown, but he refused the second time due to age and infirmity which would prevent him attending Parliament as would be required.Prince, p.188 In 1675 he succeeded to the paternal estates, including Clovelly, of his elder brother Sir Robert Cary (1610‚Äì1675), a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King Charles II who died unmarried and without children.

The spelling Loi is common in Macau, while other spellings of the same surname such as Lui and Louie are found in Hong Kong and among overseas Chinese. *L«ö (); nearly-homophonous with the above in Cantonese (; note the differing tone), and so also spelled Loi, Lui, or Louie. *L√≠ (), a fossil word meaning \\"black\\" or \\"brown\\".

He began life as an Irish volunteer in 1780, and was afterwards educated at the endowed classical school at Armagh, and then at a private school. He was associated for a time with the Sheares brothers and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the United Irishmen but, being dissatisfied with their programme, he cut himself adrift and began to study medicine. Biography He apprenticed himself to William Hartigan (1756?‚Äì1812) on 10 Feb. 1793, his master being president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland in 1797. Macartney also entered as a pupil in the college school, Mercer Street, Dublin, where he made some dissections for the museum, and he attended the Lock hospital and the Dublin dispensary. In 1796 he came to London to attend the Hunterian or Great Windmill Street school of medicine, and he became an occasional pupil at St. Thomas's and Guy's hospitals. He also attended the lectures of John Abernethy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and through his influence was appointed a demonstrator of anatomy in the medical school in 1798. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 6 Feb. 1800, began to practise in London as a surgeon, and was appointed lecturer on comparative anatomy and physiology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, a post he held from March 1800 to 1811. On 21 Feb. 1811 he was elected F.R.S., and from 1803 to 1812 he served as surgeon to the Royal Radnor Militia. In May 1813 he was admitted M.D. of St. Andrews University, and on 21 June 1813 he was elected professor of anatomy and surgery in the university of Dublin, and physician to Sir Patrick Dun's hospital. These offices he resigned in 1837, after he had raised the medical school to a much better position than it had ever before occupied. During almost the whole of his residence in Dublin Macartney was subjected to a very singular exhibition of petty persecution and open insult at the hands of some members of the board of Trinity College. He was denied the privilege of election to the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, though he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1818. He also received an honorary M.D. from the university of Cambridge (31 Aug. 1833), to which he sold his museum in 1836, the university of Dublin having refused to purchase it. He died at 31 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, on 6 March 1843 (Gent. Mag. 1843, i. 554). He married on 10 Aug. 1795 a Miss Ekenhead. An ill-used and greatly misunderstood man, \\"he was,\\" says Professor Alexander Macalister, > an expert anatomist and a philosophical biologist far in advance of his > period. His description of the vascular system of birds has in many respects > not been surpassed, and his account of the anatomy of mammals may be read > with more profit than many modern works. In his account of the brain of the > chimpanzee compared with that of an idiot, as well as in many others of his > papers, there are glimpses of a morphology far beyond Cuvier, whose works he > edited. His book on inflammation may be placed side by side with any > pathological work of the period, while his researches on animal luminosity > form the basis of many subsequent researches on the subject. Macartney discovered the fibrous texture of the white substance in the brain, and the connection between the subcortical nerve fibres and the grey matter of the cerebral hemispheres. He gave, too, the first satisfactory account of rumination in the herbivora, and he discovered numerous glandular appendages in the digestive organs of mammals, especially of rodents. As one of Warburton's advisers and as a practical anatomist of great experience in teaching, he had much to do in shaping the Anatomy Act of 1832.

Macartney), 1802, 2 vols. * Observations on Curvature of the Spine, Dublin, 1817, 4to. * A Treatise on Inflammation, London, 1838, 4to; reissued in America, Philadelphia, 1840. He also wrote numerous papers in the Philosophical Transaction and his articles on comparative anatomy are published in Abraham Rees's Cyclop√¶dia London, 1802‚Äì1819. These were: * Anatomy, Comparative and Anatomy, Vegetable, (Vol 1), 1802 * Bezoar and Beast (Vol 2), 1802/3 * Birds, anatomy (Vol 3),1803/4 * Branch, Bud and Bulb, all vegetable anatomy (Vol 5), 1805 * Classification of animals for comparative anatomy (Vol 8), 1807 * Fish or Fishes, Anatomy of (Vol 14), 1810 * Incubation in comparative anatomy (Vol 19), 1811 * Mammals, anatomy of (Vol 22), 1812 Macartney noted in his diary that he was now engaged as a regular contributor at a higher rate than any other because at that time no other person understood the subject. William Lawrence, FRS, a fellow lecturer and surgeon at St. Bartholomew's and a former pupil of Macartney, wrote articles on Insects, Reptiles and Vermes that Macartney did not have time to do.

A Federal agent (Christopher George) recruits six convicts to bust a moonshine ring run by the gangster Burl.The Devil's 8 at Fabianforte.net Plot Federal agent Ray Faulkner poses as a road gang convict, and arranges the escape of a group of hardened chain-gang criminals. He forces them at gunpoint into a helicopter. In flashback we see that Faulkner wants to take on a local crime boss, Burl, who runs a moonshine ring and has a lot of political power in a state. Faulkner persuades the convicts to work on the side of the law by promising them paroles. He heads a team of eight men, composed of himself, six prisoners and a fellow agent. The team includes *Sonny, a man in prison for murder who is a good driver. He has a drinking problem. *Frank Davis, a former driver for the syndicate. Davis is at first opposed to the idea but then discovers the mob murdered his brother. *Henry, a black prisoner who is a good driver. *Billy Jo, a mechanic who wants to drive. *Sam, a prisoner who likes to fight. *Chandler, a man who refuses to fight who reads the Bible. *Stewart Martin, a Federal agent on his first assignment Faulkner trains the men in high-speed driving and hurling lighted bombs at pinpoint targets. The team start intercepting the moonshiners' delivery cars until Burl is forced to give Faulkner and his men a share of the illegal whiskey operation and let them make the deliveries. Burl pulls a double-cross by arranging for Faulkner and Martin to be ambushed by crooked police while making a moonshine run, and Martin is shot down from a police helicopter. Sonny has learned the location of Burl's stills and the team attack with their specially equipped cars and carefully timed explosives. During the battle, Burl tries to escape by using his mistress Cissy as a hostage, but Faulkner captures him. Cissy is reunited with Davis, and Burl is taken to prison.

Gordon had the script rewritten by his two assistants, John Milius and Willard Huyck, who had gotten a summer job working in the story department of AIP after studying at USC. Milius says they were given two weeks to write it and they did it in ten days. \\"I don't think we ever thought it was our best work.

He graduated B.A. in 1516, was elected fellow of his college in 1516, proceeded M.A. in 1519, and had a title for orders from Queens' College in February 1521. He took part in the expulsion of Dr. John Jennins from the presidency of Queens' in 1518, and in 1528 was himself elected president. Being empowered by the college to make bargains and covenants at his discretion, he alienated some of the estates belonging to the society. On 28 November 1528 Haynes was instituted to the rectory of Barrow, Suffolk. He was one of the delegates appointed by the senate to make a determination as to the king's divorce in 1529‚Äì30; commenced D.D. in 1531, and in 1532‚Äì3 and 1533‚Äì4 served the office of vice-chancellor. On 23 May 1533 he attested Thomas Cranmer's instrument of divorce at Dunstable, and in 1534 was admitted vicar of Stepney, Middlesex. During that year he and John Skip were selected by the court to preach at Cambridge against papal supremacy. In 1535 Haynes was sent with Christoper Mount as ambassador to France. At the end of the same year he was instituted to the rectory of Fulham, Middlesex, and on 24 December was installed canon of Windsor. On 16 July 1537 he was elected dean of Exeter, and in that capacity he attended the baptism of Prince Edward; and soon afterwards resigned the presidency of Queens' College. A letter in condemnation of the bill of the Six Articles, addressed by him to a member of parliament, is printed in John Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials. In 1538 Haynes and Edmund Bonner were sent to Spain, and joined Sir Thomas Wyatt, the ambassador there. Offended by Wyatt's treatment of them, they later charged him with holding traitorous correspondence with Reginald Pole and speaking disrespectfully of the king. Haynes signed the decree of 9 July 1540 invalidating the marriage of Henry VIII with Anne of Cleves, and on the following 17 Dec. the king made him one of the first prebendaries of Westminster. Haynes was a visitor of the university of Oxford, the college of Windsor, and Exeter Cathedral, and one of the commissioners against the Anabaptists. He also assisted in the compilation of the first English liturgy. He died in October 1552, leaving by his wife Joan (who then married William May) and two sons, Joseph and Simon.

The movie had the largest budget ever given to Buchanan. Buchanan later said his \\"cue\\" on the film was Woody Guthrie's 'The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd,' which examines the populist folk-hero angle of the outlaw. In particular, I was inspired by Woody's great line about how 'some men will rob you with a six-gun, and some will rob you with a fountain pen'.\\" The film features Morgan Fairchild in a small role as a gangster's moll. Buchanan later said \\"I gave her her first job\\" on the film. According to one account, halfway through the film AIP executives were worried about the movie being behind schedule and replaced Buchanan with Maury Dexter.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p241 According to Dexter's own memoirs, he went on the film as executive producer at the behest of James H. Nicholson of AIP \\"to make sure Larry brought the film in on schedule and with some amount of quality.\\" Dexter says that \\"the film went along without a hitch and Larry delivered a nice film\\" but that after it was put together to a rough cut Dexter and AIP \\"thought it was too slow and talky.\\" He then took a small crew and returned to Dallas with stunt doubles and the actors \\"and shot several scenes involving action.

Laura's mother, Emma Upthegrove tells the story of her daughter and John Ashley. John goes into a life of crime after he accidentally shoots a Seminole, Desoto Tiger.

Moberly later wrote \\"twenty- eight features came and went from my place and hundreds of commercials before I realized I had nothing more to show for it than a lot of deferments owed me, and buildings full of equipment. All the little ones I helped went out of business and the ones who made it left and forgot me. I was deciding whether to sell out at offers around a half-million and forget the business or make films myself and try for broke. He read a story of the history of Florida by Philip Weidling and became interested with the bank robber, John Ashley. He asked Weidling to write the true story of Ashley for him. \\"I wrote a screenplay from it and scouted locations that were factual and even built eleven sets for it before I had any money to make it\\", he said. Moberley met a former theatre owner named Louis Wiethe who was interested in investing himself and raising the balance to shoot it. They produced the film together and Moberley directed. =Casting= Wiethe and Moberley went to California to cast the leads. \\"We had some beautiful offers from name actors, but the only one I regret not using was Burt Reynolds\\", said Moberley. \\"He would have made a beautiful John Ashley, plus the fact that I would have had the two hottest young stars in the country in my very first feature.\\" Moberley said he became interested in Karen Black after seeing her photo. She \\"had never played a lead role, but I thought she looked like what I needed. I read a few pages of the script with her and said, \\"That's all I need to hear, you've got the part.\\" By February 1969 it was announced that Fabian and Karen Black were to play the leads. =Shooting= Filming began 10 March 1969 on location in Stuart, Florida, in and around Martin County, and at Moberly Film Studios in Fort Lauderdale. Moberley recalls \\"Most of the people working with me wondered where I got that kookie little hippie girl, but by the end of the first day's shooting, I was convinced she would be my film and outshine everyone else. Most everyone was mad at me for changing the script every day and the feeling got to be that I was in total confusion and didn't know what I was doing. I guess that happens to most all new film directors. Before the film was over, they all began to realize Karen was stealing the scenes. \\" Additional footage was later shot, including filming a nude scene at the public beach at the House of Refuge in Martin County. Release The original title of the film was The True Story of the Ashley-Mobley Gang. Then it was Too Soon to Laugh, Too Late to Cry before becoming Little Laura and Big John. Moberley said \\"We held our film back till Karen became one of the hottest properties around.\\" Crown International bought the rights to the movie which was not released until 1973. When the film came out Moberley said \\"I am grateful to Karen Black, although she has forgotten me the same as the others who made it.\\" The film marked the first time Fabian was credited as \\"Fabian Forte.\\" Moberley later said \\"After working in the early 1900 era with all of the antique cars and clothes, I tried to write another period picture about the rum runners, but just couldn't come up with something I thought the young people would buy. \\" See also * List of American films of 1973 References External links * *Little Laura and Big John at Fabianforte.net Little Laura and Big John at BFI Category:1973 films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:1973 crime drama films Category:American crime drama films Category:Crown International Pictures films Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Biographical films about criminals Category:1973 drama films ","title":"Little Laura and Big John"},{"id":"35366487","text":"Ceropales is a genus of kleptoparasitic spider wasps from the sub-family Ceropalinae of the family Pompilidae.

Origins As a Dutch, English, French, and German surname, Noe is derived from the biblical given name Noah (Middle English and Latin ). The English variant Noy is similarly derived. However, Noah was not a common given name in medieval England when the surname first appeared there, and so Patrick Hanks suggests that the surname may have been used by descendants of people who were nicknamed Noah, for example as a jocular reference to the Genesis flood narrative, or because they had played the part of Noah in a stage play.; As a Korean surname, Noe () can be written with either of two hanja characters: one meaning \\"thunder\\" (; ), and the other meaning \\"to request\\" (; ). In North Korea, both of these surnames are still spelled Roe (), but in South Korea, the spelling of Sino-Korean words starting with 'r' has changed. The first character is used to write the Chinese surname now pronounced L√©i in Mandarin Chinese, while the second is used to write the surname L√†i. In Korea, surnames are also divided by identification with bon-gwan, which are hometowns of a clan lineage. The main bon-gwan for the surname Noe meaning \\"thunder\\" is , a township and island in Ganghwa County, Incheon. Its members claim descent from Noe I-seong (; ), who came from China to Korea to take the official post of '\\"Vice-Minister of Justice\\", in rough translation; see Three Departments and Six Ministries during the reign of Emperor Dezong of Qing in the late 19th century. The Jokbo Museum cites the following work for their pages on family names: Statistics In Italy, 426 families bore the surname Noe, with 197 (46.2%) located in Lombardy, 49 (11.5%) in Piedmont, and 42 (9.9%) in Veneto. In the Netherlands, there were 184 people with the surname No√´ as of 2007, up from 175 in 1947. In South Korea, the 2000 census found 80 people in 26 households with the surname Noe meaning \\"thunder\\", all but two of whom identified with the Gyodong bon-gwan. There were also 12 people in two households with the surname Noe meaning \\"to request\\", but the census did not record their bon-gwan. Statistics for the current distribution of these surnames in North Korea are not available. A 1930 taxation survey by the Japanese colonial government found roughly thirty households with the surname meaning \\"thunder\\", primarily in Suan County and Hwangju County, North Hwanghae province (in an area that became part of North Korea after the division of Korea). The 2010 United States Census found 11,182 people with the surname Noe, making it the 3,229th-most-common name in the country. This represented an increase in absolute numbers, but a decrease in relative proportion, from 10,789 (3,080th-most-common) in the 2000 Census. In both censuses, more than 90% of the bearers of the surname identified as White, between three and five per cent as Hispanic, and between one and two percent as Asian.

The museum was established on February 1, 2000 and as soon as on February 24, 2000 it was ceremonially opened by an exhibition named \\"The Red Cross at Peace and War Times\\". It is headquartered in the 1927 former dispensary building of the Red Cross in Martin, Slovakia. The town of Martin was choose as the seat of the Slovak Red Cross Museum, because it has got a long Red Cross tradition. In 1924 ‚Äì 1938, Martin was the seat of the Slovak division of the Czechoslovak RC. This is mostly the credit of Dr. Alica Masarykov√°, the first president of the Czechoslovak RC (CSRC). She ensured and organized nationwide activities of the Red Cross from Martin: sanitary movement, nursing, humanitarian aid, activities of young CSRC members and many others. An extensive publishing activity of the CSRC had been associated with the names of renowned Slovak writers. The museum thoroughly documents and presents these history activities of the Red Cross in Slovakia. Activities As a result of its scientific and research activities the museum provides 2 to 3 premiere exhibitions each year. It also publishes books and textbooks on humanitarian history as well as on Slovak Red Cross history. The SCK-museum offers through its school awareness program specialized lectures on international humanitarian law for schools and other organizations, to teach the students the basic humanitarian principles and to promote humanism among the young generation.

It is the only species classified in the monotypic genus DipogonTropicos, Dipogon Liebm. which belongs to the subfamily Faboideae.Liebmann, Frederik Michael. 1854. Annales des Sciences Naturelles; Botanique, s√©rie 4, vol 2: 374 Description Dipogon lignosus is climbing woody, herbaceous perennial which becomes woody towards the base. The soft green stems climb over nearby structures, shrubs or trees, and can grow up to 2m tall, extending a long way horizontally if possible. Its leaves are dark to medium green above, paler below and are composed of three diamond shaped leaflets which have a wide set base before tapering to a fine point. Each leaflet has its own stalk. The flowers are typical for the pea family and are pink, mauve, magenta and purple in colour, growing on the tips of new growth stems in short, dense racemes with long peduncles. Flowering occurs throughout spring and summer, i.e. August to January in its native South Africa. The pods are flat and sickle- shaped, each containing four to six seeds, and are formed soon after flowering. In warmer climates this is an evergreen, but it may develop a deciduous habit in areas where are subject to frosts. Distribution Dipogon lignosus has a native range that covers the Western Cape and Eastern Cape in South Africa where it prefers milder areas where it is not subjected to frost. It is an invasive weed in Australia and New Zealand and in some areas control of D. lignosus can be mandated. Habitat and biology In South Africa Dipogon lignosus has a natural habitat of forest margins and stream banks, where it climbs over other shrubs and trees. This habitat preference is replicated in Australia but it is usually found close to human habitation. It prefers to grow in moderately shady sites where there is dense vegetation to provide support for its twining stems. The seeds are explosively thrown out of the ripe pods landing some distance from the parent plant and they are able to remain dormant in the soil for some years when conditions are unfavourable for germination. Germination is stimulated by disturbance such as fire, rain or seasonal changes. As a legume D. lignosus has symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria which live on nodules on the roots and these enhance soil fertility The bacteria are afforded nutrients and shelter by the planta and the bacteria provide their host with usable nitrogen collected from minerals in the soil. It is tolerant of salt laden winds. Horticulture Dipogon lignosus has been widely cultivated outside of South Africa from as far back as the early nineteenth century. Areas where it has been used in horticulture include Europe, Madeira, Azores, Sri Lanka, Australia, California and temperate regions of South America. Invasion Dipogon lignosus is regarded as highly invasive in Australia especially in riverside and coastal vegetation, heathland, dry sclerophyll forest, warm temperate rainforest and grassland. It is an effective invader as the seed is explosively ejected from pods over distances of several metres or the seeds may be spread further in dumped garden refuse or contaminated soil and it is also dispersed by birds or water for distances that may exceed 1 km. Rhizomes can also be transported to spread the plant. Control of D. lignosus in native Australian vegetation can be very labour-intensive and the best control strategy is to minimise disturbance by removing the smaller, scattered plants initially and then targeting the larger infestations starting at their outer margins. The small seedlings may be sprayed with a suitable herbicide where appropriate. For larger plants, the climbing stems should be cut down to the roots with the remnant stumps then being excavated or immediately treated with herbicide. Taxonomy and nomenclature The specific name lignosus means woody in Latin, referring to the woody stems base at the base of the plant. Dipogon is derived from the Greek di, meaning two, and pogon meaning beard, referring to the style which has a thick beard on its upper side near its tip. Originally it was placed in the genus Dolichos, hence the Australian vernacular name of dolichos pea, and Carl Linnaeus named the spcesies as Dolichos lignosus. Bernard Verdcourt moved it into the monotypic genus Dipogon in 1968 when he was revising the genus Dolichos, using the name Dipogon which had been used by Liebmann in 1854 and as it was an already established synonym for Dolichos lignosus.

He also used the title Lord of Krossen, after a town in the Neumark.  Life  = Co-ruler= John II belonged to the Brandenburg line of the House of Ascania and was the eldest son of Margrave John I and his first wife, Sophie of Denmark (1217‚Äì1247), the daughter of King Valdemar II of Denmark and his second wife, Berengaria of Portugal. Since he was only co- ruler and appeared in the limelight less often than his brother, less is known about him than the other Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg. On one occasion in 1269, he was consignatory of the Treaty of Arnswalde with Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. Nevertheless, he is one of only two of the co-rulers of this time (the other being Otto IV) to be given a statue on the Siegesallee in Berlin by Kaiser Wilhelm II. = Chorin Abbey = Most of what is known about John II relates to Chorin Abbey. This was a Cistercian abbey that his father had founded in 1258 under the name Mariensee, where he intended the Margraves of Brandenburg-Stendel would be buried, considering that Lehnin Abbey, where the earlier margraves had been buried, was located in the part of the Margraviate held by the Brandenburg-Salzwedel line.  Ascanian castles on the Schorfheide hunting grounds  400-year-old road in the Schorfheide hunting grounds In 1273 the three brothers, Otto IV \\"with the arrow\\", John II and Conrad I (the father of Waldemar, the last great Margrave of Brandenburg from the House of Ascania) issued a joint declarationStefan Warnatsch: Regestenverzeichnis, item nr. 138, dated 8 September 1273 confirming the move of the Mariensee monastery to Chorin. Their three seals show the same picture of a standing armed Margrave with an eagle on his shield and the margraviate flag flying from his lance. They only differ in the inscription, which associates each seal with one of the brothers. The deed was issued on the castle at Werbellin, a village in the Schorfheide area to the west of the monastery. In the second half of the 13th century, the Schorfheide was the Ascanians' favourite hunting ground. Besides Werbellin, they had two other castles in this vast forest area. Otto IV's favourite castle was Grimnitz Castle on the western shore of Lake Grimnitzsee. John II preferred the fortified house at Breden on the south-eastern shore of Lake Werbellin and the castle in Werbellin at the southern end of the lake.Grimnitz Castle at eiszeitstra√üe.de All three castles had been established by John I and were probably destroyed during the 14th century. Ruins of Grminitz castle still exist. It was first mentioned in a deed sealed by John II, Otto IV, Conrad I and Henry I \\"\\"Lackland\\" in 1297.In this deed, the brothers donate Marienwalde monastery to the village of Mensdorf On the hill site of Werbellin castle, a (closed) observation tower now stands. This tower was inaugurated by Prince Charles of Prussia as a reminder of the Ascanians in 1879.Emil Dominik: Die Askanierburg Werbellin, ‚Ä¶ p. 134 ff Wolfganf Erdemann has suggested that this paten was donated after John II's death by his brothers Otto IV and Conrad I: donated to Chorin to remember the Ascanians.Wolfgang Erdmann: Zisterzienser- Abtei Chorin. ‚Ä¶, p. 12 The other half of the Eucharist set is a beautiful calyx (the Ascanian chalice), which was probably donated in 1266 or 1267 and depicts John I and Otto III and their wives. John II was buried as Chorin Abbey 1281 and his wife Hedwig in 1287. The abbey's construction had not been completed at that time. = Marriage and issue = Between 1258 and 1262, he married Hedwig of Werle (1243‚Äì1287), the daughter of Nicholas I of Werle and Jutta of Anhalt. They had two sons: * Conrad II (1261‚Äì1308) * John (1263‚Äì1292), Bishop of Havelberg  Statue on the Siegesallee  The statue of John II on the Siegesallee The inclusion of a statue of John II's nephew Henry II, who played an insignificant r√¥le in the history of Brandenburg, in the statue collection lining the Siegesallee, was controversial and in the end his statue was only accepted for reasons of symmetry: the design called for sixteen statue groups on both sides of the avenue.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die ‚Ä¶, pp. 57 ff and 125 No such controversy appears to have existed around the inclusion of the equally insignificant co-ruler John II. As typical contemporaries and distinctive supporting characters, whose busts would complete John II's statue group, the historical commission led by Reinhold Koser selected Count G√ºnther I of Lindow and Ruppin (d. 1284) and Konrad Belitz (d. 1308), a long-distance trader and councillor from Berlin. Sculpture group 6 was sculpted by Reinhold Felderhoff, who was given a free hand in the design of his statues. No contemporary picture of John II was available. The describes John II as small in stature, capable and strong. However, the overall design of the Siegesallee prescribed a uniform height of all statues. The design Felderhoff settled on, was rather unlike the historicizing art of the other statue groups on the Siegesallee. Instead, he opted for an almost modern large typifying shape. He refrained from individualizing his statue and instead created a quiet and serious warrior archetype. The warrior is looking to the ground and leans on a large shield bearing the arms of the House of Ballenstedt -- Esico of Ballenstedt is considered the progenitor of the House of Ascania. Relief in Mariendorf by an unknown artist, after the statue on the Siegesallee, 1909 Sculpture group 6 was ceremonially unveiled on 14 November 1900. Between 1978 and 2009, John II's statue was housed in the Lapidarium in Kreuzberg. Since 2009, it has been on display in the Spandau Citadel.

In the 1850s a number of railways were built in the area, which improved on the existing tramways. A special branch line of the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway served the gas works at Wyesham. The company‚Äôs prime source of revenue at that time was the water side of the business. The gas part of the business supplied fuel for street and private lighting to the town.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, Until the 1930s the gas works were operated by the Monmouth Gas and Water Co. Ltd. The gas was manufactured from coal that was brought by railway.
