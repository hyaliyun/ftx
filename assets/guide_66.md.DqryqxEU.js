The Globe and Mail, June 5, 1972. The film's cast also includes Hugh McIntyre and Eileen McIntyre as Ann's parents. Production The film was influenced by the then-experimental blend of docufiction techniques innovated by films such as Nobody Waved Good-bye and √Ä tout prendre. Its script consisted solely of a 15-page story outline, around which the actors improvised their dialogue so that the film would feel like a documentary. It was made on a budget of just $23,000.

Despite favourable critical response and Knox's award win the film received only limited release, in part because it had been shot on 16 mm film, which very few movie theatres in Canada had the equipment to screen, while Mackey did not have the budget to convert it to the more normal 35 mm film.\\"The Friendly Neighborhood Cineastes\\".

In the first couple of years with the Yankees organization, they mistakenly listed him as being born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which would have made him a forerunner to become the first Haitian-born Major League player. Florial signed with the New York Yankees under the name \\"Haniel d'Oleo\\" in 2014. However the contract was voided after he was unable to provide a birth certificate and he re-signed with the Yankees under the name, Estevan Florial in 2015. He made his professional debut that season with the Dominican Summer League Yankees 1 where he batted .313 with seven home runs and 53 RBIs in 57 games. =Minor leagues= He played 2016 with the Pulaski Yankees, Charleston RiverDogs and Tampa Yankees, batting a combined .227 with eight home runs and thirty RBIs in 67 total games among the three teams. Florial started the 2017 season with Charleston. He was selected to appear in the All-Star Futures Game in July. After batting .297 with 11 home runs, 43 RBIs and 17 stolen bases for Charleston, he was promoted to Tampa in August, where he finished the season slashing .303/.368/.461 with two home runs and 14 RBIs in 19 games. The Yankees promoted him to the Trenton Thunder for their postseason but did not appear in a game. Florial entered 2018 as one of the top prospects in the minor leagues. Playing for Tampa, he broke the hamate bone in his right wrist in May and required surgery, costing him three months of the season. In 2019, the Yankees invited Florial to spring training as a non-roster player. He suffered a non-displaced fracture in his right wrist during spring training. He returned to Tampa in June, where he played for the 2019 season. =New York Yankees= Florial was called up to the majors on August 28, 2020. He played in the first game of a doubleheader that same day against the New York Mets, where he got his first MLB hit. At the end of the day he was sent back to the minors.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. As of 2017, it is used by the Beaver Island Historical Society as a historical museum, the Old Mormon Print Shop Museum. History After the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, James Strang founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a faction of the Latter Day Saint movement (i.e. the Mormons) that he claimed to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Church. In 1847, Strang and some of his followers moved to the then largely uninhabited Beaver Island. The colony of St. James quickly grew, and by 1850, there were several thousand people in the Beaver Islands, most of them Mormon. In 1850, Strang and his followers constructed this building as a print shop. On December 12 of that year they printed the first issue of the Northern Islander, one of the earliest papers published in northern Michigan. It was published first as a weekly, and later as a daily, and carried both general news and columns dealing with the religious ideas of Strang. The shop was also used to print books. Strang, however, had made many enemies, and in June 1856 he was shot, dying a few weeks later. Shortly after Strang's shooting, Beaver Island was invaded by a mob of non-Mormons from the mainland portion of Michigan, who sacked many of the buildings and forcibly evicted the residents. The mob took control of the print shop, and issued an edition of the Northern Islander listing their grievances. In later years, the print shop became a boarding house owned by a Mrs. Gibson. It was later purchased by the Beaver Island Historical Society, who use the building as a historical museum, the Old Mormon Print Shop Museum. Plans are underway to expand the building. Description The Mormon Print Shop is a two-story building with a gable roof measuring approximately 30 feet wide by 20 feet deep. A single-story addition measuring 19 feet wide is attached to the rear of the building. It is constructed the shop is built from squared logs covered with vertical board and batten. The foundation originally consisted of cedar posts sunk into the ground, but these deteriorated and were replaced by cement blocks.

Background Of the housing units in the Pandi site, 538 were awarded specifically to Philippine National Police personnel. Utilities such as water and electricity are not yet available in some housing units. As of March 2017, 1,848 out of 9,128 houses were completed by the National Housing Authority (NHA). Events On March 8, Kadamay, an urban poor group, led an occupation of about 5,000 pending housing units in five relocation sites in Bulacan. Members of Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap (Kadamay) vowed to defend their barricades and occupation of these idle government housing sites and units. They appealed to President Rodrigo Duterte to heed their call. Police reported that about 5,000 individuals reportedly occupied the housing units in Pandi Residences 3, Pandi Village 2 and Padre Pio. The National Housing Authority (NHA) stated that 4,000 housing units in the area occupied. Kadamay said this was to protest against the failure of the Duterte administration and the housing authorities to provide shelter in the area. On March 13, a group of families, composed of 500-1,000 members, occupied the housing units in Bulacan. Duterte warned that homeless settlers must follow the law or he would be forced to remove them from the site. Duterte labelled the occupation by Kadamay as \\"anarchy\\". League of Filipino Students (LFS) national spokesperson JP Rosos condemned Duterte for stating what Kadamay did was anarchy. On March 14, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) told Duterte that the occupation of government housing units was not anarchy. On March 16, the NHA officials processed 160 housing applications from families who occupy the idle units in Pandi. On March 20, Kadamay members protested the eviction notices against the occupation on idle housing units. Kadamay Chairman Gloria Arellano lambasted the PNP, whom it called \\"fear- mongers\\" in response to the occupation. Meanwhile, on March 21, about 15 Kadamay members attempted to enter the housing units in Rodriguez, Rizal but were foiled by the police. The NHA issued eviction notices, on March 23, to members of Kadamay who occupied the units. However, the urban poor group burned their notices once the NHA personnel left the area. On March 24, about 1,000 Kadamay members gathered again at NHA office to demand their rights over 5,000 idle housing units. ACT Teacher partylist representatives criticized the NHA for the eviction notices they gave to them. Kilusang Mayo Uno, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, Makabayan, Gabriela and Anakpawis members teamed up with Kadamay to protest the lack of housing programs for the poor. According to the dialogue between the Kadamay and the NHA on March 27, they came to an agreement that any units left unclaimed after the May 30 deadline would be transferred to the informal settlers. The NHA announced a plan, on March 27, to expel 20,000 illegal dwellers from 5,262 housing units in Pandi, Bulacan. However, the NHA withdrew the orders after Kadamay agreed to undergo a validation process, which started on April 3, to determine whether the members are eligible, according to Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao. On April 4, Duterte announced that members of Kadamay may now live in units, as long as they do not oust police officers and soldiers who currently reside there. He also urged the soldiers and police officers to give up their claims to their houses occupied by Kadamay, vowing to build better housing projects by December. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, on April 6, called the grabbing of houses by the Kadamay members the \\"front organization of communists.\\" Trillanes warned that the community may be used as a \\"sanctuary\\" of communist rebels. On the same day, Duterte accused Kadamay of involvement in \\"anarchical activities\\" as he promised to prevent any efforts to occupy other housing projects.  Aftermath  Before May 1, members of Kadamay gathered before the ombudsman, demanding the livelihood so that they can pay their occupied house. On July 25, Duterte threatens to \\"shoot\\" them if Kadamay refuse to follow his order not to occupy the houses again. He mentioned that the group have gone rebellion and they ignore laws. Kadamay Chairperson Gloria Arellano lambasted Duterte, saying that the housing programs are not his agenda but only the soldiers, and the majority of making threats. from the original.

Elegy had its world premiere production at the Donmar Warehouse, London with an official opening night on 27 April 2016, following previews from 21 April. Its limited run concluded on 18 June 2016. Josie Rourke directed the production, which starred Zo√´ Wanamaker as Lorna, Barbara Flynn as Carrie and Nina Sosanya as Miriam. The play was nominated for the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. Plot In the near future, radical and unprecedented advances in medical science lead to the possibility of augmenting and extending life. Lorna has had surgery to eliminate a brain disease. However, she loses her memory and does not recognize her partner Carrie when they meet after 20 years. In flashbacks, the two are seen during their relationship. Lorna's doctor Miriam is conflicted about the treatment. Critical reception The Guardian reviewer said: \\"Payne probes the moral consequences of scientific progress. At its most moving, the play poses the question of whether love, like religious faith, is a conscious state of mind that can be eradicated: much of the play‚Äôs anguish derives from Lorna‚Äôs post-op indifference to the devoted Carrie. But, while the play airs big issues such as whether medical advance undercuts the notion of fixed identity, it works because we care deeply about the people.\\"Billington, Michael. \\" Elegy review ‚Äì Zo√´ Wanamaker is superb in Nick Payne's soulful play about science\\" The Guardian, 28 April 2016 The Independent reviewer concluded with: \\"As always with Payne, the structure feels musical ‚Äì an impression amplified here with repeated extracts from the elegiac poetry of Douglas Dunn and Christopher Reid and by the pointed symbolism of the design.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the 290th fought in the Battle of Smolensk, Operation Bagration, the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, and the East Pomeranian Offensive during the rest of the war before its postwar disbandment in 1946.  History  The 290th began forming on 12 July 1941 at Kalyazin in the Moscow Military District from reservists. Its basic order of battle included the 878th, 882nd, and the 885th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 827th Artillery Regiment. After only five weeks, the division was assigned to the 50th Army. In late September, the division was encircled in the Bryansk pocket by Operation Typhoon, the German advance on Moscow. The division's remnants broke out from the pocket by 23 October. On 27 November the 827th Artillery Regiment was removed from the division and replaced by the 1420th Artillery Regiment on 22 January 1942. In May, the 290th transferred to the Western Front's 10th Army. During the last four months of 1943, the division was part of the 33rd Army, 49th Army, and the 68th Army, as it advanced from Smolensk to the Mogilev-Orsha line on the Dnieper. At the end of the year, the 290th transferred back to the 10th Army, but in spring 1944 it was moved to the 49th Army. The division fought in Operation Bagration and was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for recapturing Grodno. By August it began to outrun its supply lines, and received 1200 rear area conscripts and militia from Grodno, and 380 newly drafted civilians from areas it advanced through as replacements. In September, the 290th was transferred to the 3rd Army of the 2nd Belorussian Front, with which it fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive and the East Pomeranian Offensive in early 1945. At the very end of the war, the 3rd Army was transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front, and became part of the front reserve during the Battle of Berlin. By the end of the war, the division's honorifics were \\"Mogilev, Order of the Red Banner, Orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov.\\" The division was relocated to Chavusy in the Minsk Military District with the 35th Rifle Corps in the summer of 1945, and disbanded there in June 1946 along with the corps.

Lundager was struck down with tuberculosis leaving him unable to work for two years. When he was ready to work again, he was compelled to find less physically challenging work, and therefore entered the field of photography, establishing his own photography business in Fredericia.

Several open and commercial programs exist to perform these operations. The concept of the technique is minimization of Gibbs free energy of the system; the success of this method is due not only to properly measuring thermodynamic properties, such as those in the list of thermodynamic properties, but also due to the extrapolation of the properties of metastable allotropes of the chemical elements. History The computational modeling of metal-based phase diagrams, which dates back to the beginning of the previous century mainly by Johannes van Laar and to the modeling of regular solutions, has evolved in more recent years to the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams).

While crystallographic databases are used mainly as a reference source, thermodynamic databases represent one of the earliest examples of informatics, as these databases were integrated into thermochemical computations to map phase stability in binary and ternary alloys. Many concepts and software used in computational thermodynamics are credited to the SGTE Group, a consortium devoted to the development of thermodynamic databases; the open elements database is freely availablehttp://www.crct.polymtl.ca/sgte/unary50.tdb based on the paper by Dinsdale. This so-called \\"unary\\" system proves to be a common basis for the development of binary and multiple systems and is used by both commercial and open software in this field. However, as stated in recent CALPHAD papers and meetings, such a Dinsdale/SGTE database will likely need to be corrected over time despite the utility in keeping a common base. In this case, most published assessments will likely have to be revised, similarly to rebuilding a house due to a severely broken foundation. This concept has also been depicted as an \\"inverted pyramid.\\" Merely extending the current approach (limited to temperatures above room temperature) is a complex task.http://thermocalc.micress.de/proceedings/proceedings2015/tc2015_tumminello_public.pdf PyCalpahd, a Python library, was designed to facilitate simple computational thermodynamics calculation using open source code. In complex systems, computational methods such as CALPHAD are employed to model thermodynamic properties for each phase and simulate multicomponent phase behavior. The application of CALPHAD to high pressures in some important applications, which are not restricted to one side of materials science like the Fe-C system, confirms experimental results by using computational thermodynamic calculations of phase relations in the Fe‚ÄìC system at high pressures. Other scientists even considered viscosity and other physical parameters, which are beyond the domain of thermodynamics. Future developments There is still a gap between ab initio methodsP. Turchi AB INITIO AND CALPHAD THERMODYNAMICS OF MATERIALS https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/306920.pdf and operative computational thermodynamics databases. In the past, a simplified approach introduced by the early works of Larry Kaufman, based on Miedema's Model, was employed to check the correctness of even the simplest binary systems. However, relating the two communities to Solid State Physics and Materials Science remains a challenge,J. A. Alonso and N. H.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the 290th fought in the Siege of Leningrad until its end in January 1944, and then in the Baltic states, Poland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia before being disbanded after the end of the war in the summer of 1945.  History  The 291st was formed in early July 1941 as the 11th Moscow Militia Division, which soon received a regular Red Army cadre and on 12 July became the 291st Rifle Division. Its basic order of battle included the 181st, 309th, and 1025th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 838th Artillery Regiment. Less than a month after its formation, the division was sent to Leningrad, and by 17 August was part of the city's Krasnogvardeysk fortified sector. At the beginning of September, the division was transferred to the 23rd Army, holding positions against Finnish attack north of the city. The division served with the 23rd Army until March 1943, when it transferred to the 55th Army of the Leningrad Front. In January 1944, when the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive, which ended the siege, began, the division was part of the 67th Army. At the time, the average rifle company in the division had about 70 men, half of authorized strength. In April 1944 the 67th Army was transferred to the 3rd Baltic Front, and the division became part of the army's 116th Rifle Corps. In September the division was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command where it remained for over three months. Returning to the front in December, the 291st became part of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 21st Army. The division fought in Poland, Germany, and northern Czechoslovakia for the rest of the war. The division was disbanded in the summer of 1945 with the Central Group of Forces.

Recent 1999 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau put the total number of people living in Philadelphia who identify as Black or African-American at 689,927, comprising 43.6% of the total population of the city. History Published in 1899 by the University of Pennsylvania and conducted by W. E. B. Du Bois, The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study was the first sociological race study of the African American community in the United States. The aim of the social study was to identify \\"The Negro Problems of Philadelphia,\\" the problems facing black communities not only in Philadelphia, but all over the country as well. The study focused on Philadelphia's Seventh Ward (currently Center City Philadelphia) and the socioeconomic conditions of black churches, businesses and homes within the neighborhood. Using statistics Du Bois created from his survey data, Du Bois compared the occupation, income, education, family size, health, drug use, criminal activity and suffrage of black and white residents living in the Seventh Ward and to Philadelphia's other wards. Du Bois used statistical evidence to highlight the socioeconomic inequalities the black community faced and make the black community's suffrage known to whites. In turn, he disproved stereotypes surrounding the black community which were cited as the sources of \\"The Negro Problem.\\" Geography By 1976 many blacks were moving to Wynnefield, with many originating from Creek and Overbrook; the new residents of Wynnefield had recently become middle class.\\"Blacks in Philadelphia.\\" p. 44. Circa 1976 many African-Americans resided in Powelltown Village. The majority originated from other states and held professional positions, including artists, graduate students, musicians, teachers, and writers. Circa 1961 Society Hill was a majority black and low income neighborhood, but by 1976 it became gentrified and mostly White with the remaining black population residing in about three or four high-rise apartment buildings with high rents. Black Enterprise wrote that a possible reason why wealthier blacks opted not to move to Society Hill was \\"Unpleasant memories of the old neighborhood\\". Institutions The African American Museum in Philadelphia is located in Center City. Religion An 1829 image of the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas The African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas, established in 1792, was the first house of worship designated for black people in the United States. While the St. George's United Methodist Church had initially allowed black worshipers in the main area, its black worshipers left after the church moved them to the gallery area by 1787.\\"Blacks in Philadelphia.\\" p. 36. Education In 1976 66% of all students of the School District of Philadelphia were black; this number was proportionally high since whites of all economic backgrounds had a tendency to use private schools. Wealthier blacks chose not to use private schools because their neighborhoods were assigned to higher quality public schools.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. As of 2017, it is operated as a museum by the Beaver Island Historical Society. History Feodar (or Feodor) Protar was born in Estonia. He was said to have been influenced by the writings of Leo Tolstoy and exiled. He settled in Dresden, and when his wife died in 1870, emigrated to the United States. He toured for a time with actress Fanny Janauschek, and in 1882 purchased and began operating a German newspaper in Rock Island, Illinois. In 1887, while on a trip in Lake Michigan, a storm forced Protar's ship into the Beaver Island harbor at St. James. He became enchanted with the island, and spent his summers there for the next five years. In 1893, Protar moved to Beaver Island permanently. He chose for his house a log cabin constructed by an Irish settler in about 1860. He soon realized the extreme need on the island for a physician, began studying medicine, and was soon practicing as an unlicensed physician. Protar continued living in this house, and practicing medicine, until his death in 1925, never leaving the island. Protar's neighbors erected a bronze tablet on his grave in 1928, reading, \\"to our Heaven sent friend in need, Feodora Protar, who never failed us. In imperishable gratitude and adoration. His people of Beaver Island.\\" The cabin fell disrepair for a number of years, and in 1971 a new roof and porch were constructed. The Beaver Island Historical Society maintains the home, under the guidance of Antje Price, who translated Protar's diaries.

Her husband, Mohammed Mzali served as the country's Prime Minister from 1980 to 1986. Early life and education Fethia Mokhtar was born on 6 April 1927 in Tunis. She attended primary school at a Muslim girls' school and then the Bardo girls school. Her secondary schooling was interrupted by World War II, but completed in 1942 at Armand Falli√®res High School in N√©rac in 1947. She obtained a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne in Paris in 1952. Career Mzali was a teacher and then headmistress at the Teacher's College in Tunis. She was a member Destour and participated in the demonstrations from 1950‚Äì1955 that led to independence. In 1956, after Tunisian independence, Mzali was one of the founders of the National Union of Women of Tunisia. In 1974, she was appointed president of the organisation, a post she held until 1986. However, her appointment under President Habib Bourguiba has been criticised for contributing to the women's movement in Tunisia languishing under his influence. In 1957, Mzali was elected as a municipal councillor for the city of Tunis, serving a three-year term. She was first woman in Tunisia to give a speech about birth control in 1959. She joined the Central Committee of the Socialist Destourian Party in 1974 and was appointed a member of its governing body in 1979. She was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as the deputy for the regions of Kairouan, Tunis and Bizerte in 1974 and 1981. She was elected Vice- President of the National Assembly each year from 1980 to 1984. On 1 November 1983, Mzali was appointed as Minister for Family and Women in the government of her husband Prime Minister Mohammed Mzali. Souad Yaacoubi was appointed Minister of Public Health at the same time, making the two women the first to serve in the country's cabinet. Mzali was dismissed from her position in June 1986 after her husband's dismissal from the ruling party's administration. They fled the country for France, and in April 1987 Mohammed Mzali was convicted in absentia of abuse of social property and unlawful enrichment. The conviction was annulled in 2002, allowing their return to Tunisia. Awards and honours In 1978, Mzali accepted the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights on behalf of the National Union of Tunisian Women. She also received decorations from the governments of France, Finland and Senegal. Personal life Mzali met Mohammed Mzali while studying in Paris and they were married in 1950. They had six children.

The division was first formed in the summer of 1941 and was destroyed near Leningrad in the fall of that year. Reformed in June 1942 from a rifle brigade, the 292nd was destroyed during counterattacks against the German advance north of Stalingrad in the fall of 1942. It was reformed in July 1943 in the Soviet Far East, and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, before being disbanded in 1946.  History  = First Formation = The 292nd Rifle Division began forming from individual replacements on 2 July 1941 in the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 1007th, 1009th, and 1011th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 833rd Artillery Regiment. The partially-formed division was hurriedly moved to the front at Kirishi near Leningrad, where it arrived on 24 August. The 292nd was assigned to the new 52nd Army, but transferred to the 4th Army by the end of September. The division fought in defensive battles east of the Volkhov River and the Tikhvin Offensive in early November. The latter successfully recaptured Tikhvin from the German troops, and was one of the first German operational defeats in the war. As a result of heavy losses, the 292nd was disbanded on 30 November 1941. = Second Formation = The 292nd was reformed on 9 June 1942 from a rifle brigade in the Moscow area, part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. It included the same rifle regiments as the first formation. The division was immediately assigned to the 10th Reserve Army. In August the 292nd was sent to the front with the Stalingrad Front's 24th Army. As part of the army, the division fought in counterattacks against the German flank north of Stalingrad during September and October, suffering heavy losses. As a result, the division was disbanded on 5 November and its remnants used as replacements for other Don Front divisions. This was one of the last times in the war that a number of divisions were disbanded due to casualties. = Third Formation = The 292nd was reformed for the third and last time on 15 July 1943 in the Transbaikal Front reserves in the Soviet Far East. It included the same regiments as the previous formations. The division became part of the 2nd Rifle Corps, and served with it for the entire war. In July 1945 the corps was assigned to the 36th Army, and in August the division fought n the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

Produced by Shital Bhatia, Dhaval Gada & Motion Picture Capital and distributed by Reliance Entertainment, Plan C Studios, Friday Filmworks & Pen India Limited. The film features Sidharth Malhotra, Manoj Bajpayee, Rakul Preet Singh, Pooja Chopra, Adil Hussain, Kumud Mishra, Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. Inspired by the Adarsh Housing society scam, the film's narrative centers around the relation between a colonel and his protege that gets affected when the latter becomes disillusioned upon overhearing a conversation and goes rogue with sensitive data related to his covert organization, prompting the colonel to race against time and hunt him down. After having its release date rescheduled from 26 January to 9 February to yet another week, it was released on 16 February 2018. Plot During a surveillance in South Block, New Delhi, Major Jai Bakshi overhears a conversation between Retired Lt. Gen Gurinder Singh, an Indian Arms Lobby representative and the Army Chief Pratap Malik. Gurinder tries to bribe him on behalf of a Czech firm, but threatens to expose the DSD (Data & Systems Diagnostics), a confidential operations unit which Jai is a part of, when the chief doesn't comply. Suspecting a major scam in the army, Jai continues with the surveillance for 2 months before going rogue with his cyber-expert girlfriend Sonia, taking along some information related to his organization. Colonel Abhay Singh, Jai's mentor, learns of this and decides to pursue Jai while he's himself pursued secretly by Officer Brig. Srinivas who reports his movements to Gurinder. After a meeting with the army chief who explains him about the real culprit and a powerful arms dealer named Mukesh Kapoor, Abhay finds his car pursued and manages to escape while the pursuers sent by Srinivas keep following the car. The DSD shift their location to an undisclosed location, and Gurinder enlists the help of a journalist named Kamya and provides her sensitive information that can expose the army's secrets. Abhay flies to London and so does a disguised Jai who is picked up by Sonia upon his arrival. In London, Jai manages to frighten Gurinder into transferring all his money into Jai's account while Abhay meets Tariq, a middle man for Intelligence agents, who arranges guns and tries to locate Jai and Sonia, eventually alerting Jai. A desperate Abhay meets Mukesh Kapoor and tells him his agents have captured Gurinder. He makes a deal with him, telling him to kill Jai and Sonia in exchange for the information he possesses as it threatens both the parties. While Jai is en route to meet an MI-6 agent to sell him the information, Mukesh's sniper tries to kill him. A few agents are killed and Jai is wounded, but manages to escape. Abhay picks up Sonia and calls Jai from her phone, telling him to come at a spot. Jai arrives, but is repeatedly punched by Abhay who then holds him on gunpoint while Jai justifies his actions and questions what the elder generation plans to leave for the present one. This makes Abhay agree with him, and Jai tells Mukesh to free Tariq in exchange for all the information Jai would personally deliver to him. Abhay heads back to India, disguised, where he follows Jai's instructions and meets Baburao, an old man who reveals about an army housing scam in Mumbai, involving Gurinder Singh and the Defence Minister. Abhay records his statement and hands it over to Kamya, his ex-girlfriend, who decides to play it after listening to Baburao's words. Gurinder, rescued by Srinivas after capturing DSD agents, receives the same audio recording and shoots himself after listening to it. The housing scam is exposed, due to which Srinivas is forced to free the captured DSD agents. The Indian Army and DSD's reputation is saved, while Jai goes to meet Mukesh. Right before entering the building, as he is being watched by Mukesh's agent, Jai decides not to hand over the information and disappears as a bus passes. Mukesh decides to let go, while Jai reunites with Abhay after 2 months.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The store is mentioned in two of Ernest Hemingway's short stories, \\"Up in Michigan\\" and \\"The Last Good Country.\\" History In 1870, Horton Bay's founder Samuel Horton established a homestead at this site. In 1876, Alonzo J. Stroud and William H. Ohle set up a sawmill near here and were soon employing up to 30 workers. With the influx of workers, Horton Bay quickly grew into a small community, and the need for a general store and other services soon became apparent. William H. Ohle withdrew from the sawmill business and concentrated on real estate and construction in the new community. Tradition has it that Ohle supervised the construction of the Horton Bay General Store, as well as many other early buildings in the community (including the next-door boardinghouse, now the Red Fox Inn. The General Store was likely built in 1877 or 1878. The store was constructed as a typical late nineteenth-century general store. The entire first floor carried a general stock of groceries, hardware, clothing, and other products, while the second floor served as living quarters for the proprietor. In 1879, the first post office for Horton Bay was located in the store. The store has operated more or less continuously since its construction. Alonzo Stroud owned the store from 1890 - 1894. He sold it to his clerk Conrad Schneider, who operated it for over ten years until selling it to Merton Fox in 1904. During the Great Depression, Ben and Margaret Belnap owned the store, and in 1972, Harriet Housel and her parents, George and Betty, took over ownership. Claudia and Chip Lorenger purchased the store in the early 2000s, and own it as of 2017. Description The Horton Bay General Store is a rectangular gable- front two-story frame Late Victorian commercial building, clad in clapboard, on a fieldstone foundation. It has a symmetrical, falsefront facade with an upper cornice containing a central triangular pediment. The storefront contains a centrally located, recessed doorway flanked by display windows. A storefront cornice with supporting bracketry is located at the point where the porch roof meets the facade. On the interior, the first story contains much of the original store interior finish, including a board ceiling, the original floor, some of the shelving units, and one sales counter. Several carbide and kerosene lamps are still in their locations. On the second floor, the living quarters have been extensively modernized.

His practice is informed by the concepts linking art, life science and the social sciences. Enmeshed at the junction of these worlds, his floating sculptures, community projects and interactive installations propose and explore new, sustainable ways of inhabiting and sensing the environment. In 2007 Saraceno activated projects aimed towards an ethical collaboration with the atmosphere, including Museo Aero Solar. These projects grew into the international, interdisciplinary artistic community Aerocene, who with Saraceno in 2020 launched the certified, untethered flight Fly with Aerocene Pacha, achieving six world records for altitude, distance, duration (both in the general and female category) using only the warmth of the sun and the air. Saraceno‚Äôs interest in spiders and their webs led to the formation of Arachnophilia.net and the Arachnomancy App. Through these platforms Saraceno invites people from around the globe to weave the web of interspecies understanding and take part in the challenge of Mapping Against Extinction.  Education and artistic career  Tom√°s Saraceno studied architecture at Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in Argentina between 1992 and 1999, after which he studied art and architecture in a postgraduate program at Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes de la Naci√≥n Ernesto de la C√°rcova, also in Buenos Aires. Saraceno then moved to Europe to complete his post graduate studies at St√§delschule. There, he was directed by Daniel Birnbaum (curator of the 53rd Venice Biennale) and studied under professors Thomas Bayrle and Ben van Berkel. In 2003-2004 Saraceno participated in the course \\"Progettazione e Produzione delle Arti Visive\\" (Design and Production of Visual Arts), held by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Olafur Eliasson at Instituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia (IUAV). Saraceno‚Äôs first installations were exhibited at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2002 and again at the Venice Arte Biennale in 2003, as well as at the S√£o Paulo Biennale of 2006. In 2009, he attended the International Space Studies Program at NASA Center Ames (Silicon Valley, California).That same year, Saraceno exhibited again in Venice, this time at the 53rd Arte Venice Biennale \\"Fare Mondi/Making Worlds\\", curated by Daniel Birnbaum, and won the Calder Prize. Saraceno‚Äôs work has been widely exhibited internationally in solo and group exhibitions. Most notably, these include: * \\"Aria\\", at Palazzo Strozzi, Florence, Italy, curated by Arturo Galansino (2020). * \\"Aero(s)cene: When breath becomes air, when atmospheres become the movement for a post fossil fuel era against carbon-capitalist clouds\\" and \\"Spider/Web Pavilion 7\\", at \\"May you live in interesting times\\", Venice Biennale, curated by Ralph Rugoff (2019). * \\"ON AIR\\", Carte blanche to Tom√°s Saraceno at Palais de Tokyo, curated by Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel (2018-2019); * \\"In orbit\\", at Kunstsammlung Nordrhein- Westfalen K21, D√ºsseldorf (2013-2016, 2017- ongoing); * \\"Aerocene\\", at Solutions COP21, Grand Palais, Paris (2015); * \\"Arachnid Orchestra. Jam Sessions\\", at NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (2015); * \\"Cloud Cities\\", at Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (2011‚Äì12); * \\"On the Roof: Cloud City\\", at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2012);  Awards  \\\\- 2019, The Golden Madonnina, The Design Prize - In the artistic realm; \\\\- 2010, 1822 Kunstpreis; \\\\- 2009, Alexander Calder Prize;  Selected works and projects  = Cloud Cities = Saraceno's long-term artistic research project (2002‚Äìpresent) draws inspiration from Buckminster Fuller and other radical architects. The aim of the project is to create a modular, transnational city in the clouds, the realization of which would be a new model for liberating and sustainable building practices. The exhibition Cloud Cities, presented at Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum f√ºr Gegenwart in Berlin (2011‚Äì12), consisted of a collection of geometric, inflated shapes that challenge the notions of place, space, future and gravity. Through the exhibition, Saraceno sought to explain how human beings live in combination with their environment. As curator and art historian Moritz Wesseler notes, \\"an aspect that is of great importance to Saraceno in this context is that the city's shape and size can be changed continually, subjecting conventional ideas about boundaries and territories to critical scrutiny. (...) The works he creates as part of this exploration can be considered components of sorts for the future cloud-city that can be assembled to create the desired complex in its entirety. But the components also exist in isolation, as independent sculptures or installations, evincing forces and qualities of their own that render them highly fascinating constructs.\\" = Observatory/Airport City = Related to Cloud Cities, Saraceno launched an exhibition 'Observatory/Air-Port-City' at the Hayward Gallery London (2008). The exhibition was composed of a collection of spheres, each housing autonomous residential units. The network of habitable cells float in the air, combining and recombining like clouds, constructing a flying airport. This is Saraceno's utopic vision: to create a new airborne nomadism. = On the Roof: Cloud City = Saraceno exhibited 'On the Roof: Cloud City' in the Iris and B Gerald Cantor Roof Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) New York City (2012). This consisted of a constellation of sixteen large, interconnected modules composed of glass segments and cut in non- identical geometric shapes held in place by steel joints, reinforcements and steel cables. Visitors were able to walk through the installation, which draws its shape from bacteria, clouds, universes, foam and neural communication networks. = In Orbit = In Orbit, installed since June 2013 at K21 St√§ndehaus, D√ºsseldorf, spans Saraceno's inquiries into urbanism, natural engineering and communication. Curated by Marion Ackermann, the installation hangs more than 25 meters above the piazza of the K21. Saraceno's installation combines the structure of a spider's web with the vision of Cloud Cities. Over 400,000 visitors to the exhibition have strolled, climbed, laid, on a 2,500 sqm web, dotted with massive inflated PVC spheres. The movement of each participant is felt by others, exhibiting a potential for new modes of human communication. = On Space Time Foam = 'On Space Time Foam', an installation by Saraceno and curated by Andrea Lissoni, was inspired by the cubic shape of the exhibition space at HangarBicocca, Milan, appearing there in 2013. The structure was composed of three levels of thin, clear film fixed to the walls and floating at a height of 14 to 20 metres, covering an area of 400 square metres. Visitors were granted access to three levels of the artwork, finding themselves in mid-air, encouraging the loss of spatial coordination. HangarBicocca has a cubic form. The cube, a geometric form often used by scientists to represent the concepts of space and time, inspired Saraceno to create an installation in which the visitors' movements enact the time variable, thereby introducing the concept of the fourth dimension within the three-dimensional space. The title of the work can be traced to quantum mechanics on the origins of the universe, distinguished by the idea of extremely fast-moving subatomic particles that can trigger changes in spatio- temporal matter. Freely inspired by these theories, Saraceno makes their movements metaphorically visible. The installation is a device that calls perceptual certainties into question; it is an element that modifies the architecture containing it, a structure that makes the interrelationships among people and visible space, an attempt to overcome the laws of gravity. As the artist explained, \\"the films constituting the living core of HangarBicocca are constantly altered by climate and the simple movement of people. Each step, each breath, modifies the entire space: it is a metaphor for how our interrelations affect the Earth and other universes.\\" = Solar Bell = Saraceno has developed a Solar Bell flying sculpture made of lightweight and sustainable materials. Its design is based on the modular tetrahedron, or four-sided pyramid, invented by Alexander Graham Bell during his early investigations into manned flight. Bell made important discoveries in the field of aviation and frame construction, and happened upon the strongest geometrical structure known in the cosmos, the octet truss. This was the same spaceframe that Buckminster Fuller later followed for his Geodesic dome. 'Solar Bell' was the final project in a series of artworks created to accompany the expansion of the Port of Rotterdam with the construction of Maasvlakte 2 in the Netherlands in 2013. Solar Bell Ensemble, Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, USA 2016. = Flying Plaza = Inspired by Solar Bell, Saraceno developed the idea of entire cities built upon lighter-than-air structures and sustainable energy technologies, lifted by the wind and suspended above the surface of the Earth. This 'flying plaza' represents an inquiry into public space, which according to Saraceno's vision, can be erected in alternative and fossil-free ways. Saraceno imagines spaces of dwellings as new urban skyscapes: flying buildings elevated by wind power alone, which erase the boundaries defined by geopolitics, and start to respond to local specificities. = Aerocene = Aerocene is a project that aims to explore environmental issues scientifically and artistically. It consists of sculptures that are kept in the air by the Sun's heat and by infrared ratiation.http://news.mit.edu/2017/aerocene-soars-at-wef-davos-0209 Aerosolar sculptures were officially presented during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21, at Grand Palais, Paris, 2015, after that a similar prototype has been tested in November at the White Sands Dunes of New Mexico. On November 8, 2015, it broke world records by achieving the longest and most sustainable certified flight (without fossil-fuel, solar panel, helium or batteries) ever registered: During approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes, seven people were lifted up in White Sands' desert landscape. With a net lift of more than 250 kg, the payload of the \\"D-O AEC Aerocene\\" solar sculpture has no precedent in the long history of manned solar balloon flight attempts. The project has evolved from Tom√°s Saraceno's residency at L'Observatoire de l'Espace, CNES. Led by Saraceno, the project's team is composed of leading scientists and engineers, including collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), Braunschweig University of Technology - Institute of Architecture- related Art (IAK), TBA21 Academy, Red Cross Red Crescent, and numerous universities, research centers, cultural and art institutions, and museums around the world. = Aerocene Explorer = The Aerocene Explorer is a flight kit. Participants can hack the devices pack, create their own lightweight sensors, and lift them up. Data collected with the Aerocene Explorer can be uploaded and shared with Aerocene's open-source online community, via an interactive website that encourages participants all over the world to share their experiments, photos and videos, comments, and innovations. = Museo Aero Solar Community = The \\"Museo Aero Solar\\" group is an open-source international community, initiated in 2008 by Tom√°s Saraceno in conversation with Alberto Pesavento. The community organizes events around the world to turn plastic bags into lighter-than-air sculptures, creating airborne flying museums. Sending a message for sustainability, Museo Aero Solar retakes and transforms a pollutant. The resulting collection includes more than 20,000 plastic bags culled from countries including Colombia, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Palestine, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, amongst others. = Stillness in Motion - Cloud Cities = Stillness in Motion ‚Äî Cloud Cities, was launched by Saraceno and curated by Joseph Becker at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), San Francisco in 2016. Organized by the SFMOMA Architecture and Design department, the exhibition comprises an immersive, site-specific cloudscape installation of suspended tension structures and floating sculptures, as well as explorations of the intricate constructions of spider webs. = Arachnid Research Lab = Since 2008, Saraceno has conducted research in his studio into the woven habitats of spiders. This research was born out of Saraceno's interest in the origins of the cosmos and the structure of spacetime. The Earth, being set within a web-like structural dimension was the inspiration that propelled the research into comparisons between this, and natural phenomena within our planet; namely, spider webs. In developing this line of inquiry, Saraceno pioneered the invention of the first machine of its kind capable of scanning, digitising, and measuring a three dimensional spider web. The first scan in history was made on a Black Widow spider's web and was first presented in 2010 at the exhibition '14 Billions (Working Title)' at the Bonniers Konsthall in Sweden. Developed over two years in collaboration with arachnologists, astrophysicists, architects and engineers, the installation depicted the black widow spider's web on a 1.17 scale and was composed of 8000 black strings connected with over 23,000 individually tied knots, spanning 400 cubic meters. This installation provided the visitor with the opportunity to observe themselves in the act of becoming a community by being immersed in this interconnected woven habitat. Today, the Arachnid Research Lab develops many other projects including the archive of Arachnophiliac encouters. On the occasion of the 2019 Venice Biennale and in the context of the sixth mass extinction, Saraceno launched the Arachnomancy App with the help of the Arachnophilia community. Through this app, users are encouraged to notice, document and map spider webs they encounter in both wild and urban spaces. = Hybrid Webs = The secondary output of the research conducted in the Arachnid Research Lab are the 'Hybrid Webs' - the collective term for a series of sculptures devised by Saraceno. Each sculpture, made entirely of spider silk is designed to appear as a unique, geometric galaxy floating in infinite space. Creating the sculptures means incorporating webs woven by spiders who are social, asocial or between the two. During the building period, the sculptures are turned onto each side, allowing gravity to aid the interweaving of silk from different sorts of spider. The works' titles reveal the technical specifications of each sculptural element; the genus and species of spiders employed and the time taken by each spider to complete its web. The final sculpture is thereby an emblem of an encounter which might not otherwise have succeeded, and so prompts a reflection on human coexistence with ourselves and the natural world. 'Hybrid Webs' have been exhibited worldwide: \\\\- \\"May you live in interesting times\\", Venice Biennale, curated by Ralph Rugoff (2019); \\\\- \\"ON AIR\\", Carte blanche to Tom√°s Saraceno at Palais de Tokyo, curated by Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel (2018-2019); \\\\- Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, New York and at Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2018); \\\\- Pinksummer Contemporary Art, Rome (2016); \\\\- Istanbul Design Biennial, Istanbul (2016); \\\\- 11th Shanghai Biennial, Shanghai (2016); \\\\- Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt (2016); \\\\- UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, USA (2016); \\\\- MARCO, Museum for Contemporary Art, Monterrey, Mexico (2016); \\\\- Cultural Center; Espace Muraille, Geneva (2015); \\\\- Chicago Architectural Biennial, Chicago (2015); \\\\- Louvre Museum, Paris (2015); \\\\- Georg Kolbe Museum, Berlin (2014); \\\\- Museo di Villa Croce, Genoa, Italy (2014); \\\\- Esther Schipper, Berlin (2012); = Arachnid Orchestra Jam Session = Saraceno has also developed a line of inquiry into the sound properties of spider webs. In collaboration with arachnologists, musicians and sound engineers based in Singapore and elsewhere, Saraceno has harnessed the structural properties of spider silk, transforming the web into a musical instrument. Since spiders do not possess an auditory system, they perceive the world around them with pressure and vibrations that come from their own movement, for example web-plucking. A cobweb is therefore a sensory object, an extension of a spider's body and the vibrations communicated via this practice are used for attraction, hunting and other social interactions. Saraceno has succeeded in amplifying these inaudible vibrations and web-pluckings into acoustic rhythms. This was presented by Saraceno at the 'Arachnid Orchestra Jam Session', curated by Ute Meta Bauer at the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (2015). The focus of this exhibition, which included a run of live performances, was to push the boundaries of interspecies communication.

Gillespie had previously collaborated with Ben Wheatley, who executive produced. Rupert Evans, Deirdre Mullins, Steve Garry, Michael Smiley, April Pearson, and Gordon Kennedy, Tom Meeten, and Alex March star. Evans, Mullins, Garry, Smiley, Kennedy, Meeten portray mercenaries tasked with transporting a hostage (Pearson) and survivor (March) across a battlefield. Along the way, the mercenaries become trapped in an abandoned armoured personnel carrier they enter as refuge against an unseen enemy. (Despite the film's title, the vehicle portrayed is not a tank but a Type 432 armoured personnel carrier, a vehicle used to deploy infantry. The 432 was known in British Army service as the Bulldog, hence the two alternative film titles.) It premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival.  Plot  In a forest, mercenaries Reeves and Karlsson rejoin the rest of their squad ‚Äì Gantz, Capper, Evans, commanding officer Smith, along with two hooded and bound captives. Reeves reports fleeing from a group of hostiles, as Karlsson sedates Capper, whose leg is badly wounded. Evans reports a farm and jeep nearby, and Smith orders them to investigate. At the farm, Reeves vomits after seeing a mysterious orange powder. Evans, already nervous, becomes increasingly erratic after finding the jeep's engine has been sabotaged in a gruesome manner. As Karlsson sedates Evans and tends to Capper, Reeves and Gantz explore the farm. Reeves and Gantz find mercenaries, whom they refer to as \\"group D\\", and two other captives, all decapitated, in a barn. As they return, they hear music from a storage container. They find a woman inside, who panics when they turn off the music. Karlsson sedates her and Smith orders her brought along. An enemy flare is shot off, and Smith orders a retreat, leaving Capper behind. Gantz and Evan fire at a hooded figure before retreating, but Evan returns as Capper calls out. The rest flee through a field until they encounter an abandoned armoured personnel carrier. Seeking refuge, they throw out its cargo while Gantz fires at another hooded figure. One of the prisoners stabs Gantz, and Reeves kills her. Once inside the vehicle, they hear noises from outside as attackers attempt to open the door, which Gantz then jams. Karlsson gives them tranquilizers to help them sleep. Smith orders Gantz to fix the tank. Gantz finds a rotting corpse in the front of the vehicle, but fails to start the engine. He sees another strange figure outside the viewport. Searching the vehicle for tools, they find bottles of orange powder labelled \\"Kratos\\". Annabella, the surviving prisoner, claims to be a teacher and explains it means \\"strength and power\\" in ancient Greek. She secretly pockets a flare gun from a toolcase. Reeves dreams of the monster Gantz saw and an argument between Smith and the others about the notebook he constantly writes. He awakens and questions Annabella, who claims to not remember why she is there. The next morning, the argument Reeves dreamt occurs, but Smith refuses to show the notebook. Gantz attempts to repair the engine again, but cannot reach it. He reports an orange powder on the engine, before seeing a monstrous, gasmask-wearing enemy outside the vehicle. After being calmed, he refuses to return, and Karlsson sedates him. Smith orders Reeves to attempt to fix the engine next. Karlsson begins looking through files stored in the vehicle, and finds they are dossiers on the mercenaries and their captives, identifying them as dead, including Smith. Smith expresses disbelief, saying he did not expect that many casualties, but claims he doesn't know anything. Reeves inspects the corpse in the front of the vehicle, and finds that the dog tags are for Evans. As Reeves attempts to fix the engine, Capper appears and taunts them, refusing to open the hatch. He suggests Smith knows what is going on, and asks Karlsson if she knows what she has been injecting everyone with. As Smith and Karlsson argue, Annabella shoots Smith with the flare gun, killing him. Karlsson kills her, before realizing she was accidentally shot by Smith when he was attacked. Before Karlsson dies, she reads through Smith's mission notes, finding that Smith has been recording the dosages of the red-tinted sedative. Reeves is able to start the engine. Egged on by Capper, who ingests Kratos, Reeves attempts to run him over. Capper eventually trips and falls, and challenges Reeves to run him over, which Reeves does. Later, after Reeves has stopped the vehicle, the rescued woman wakes and discovers everyone but Reeves dead. She finds that the hatch is no longer jammed, and flees. Figures in hazmat suits and gas masks arrive, along with a gas masked man in a suit. Finding a survivor in the vehicle, he declares \\"It worked, good.\\" before ordering Reeves killed. The forest from the start is shown again, as a loudspeaker announces that an experiment is about to begin, and a soldier emerges from a white box.  Cast  * Rupert Evans as Reeves * Deirdre Mullins as Karlsson * Steve Garry as Gantz * Michael Smiley as Capper * April Pearson as Annabella, a hostage * Gordon Kennedy as Smith * Tom Meeten as Evans * Alex March as the test subject Neil Maskell makes a cameo as the voice of the announcer, and Nick Gillespie appears as the businessman.  Production  Writer-director Nick Gillespie had collaborated with executive producer Ben Wheatley on several films previously, including Kill List. Smiley had also appeared in that film. Besides Wheatley, Gillespie cited Clive Barker as an influence. Although the film was not meant to be deeply political, Gillespie used imagery reminiscent of the Abu Grahib Prison Scandal to subvert viewer expectations about the prisoners. When they are revealed to be young women, Gillespie said it is meant to signify that \\"something's not quite right there\\". Of the film's plot, Gillespie said it was designed to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions, as he found it more interesting to offer clues than direct answers.  Release  Tank 432 premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival on 23 July 2016. It was released on DVD in the UK on 22 August, and IFC Films released it to video on demand in the US on 25 November 2016.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 13% of eight surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.5/10. Metacritic rated it 43/100 based on seven reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it \\"makes the familiar mistake of confusing obscurity with tension\\". Scheck further described it as \\"an occasionally intriguing but frustratingly oblique high-concept genre exercise that mainly induces tedium, not to mention claustrophobia\\". Writing in Film Journal International, Maitland McDonagh called it a \\"claustrophobic thriller with a disappointing payoff\\". Commenting on the plot, McDonagh said the film delivers many bizarre twists but \\"plays fair\\" in the climax. Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times called it a \\"high concept tease\\" with an unsatisfying conclusion and plot possibly kept vague to hide its lack of originality. At the Los Angeles Times, Noel Murray called the film \\"more tedious and confusing\\" than ambiguous. Murray concluded, \\"A few memorable shots don't offer enough justification to watch a film that's not scary, rarely exciting and never as engrossing a puzzle as it means to be.\\" Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice compared the plot negatively to The Outer Limits, calling the film a \\"busy but tedious thriller\\". In rating it 3/5 stars, Drew Tinnin of Dread Central praised the cinematography and acting but said answers to the film's plot come too late and are not satisfying. In recommending it for fans of atmospheric films, Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting wrote, \\"This bad boy is all mood and atmosphere ‚Äì at times feeling like an exercise in tension and dread more than a narrative.\\"  References   External links  * 2015 films 2015 horror films 2010s thriller films British films British horror thriller films English-language films 2010s psychological horror films ","title":"Tank 432"},{"id":"53713810","text":"73rd Road near the junction with 30th Road The 73rd Road is one of the most major Roads of Mandalay.

It presents an alphabetical listing of cricketers who debuted for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class cricket from the beginning of the 1827 season until the end of the 1863 season. Many of the players continued to represent the club after 1863 but they are only listed here, as it was in this period that they made their MCC debuts. Players who debuted for MCC before 1827 can be found in List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1787‚Äì1826). The \\"roundarm era\\" began in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches being played that season; 1863 was the last season before overarm bowling was legalised. MCC played all its home matches through the roundarm era at its own Lord's venue in north London. Although many of the players who represented the club were members or ground staff, others were associated with county clubs or teams and appeared for MCC by invitation. MCC teams have always operated at all levels of the sport and players who represented the club in minor cricket only are out of scope here. The details are the player's usual name followed by the span of years in which he was active as an MCC player in important matches (the span may include years in which he played in minor matches only for MCC and/or years in which he did not represent MCC in any matches) and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards (e.g., surname preceded by all initials). In cases where the player represented significant other teams besides MCC, these are given at the end of his entry. A * Sir Thomas Abdy, 1st Baronet, of Albyns (1834) : T. N.

The Czech Republic is represented in the Kurdistan Region through a consulate general in Erbil since 2006, while the Kurdistan region has no representation in the Czech Republic. Relations between the two are characterized by high level talks and cooperation against ISIS. Kurdish President Massoud Barzani visited the Czech Republic in 2015, meeting President Milo≈° Zeman and other senior government officials. In November 2015, Czech President Milo≈° Zeman said that he believes the Kurdistan Region will soon become independent. History =Czechoslovak contacts with Kurdish rebels during the Iraqi Republic (1958-1968)= Prague recognized Abd al-Karim Qasim's government on 16 July 1958, and also maintained relations with Kurdish rebels and Iraqi communists. In 1959, a few weeks after the opening of the Czechoslovak embassy in Baghdad, the secretary of the Czech ambassador met with Mustafa Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, in Baghdad. In 1960, Iraq and Czechoslovakia signed a protocol on scientific and technical cooperation and Iraqi students, a majority of them Kurds, travelled to Czechoslovakia to study. After the Ba'athist takeover in 1963, Czechoslovakia ended its support for the Iraqi regime and shifted focus towards the Iraqi Communist Party and the Kurds, both of whom were in opposition. Prague established diplomatic ties with the new regime in February 1963, but maintained contacts with the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Mustafa Barzani. In July 1963, the governing Communist Party of Czechoslovakia adopted policies with the aim of isolating Baghdad internationally, using the Kurds and the communists. Officially, the position of Czechoslovakia regarding Kurdish matters in Iraq was to maintain a position of restraint and not condemn or condone anything. Furthermore, Prague would support the Iraqi government but continue to raise the Kurdish issue internationally to seek a solution and an end to the Kurdish genocide. This was disclosed from a report from 23 July 1963. In this period, Prague did not allow any activity in Iraq that was associated with fighting the Kurds. The Kurdish leader and member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party Jalal Talabani visited Prague in July 1963, where he held talks with the Czechoslovak Committee of Solidarity with the Nations of Asia and Africa. During his visit, he urged Prague to provide the Kurds with moral, financial and military support. The Czechoslovak government subsequently decided to send light weapons to about 2,000 Kurdish fighters, but it was not possible to transport the weapons from Czechoslovakia to the Kurdistan Region. Eventually, Prague decided to give to the Kurds the money raised from weapons sales to Baghdad, a policy which continued despite criticism from Baghdad. In 1965 Barzani sent a letter to the Permanent Mission of Czechoslovakia to the United Nations urging Prague to stop supplying arms to the Iraqi regime, but his request was ignored. In 1975, when Prague began returning Kurdish students to the Ba'athist regime, students led by Yekta Uzunoglu began a hunger strike to protest the measures. =Czech Republic (2003-2013)= After a deterioration of relations between Czechoslovakia and Iraq due to the Iraq-Iran war, and the Czech Republic's participation in sanctions against Iraq from 1990 to 2003, the Czech Republic focused primarily on the reconstruction of Iraq, but in 2006 a liaison office was opened in Erbil and cultural exhibitions have been held in the Kurdistan Region in this period. =Strengthen of ties and military aid (2014-)= In 2015, a Czech- Kurdish Chamber of Commerce was founded with the aim of promoting development and growth between Czech companies in the Kurdistan Region and vice versa. In March 2017, the Czech government announced that they would invest in the Kurdish agriculture sector. The Czech Republic has been aiding Kurdish military forces (Peshmerga) since 2014, when ISIS entered Iraq and captured Mosul. In August 2014, the Czech Republic sent Kurdistan 500 tons of ammunition for Kalashnikovs, machine guns, bazookas and 500 hand grenades. The shipment mostly consisted of arms not used any longer by the Czech military. In December 2014, the Czech government announced that 5,000 anti-tank missiles were en route to Kurdistan for the fight against ISIS. In January 2016, Czech Deputy Defense Minister Jakub Landovsky visited Erbil to discuss bilateral ties and the fight against ISIS. Landovsky also visited a Peshmerga base in Gwer near Mosul. In the same month, after a meeting with high-ranking Czech officials, the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka announced that his country would send Kurdistan more rifles and ammunition. The Czech Republic has also been training Peshmerga in mine-clearance operations and training Kurdish doctors in Paris, and operates some construction projects in the region.

Cervi won the barrel racing title at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1995, 1999, 2010, and 2013. She was inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame and Museum in 2018. Early life Sherry Cervi was born on September 17, 1975, in Tucson, Arizona. Sherry Cervi is the younger daughter of Mel and Wendy Potter. She was raised in Marana, Arizona. Her parents were both members of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), and encouraged Cervi and her older sister Jo Lynn to learn to ride. Cervi began competing in local rodeos at age six. Cervi continued to compete in rodeo as she grew up, and in high school she also played on the basketball team. Her height - - worked to her advantage. She was named an all-conference pick. After graduating from Marana High School, Cervi enrolled at Central Arizona College. During her freshman year, she competed on the school's rodeo team. The following year, she left the college team and joined the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) as a barrel rider. She continued to take classes towards a degree. Career Professional rodeo participants who compete in the PRCA travel to dozens of rodeos each year. The top 15 competitors qualify for the annual NFR. However, barrel racers are ranked by the amount of money they win at rodeos sanctioned by the WPRA. The top money earners in barrel racing in the WPRA are invited to the NFR. In 1994, her second year as a professional, Cervi qualified for the NFR. She finished second. The following year, Cervi qualified for the NFR as not only the top seed in barrel racing, but with the top earnings during the season of any of the 120 contestants. This allowed her to wear the \\"Number 1\\" tag, making her the second woman in NFR history, after Charmayne James, to do so. She won her first world title.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 1995 World Champion, p. 9.

In 2001, Cervi's husband was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed. In conjunction with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, a three-day Olympic Command Performance Rodeo was hosted to showcase Western culture. Both the United States and Canada brought five competitors in each event. The winners would receive both prize money and medals. Cervi was one of the United States representatives. Cervi won her third world title in 2010.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 2010 World Champion, p. 9. Cervi remarried in 2013, to Cory Petska, a top team roping competitor in the PRCA. The same year, a woman named Susan Rowan was convicted of impersonating Cervi from 2008‚Äì2010. The woman defrauded several companies and attempted to meet men. During the 2013 season, Cervi competed at more than 45 rodeos, including a win at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. In one three-week span, she won almost $70,000. At the 2013 NFR, Cervi placed in the top six in each the ten rounds. She was only the fifth barrel racer to do so in NFR history. She earned more money at the NFR than any other competitor. Her combined time of 138.15 seconds broke the record set by Jill Moody in 2010. Cervi was named world champion and aggregate champion.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 2013 World Champion, p. 9. Her earnings of $155,899 at the NFR were the most of any female competitor, earning her the Top Gun Award. This win was one of 12 championships she won that year. Her excellent 2013 season helped her reach a rare $2 million in lifetime earnings, the most of any barrel racer. In early 2015, a group of elite rodeo competitors, including Cervi, formed the Elite Rodeo Athletes, a for-profit organization collectively owned by its competitors. They planned to compete against each other at several rodeos around the country, culminating in a world championship at the end of their season. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, which runs the men's events at the NFR, promptly changed its bylaws to prohibit their contestants from having an ownership interest in another rodeo association. Barrel racers were not affected, as the WPRA did not prohibit their members from holding financial interests in other rodeo associations. By 2016, Cervi reduced her professional rodeo involvement, competing in about one-third of the rodeos that her peers did. She hosts Sherry Cervi Youth Championships for young barrel racers, and she works in the family business, Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., in Wisconsin. She still qualified for the NFR, ranked 12th in the standings. In the second round, she finished in a tie for second with Lisa Lockhart, just one-hundredth of a second out of first. She earned $18,191 for the place. In 2018, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame inducted Cervi. =Horses= Cervi's important horses include the following: PC Frenchmans Hayday, nicknamed Dinero; Sir Double Delight nicknamed Troubles; Tinman; Jet Royal Speed, nicknamed Hawk; and MP Meter My Hay, nicknamed Stingray.

A hijacked truck was deliberately driven into crowds along Drottninggatan (Queen Street) before being crashed into an √Öhl√©ns department store. Five people were killed, including an eleven-year-old girl, and 14 others were seriously injured. The perpetrator was Rakhmat Akilov, a 39-year-old rejected asylum seeker and a citizen of Uzbekistan, who was apprehended several hours later. He had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State in a self-recorded video the day before the attack, and Uzbek authorities said he had allegedly joined the group. Akilov was convicted of murder and terrorist crimes, and sentenced to life in prison and, if released, deportation to Uzbekistan and lifetime expulsion from Sweden.  Attack  Akilov chose to attack during an afternoon as there were many people and tourists in the area. Akilov recorded a number of films in the Odenplan area where he is heard saying that it is time to kill \\"infidels\\" and that it grieved him how Muslims in the Levant and Afghanistan were dying. The attack took place at about 14:53 local time. It began when a truck for the Spendrups brewery was hijacked while making a delivery on the street Adolf Fredriks kyrkogata in central Stockholm. According to a Spendrups press release, the driver attempted to stop the hijacker by standing in front of the truck, but had to jump out of the way and was slightly injured when the hijacker accelerated towards him. The hijacker then drove the truck at high speed into a pedestrian street, going about down Drottninggatan, one of Stockholm's main shopping streets, hitting pedestrians along the way. Witnesses said the hijacker attempted to target children as he zigzagged on the street. The attack ended when the truck slammed into the √Öhl√©ns City department store on the corner of Drottninggatan and M√§ster Samuelsgatan. The truck caught fire, but the flames were quickly doused by firefighters. The hijacker jumped out and fled the scene. A homemade bomb was reportedly found in the truck after it was abandoned by the hijacker. Police sources said the device was found in a bag and had not been detonated, adding that the attacker had been burned by it. National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson later said they had found a suspicious object in the driver's seat that \\"could be a bomb or an incendiary device\\", and was pending further investigation.  Aftermath  = Immediate response = Swedish police officer in tactical gear on patrol the day after the attack in Stockholm The Parliament House and the metro system were locked down in response to the attack, and Stockholm Central Station was evacuated. All trains to and from Stockholm were put on hold, with traffic only resuming later in the evening. The Swedish Prime Minister said in a press statement that the attack appeared to be terrorism, and that police and security services were treating it as such. Two days after the attack, the prime minister said the following: King Carl XVI Gustaf, on behalf of the Royal Family, gave their condolences, stating, \\"Our hearts go out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and to their families.\\" Swedish media reported on those who chose to help the injured, especially medical doctors working nearby who ran to help those in need. Police from all over Stockholm were called in to assist after the attack. Swedish border controls were tightened following the attack, and travelers from other countries, including Nordic countries, were advised by police to bring their passports. However, the Swedish Security Service (S√§po) did not raise the risk assessment from \\"level 3\\" (on a scale of 1 to 5), the level it had been at since 2010. On the day of the attack, Norwegian police said officers in the country's largest cities and at Oslo Airport would be armed. The day after the attack, a man was arrested and part of the Gr√∏nland district of Oslo closed off by police after a \\"bomb-like\\" device was found, which was later destroyed in a controlled explosion. The man, a 17-year-old Russian citizen, was charged on 9 April with illegal possession of an explosive device. The man arrived with his family in Norway as an asylum seeker in 2010, and was known to the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) for having expressed support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). With his background from the Caucasus, the 17-year-old has been linked to two other young Chechen men from the same martial arts club in the northern village Vads√∏ who traveled to fight for ISIS in Syria. The events led PST to raise the terror alert, indicating that attempted attacks during the coming year are \\"likely\\". Police patrols were also increased in Finland's capital Helsinki. = Reactions =  Domestic  Flowers just outside the √Öhl√©ns department store in Stockholm the day after the attack On 9 April, the Swedish Prime Minister said the government intended to change immigration law to facilitate the removal of people whose applications to stay in Sweden have been rejected. On 9 April, more than forty thousand people gathered on Sergels torg (Sergel's Square) in Stockholm to honor the victims. Many people visited the site of the attack, leaving flowers and candles for the victims on Sergels Torg and on Drottninggatan, resulting in what was described as a \\"sea of flowers\\". Flowers were also left at G√∂taplatsen in Sweden's second-biggest city Gothenburg. After the attack, there were proposals in Aftonbladet‚Äîone of Sweden's biggest newspapers‚Äîthat vehicles be banned from Stockholm city center so they cannot be used as weapons, citing the use of vehicles as terrorist weapons in Stockholm as well as Nice, Berlin, Jerusalem, and London. The department store √Öhl√©ns had planned to re-open two days after the attack, but received heavy criticism after saying they would be selling smoke-damaged clothing at reduced rates. √Öhl√©ns later chose to stay closed for one more day and not to sell any damaged clothing. The Swedish far-right was accused of trying to profit from the attack, producing fake news and circulating fake quotations online. This included tweets and social media posts from officials of the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing nationalist party. A man with a name similar to that of the main suspect was falsely implicated on the website Avpixlat. Following the attack, the social media website Facebook was criticized for not deleting images of badly wounded or dead victims. On 11 April, a Facebook spokesman said the website had begun deleting the images. Swedish authorities started cracking down on illegal immigrants in the country after the attack. In April 2019, the municipality of Stockholm organised an event to place a wreath to commemorate the anniversary of the attack. Families of the victims were not invited and were banned from attending the event which the municipality said was \\"private\\".  International  Finland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs, lit up in the colours of the Swedish flag, in order to commemorate the victims The lights on the Eiffel Tower were switched off on the evening of the attack to mourn the deaths. Nice, a city which bore witness to a similar but deadlier attack in 2016, raised the Swedish flag at half-mast the day after the attack to show solidarity with the Swedish people. In Brussels, where a terrorist attack took place a year earlier, the ING Marnix building near the Throne metro station was also decorated with a moving Swedish flag animation. Responses by the heads of state or foreign ministers of several European countries were issued within hours of the attack. However, discussion among US news media and officials was dominated by the American missile strike in Syria, which happened the same day. St√©phane Dujarric, the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, said, \\"Our sympathy goes to the families of the victims and all those affected and we wish the injured a prompt recovery. The United Nations stands in solidarity with the people and Government of Sweden\\". Pope Francis also said prayers for the victims of the attack. Danish government minister Inger St√∏jberg expressed concerns that at least 12,000 illegal immigrants were still living in Sweden after having their asylum applications rejected. She said that if satisfactory answers could not be given by the Swedish government, Denmark would consider implementing border checks on the Danish side of the border. The only border checks done in April 2017 were on the Swedish side. The attack is described as \\"driven by jihadist ideology\\" by Europol.  Perpetrator  Swedish police initially published pictures of a man wearing a hooded jacket, who they wanted to question over the attack. At 19:55 (17:55 UTC) on 7 April, Rakhmat Akilov, a 39-year-old construction worker from Uzbekistan, was apprehended in M√§rsta, north of Stockholm, suspected, on probable cause, of \\"terrorist crimes through murder\\". The police said he had been found \\"behaving suspiciously with minor injuries\\" and was believed to have driven the truck. He was officially arrested at 01:15 on 8 April, and formally identified by the Swedish Prosecution Authority on 11 April. The Swedish Security Service (S√§po) was heavily involved in the investigation. In 2016, S√§po had received some information on the suspect, but were unable to confirm it when they followed up on it. They reportedly deemed him a \\"marginal figure\\" on the fringes of extremist groups. Akilov came from a Russian speaking family from a village outside Samarkand, currently in Uzbekistan. His older brother Olim Akilov stated in an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that they considered themselves a \\"typical Soviet family\\", and he mentions that they did not welcome the collapse of the USSR. According to the brother, neither Rakhmat Akilov nor his children were ever religious, and Rakhmat didn't attend mosque in Russia or Uzbekistan or show signs of increased religiosity. Akilov moved to Russia in 2009 to work at the same cement factory outside Moscow as his older brother, which he did until 2013 when he lost this job. As stated by Akilov during police interrogation, in Tashkent he applied for a visa to Poland, after which travelled to Warsaw and then Gdansk, from where he took a ferry to Sweden. Akilov arrived in Sweden on 10 October 2014. He claimed asylum at the Swedish Migration Agency. The agency registered his application under the given fake name although his true identity was known and despite that according to the Dublin Regulation his application should have been handled in Poland, as he already had a visa there. Akilov stated he needed refuge from \\"the Uzbek security services which he claims tortured him and accused him of terrorism and treason\\". However, Sweden's Migration Board ruled that there was no evidence of this, and in late 2016, Akilov was ordered to leave Sweden within four weeks. When he failed to do so voluntarily and did not appear at the Swedish Migration Agency when called, the case was referred to the police; however, he went into hiding and could not be found for deportation. Reportedly, he lived at various addresses in Stockholm suburbs and was known as a hard worker, and a \\"normal Muslim\\" who visited the mosque on Fridays but got drunk on weekends and used cannabis. Shortly before the attack, Akilov was fired from his construction job, due to using drugs and sleeping while at work on dangerous construction sites with asbestos. On 9 April, Swedish police said Akilov had \\"expressed sympathy for extremist organizations, among them IS [Islamic State]\\".\\"Uzbek suspect in Swedish attack sympathized with Islamic State: police\\" . Reuters. 10 April 2017. Retrieved 12 April 2017. On 14 April, Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov said that Akilov had joined ISIL after moving to Sweden, and had encouraged friends and family in Uzbekistan to fight for ISIL. Uzbekistan had opened an investigation and charged Akilov with participation in extremist, separatist and fundamentalist groups, as well as with making and distributing material that threatened public security. An Uzbek security source said Akilov had tried to travel to Syria in 2015 to join ISIL but was stopped at the Turkey-Syria border and sent back to Sweden. The source added that, two months before the attack, Uzbek authorities had put Akilov on a wanted list for those suspected of religious extremism. The Foreign Minister said that intelligence on Akilov had been \\"passed to one of our Western partners, so that the Swedish side could be informed\\". The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs said it had not received such information. ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but experts note that the group tends not to do so if its members are arrested, as in the Stockholm attack. Akilov was registered at the same address as another person with links to financial crime. Initial suspicions of those involved sending money to ISIS could not be confirmed, though a number of people were convicted of false accounting and severe tax crimes. Early reports suggested Akilov had exchanged WhatsApp messages with a Chechen ISIL supporter just before and immediately after the attack. The authenticity of the chat was questioned, however. His former Facebook page reportedly linked to extremists and featured at least two ISIS propaganda videos. It has also been suggested that he had liked a Facebook page called \\"Friends of Libya and Syria\\", whose aim is to expose the \\"terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals\\" of the United States, Britain, and Arab \\"dictatorships\\". During his time in prison, Akilov had made \\"Hitler salutes\\" and racially insulted personnel, leading to an investigation for racial agitation which was later dropped as the threats and insults were directed to specific individuals and not made public. Akilov has shown aggressive tendencies in prison, which requires him to be protected by four employees, including one armed. Akilov has supported the Islamist organisation Hizb-ut-Tahrir on Facebook. According to the prosecutor, Akilov's motive for carrying out the attack was to make the Swedish government cease its military training effort in Iraq. = Legal proceedings = The public prosecutor successfully requested Akilov be remanded in custody during the preliminary investigation on 10 April 2017, pending a decision on prosecution. Akilov requested a Sunni Muslim defense attorney, which was rejected by the Stockholm District Court. A pre-trial hearing was held at Stockholm District Court on 11 April, where his lawyer said he confessed to a terrorist crime and intended to plead guilty. A court- ordered psychological evaluation determined that Akilov did not suffer from any mental disorder at the time of the attack. Prosecutor Hans Ihrman indicted Akilov for terrorist crimes on 30 January 2018. Akilov was found guilty of terrorist crimes by five murders, attempted terrorist crimes by 119 counts of attempted murder and 24 counts of endangering others on 7 June 2018. He was sentenced to life in prison, and will be legally allowed to request a time-set prison sentence in 2028. If released, he would be deported to Uzbekistan and banned from returning to Sweden. Akilov was imprisoned in Kumla Prison, a high security facility. In August 2018, he was assaulted by a fellow inmate who wanted vengeance for Akilov's terrorist attack. = Further investigation = Several other people were briefly detained by police in connection with the attack. Police said on 13 April that they had held about 700 interrogations and made approximately 300 seizures during the preliminary investigation. Five people were detained the day after the attack in two separate raids of a car and apartment linked to Akilov, all of whom were released from police custody within two days. The next day, a second suspect with links to Akilov was arrested on a lower level of suspicion of terrorist crimes through murder. The prosecutor revoked the arrest of the suspect two days later as the suspicions had weakened. Another person was arrested for an undisclosed offense on 23 April and two days later the arrest was revoked as the person was cleared of any involvement in the attack.  Casualties  Five people died as a result of the attack. Four of the victims who were killed at the scene or died in hospital shortly thereafter were identified as British Spotify executive Chris Bevington, 41, a 31-year-old Belgian psychologist, a 69-year-old Swedish woman, and Ebba √Ökerlund, an 11-year-old Swedish girl.

It shows Guidoriccio da Fogliano, the commander of the Sienese troops, on horseback against the background of a landscape in which the siege of Montemassi takes place.. For a long time it was assumed that the work was painted in 1330 by Simone Martini. This dating made it one of the first secular portraits and one of the first monumental landscape paintings. It is widely considered a masterpiece of European painting. In 1977, a frequently acrimonious debate started among art historians about the question whether Martini was indeed the artist. On the same wall in the Sala del Mappamondo another fresco has been discovered that could support the theory that the fresco is not as old as originally thought, and not a work by Martini. However, this matter is still unresolved.  Description  In the middle of the fresco Guidoriccio da Fogliano, a condottiero (mercenary officer) and commander of the Sienese troops, is depicted on horseback. He is shown in profile with a Field Marshal‚Äôs baton in his hand. On the left Montemassi can be seen surrounded by ramparts. To the right of the central figure of Guidoriccio there is a siege engine with the flag of the Sienese Republic in top. Further to the right there is a group of tents at the foot of a hill, with white and black flags and pennants flying. At the bottom of the fresco the year of the conquest of Montemassi by Sienese troops (1328) is given in Roman numerals: MCCC.XX.VIII.  History  The murals in the Palazzo Pubblico were commissioned by the Council of Nine, Siena's ruling body. The murals capture important triumphs in the history of Siena. From the beginning of the 14th century the city council commissioned murals of castles and cities that were conquered by Siena. By decorating the meeting room of the Council of Nine with these images, it was made clear that these cities and castles were now the inalienable property of Siena. In this sense, the frescoes can be seen as an artistic form of political propaganda. Guidoriccio da Fogliano at the Siege of Montemassi These frescoes eventually filled two walls of the meeting room in the Palazzo Pubblico. Between 1314 and 1331 at least seven castles were painted. Documents show that Simone Martini painted at least four of them: Montemassi and Sasso Forte in 1330, and Arcidosso and Castel Del Piano in 1331. Around 1345, many of these frescoes had to make way for the Mappamondo, the world map by Ambrogio Lorenzetti which is now lost. In the seventeenth or eighteenth century, major restoration work was carried out to restore images that had been lost during the construction of the Mappamondo. The fresco with the equestrian image has always captured the imagination of art historians and the general public. It is seen as a unique mix of realism and artistic imagination. For many it is not just a portrait of one particular warlord during a specific campaign, but a reflection on war and knighthood in general. The Guidoriccio has been considered one of the first secular, i.e. strictly non-religious, portraits, and one of the first monumental landscape paintings in Western art. An icon of 14th-century art, it was considered to be one of the best works by Simone Martini. Over the centuries, the horseman has become an emblem of Siena which is still frequently found on souvenirs and local products. Many tourists came, and come, to Siena to see the fresco.  Controversy  The Castle of Montemassi is clearly recognizable in the Guidoriccio. Therefore, it was long believed that this must be the fresco that Simone Martine was commissioned to paint by the Sienese city government in 1330. This assumption was challenged in 1977 by the American art historians Gordon Moran and Michael Mallory. At first, they claimed that while most of the fresco had indeed been painted by Martini, the central image of the horseman had not. They came to this conclusion because in their view horse and rider are not really part of the wider scene. They also pointed out that commander Guidoriccio da Fogliano changed his allegiance to on an enemy of Siena in 1333. It seemed unlikely that the Council of Nine would have tolerated the portrait of \\"a turncoat\\" in such a prominent place in the town hall. Moran and Mallory suggested that the rider image was added to the fresco in 1351, after the death of Guidoriccio da Fogliano who had by then been reinstated as commander of the Sienese troops. Simone Martini died in 1344. This theory was at first not taken seriously at all, and later fiercely contested. Moran and Mallory have stated that they were systematically thwarted by prominent Italian art historians and by the Sienese authorities. Their publications were rejected by journals and not included in scholarly bibliographies and catalogs. They say that they were prevented from presenting their theory at conferences, and were not allowed to do further research in Siena.  New ideas on attribution  340x340px The debate took on a new dimension a few years later when a previously unknown fresco was discovered on the western wall of the Sala del Mappamondo. It is probably one of the castle frescoes that disappeared behind plaster circa 1345 when the Mappamondo was installed in the hall. It is partly overlapped by the Guidoriccio, has a similar theme (two persons and a castle) and is of high quality. Some point to Duccio as the creator, others argue that this underlying fresco is definitely by Simone Martini. According to Moran and Mallory, this is Martini's fresco of the castle in Arcidosso. This would mean that the Guidoriccio cannot be the Montemassi fresco painted by Simone Martini in 1330 because it partly overlaps the image of Arcidosso, which was painted a year later in 1331. The main issue in the Guidoriccio debate therefore no longer was whether perhaps the equestrian image had not been painted by Simone Martini, but whether the entire fresco could be attributed to him. It has been suggested that the Guidoriccio was painted by Lippo Memmi, a brother-in-law of Simone Martini who had a similar style. However, this theory is not widely supported.  New ideas about dating  The debate on the correct attribution of the Guidoriccio raged for decades in scientific journals as well as in the wider media; still no final conclusion has been reached. It is unusual for a debate among art historians about the dating and attribution of a 14th-century work of art to take this long and get so much public attention. Those who think that it is a work by Simone Martini base their opinion on stylistic similarities with his other work. Their opponents point out facts concerning the technical preparation of the fresco and possible anachronisms in the imagery that would make it unlikely that it was painted around 1330. They refer to the architecture of the castles, heraldic elements and the siege engines depicted. They usually conclude that the Guidoriccio could not have been painted before the fifteenth century. The fact that Vasari in his famous painters' biography Le Vite from 1550 makes no mention of a work as prominent as the horseman fresco is seen by some as a reason to date it even later. There is still no consensus about the painter and the date of creation of the Guidoriccio.

Life He was born on 24 June 1774 at Garn Deilo fach in the parish of Llanfair-Nant-y-G√¥f, Pembrokeshire, the fifth son of Henry and Ann Shadrach of Nevern. As an adult and farm servant to a local Independent minister, John Richards, he had access to his employer's books. At his master's suggestion he decided to enter the Independent ministry, and in 1798 he went on a preaching tour to North Wales. Shadrach was induced by to remain in the area as a schoolmaster, first at Hirnant near Bala, and then at Pennal and Derwenlas near Machynlleth. Towards the end of 1802 he was ordained pastor of the independent church at Llanrwst. There he campaigned against the G≈µyl Mabsantau which flourished in the district. In November 1806 he removed to north Cardiganshire, where he had charge of the churches of Talybont and Llanbadarn Fawr. In 1819 Shadrach took on a new church which he formed at Aberystwyth, and for which, two years later, he built a chapel, at his own cost. In poor health, he resigned his charges in August 1835, but continued to preach until his death on 18 January 1844. He was buried at St. Michael's Church, Aberystwyth. Works Shadrach has been called the \\"Bunyan of Wales\\", for his use of allegory, a title also given to Christmas Evans. He was the author of 27 works, all but one in Welsh. They were mostly homiletic in character, sketches of sermons that he had given. A Looking Glass; neu Ddrych y Gwrthgiliwr (Carmarthen, 1807, and reprints), was translated into English by Edward S. Byam, chief magistrate of Mauritius, as The Backslider's Mirror: a popular Welsh treatise, translated from the ancient British Language, London, 1845. His final work, Cerbyd o Goed Libanus (Aberystwyth, 1840), included some autobiographical notes. In 1836 Shadrach wrote a prophetic ballad about the Aberdyfi district, which gained a reputation. Family Azariah Shadrach married Margaret Maurice in 1805. They had at least four children, Eliakim Lloyd, Eve, Joanna and David Shadrach.

It stars Iza Calzado, Ian Veneracion, TJ Trinidad, Michael de Mesa, and Adrienne Vergara. The film competed in Japan at the 12th Osaka Asian Film Festival in March 2017 to critical acclaim, where Calzado also garnered the Yakushi Pearl Award for Best Performer. The film premiered in the Philippines on May 10. Bliss explores elements of a film within a film narrative where the protagonist also plays the lead. Synopsis Jane Ciego (Iza Calzado), a successful actress, produces her own film to gain respect from the industry. During the film production, she is involved in an accident that leaves her disabled. She is left in a secluded house to avoid more attention from the press, under the care and supervision of her husband, Carlo (TJ Trinidad) and a cruel, unusual nurse named Lilibeth (Adrienne Vergara). As days go by, she descends into insanity as she experiences horrors and madness while being trapped in her own home.

His first choice for the lead role had been Anne Curtis but the latter turned it down. After auditioning several actresses, the role eventually went to Iza Calzado. Tarog took roughly three to four months to write the screenplay. He credited foreign films such as Ingmar Bergman's Persona, Misery, and anything by Japanese director Satoshi Konmost notably his films Perfect Blue (1997) and Millennium Actress (2001)as inspirations in crafting the film. Tarog scored the film for about three weeks. Marketing Bliss teaser trailer was released by February 2017, followed by an official trailer the following month. Release During a special screening of the film's uncut version at the Cine Adarna, UP Diliman, Quezon City, April 3, 2017 Bliss first premiered in Japan, as an entry to the 12th Osaka Asian Film Festival held from March 3 to 12, 2017. The film was well received during its run at the festival. Accordingly, the festival awarded Iza Calzado the Yakushi Pearl Award for Best Performer award which she accepted on March 11. In the Philippines, the film was originally rated \\"X\\" by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board due to its depiction of excessive nudity and violence, and masturbation, deeming it unsuitable for public consumption. One of the board members noted the nudity to be \\"gratuitous\\". The producers held a special free screening of the uncut version at the Cine Adarna in the University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City on April 3, 2017. On April 5, Tarog confirmed through his Instagram profile that the film had been reevaluated to an \\"R-18\\" rating without cuts. Reception Oggs Cruz of CNN Philippines called it \\"...a well-crafted film, one that even outshines Heneral Luna in terms of consistency, and heck, even ambition.\\" He concluded that Bliss is a film \\"whose pleasures aren‚Äôt immediate. It isn‚Äôt as emotionally rousing as Heneral Luna or Sana Dati, whose themes of nationalism or romantic love, respectively, are things that provoke effortlessly. Bliss seems to be more cerebral, a work that forces its viewers to think before they feel.\\" Rose Carmelle Lacuata of ABS-CBN News said that Iza Calzado's performance \\"...was able to effectively play the role of an actress trapped in her own world. It is not surprising that she was given the Yakushi Pearl Award for Best Performer in the 2017 Osaka Asian Film Festival.\\" Jam Pascual of The Philippine Stars \\"Young Star\\" column said \\"Bliss is a brainy change of pace ...

Early career  He was born Henriks ≈†tubis in Kreis Hasenpoth in the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Latvia) in a family of Latvian ethnicity.–ö–¢–û –†–£–ö–û–í–û–î–ò–õ –ù–ö–í–î He was arrested twice during 1913, and on the second occasion was convicted of belonging to an anarchist group, and deported to Olonets province in north Russia. He later concealed his anarchist past, claiming to have been a Bolshevik since 1913. After the February Revolution, he moved to Petrograd (St Petersburg), and was responsible for security at the Smolny Institute, the building which the Bolsheviks commandeered for their headquarters. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he led a detachment of sailors who seized control of Petrograd's telephone exchange. In December 1917, a few weeks after the Bolsheviks had seized power, renaming their organisation the All-Russian Communist Party, Zakovsky became one of the founding members of the Cheka. He served in this organisation, under its different names, for the remainder of his career. During the Russian Civil War, he took part in suppressing anti-communist rebellions in Astrakhan, Saratov, Kazan and elsewhere. In February 1926, he was appointed head of the OGPU in Siberia. He was in charge of security during Josif Stalin's visit to Siberia early in 1928, during which the General Secretary ordered grain to be seized by force from producers who were unwilling to sell, a decision which was the precursor to the forced collectivisation of agriculture. In 1928, Zakovsky was given the additional role of head of the 'troika' system, created to administer extrajudicial reprisals against peasants who resisted the change in policy. From November 21, 1929, to January 21, 1930, alone, the troika handled 156 cases, in which 898 people were convicted and, of those, 347 were shot. At the height of collectivisation, in 1930, the troika handed out sentences on 16,553 people, of whom 4,762 (28.8%) were shot - their death signed by Zakovsky - and 8,576 (51.8%) were sent to the labour camps. In 1932, he was appointed head of the OGPU in the Belorussian soviet republic.  Role in the 1930s purges  In December 1934, the Leningrad (St Petersburg) communist party leader Sergei Kirov was assassinated. The police officers deemed responsible for this security lapse were sacked, and Zakovsky was transferred in January 1935 as head of the Leningrad NKVD. In this capacity, alongside Kirov's successor, A.A.Zhdanov, he organized the round-up and mass deportation of the so-called 'Leningrad aristocrats' - 11,702 people who had lived in comparative prosperity before the revolution. The writer Nadezhda Mandelstam later described going with Anna Akhmatova to the station to say goodbye to a woman who was being deported with her three small sons. After this operation, Zakovsky was promoted to the level of Commissar of State Security, First Rank, and awarded the Order of the Red Star (1936). At the plenary session of the Leningrad communist party on March 20, 1937, he declared that there were \\"enemies still active\\" within the organisation, an announcement that marked the onset of a purge of the Leningrad party that was \\"violent even by Soviet standards.\\" Zakovsky was planning a major trial of leading Leningrad communists, including Zhdanov's deputy, Mikhail Chudov (who was executed in 1937), his wife Lyudmila Shaposhnikova, Boris Pozern (shot in 1938), and others. An Old Bolshevik named Rozenblum, who survived the purges, was lined up as a witness, brutally tortured, and then brought before Zakovsky. This case was included in the famous Secret Speech which the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev delivered to the 20th Communist Party congress, in 1956, denouncing crimes committed under Josif Stalin. Khrushchev said: The public trial never took place: the victims were shot after closed trials. In 1937 Zakovsky was awarded the Order of Lenin. Around this time he is said to have boasted that if he had had Karl Marx to interrogate he would make him confess to being an agent of Bismarck. On January 29, 1938, it was announced that Zakovsky had been transferred to Moscow as First Deputy head of the NKVD, second in command to the infamous Nikolai Yezhov. Among his first tasks was to dispose of the head of the NKVD foreign department, Abram Slutsky. Rather than have him arrested, which might have provoked foreign agents to defect, Zakovsky crept up on him while he was talking to fellow officer Mikhail Frinovsky and stupefied him with chloroform, allowing another officer to inject him with poison. Zakovsky also took part in interrogating the former head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda, to get him to confess under torture to being a terrorist, but on April 19, 1938, he was himself arrested and accused of being part of the 'Yagoda conspiracy,' of being a spy, and of organising a Latvian nationalist clique within the NKVD. He and his former deputy, Nikonovich, were both severely tortured. In summer 1938, as Lavrenti Beria was about to take over control of the NKVD, Zakovsky's successor, Mikhail Frinovsky, decided rapidly to get rid of former officers who might incriminate him, including Zakovsky, who was shot on August 29, 1938.

The site was proclaimed a National Historic Site of Japan in 1979.{ Background In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what later was designated Mutsu Province in northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. The Emishi were able to successfully resist the Japanese for several decades; however, in 802 AD, the Chinjufu-sh≈çgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro defeated Emishi chieftain Aterui, and many of the Emishi tribes in the Shiwa District submitted to Japanese rule. In 803 AD, Shiwa Castle, a large fortification with wooden walls, was established in what later became part of the city of Morioka to serve as an administrative center of the imperial government. However, the site was prone to flooding, and in 811 AD, and Shiwa Castle was abandoned in favor of Tokutan Castle approximately ten kilometers to the south. Description Shiwa Castle was a square enclosure, approximately 840 meters on each side, consisting of an earthen rampart surmounted by a wooden palisade, and protected by a dry moat measuring 980 meters on each side. There was a gate at the center of each side facing each of the cardinal directions, with yagura watchtowers were erected at 60 meter intervals. Within was a secondary palisade roughly 150 meters square, containing the 14 buildings making up the administrative compound. The palace compound was connected to the main south gate by a road 18 meters in width. From the size of the foundations of the barracks and workshops, the garrison was between 1200 and 2000 men.Shiwa Castle on jcastle.info Current situation A large scale archaeological investigation was conducted by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education from 1976-1977, in conjunction with the construction of the nearby T≈çhoku Expressway.

The Montana Club is a historic building in Helena, Montana, U.S., completed in 1905 and contains within it a restaurant and bar that were originally part of a private, traditional gentlemen's club established in 1885. History The Montana Club was founded in 1885 by a group of 130 members for \\"literary, mutual improvement & social purposes.\\" Members gathered in various locations until they purchased a triangular-shaped plot of land owned by Samuel Thomas Hauser in 1891 to build a gentlemen's club. The first Montana Club, designed by architects John C. Paulsen and John LaValle, was built in 1891-1893. The building was set on fire in 1903 and all but the first floor was so severely damaged the building was declared a total loss. A new building, built with terracotta, was designed by architects Cass Gilbert and George H. Carsley. It was built on the footprint of the old building, and the first floor structure was salvageable, which explains why the first floor is designed with elaborate stone arches rather than plain terracotta. Its construction cost more than $120,000. Members' Dining Room The fire was set by the 14-year-old son of the bartender, a boy who had started previous fires, and who actually rode to the site with the firefighters, later explaining his motive \\"was to have the horses [that pulled the fire engine] run.\\" The boy was sent to reform school for the offense, but his father kept his job at the club for several more decades. The entryway of the original structure was preserved in the rebuild, and became a subject of some controversy many years later on account of the counter-clockwise swastika designs embedded into mosaic tiles on the floor. The design as installed in the 1893 building was derived from Native American symbolism and intended to represent friendship, good luck or well-being, as opposed to the later meaning given to the clockwise-oriented symbol adopted by the Third Reich. Though the floor was carpeted over for many years and the design beneath largely forgotten, the management of the building ultimately chose to allow the floor to be visible and use it as a tool to teach how the meaning of a symbol could change over time. The modern club opens membership to both men and women.

Ernie was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Cyclone Marcia in 2015, and also the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Cyclone Ita in 2014. Ernie developed from a tropical low into a cyclone south of Indonesia in the northeast Indian Ocean on 6 April 2017, and proceeded to intensify extremely rapidly to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. A few days later, on 10 April, the system was downgraded below cyclone intensity following a period of rapid weakening (though not nearly as rapid as its intensification), located southwest of its original position. Ernie had no known impacts on any land areas. Meteorological history On 5 April 2017, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring a developing tropical low located in the northeast Indian Ocean, approximately 710 km (440 mi) east of Christmas Island. The system had been tracking in a generally westwards direction during the previous few days as a weak area of low pressure, but had not been significant enough to warrant the issuance of tropical cyclone warnings. The tropical low tracked south-westwards throughout the day of 5 April, before adopting a course to the south-southwest during the night. On the morning of 6 April, sustained gale-force winds developed on the western side of the system. Despite the existence of these cyclone-strength winds, the Bureau of Meteorology still classified the storm as a tropical low because they did not extend more than halfway around the system. The storm continued its trend of steady intensification, and was upgraded to a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale by 12:00 UTC on 6 April. The storm was assigned the name Ernie ‚Äì the seventh tropical cyclone and sixth named storm of the 2016-17 Australian region cyclone season. This intensification to Category 1 status marked the beginning of a period of explosive intensification lasting about 24‚Äì30 hours, which concluded with Ernie being upgraded to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone at about 12:00 UTC on 7 April. Upon strengthening to Category 5 intensity, the cyclone had 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), gusting to 285 km/h (180 mph). Aided by favourable environmental conditions, including sea surface temperatures of 29-30 ¬∞C (84-86 ¬∞F), the cyclone maintained its Category 5 intensity for more than 12 hours, while still tracking to the south-southwest. Ernie continued to intensify gradually during this time, peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), gusts to 315 km/h (195 mph), and a central pressure of 922 hPa (27.23 inHg). Its maximum one-minute sustained wind speed of 260 km/h (160 mph) at this time made the storm the equivalent of a lower-end Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Ernie shortly before being named on 6 April Soon afterwards, the system turned to the west-southwest and encountered an unfavorable environment of increased wind shear, dryer air, and cooler sea surface temperatures, which caused Ernie to weaken. The storm was downgraded to Category 3 status by 12:00 UTC on 8 April, about one day after it reached Category 5 intensity. Ernie's decline in strength was paused, though, when the system began to re-intensify a few hours later, on the morning of 9 April, local time. The renewed period of strengthening proved short-lived and meager, however, as Ernie began weakening again on the afternoon of the same day, before it could reattain Category 4 status. The cyclone was downgraded below severe tropical cyclone status to Category 2 intensity by 12:00 UTC on 9 April, and then further to Category 1 intensity by 00:00 UTC on the following day. Ernie weakened below tropical cyclone intensity by 06:00 UTC on 10 April, ending its short but significant 90-hour existence as a cyclone. Gales persisted in the southern quadrants of the system for a number of hours despite its declassification, due to the steep pressure gradient caused by a high pressure ridge to the south. Ex- Tropical Cyclone Ernie continued to track to the west-southwest, and later in a more southerly direction, until the remnants of the system dissipated four days later. Rapid intensification Severe Tropical Cyclone Ernie was a particularly noteworthy cyclone due to its extremely rapid rate of intensification. On the morning of 6 April, when gale-force winds were present on the western side of the developing tropical low, the storm was predicted to remain relatively weak, and reach only a marginal Category 2 intensity by the early hours of 8 April local time. After that time, it was forecast to weaken gradually while tracking to the west-southwest. As time progressed, the system attained Category 2 intensity while located 720 km (445 mi) southeast of Christmas Island, and Ernie's maximum predicted strength was raised to Category 3. Soon, in defiance of even this raised intensity forecast, environmental conditions became near perfect for Ernie to intensify extremely rapidly, and to a high degree. The storm intensified to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone by 06:00 UTC on 7 April, then reached Category 5 status at about 12:00 UTC. From this point on, the cyclone continued to strengthen further, however at a much less frenetic pace. Overall, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ernie intensified from a tropical low to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in just 24‚Äì30 hours. The Bureau of Meteorology labelled this period of explosive intensification as ‚Äòextraordinary‚Äô in the cyclone's severe weather report. Impacts Throughout its existence, Ernie tracked generally southwards as it intensified, and then generally to the west-southwest as it weakened. This track led the system to be located a considerable distance away from all land areas, including well to the northwest of Western Australia, well to the east of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and well to the south of Indonesia. Consequently, Ernie did not cause any known impacts on land in terms of property damage, heavy rain or strong winds and was not retired from the list of names used by the BOM.

A northwest-southeast elongated, roughly long crater or caldera caps off the edifice . It contains a lava dome formed by biotite and hornblende containing dacite . Ignimbrites occur on the foot of the volcano, mostly on the eastern and southwestern side . There appear to be at least two ignimbrites whose composition and age resembles that of Ojos de Maricunga and neighbouring volcanoes . In fact, Ojos de Maricunga may be the source of ash flows . Volcanic rocks include andesite and dacite, with potassium contents in the middle to high range and elemental compositions reflecting volcanic arc petrologies . Exposures in the caldera have a porphyritic texture . Overall content of Ojos de Maricunga rocks is 61-64% and dominant phenocryst phases are plagioclase and additional clinopyroxene, magnetite, orthopyroxene and quartz. The volcano was active 16-15 million years ago . Potassium-argon dating has been performed both on the central lava dome and the andesite lava flows. The former show ages of 15.8 ¬± 0.9 million years ago and the latter 15.1 ¬± 0.7 million years ago . Other ages are 16.2 ¬± 0.6 and 16.1 ¬± 0.8 million years ago for the slope deposits . One ignimbrite was erupted 15.8 million years ago. The Ojos de Maricunga ignimbrites were once considered to be Quaternary and that the \\"San Andes\\" flows dated at 9.15 ¬± 0.15 million years ago originated from Ojos de Maricunga . Presently, the volcano is partially eroded. Santa Rosa volcano has a similar architecture and lies southwest of Ojos de Maricunga. The Salar de Maricunga lies northeast of Ojos de Maricunga. The Laguna Santa Rosa lies southeast of Ojos de Maricunga and the west flowing Quebrada Paipate originates on the volcano's southern slope . The watershed of the Copiapo River borders Ojos de Maricunga to the west . The Cerro Maricunga gold mining project is located on Ojos de Maricunga.

Its core, defining trait is the use of simulated systems that respond to a variety of player actions which, combined with a comparatively broad array of player abilities, allow the game to support varied and creative solutions to problems, as well as emergent gameplay beyond what has been explicitly designed by the developer. This definition is not to be confused with game systems which allow player choice in a confined sense or systems which allow players to easily escape consequences of their choices. Immersive sims by definition allow for multiple approaches, and typically incorporate elements of multiple genres, including role-playing games, stealth, first- person shooters, platform games and survival horror. Although they typically have smaller worlds than open world games, they also generally allow for open- ended gameplay, allowing the player to progress in any order and pursue side missions alongside any main story missions. Immersive sims are generally compared to games developed by Looking Glass Studios. The first such game generally considered an immersive sim is Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, and other examples include Thief and Thief 2, System Shock and System Shock 2, as well as the first Deus Ex. The term \\"immersive sim\\" may also be used to describe the game design philosophy behind the immersive sim genre, which uses interacting, reactive and consistent game systems to create emergent gameplay and a sense of player agency. Concept Immersive sims typically task the player to make their way through levels and complete missions, but do not enforce the means by which the player does this. A common example would be where the player-character must get past a guard. The choice of how to do this would be up to the player: they may attempt to sneak around; use parkour or other similar abilities, aided with some equipment, to slip around them; find small passageways that allow them to get around the guard; create a distraction that draws the guard away from their post; convince or bribe the guard to ignore them; or simply attack and kill or disable the guard directly. The choices may be limited by the player-character's abilities and current inventory, and there may be consequences of the player's choice. For example, killing or disabling the guard could leave the guard's body to be found later, raising the alert level of other guards. However, this element of consequence can be seen as a negative to players if taken throughout the game. For example, Dishonored introduced a \\"chaos\\" system that adjusted how enemy guards would behave due to how much violence and disturbance a player had done earlier in the game, which discouraged players from trying different tactics to avoid making future encounters harder. This system was removed for Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, as well as the addition of optional quests to encourage alternate approaches to missions. Warren Spector, part of Looking Glass Studios, said that immersive sims create the feeling that \\"you are there, nothing stands between you and belief that you're in an alternate world\\". Many of the key developers of immersive sims compare them to tabletop Dungeons & Dragons games hosted by a good gamemaster, or to live action role- playing games, in that there are a set of rule systems to keep it a game, but the game will react to the players' actions rather than force the player to conform to a specific action. Spector is credited with the term \\"immersive sim\\" in a post-mortem he wrote on the development of Deus Ex in 2000, although Spector himself attributes it to his Looking Glass colleague Doug Church instead. Mark Brown of the YouTube series Game Maker's Toolkit identified that a key differentiating feature of immersive sims is that they do not readily use scripted or fixed events. Instead, they use a consistent series of rules and systems throughout the game. These consistent systems then can be exploited by the player to complete objectives in unique and unpredictable ways, with the game reacting to the player's decisions. Brown uses the example of being able to fire rope arrows (to climb on) at any wooden surface in the original Thief: The Dark Project (1998), while the 2014 Thief game limited what locations these could be used, removing the immersive sim elements. Rick Lane of PC Gamer noted that while earlier games in The Elder Scrolls series were not immersive sims, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006) transitioned the series to an immersive sim. The concepts of immersive sims are designed to have the player imagine themselves are part of a consistent world, and games using immersive sim philosophies need not have gameplay systems normally attributed to immersive sims. A notable example is Gone Home, a narrative exploration game that has the player examine the state and objects in a home to piece together a story of events that happened there previously, but has otherwise very few game mechanics. Steve Gaynor of The Fullbright Company which developed Gone Home, compared their approach to Looking Glass Studios' games, stating that \\"It‚Äôs really about this feeling of being in a place and the designers trusting you to progress through it in a meaningful way\\". History Warren Spector considered Ultima VI: The False Prophet (1990) the first game to have an immersive sim mentality as while played from a top-down view, it relied less on events and planned-out puzzles, and instead provided the rulesets and systems through its living world to allow players to craft their own solutions to situations. Spector described one playtesting example from Ultima VI that he considered the genesis of the immersive sim genre, in which a playtester lacked a magical spell needed by his party to pass by a closed gate, and instead used a pet mouse character to sneak through small spaces and access the necessary controls to open the gate, something none of the developers had anticipated. Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss (1992) is considered the first game to demonstrate the necessary elements of an immersive sim according to Spector and others. It built upon Ultima VIs gameplay and added in the first-person perspective, predating Wolfenstein 3D, the game that launched first-person shooters, by a few months. The first- person view helped to cement the impression that the player was part of the game's world that they had full control of, and completing the impression of immersion. Spector recalled that he had thought to himself \\"Do you not realize that the entire world just changed?\\" on seeing the initial demo for Ultima Underworld. Other early examples include System Shock (1994) and its sequel System Shock 2 (1999), Thief: The Dark Project (1998) and its sequel Thief II (2000), Deus Ex (2000), and Arx Fatalis (2002). However, at the same time, more action-oriented games with strong narrative elements that followed from Wolfenstein 3D, like Doom (1993) and Half-Life (1998), drew larger commercial sales, making it difficult to gain publisher interest. Around 2006-2008, several games emerged that revitalized interest in the immersive sim, including The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), BioShock (2007), S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl (2007) and Fallout 3 (2008). Spurred from these successful titles, there have been new titles in the Deus Ex series, including Deus Ex: Human Revolution (2011), as well as a planned System Shock 3 and Underworld Ascendant releases. New properties, including Dishonored (2012) and Prey (2017) were developed acknowledging the design principles of immersive sims. While the immersive sim genre is well-received critically, their sales have been varying. The original Deus Ex sold more than 500,000 units (at the time, a respectable number), but its immediate sequels, Deus Ex: Invisible War, was considered a commercial failure. More recently, while Deus Ex: Human Revolution sold more than 2.1 million copies within a month of its release, its sequel Deus Ex: Mankind Divided had not yet cleared one million in sales a year after its release. Dishonored 2 also did not see similar sales uptake as the original Dishonored. While Jody Macgregor of PC Gamer noted that there are other factors contributing towards lower sales, including other competing games, and changes in a sequel's marketing and approach, they noted that immersive sims require more commitment from the player to invest and learn the game's complex interacting systems in contrast to other types of games built around simpler mechanics, making immersive sims harder to sell. Jordan Thomas, a developer on Thief and the BioShock games, also said that immersive sims very difficult to be built by groups other than large teams due to the complexity of such games, making contributions from indie games unlikely. Arkane's Harvey Smith believed that while these recent sales trends for immersive sims are disappointing, there will always be a market for them, but there will be a need to balance the cost of development to lower sales numbers. Smith attributes the lower sales of more recent games to the general trend of players favoring fast-paced action games with strong multiplayer components, with publishers being wary of games without such elements. Immersive sims by nature tend to be single-player experience requiring thought-out approaches, but Smith believes that the genre will adapt to these player preferences in the future, particularly from indie game development. Lineage Warren Spector is one the key figures that defined the immersive sim genre. A small number of studios and developers have been associated with the immersive sim genre, creating a lineage in its development principally from Looking Glass Studios and its projects. Ultima Underworld was created by Paul Neurath and Doug Church under their studio Blue Sky Productions, which they took to Origin Systems for publication. Warren Spector of Origin, who had worked on Ultima VI, eagerly worked closely with Blue Sky to finalize the game, transitioning Blue Sky into Looking Glass, which created the System Shock and Thief games. Spector later joined Ion Storm and founded its Austin, Texas, studio, where they developed the Deus Ex series. Looking Glass Studios eventually closed down, but developers from it launched their own studios; notably, Ken Levine, who had helped with Thief and System Shock 2, left to form Irrational Games, creating the BioShock series which has been described as a spiritual sequel to the System Shock games. Separately, Rapha√´l Colantonio had been part of the quality assurance team supporting Origin Systems for Electronic Arts (EA) that were publishing games like System Shock in Europe. Colantonio left EA and eventually founded Arkane Studios, desiring to make an immersive sim sequel to the Ultima Underworld series. EA denied them the use of the intellectual property, and instead Arkane produced Arx Fatalis. Later, Colantonio brought on Harvey Smith, a quality assurance tester for Origin for System Shock and one of the lead developers under Ion Storm for Deus Ex. They subsequently designed the Dishonored series as well as building the new Prey atop similar immersive sim fundamentals. More recently, Neurath founded a new studio OtherSide Entertainment, obtaining the rights for an Underworld sequel from EA, and for the System Shock property through Night Dive Studios whom had acquired the rights from EA. Neurath brought on Spector to help create both sequels. In immersive sims that include numeric codes, several of these games use the numerals \\"451\\" or \\"0451\\" as part of the first code that the player encounters. The origin comes from both System Shock games which use it as part of the first door codes seen in the game. While it was believed to be a reference to Fahrenheit 451, but according to Spector, the code 451 had been used on the door for Looking Glass's studios in Cambridge. Since then, its reuse in immersive sims is described as a \\"kind of a signature that developers use to align themselves with Looking Glass\\", according to former Looking Glass developer Tim Stellmach. The name \\"Looking Glass\\" is also played upon by developers of immersive sims to reflect on the importance of Looking Glass Studios to the genre. OtherSide Entertainment took its name as a play on \\"Looking Glass\\". Prey includes the \\"Looking Glass\\" computer system that the player encounters frequently on the station.

A forward, tall and weighing , Smith plays primarily as the full- forward or centre half-forward. After spending five seasons with the in the Victorian Football League, Dave Zennaro convinced him to take the next step in which he garnered team of the year honours and state representation, he was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club in the 2017 rookie draft and made his AFL debut in the 2017 season. Pre-AFL career Playing with the Upper Ferntree Gully Football Club in the Eastern Football League, Smith won a senior premiership with the club at nineteen years of age, he then joined the in the Victorian Football League (VFL) prior to the 2012 season. At the end of the 2015 season, experienced Casey players, Evan Panozza, Mitch Gent and Will Petropoulos left the club, and Smith consequently became the oldest player on the list at twenty-five years of age and the most experienced with fifty-two games. He was named the vice-captain for the 2016 season, and after playing as the key forward for a majority of his career at Casey, he played the 2016 season as a smaller forward due to -listed players Chris Dawes, Liam Hulett and Sam Weideman featuring as the key forwards for the season. His new role saw him kick a career best thirty-one goals for the year and as a result, he became Casey's leading goalkicker and finished sixth overall in the league. After playing nineteen matches for the year, he helped the club secure the minor premiership and his performance in the preliminary final‚Äîwhich garnered a game-high three goals‚Äîsaw the club qualify for the grand final for the first time since 1999. Although Casey headed into the grand final as heavy favourites and he kicked three goals in the match, Casey ultimately lost the grand final to by thirty-one points at Etihad Stadium. His performances during the year led to state honours when he represented Victoria against South Australia and he was named as the centre half-forward in the VFL team of the year. At the conclusion of the season, he was considered a \\"roughie\\" to be recruited in the upcoming AFL draft by Cranbourne Leader journalist, Paul Amy, due to his breakout season in the VFL.

He was predicted by AFL Media reporter, Dinny Navaratnam, as the draftee who would have the greatest impact at Melbourne for the 2017 season. After \\"impressing\\" in VFL pre-season matches, in which Casey-coach, Justin Plapp, said he was playing at an \\"exceptional level\\", he made his AFL debut in the twenty-nine point loss against at Etihad Stadium in round three, in which he kicked his first AFL goal.

He was also a former chairman of the Nigeria National Council of Arts and Council and it was during his tenure, the first festival (NAFEST) was held. An arts patron, he promoted events such as Bonny war canoe regattas. As a rights activist, he believed that Nigerian states should have prominent roles in the control of their economic, political and social policies. Life Biriye was born on September 26, 1920 as Harold Wilcox the son of Rowland and Rebecca Wilcox of Peterside, Bonny. He studied at Bonny Government School then proceeded to King's College, Lagos. After King's College, he worked for less than a year at the Post and Telecommunications and the Public Works Department mostly writing electricity bills but his attitude was not predisposed to civil service. Upon leaving civil service, he engaged in the exportation of commodities such as black pepper, piassava and rattan canes. In 1941, he co-founded Ijo Peoples League, a platform to unite Ijos that were in different divisions of the Eastern region under one province. After the end of World War II, Biriye was involved in politics, he was an early member of NCNC but his experience of the competition between NCNC and AG formed his understanding that ethnic minorities needed better representation as the core base of both parties came from the Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups. He began a campaign for the creation of Rivers States. In 1953, he gained the support of the Action Group for the creation of an independent State but the plan to include Old Calabar and Ogoja provinces as part of a new COR state pushed him away from the group. In response to the need of the 1957 Constitutional Conference to include all shades of opinions, Biriye pressed for the representation of Ijaws among the delegates. He was supported by the Conference of Rivers Chiefs which gave him the mandate to represent the Ijaw region at the conference and also to present their case that the area should be accorded the same status as it was in the 1880s when the Oil Rivers Chiefs of Bonny, Nembe, Brass, Ogoni, Ahoada and Degema signed treaties with the British. Unsuccessful legal presentations were made by Biriye and Udo Udoma that granting independence to Nigeria without adequate protection of the rights of Rivers Provinces as a separate state would be a violation of the treaties. In 1959, he became the chairman of the Bonny County Council. In 1967, changes in the structure of governance led to the creation of Rivers State and in 1969, Biriye was appointed a commissioner. He was commissioner for Agriculture and later redeployed to work in the state's Ministry of Works. Biriye was appointed chairman of the National Council of Arts and Culture by General Yakubu Gowon, the council was involved in the preparation of FESTAC 77. During the Festac, Biriye was the Admiral of the regatta event while in 1956, his father was Admiral of the regatta that welcomed Queen Elizabeth during her visit.

Life Hughes was born in the small village of Cilgeraint, Llandygai, Carnarvonshire; his father was a deacon of the Independent church at Cororion, and district president of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He was educated at a Sunday school. When the Independent church to which his family belonged was closed, he joined the Wesleyans, but subsequently returned to the Independents, and became known in the district as a preacher. Successively, Hughes took charge of churches at Rhos-y-lan, Tabor, and Llanystumdwy, at Jackson Street, Manchester, and at Capelhelyg, Chwilog, and Abererch in Carnarvonshire. At Abererch he set up a printing‚Äìpress, and edited Yr Arweinydd, a penny monthly, for many years. In 1859 he moved to Aberdare, where he took charge of the new church at Bethel, and gathered a large congregation. Hughes died on 8 December 1864. He was Arminian rather than Calvinistic; in church organisation he was a Congregationalist. He lost money on his publications, and a public subscription was raised for him by friends during the last year of his life, though he died before the testimonial was presented. In early life he competed frequently and successfully at eisteddfodau, and later often acted as an adjudicator. Works Hughes was a prolific writer, and contributed largely to magazines.

He died as a result of the explosion aboard the USS Princeton. Biography Beverley Kennon was born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia on April 7, 1793, the son of Richard Kennon and Elizabeth Beverley (Munford) Kennon. His father was a veteran of the American Revolution and a political leader of early Virginia who served terms in both the House of Delegates and the State Senate. Beverley Kennon was educated in Mecklenburg County, and in 1809 was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy. He served in the War of 1812, including a posting to the USS Superior on Lake Ontario. In 1813, he received his commission as a lieutenant (junior grade), and he made the Navy his career. During the Second Barbary War he served on the USS Constellation (as did his brother George, the ship's surgeon), and he was involved in the capture of the Algerian ship Mashouda. Kennon was promoted to master commandant in 1828, and in 1830 he was assigned as commander of the USS Vandalia. He was promoted to captain in 1837; he commanded the USS Macedonian from 1838 to 1841, and the Washington Navy Yard from 1841 to 1843. In March 1843, Kennon was assigned as head of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair, and he served in this position until his death. As a senior Navy captain, Kennon was permitted to use the title commodore, which is how he was frequently addressed. 1844 Peacemaker accident Contemporary Currier & Ives lithograph depicting the explosion Kennon died aboard ship near Fort Washington, Maryland on February 28, 1844. On that date, USS Princeton departed Alexandria, Virginia on a demonstration cruise down the Potomac River. In attendance were President John Tyler, members of his Cabinet, former First Lady Dolley Madison, Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, and approximately four hundred guests. As part of the demonstration, Captain Robert F. Stockton decided to fire the larger of the ship's two new long guns, Peacemaker. The gun was fired three times on the trip downriver and was loaded to fire a salute to George Washington as the ship passed Mount Vernon on the return trip. The guests aboard ship observed the first set of firings and then retired below decks for lunch and refreshments. Afterwards, Thomas Walker Gilmer, the Secretary of the Navy and a lifelong friend of Kennon's, urged the guests to view the final shot of the Peacemaker. When Captain Stockton pulled the firing lanyard, the gun burst. Its left side had failed, spraying hot metal across the deck and shrapnel into the crowd. Instantly killed were: Kennon; Gilmer; the Secretary of State, Abel P. Upshur; Maryland attorney and politician Virgil Maxcy; David Gardiner, a New York lawyer and politician; and the President's valet, a black slave named Armistead. Another sixteen to twenty people were injured, including several members of the ship's crew, Senator Benton, and Captain Stockton. The President was below decks and not injured. The dead were accorded a state funeral in the East Room of the White House. Kennon was first buried at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., and later re-interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. Family Kennon's first wife was Elizabeth Dandridge of Virginia (1808-1832); in 1842 he married Britania Peter (1815-1911) of Tudor Place in Georgetown; she was the daughter of Martha Parke Custis Peter and Thomas Peter. With his first wife, Kennon's children were sons Beverley Kennon Jr. (1830-1890) and William Dandridge Kennon (1832-1872). Beverley Kennon Jr. served as an officer in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War, and later became a mercenary in Egypt. William Kennon was a Confederate soldier in the Civil War, and served in the 4th Virginia Cavalry and Woolfolk's Battery of Alexander's Artillery Battalion. In addition, William D. Kennon served aboard the ship Campbell as a member of the United States Revenue Cutter Service. With his second wife, Beverley Kennon was the father of a daughter, Martha Custis Kennon Peter (1843-1886).

This allows for the ability to develop, assess and improve quality education in a number of contexts. Qualifications frameworks are typically found at the national, regional, and international level.  History  The origin of qualification structures can be traced back to organized education in antique civilizations such as Greece, Sparta, Rome and China. As no specialized career structure existed in these cultures, organized education focused on broad issues of international citizenship, and not on vocational preparedness, which was achieved mainly through informal apprenticeships. As civilizations developed, the role of social class and caste received more emphasis, and people who displayed certain competences were grouped together. The advantage of having participated in and benefited from education gradually became more visible as civilizations developed. In this respect the Chinese civilization was the most organized, with a series of levels attached to examinations, which in turn granted the right of access to public office. During the Middle Ages education had a particularly religious nature, while the late medieval centuries were categorized by a new approach to education alongside the clergy and feudal knighthood. New economic objectives as a result of the Crusades and the development of banking, importing and shipping across Europe and the West gave rise to the development of cities, and a new form of education aimed at professional life. Education became available to the middle classes, and the merchant and craft guild system developed.De Villiers, H. C. 1997. Affirmative action and the qualification structure. Unpublished Master's dissertation, University of Pretoria. The first institutions of formal higher education were established at this time in the Islamic universities of Al-Azhar in Cairo and Sankore in Timbuktu.Serpell, R. 2007. Bridging between orthodox Western higher educational practices and an African sociocultural context. Comparative Education, Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 23‚Äì51. By the eleventh century, universities were developing in Europe, largely in reaction to the previous narrow religious doctrine. The establishment of the University of Bologna marked the beginning of the European university tradition. This was also the time when the term 'qualification' acquired a more definite meaning, although it retained its emphasis on social class structures. The nineteenth century brought with it a wave of liberalism and consciousness of equal rights and opportunities, accompanied by increased specialization and bureaucratization. The increased need for skilled employees eventually resulted in an emphasis on credentials which persists to the present day. During the twentieth century the emphasis shifted to human capital theory and technological development, eventually leading to concerns whether the education system was able to meet the demands of the labour market. At the time it was argued that the strong divisions were creating barriers to learning, and that there was a need to do away with the sharp distinction between academic and vocational systems. During the late 1980s, and strongly influenced by the thinking on integration but also by a focus on vocational training through a competency approach, the notion of a National Qualification Frameworks (NQF) emerged in the United Kingdom. Its roots lay in the competence approach to vocational education which was broadened by Jessup,Jessup, G. 1991. Outcomes: NVQs and the Emerging Model of Education mid Training. New York, RoutledgeFalmer. as well as the Scottish Action Plan which led to the modularization of vocational education and training in Scotland.Scottish Education Department (SED). 1983. 16‚Äì18s in Scotland: An Action Plan. Edinburgh, SED. The idea developed that all qualifications could be expressed in terms of outcomes without prescribing learning pathways or programmes.Young, M. F. D. 2005. National Qualifications Frameworks: Their Feasibility and Effective Implementation in Developing Countries. Geneva, ILO. Within this politically charged melting pot of factors, and a renewed emphasis on the importance of lifelong learning, the first NQFs were established in Australia, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa between 1989 and 1995. France, as a country with a different, notably non-Anglo Saxon tradition, was also a member of this group of first-generation NQFs (Bouder, 2003; Keevy et al., 2011).Bouder, A. 2003. Qualifications in France: towards a national framework? Journal of Education and Work, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 347‚Äì56.Keevy, J., Charraud, A. and Allgoo, K. 2011. National qualifications frameworks developed in Anglo-Saxon and French traditions. Considerations for sustainable development in Africa. Research report for the ADEA Triennial on Education and Training in Africa, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 27 November ‚Äì 2 December 2. In the case of France, the NQF drew on a hierarchy of qualifications that found official expression at the end of 1960s in a nomenclature which tried to rationalize the number of students leaving the education and training system to correspond with the needs of the labour market. Across the first-generation countries, NQFs were conceptualized as hierarchical classifications of levels of formal learning programmes and their associated qualifications and certificates.Coles, M., Keevy, J., Bateman, A. and Keating, J. 2014. Flying blind: policy rationales for national qualifications frameworks and how they tend to evolve. Integral features of NQFs included new quality assurance and standards-setting regimes based on learning outcomes, and importantly for this study, level descriptors which are used to determine the level at which a qualification should be pegged.Tuck, R. 2007. An Introductory Guide to NQFs: Conceptual and Practical Issues for Policy Makers. Geneva, ILO.  Construction  All qualifications frameworks are learning outcomes-based. In qualifications frameworks, qualifications are developed using learning outcomes, and the set of hierarchical levels they consist of are described with a set of learning level descriptors. Qualifications frameworks emerged from two complementary education and training discourses in the late 1980s: the competence approach to vocational education, and the shift to learning outcomes, embedded within the broader concept of lifelong learning. As a result, the interrelationship between competences and learning outcomes was not only firmly embedded in qualifications framework thinking from the very outset, but was also used in a hybridized form.  National level  A national qualifications framework (NQF) addresses the educational quality concerns of specific countries. Some examples include: * Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) * Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) * German Qualifications Framework (Deutscher Qualifikationsrahmen, DQR)  Regional level  A Regional Qualifications Framework (RQF) focuses specifically on qualifications at the regional level. Some examples include: * European Qualifications Framework (EQF) * SADC RQF * CARICOM TVET Qualifications Framework (TVET QF) * ASEAN RQF * Qualifications Framework for the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA) * Pacific Qualifications Register (PQR)  International level/world reference levels  The purpose of the world reference levels lies mainly in their potential to provide a neutral and independent reference point against which a level of learning can be assessed. The idea of a set of world reference levels was considered in May 2012, during the Third International Congress on TVET, held in Shanghai, China. The research included in this report was initiated by UNESCO based on the recommendation from the Congress to the UNESCO Director- General to undertake this work. The UNESCO TVET Section, in cooperation with the European Commission's Directorate General for Education and Culture and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), subsequently invited key organizations in Brussels to deliberate on the Shanghai Consensus RecommendationUNESCO. 2012. Shanghai Consensus: Recommendations of the Third International Congress on Technical and Vocational Education and Training 'Transforming TVET: Building skills for work and life', Shanghai, People's Republic of China, 14 to 16 May. in September 2013. The deliberations included regional developments in Europe, notably the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and in Asia, notably a common standard for competences developed by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as the move towards regional qualifications frameworks (RQFs) in Central America and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). At the national level, the development of national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) was considered across and beyond these regions, including Mercosur (Mercado Com√∫n del Sur, the Common Market of the South) in South America and the development of a transnational qualifications framework (TQF) by twenty- nine small states of the Commonwealth.COL and SAQA. 2008. Transnational Qualifications Framework for the Virtual University of Small States of the Commonwealth. Concept Document. Pretoria: Commonwealth of Learning and South African Qualifications Authority. The additional dimension of learning metrics as used in longitudinal studies, international competence assessments and diagnostics reviews was also considered. The Brussels deliberations concluded that the mobility of people (both learners and workers, including migrant workers) and jobs (including outsourcing and offshoring) constitutes an important driver for the world reference levelsChakroun. 2013. Outcomes of the workshop, Engaging global conversations on recognition of TVET quali cations based on learning outcomes, 25‚Äì27 September 2013, Brussels, unpublished report. emanating from the Shanghai Consensus Recommendation. It was noted that jobs are not always matched to demands during these movements, because of demographic shifts and the differential capacities of economies to create jobs. The cross-border provision of education and training, as well as the technological developments resulting in increased open and distance learning, and online learning, were also identified as important drivers towards world reference levels. Another important driver identified in the Brussels deliberations was the need for international dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building in the field of the recognition of qualifications.  Other types of frameworks  = Sectoral qualifications frameworks = Sectoral qualifications frameworks are developed within a specific country and with a specific sectoral focus. Examples include: * a TVET framework in Jamaica * the occupational qualifications subframework in South Africa * the General Education Qualifications Framework in Poland * the Engineering Sectoral Framework in Armenia = Transnational qualifications frameworks = Transnational qualifications frameworks are developed across a range of countries. Where these countries are in the same geographical proximity they are referred to as regional qualifications frameworks (examples include the SADC RQF and the EQF). Transnational qualifications frameworks can also be developed across countries that are not in the same geographic proximity. = For online learning =  The E-xcellence framework  The E-xcellence framework was developed by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU). It is an instrument for benchmarking the quality of online, open and flexible education at programme, faculty and institutional levels. The framework defines requirements (called \\"benchmarks\\") for the entire process, from curriculum design to delivery, including the management and support of online and blended learning.  The OpenupEd quality label  The OpenupEd quality label is derived from the E-xcellence framework. Ossiannilsson and colleaguesOssiannilsson, E., Williams, K., Camilleri, A., & Brown, M. (2015). Quality models in online and open education around the globe: State of the art and recommendations. Oslo, Norway: International Council for Open and Distance Education. identified this framework as useful for certification and benchmarking. The label describes a self-assessment and review Quality Assurance (QA) process for the MOOCs (Massive open online courses) in the European OpenupEd partnership,http://www.openuped.eu but the OpenupEd framework can be used for the QA of any MOOC. The benchmarks statements in this label, derived from benchmarks produced by the E-xcellence framework, are divided into two groups: those that apply at the institutional level and those for individual courses (MOOCs).  Learning level descriptors  Learning level descriptors are essential elements in Qualifications Frameworks. Learning Level descriptors are statements that provide a broad indication of learning appropriate to attainment at a particular level, describing the characteristics and context of learning expected at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.Vlasceanu, L., Gr√ºnberg, L. and P√¢rlea, D. 2007.

(eds). 2010. A Tuning Guide to Formulating Degree Programme Profiles Including Programme Competences and Programme Learning Outcomes. Bilbao, Groningen and The Hague. Manabile, E. 2007. Summary of the revised Bloom's taxonomy. Unpublished. Learning outcomes can be used to describe many things, including knowledge, skills and competences (KSC), in the context of qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are increasingly being used in global context 'as a dynamic tool for modernisation and reform'.CEDEFOP. 2009. The Shift to Learning Outcomes. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP. The key mechanism through which the learning outcomes approach is being implemented is qualifications frameworks, but there are also others, such as within curriculum reform on both national and international levels. The Tuning Project, which started in 2000, stands out as a good example of the introduction of learning outcomes outside of, but nonetheless related to, qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are used in the formulation of qualifications, and also in the formulation of level descriptors. Definitions of the concept of learning outcomes vary across contexts, although some common elements can be identified. Here are several definitions. Learning outcomes... * Describe what students will know and be able to do upon successful completion of a course or programme.University of Adelaide. 2014.

From a review of the interpretation of learning outcomes it is evident that learning outcomes are understood to be statements that describe mainly three major domains: knowledge (learning to know), skills (learning to do) and competences (learning to be).UNESCO. 1996. Learning: The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century. Paris, UNESCO. = Competences = The interrelationship between learning outcomes and competences is best illustrated in qualifications frameworks. While learning outcomes often describe competences, competences can also be stand alone. Competences represent a dynamic combination of cognitive and meta-cognitive skills, demonstration of knowledge and understanding, interpersonal, intellectual and practical skills, and ethical values.

The engagements proceeded from an attack by the Union Navy on a battery on John Berkeley Grimball's plantation on Edisto Island. After successfully destroying the battery, the ship was attacked twice by Confederate artillery forces before returning to its station. The attack was a part of Union efforts to secure Edisto Island, which housed a large colony of escaped African Americans and served as a launching point of a campaign against Charleston. Background 1862 U.S. Coast Survey map of the Coast of South Carolina from Charleston to Hilton Head cropped to show Edisto Island, White Point, the Dawhoo River, and Willstown Edisto Island was largely abandoned by planters in November 1861 and in December 1861, escaped slaves began setting up their own refugee camps there. In January 1862, armed blacks from the island and Confederate forces clashed and a Confederate raid in reprisal killed a small number of unarmed blacks. In February, Union forces were stationed on the island to develop it as a staging area for future campaigns against Charleston, twenty-five miles away, as well as to protect the colony, which would eventually number thousands of blacks. As Union forces took control of the island, a number of skirmishes occurred, and Confederates withdrew. Pineberry Battery was further up the Edisto River from the island, which was one likely path for a land campaign against Charleston.Tomblin 2009, p65-73 Among the actions, on March 18, Pineberry Battery opened fire on a Union Naval reconnaissance.Silverman et al. 2002, p98 The Pineberry Battery was on the Pineberry plantation on Edisto Island owned by John Berkeley Grimball.Williamson 1965, p138-139 Battle The steamers E.B. Hale and Stars & Stripes fitting out at the New York Navy Yard during the summer of 1861 On April 29, a union expeditionary force in the gunboat USS E. B. Hale and with twenty-two men from the USS Crusader along with a flatboat and howitzer also from the Crusader travelled up the North Edisto River to the Dawhoo River to attack a confederate Battery on the Pineberry plantation.Report of the Secretary of the Navy 1863, p219-221 The attack was led by Lieutenant Alexander C. Rhind, who was anxious to show his mettle to Flag Officer Samuel F. Du Pont. The Hale was a freighter which had been converted to a gunboat and mounted four 32-pounder smoothbore cannon and was commanded by Lieutenant James H. Gillis. The ship arrived near the Confederate battery of two 24-pounder guns in the late afternoon and exchanged artillery fire.Tucker 2013, p2123 Commander Du Pont reported that the Confederates continued fire from their field guns while the Hale traveled down the windy river, but fled when the ship came close.Moore 1864, p99 Rhind sent Gillis ashore with 22 men who spiked the guns, burned and destroyed the carriages, and captured the powder. The engagement lasted about four hours.Silverman et al. 2002, p101 Evans had received intelligence of the attack and led a detachment of six guns of the Washington Artillery under Captain Walter to the place. Two guns attempted to relieve the force at Pineberry but were too late. The remaining four guns set an ambush at a place called White Point.\\"News from the Coast\\", Wilmington Journal (Wilmington, North Carolina), May 8, 1862, page 4, accessed April 10, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10188076/news_from_the_coast_wilmington_journal/ Two companies of infantry accompanied the guns at White Point.The War of the Rebellion, p13 The Union forces continued on up the Pow Pow or South Edisto River to make an attack on a schooner in that direction, but Evans met them with two pieces of field artillery near Willstown. Union forces then returned to their gunboat and continued back down the Dawhoo River. The ship was ambushed by the four artillery guns and by small arms at White Point near Slann's Bluff. Rhind stated that he had prepared for this eventuality and returned fire with shell, grape, and canister. The engagement continued there for nearly an hour. Commander Du Pont reported that the Hale returned without a man injured, although one of the Hale's 32-pounder guns was damaged. Confederates also reported no losses.The Union Army: Cyclopedia of Battles, 1908, p691 The officers and men of both Union ships earned a commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for their courageous conduct. Aftermath On June 2, Horatio Wright's division embarked from Edisto Island on Hunter's planned campaign which would lead to the Battle of Secessionville on June 16.Symonds 2010, p77 In the summer of 1862, Union troops protecting coastal colonies began to withdraw to reinforce Union General George B. McClellan who was engaged in the Peninsula Campaign, a series of battle between March and July. Having lost at Secessionville, Hunter withdrew the rest of garrison on Edisto Island on July 11, and the African American colony was moved to St. Helena villageTomblin 2009, p85-86 Pineberry Battery was a battery on the prominent John Berkeley Grimball plantation which was heavily effected by the war and well documented in Grimball's diary.Trinkley and Fick 2000, p38 Early in the war, by June 1861, seventy slaves on the plantation had fled,Melton 2012, p122 and by May 1864, Grimball claimed that damage on the plantation had approached $20,000.Woodward 2014, p132 Grimball returned to the plantation in 1866, but was unable to pay mortgage payments on half of the plantation.Linder 1995, p212-213 References Sources *Linder, Suzanne Cameron.

Disparities in accessing and quality of mental health care  There is a growing unmet need for mental health services and equity in the quality of these services. While these services often advertise themselves as being a support system and caregiver for any and all who need treatment or support, oftentimes certain aspects of an individual's life, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, will determine the access and quality of care that they are given. Due to a growing level of socioeconomic inequality among races, African Americans are less likely to have access to mental health care and are more likely to have lesser quality care when they do find it. African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to be uninsured or have Medicaid, limiting the amount and type of access that they have mental health outpatient sources. In one study, of all those who received mental health care, minority populations reported a higher degree of unmet needs and dissatisfaction with the services they were given (12.5% of whites, 25.4% of African Americans, and 22.6% of Hispanics reported poor care). In addition, mental illnesses are often under and over diagnosed among different minority groups for various reasons. For example, schizophrenia is often over diagnosed in African Americans, whereas mood disorders, depression, and anxiety are under diagnosed. This serves as an example of how minority groups in the United States, such as African Americans, are at risk of being diagnosed based on stereotype and not properly assessed or treated for other mental health conditions that they may or may not be at risk for. The LGBTQ population, while still open to the same disparities as racial minority groups, is often confronted with the problem of being denied mental health treatment because of the gender they identify as or their sexual orientation. In a study conducted by The National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 19% of the LGBTQ sample reported being denied the healthcare they needed. In addition, 28% of the sample reported being harassed or even physically assaulted during the health visit. While denial of treatment and harassment during treatment are large causes of the disparities among mental health care quality, the lack of knowledge is also of concern among the LGBTQ population. As it is such a newly developing field of study, there is very little knowledge or research conducted that relate specifically to LGBTQ health and healthcare. Because of this, about 50% of the LGBTQ population report having to teach aspects of their health and treatment to the health care providers. = Socioeconomic status disparities = Lack of socioeconomic resources can lead to development of traumatic experiences that precipitate into mental health disorders. For example, not having employment or having limited access to resources can influence the course of developing some of the most common mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and psychological stress. Living with a mental health disorder can also contribute to disparities in receiving mental health care. Living with a mental health disorder could affect an individual's economic status, which can additionally lead into their mental health quality as well as life expectancy. Another socioeconomic factor that can lead to barriers and inequalities in accessing mental health care services include financial restraints. There has been a rise in cost for uninsured individuals in accessing mental health care services compared to individuals who have private or public insurance. = Education disparities = Educational disparities can be defined as unjust or unfair differences in educational outcomes that can be a result of difference in treatment of certain minority groups in schools, varying socioeconomic statuses, and varying educational needs. These disparities in education can ultimately lead to issues of mental health. When this happens, less privileged groups get looped into the cascading effects of inequality. Disparities in education, contributory to socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and ethnic/racial status can be another contributing factor to mental health inequality. Socioeconomic status plays a large role in the difference in access to educational resources. School districts are split geographically. Because the current funding for public schools comes from local property taxes, there is more incentive for high-status individuals to narrow the boundaries to not include lower income families from their school districts. Because each school district is then only encompassing one socioeconomic group, the programs and quality are affected. This is where we begin to see the dramatic differences between school districts. While some schools offer amazing guidance departments, advanced classes, and phenomenal facilities, other areas struggle to find qualified and motivated teachers to teach basic classes. Although public education is something that is supposed to be a right for all, an individual's socioeconomic status can greatly affect the quality of that education. An individual's immigration status also affects the quality of education received. While there are some immigrant groups which do well after immigrating to the United States, many do not have the same level of success. There are many barriers that prevent the academic success of immigrant children. These barriers include but are not limited to the fact that most parents of immigrant children do not understand the United States educational system, inadequate English as a Second Language programs, and segregation. There are also differences in outcomes across immigrant generation, with first-generation immigrants performing better than subsequent generations. This is termed the immigrant paradox. These issues along with the psychological effects of acculturation (e.g., adapting to a whole new country, language, and culture) amplify educational inequality. Disparities in education are the insufficiency of resources that are included but limited. These disparities usually targets socially excluded communities with low income. Statistics are used when measuring grades, GPA, test scores, and dropout rates to determine the success of students. By creating a system in which a person could never succeed can perpetuate inequalities, especially those suffering from mental health. = Spatial disparities (geographic location) = Spatial disparities include, but are not limited to, where one lives, spends most of their time, where they receive most of their resources, and where they receive education. For example, minority races who live in higher poverty neighborhoods are at higher risk for additional stresses and mental health disorders. Yet this population has been shown to experience more difficulties in accessing mental health services. Considering this cycle of needing care but not being able to receive care, inequality due to spatial location will likely remain and continue to limit access to mental health care without additional intervention to increase access to mental health services. Many minorities including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans inhabit these poverty filled neighborhoods due to factors being not in their favor in certain aspects of society. These neighborhoods lack resources such as offices with psychiatrists or health clinics with good doctors who are trained to help those in need of mental health care. It would also be beneficial to make specific services just for those in high-poverty neighborhoods who lack the resources so we can encourage those in need to get the help that they deserve. With adjustments made to meet these circumstances, the spatial disparities can be lowered and allow those who need the help to get it. = Ethnic and racial disparities = There is inequality in mental health care access for different races and ethnicities. Studies have shown that minorities with low-income have less access to mental health care than low-income non-Latino whites. In addition to lack of access, minorities in the United States were more likely to receive poorer quality in mental health care and treatment compared to non-Latino whites individuals, leading to many minorities delaying or failing treatment. Studies have shown the African Americans have decrease access to mental health services and mental health care compared non-Latino white Americans. Many minorities have difficulty in finding care for mental health services. After surveying individuals of different races, a study has shown that African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans gain less access to the same type of mental services that non- minority whites get access to. A possible reason that the author stated: \\"This theory postulates that Whites have a greater propensity to avoid living in poverty communities because they are more likely to enjoy social and economic advantages. Only seriously mentally ill Whites suffer from steep downward mobility and come to reside in high-poverty neighborhoods\\" (Julian Chun-Chung Chow, Kim Jaffee, and Lonnie Snowden). This has been a problem for minority races that need the same services. It is an issue because African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans need the services more in certain areas due to how biologically certain minority races are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than whites. Race is often difficult to acknowledge in mental health. Even when access to mental health therapies exists for minorities, oftentimes both the therapist and the patient can be reluctant to factor their own racial positioning into treatment or find it difficult to believe that some of their mental health stress is due to race. Both often favor explanations rooted in past experiences like family life, personal setbacks, and other potential barriers. = LGBTQ disparities and predictors = Sexuality plays a large role in the prediction of mental illnesses and overall mental health. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer have a higher risk of having mental health issues, most likely as a result of the continued discrimination and victimization they receive at the hands of others. Members of this population are confronted with derogatory and hateful comments, whether through face-to-face communication or through social media, which affects their self-worth and confidence, leading to anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide. These mental health effects are most commonly seen among adolescents, however, they are also prevalent among adults of all ages. The sources of discrimination and victimization that the LGBTQ population suffers from can be both external and internal. While parts of society today are not accepting of the LGBTQ community and make public statements to advertise their discontent, an identifying LGBTQ can also have low confidence and a lack of self-worth that furthers these negative mental health effects. The most notable predictor of mental health illnesses among the LGBTQ population is family acceptance. Those of the LGBTQ population who receive little or no family support and acceptance are three times more likely to have thoughts of suicide than those who do have a strong family support system behind them. Oftentimes, the lack of familial support is more conducive of detrimental behaviors, such as drug and illegal substance abuse, which can cause further harm to the individual. Multiple aspects of lifestyles, including religion, can affect family support. Those who have strong family ties to religion may be less likely to seek support and help from family members due to fear of a lack of acceptance within the family, as well as within the religious community. = Sex and gender disparities and predictors = While gender differences among those with mental health disorders are an underdeveloped field of study, there are gender specific aspects to life that cause disparities. Gender is often a determinant of the amount of power one has over factors in their life, such as socioeconomic status and social position, and the stressors that go along with these factors. The location of genders and sex within the social construct can be a great determinant of risks and predictors of mental health disorders. These disparities in gender can correlate to the disparities in the types of mental health disorders that individuals have. While all genders and sexes are at risk of a large variety of mental health illnesses, some illnesses and disorders are more common among one sex than another. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with forms of depression as depressive disorders account for close to 41.9% of the disability from neuropsychiatric disorders among women compared to 29.3% among men. On the other hand, men are three times more likely to be given a diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder than women. Sex can also be a determinant of other aspects of mental health as well. The time of onset of symptoms can be different dependent on one's sex. Women are more likely to show signs of mental illnesses, such as depression, earlier and at a younger age than men. Many believe this to be a correlation with the onset time of puberty. As a result of social stigmas and stereotypes within society, women are also more likely to be prescribed mood-altering medications, whereas men are more likely to be prescribed medications for addictions. Further research on the mental health disparities among sex and gender is needed in order to gain a deeper knowledge of the predictors of mental health and the possible differences in treatments.  Current initiatives in achieving mental health equality  Because mental health inequality is largely due to disparities in health insurance, ways to improve mental health equity must come from changes in healthcare policies. Much of mental health disparity comes from a lack of access to healthcare in low socioeconomic communities and, often, underprivileged minorities. This lack of access can arise from geographic isolation, poor funding and incentive for health care providers, inefficient health care coverage or highly stigmatized and discriminatory community attitudes surrounding mental health. Also, changing the content of healthcare literature and education to include mental health is equally important. The United States has made strides to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health, but the rate of such stigma is currently still on the rise. Potentially linked to such high stigma and miseducation, mental health is also still not considered to be a significant part of basic health care plans. In order for individuals to receive the treatment necessary for mental illness, it must be first acknowledged as a real, treatable illness. In May 2013, the World Health Assembly adopted a new action plan to address mental health over the following 8 years. This plan is called the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020. This plan is an indicator of the global importance of mental health and includes goals for global mental health improvement. This plan also addresses mental health inequalities by acknowledging the need for greater access in low and middle- income countries.

Technical details about the application under test, test case logic, and test data are saved separately and joined together at test execution time. When an element in the application under test changes, the technical details are updated once in the central model. Since the test cases inherit from this model, the various test cases that test the updated element do not need to be modified manually to reflect the change. Risk-based testing Based on a risk assessment of the application under test‚Äôs requirements, Tricentis Tosca uses risk-based test design to suggest the most effective test cases and identify the risk contribution of each test cases. It also uses a variety of methodologies (such as equivalence partitioning, boundary testing, and combinatorial methods such as linear expansion) to try to minimize the number of test cases while increasing risk coverage.

The episode was written by Steven Yockey and directed by John Badham. It was first broadcast on November 17, 2016, on The CW. In the episode, Sam, Dean, Mary and Sheriff Mills go a hunter's wake when he dies but find another hunter is murdered. They soon find that they are dealing with a demon wanting revenge on the hunter after an exorcism decades ago. The episode received positive reviews, with critics praising the plot. Plot In 1980, Emerson, Manitoba, a young boy named Asa Fox is saved from a werewolf by Mary (Samantha Smith) and inspired by the meeting, he becomes a legendary hunter after he grows up, before being killed in 2016. Learning of Asa's death, many hunters go to his wake, including Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles), Mary, and Sheriff Jody Mills (Kim Rhodes), who had been in a relationship with Asa. Things are awkward between the Winchesters before one of the hunters is found murdered. They soon realize that they are dealing with * Jael, a demon who has had a grudge against Asa since Asa exorcised him in 1997. Jael locks Dean out of the house and everyone else in, but Dean is able to get in with help from the reaper Billie (Lisa Berry) in exchange for owing her one. Jael kills another hunter before possessing Jody and revealing that he did not kill Asa as believed; rather, Asa was accidentally killed by his best friend Bucky while hunting Jael, and Bucky framed Jael to protect himself. While Jael is distracted with Bucky, the hunters manage to exorcise him from Jody. They promise to spread the true story of Asa's death, disgracing Bucky. The next morning, the three dead hunters are burned while Billie arrives to try and collect on her deal with Dean by reaping Mary, who she claims will never feel like she belongs in the world after her resurrection. Mary refuses and though she decides not to return to the Bunker yet, she agrees to go out for breakfast with her children. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.80 million viewers with a 0.7/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 5% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.70 million viewers with a 0.6/2 in the 18-49 demographics.

For what was basically a filler episode (I say that because of no progression on the Lucifer story arc) this was a damn good story.\\" Samantha Highfill from EW gave the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote, \\"At this point in time, Mary might not quite be ready to return to the bunker, but she does agree to have breakfast with her boys.

Alongside his royal suzerain, Bagrat III of Imereti, Rostom fought against the expanding Ottoman Empire to which he lost parts of his principality. Rostom's relations with Bagrat III subsequently deteriorated over his support to the king's defiant vassal, Levan I Dadiani.  Accession  Rostom was a son of Mamia I Gurieli by his wife Ketevan. In 1533, Mamia was taken captive during his disastrous expedition against the Circassians in which Rostom's brother Giorgi was killed. Rostom had to ransom his father, on whose death he succeeded as Prince of Guria a year later. By that time, Guria, a principality on Georgia's southwestern Black Sea coast, had been menaced by the resurgent Ottoman Empire, then being in war with Safavid Persia over hegemony in the Caucasus. Rostom stood by the side of his official royal suzerain, King Bagrat III of Imereti, in his struggle against the Ottoman encroachment.  Ottoman wars  In 1535, Rostom joined forces with Bagrat in an invasion of the Principality of Samtskhe, ruled by the pro- Ottoman atabag Qvarqvare III Jaqeli. At the battle of Murjakheti, the atabag was defeated, captured by Gurieli's cup-bearer Isak Artumeladze, and eventually delivered to Bagrat. Qvarqvare died in prison, while Rostom was awarded his share of Samtskhe: Adjara and Chaneti, long sought after by the Gurieli dynasty. The Ottomans retaliated with a major invasion: Bagrat and Rostom were victorious at Karagak in 1543, but decisively defeated, in 1545, at Sokhoista, where Rostom's son Kaikhosro was killed. In 1547, the Ottoman military imposed a blockade of Guria's coastline and occupied the maritime settlements of Gonio and Batumi. Rostom appealed for help to Bagrat of Imereti and Levan I Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. However, the king of Imereti, indignant at Rostom's earlier decline of a combined attack on Mingrelia, disrupted the nascent Dadiani‚ÄìGurieli accord. Left to his own devices, Rostom attacked, pushed the Ottoman forces beyond the Chorokhi and forced them to evacuate Batumi, but he failed to prevent the loss of Adjara and Chaneti; the Gonio fortress became an important Ottoman outpost in southwestern Georgia. Rostom died in 1564 and was buried at the Shemokmedi Monastery. He was succeeded by his son, Giorgi II Gurieli.  Family  Rostom Gurieli was married twice, first to Princess Tinatin (fl. 1534), a member of the Imeretian royal family, and secondly, to Princess Tamar (fl. 1562). He fathered three sons and two daughters: * Prince Kaikhosro (died 1545), killed in the battle of Sokhoista with the Ottoman army; * Prince Giorgi II (died 1600), Prince- regnant of Guria (1566‚Äì1583, 1587‚Äì1600); * Princess Rodam, the first wife of Giorgi III Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia (divorced in 1564); * Princess N., wife of Mamia IV Dadiani; * Possibly, Prince Vakhtang I (died 1587), Prince- regnant of Guria (1583‚Äì1587).

He is considered one of the most influent contemporary painters in the province's capital (Capitale-NationaleBernier 2002, p. 218‚Äì219). In 2008, he was immortalized as one of the most notorious figures of Quebec's contemporary art by Robert Lepage during the celebrations for the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City. In his animated film Le Moulin √† images, Robert Lepage projected images of artworks by Jean Gaudreau next to works from Jean- Paul Lemieux, Martin Bureau, Jean-Paul Riopelle et Alfred Pellan, among others, on grain silos located in Anse au Foulon, in Quebec City's old port.  Biography  Gaudreau was born in Quebec City on May 27, 1964. When he's 10 years old, his mother, Claudia Tremblay, a plastic art teacher, musician and painter, entrust her son to Sister Alice Pruneaunamed the \\"nun-artist\\" unique in the History of art in Quebec and maybe even in Canada, Sister Alice Pruneau (Sister Sainte-Alice-de-Blois), follows the teachings of Jean Paul Lemieux at l'√âcole des beaux-arts de Qu√©bec (School for Fine Arts) between 1940 and 1945. The paintings she created until the end of the 1960s, her \\"Modern Arts \\" period, are the witness of her natural virtuosity. Sister Alice uses art as a language and cannot help but draw. Her artworks are spiritual exercises, eloquent witnesses of her intellectual and spiritual approach. Am√©lie Leclerc, Responsable du patrimoine, Maison g√©n√©ralice to teach him the basics of drawing, at the S√©minaire des P√®res Maristes\\"S√©minaire des P√®res Maristes\\" in Quebec City. As a child, he learns the \\"old fashion way'‚Äô the Mezzotint as well as the importance of geometry in drawing. Indeed, Pruneau teaches him the rules of perspective, the vanishing points as well as the Golden Triangle. The painter's mother also played a dominant role in the apprenticeship of her son's plastic practices. She herself would become multidisciplinary artist Jean Palardy's student. = Between Tradition and Modernity (1974‚Äì1985) = When he is 12 years old, Jean paints genre art scenes in Quebec's old port.Jean Gaudreau, interview with Micha√´l Lachance, 2016 He thus sketches his first subjects : the stevedores, the boats, the docks, the river and in the background, the buildings perched on Quebec City's headland, the cap Diamant. He outlines, in the manner of the countryside landscape painters, the contours of the old buildings. The Ch√¢teau Frontenac, the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, Price Building, are some favourite subjects of the passionate teenager, and as such, premonitory subjects. For instance, this painting view of the Bassin Louise Les remorqueurs (The stevedores) precedes by some thirty years playwright and filmmaker Robert Lepage's Le Moulin √† images. In 2008, the Jean Gaudreau's artworks are to be projected on some huge grain silos at the Anse au Foulon among those of other great painters in the history of Quebec City. = Isle-aux-Coudres = Until 1985, the paintings or rural landscapes in Charlevoix are a curiosity for denizens and tourists of L'Isle-aux-Coudres. The summers of the artist's youth, are spent painting landscapes, up to one to two hundred a year. His paintings are sold outside a famous hotel of the island. \\"Jean Gaudreau paints using oil, acrylic and oil pastels which he masters and harmonizes with both fervour and subtlety.\\" It is a significant period for the teenager, who regularly visits the artist painter Jean Paul Lemieux. The older man is always ready to underline to young Jean Gaudreau the importance of the drawings in the practice of painting. \\"At 17 years old, Jean Gaudreau presents his first solo exhibition in an art gallery, and he has since been seen regularly in solo or group exhibitions. Hundreds of his paintings were acquired by private or public collections, and several mural painting experiments will give way to more important commissions.\\"  The Artist's Approach  Painter, sculptor and engraver, the Quebec City's artist explores several technical means and approaches them not separately like so many individuated vehicles of expression, but rather like a gathering of manners, a single whole body baring the advantage of maximizing a frenzied expression, and all-consuming passion. Jean Gaudreau morphs into an acrobat at our own expenses to create flaming visual orgies. The artist borrows his iconography from the circus's syntax, the grammatical codes of dance and the plastic arts' vocabulary. \\"Chance encounters and the very spirit of his artistic production have led Gaudreau to associate, for many years, dance and performance art to his painting. Both by the themes he tackles and in the conception of the many events he put together, the body has become a central element of his work. In his compositions, the artist plays with elaborate staging, where characters borrowed from the circus and the dance world, sometimes moving other times remaining still, blend into various forms to create an open and animated space. Colour, thus far confined to a supporting role, becomes in this series, an essential foundation of the ensemble, without, however, falling into a purely decorative dimension. A particularly effective accomplice, it acts as a trigger.\\" The use of the epithet multidisciplinary to introduce this creator, merges with the appropriate cross-disciplinary one. Jean Gaudreau sculpts the raw matter in a diligent manner, a rigour born of a vast workshop experience, bending his back, kneading the surfaces and twisting the supports. This all- crazy labour demonstrates his mastering of colour combinations, impressionist gesture and, above all, his careful attention towards the planarity of the canvas. The artist cannot stand the lightness of emptiness, or the mundane of everyday life. The large canvases shown in 2003 in the Cirque du Soleil's headquarters bear witness to this; loaded surfaces, busy, choked, bruised and nervously piled. \\"Through M-515, Jean Gaudreau has etched the profile of a chalky face marred by the end of the day glowing tears on the crimson hue of a quivering sea. A long line stretched between two moribund abandoned in a vacuum, toggles this head in the nocturnal strangeness of the world.Normand Biron, President Emeritus of the International Association of Art Critics.\\" The thick strokes of blue, red or yellow are childhood memories, landscape from within, pieces of history, in short, Quebec City-specific colours. \\"If, like says artist Leng Hong, \\"painting the body's landscapes or painting the skin of dreams is always sketching our interior landscape,\\" then Gaudreau's interior landscape is rather fascinating. The elements of his work, parts taken from the universal subconscious, assemble deftly on the canvas like a puzzle.\\" He constantly revisits, almost with obstinacy, this welcoming and volcanic maelstrom, by stacking up material layers, painting gestures, delicate sketches, violent strokes, controlled soft hedges, visual oxymorons characterized by fine droplets or by harsh movements, articulated by a swift arm throwing moods, odours and mental landscapes on the canvas. \\"He is without a doubt, a singular figure of the Quebec visual arts world. Firstly, because he has a lot of grits and boldness. Also and especially because he earns a living with his painting, which is in itself quite exceptional. He has surrounded himself with patrons, collectors and art enthusiasts. His artwork travels to Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and New York galleries. He earns a living with his art, but let us be clear. He has chosen this frugal and precarious way of life like so many other creators. Jean Gaudreau defines his painting as intuitive. His approach favours emotion, subjectivity, even the expression of the 'unconscious.' He is also inspired by dance and movement; his painting is therefore very gestural.\\" In the stubborn, fallible and lyrical painter's vivacious historiography, the will power, elation of the artist, this uncompromising mistress is the all mighty goddess. The young painter inspired by Riopelle or Lemieux, whom he frequented from the first hour, worships more than he dares pretend. A universe inhabited by dance, theatre, painting, history, sculpture and performance, feeds the creations and he drinks it up tirelessly, as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Indeed, Jean Gaudreau takes advantage of fragments of love, as so many imprints of the past infringing on the present. He leaves traces in his artwork as fragmented sediments, mandatory rites of passage rituals for him, seeking endlessly to reinvent himself, like a stubborn and unfailing Sisyphus. \\"The brush strokes recall Riopelle, Pollock, Stella, Klimt and Ferron ; some traces evoke the Automatists and the flights dear to the lyrical abstracts. Admittedly, the artist avails himself of a postmodernism that tends to integrate all streams as bare witnesses the presence of figurative and non- figurative elements, women with lascivious faces, sinuous lines and the juxtaposition of vibrant hues and gilding. The predominant gestural as well as the intentionally less than finished and more primary aspect of his painting constitute trials at forging a personal style.\\"  Second life  Jean Gaudreau started his exploration of copper with the help of remains of the South turret of the Ch√¢teau Frontenac. After mastering the transformation technic of these pieces, that artist embedded them in his paintings thus giving them a second life. \\"By using a material out of the past‚Äîthe copper‚Äîtransforming it into a contemporary character, the artist explores what could be described as the point of metamorphosis of the medium, trying to answer questions such as 'What happens when these remains begin a new life?' ‚ÄòWhat happens when the past and the present become one and the same?' Asked about his choice of the iconography of the heart as subjects in his recent creation, Jean Gaudreau states : 'I have chosen the shape of the heart, timeless symbol of love, to express this transition between past and present. Past and presents are the two beats of a same heart.'\\"  Video Documents  * Belco, J : Jean Gaudreau ‚Äì Environnement de cr√©ation, 2010 * Lacerte, Louis : Jean Gaudreau ‚Äì Moulin √† images, 2014 * Roberge, Josiane : Balise du Temps, 2015 * Roberge, Josiane : Court m√©trage ‚Äì Tambours flambeaux, 201  Private and Public Collections  * Mus√©e du Bas-Saint-Laurent * Cirque du Soleil * Qu√©b√©cor M√©dia * Loto Qu√©bec * Feel Europe Group * Quebec City * Laval University * Sherbrooke University * Groupe TVA * Alcan Canada * TD Bank * Premier Tech * Laurier Museum  References   Bibliography   1964 births Living people 20th-century Canadian artists 21st-century Canadian artists Artists from Quebec City Canadian engravers Canadian painters Canadian photographers Canadian sculptors Canadian male sculptors French Quebecers Universit√© Laval alumni ","title":"Jean Gaudreau"},{"id":"53716300","text":"Pierce Phillips (born 6 October 1992) is an English rugby union player, who plays for Agen in the Top 14.
