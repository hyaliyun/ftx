He was also a cultural reformer toward European and Russian cultures on the basis of enlightened Islam. His name is also transliterated as Abay Kunanbayev (–ê–±–∞–π –ö—É–Ω–∞–Ω–±–∞–µ–≤); among Kazakhs he is known as Abai. Life =Early life and education= Abai was born in Karauyl village in Chingiz volost of Semipalatinsk uyezd of the Russian Empire (this is now in Abay District of East Kazakhstan). He was the son of Qunanbai and Uljan, his father's second wife. They named him Ibrahim, as the family was Muslim, but he soon was given the nickname \\"Abai\\" (meaning \\"careful\\"), a name that stayed with him for the rest of his life. The boy first studied at a local madrasah under Mullah Ahmet Ryza. His father was wealthy enough to send Abai to a Russian secondary school in Semipalatinsk. There he read the writings of Mikhail Lermontov and Alexander Pushkin, which were influential to his own development as a writer. Moreover, he was fond of reading eastern poetry, including Shahname and 1000 and 1 night. =Contributions= Abai's main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore lies in his poetry, which expresses great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the nomadic habits of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abai's lifetime, however, a number of important socio- political and socio-economic changes occurred. Russian influence continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational possibilities as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian, Western or Asian. Abai Qunanbaiuly steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abai's creative poetry affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs. Legacy Qunanbaiuly on a 2020 Russian stamp Abay monument The leaders of the Alash Orda movement saw him as their inspiration and spiritual predecessor. Contemporary Kazakh images of Abay generally depict him in full traditional dress holding a dombra (the Kazakh national instrument). Today, Kazakhs revere Abay as one of the first folk heroes to enter into the national consciousness of his people. Kazakh National Pedagogical University is named after Abay, so is one of the main avenues in the city of Almaty. There are also public schools with his name. Abay is featured on postal stamps of Kazakhstan, Soviet Union, and India. The Kazakh city of Abay is named after him. Among Abay's students was his nephew, a historian, philosopher, and poet Shakarim Qudayberdiuli (1858‚Äì1931). Statues of him have been erected in many cities of Kazakhstan, as well as Beijing, Moscow, New Delhi, Tehran, Berlin, Cairo, Istanbul, Kyiv, and Budapest. Abay is featured on the Kazakhstani Tenge, a subway station in Almaty is named after him, along with a street, a square, a theater, and many schools. In 1995, the 150th anniversary of Abay's birth, UNESCO celebrated it with the \\"year of Abai\\" event. A film on the life of Abay was made by Kazakhfilm in 1995, titled Abai. He is also the subject of two novels and an opera by Mukhtar Auezov, another Kazakhstani writer. Another film describing his father's life was made in December 2015, titled \\"Qunanbai\\". In 2016, Abay Qunanbaiuly was chosen as one of the nominees in the \\"proposed candidates\\" category of the national project ¬´El Tulgasy¬ª (Name of the Motherland) The idea of the project was to select the most significant and famous citizens of Kazakhstan whose names are now associated with the achievements of the country. More than 350,000 people voted in this project, and Abay was voted into 5th place in his category. In 2020, the government of Kazakhstan announced plans to celebrate the 175th anniversary of his birthday throughout the year. Works Abay also translated into Kazakh the works of Russian and European authors, mostly for the first time. Translations made by him include poems by Mikhail Lermontov, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Lord Byron, Ivan Krylov's Fables and Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. Abay's major work is The Book of Words (¬´“õ–∞—Ä–∞ —Å”©–∑–¥–µ—Ä—ñ¬ª, Qara s√≥zderi), a philosophic treatise and collection of poems where he encourages his fellow Kazakhs to embrace education, literacy, and good moral character in order to escape poverty, enslavement and corruption. In Word Twenty Five, he discusses the importance of Russian culture, as a way for Kazakhs to be exposed to the world's cultural treasures. Moscow protests in May 2012 On 9 May 2012, after two days of protests in Moscow following Vladimir Putin's inauguration as President of the Russian Federation for the third term, protesters set up camp near the monument to Abai Qunanbaiuli on the Chistoprudny Boulevard in central Moscow, close to the embassy of Kazakhstan. The statue quickly became a reference point for the protest's participants. OccupyAbai was among the top ranking hash-tags in Twitter for several days thanks to Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny who set up a meeting with his followers next to Abai Qunanbaiuly's monument in Moscow that he called \\"a monument to some unknown Kazakh\\". This spurred a wave of indignation among ethnic Kazakhs who highly esteem Abai. This also brought Abai's poetry into the top 10 AppStore downloads.

The site is approximately south of the larger site of Yaxchilan, under which Bonampak was a dependency, and the border with Guatemala. While the site is not overly impressive in terms of spatial or architectural size (American archaeologist, epigrapher, and Mayanist scholar Sylvanus Morley once stated that Bonampak was fourth-rate in terms of size and political importance), it is well known for the murals located within the three roomed Structure 1 (The Temple of the Murals). The construction of the site's structures dates to the Late Classic period (c. AD 580 to 800). In addition to being among the best-preserved Maya murals, the Bonampak murals are noteworthy for debunking early assumptions that the Maya were a peaceful culture of mystics (a position long-held and argued for by the well-known early Mesoamerican archaeologist, ethnohistorian and epigrapher from the Carnegie Institute of Washington, Sir John Eric Sidney Thompson), as the murals clearly depict war and human sacrifice. The site, lying close to a tributary of the Usumacinta River, was first seen by non-Mayans in 1946. Precisely who was first is a matter of speculation, but it was either two American travelers, Herman Charles (Carlos) Frey and John Bourne, or photographer/explorer Giles Healey. The Americans were led to the ruins by the local Lacandon Maya who still visited the site to pray in the ancient temples. Giles Healey was the first to be shown the huge paintings covering the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome. Excavations From 1993 to 1997, the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) excavated at Bonampak, discovering 27 burials. History of the polity Bird Jaguar in the early 5th century fought against K'inich Tatb'u Skull I in Yaxchilan, and lost his freedom.Martin & Grube 2000, p.119. Other nobles were captured in a later war against Knot-eye Jaguar I.Martin & Grube 2000, p.120. In 514, Knot-eye Jaguar I was himself taken captive (by Ruler C of Piedras Negras),Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 422 giving Bonampak some respite; but after 526, his successor K'inich Tatb'u Skull II attacked Bonampak again and captured more lords.Martin & Grube 2000, p.121. Bonampak by 600 CE had become a satellite of Yaxchilan. In that time, the ajaw of Yaxchilan installed Yajaw Chan Muwaan I as lord in Bonampak. Subsequent ajawob reconstructed the site to orient toward the metropolis. C. 790 CE, Yaxchilan's king Shield Jaguar III oversaw the installation of Chan Muwaan II, and hired Yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it in \\"Structure I\\"'s murals. Bonampak collapsed with Yaxchilan in the 9th century.David Stuart: \\"Orienting Bonampak\\", http://decipherment.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/orienting-bonampak/, April 30, 2009 Temple of the Murals Musicians on lower register of the east wall of Room 1.Structure 1: Structure 1 at Bonampak, built at the end of the eighth century A.D. (officially dedicated on November 11, 791 A.D.), measures 16 meters long, four meters deep, and seven meters tall, and is constructed atop a T-shaped platform. Although there is no evidence to support the claim, some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb, such as can be seen on Structure 33 at nearby Yaxchilan. Structurally symmetrical, balanced and stable, it is composed of three separate rooms, which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by Chooj, son of Bonampak ruler Yajaw Chaan Muwan, and grandson of Aj Sak Teles. Although there has been some disagreement as to the temporal sequence of events, it is generally agreed that the narrative should be viewed in chronological order, beginning in Room 1 (scene of tribute, dressing, dance, mummery and musical performance); then on to Room 2 (scene of violent conflict, and a display in which a human cull is presented, tortured and killed in the company of the highest members of court and upper echelons of the victorious force); and, finally, to Room 3 (scene of a dance, with observers, and ritual bloodletting). In total, there are some 281 human figures represented within the three rooms, many with captions (approximately 1/3 of the figures are named, while another 10 percent of the figures have blank captions, and slightly more than half have no caption at all). A few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment, an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible Lowland Maya collapse during the period of Structure 1's creation, and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures. The planning and execution of the Bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists, and not to one solitary genius. This team would have included plasterers, pigment preparers, and possibly calligraphers, in addition to the painters and planners whose artistic conception is most visible on the walls. The exterior of Structure 1, although poorly preserved, was once richly painted in bright hues of Maya blue, blue-green, red, and yellow. Indeed, almost everything would have been covered in paint, as even the floors in each room were painted black. Only the top surfaces of the interior benches appear to have been left unpainted. In addition to the various colors applied, there were further artistic elements on the facade of Structure 1. Just below the binder molding, there are remnants of a single band of some eighty glyphs that wrapped around the building, and broad vertical bands of red, interchanged with areas of unpainted white stucco. Essentially, the artists at Bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of Structure 1 as if it were a Maya vase; more specifically, this was done in the codex-style vases of the Pet√©n, and not mirroring those of the Usumacinta region where Bonampak is located. Above each room there is a small niche housing a seated figure‚Äîlikely representations of a ruling lord. Between these niches there were two larger stucco scenes, only one of which has survived the ravages of time. Hinting at what is depicted within on the murals, the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him, his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher. On the east and west sides of the building, the upper course featured additional seated figures within niches set atop long-snouted god heads‚Äîthese still have some remnants of red paint visible. Finally, the doorway to each room features a carved lintel of a warrior subduing a captive. Lintel 1 (Room 1) depicts Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak, capturing an enemy on January 12, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.12, 8 Eb 10 K‚Äôumk‚Äôu); Lintel 2 (Room 2) likely shows the overlord from Yaxchilan, Shield Jaguar IV, on January 4, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.8, 4 Lamat 6 K‚Äôumk‚Äôu); and Lintel 3 (Room 3) displays Aj Sak Teles, probably on July 25, A.D. 780 (Longcount date: 9.17.9.11.14, 3 Ix 2 Yax). It is worth noting that the height of each doorway is only roughly 5‚Äô 7‚Äù (1.75 meters), and around 3 feet wide. Thus, it is clear that no Maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect. In 1996, a team from Yale University led by professor Mary Miller began The Bonampak Documentation Project, which included making an even more detailed study, photographic record, and reproductions of the murals. These reproductions, completed by artists Heather Hurst and Leonard Ashby, bring to life many details, thanks to infrared photographs, that can no longer be seen with the naked eye. Most saliently, the images captured many glyphs that were previously unknown, lost either to natural erosion, or due to the many failed attempts at preservation, some of which did far more damage than conservation. For a more detailed description about The Bonampak Documentation Project, and a thorough discussion on the murals, see Mary Miller and Claudia Brittenham's 2013 seminal work on the subject titled, The Spectacle of the Late Maya Court: Reflections on the Murals of Bonampak. '' *Note: The numbered human figures (HF) mentioned below can be found in the aforementioned publication on page 73, in addition to excellent large foldouts in the back of the book. Room 1: thumb200 pxLintel 1 over doorway to Room 1. This lintel depicts Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak, capturing an enemy on January 12, A.D. 787 (Longcount date: 9.17.16.3.12, 8 Eb 10 K‚Äôumk‚Äôu). This is the scene of a regal event: the acknowledgement, in front of the court and visiting dignitaries, by the Bonampak ruler, Yajaw Chaan Muwan, of his son's right to rule. There are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative. Some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall (HF's 62, 63, and 64). The large, feathered back racks, in addition to the various jaguar, quetzal and serpent elements in their costumes, underscore the importance of these figures. These are the three ch‚Äôoks (young heirs). It was at first thought that the central figure (HF 63) was the ruler of Bonampak, Yajaw Chaan Muwan. However, further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler, Chooj, who is in between his two brothers: Bird Balam and Aj Balam. With heels raised, all three brothers are in the middle of a ritual dance. To the viewer's left of HF 62, beginning on the south wall and leading to the east wall, there are several figures playing instruments (rattles, drums, and turtle shells) and singing, which fill this room with celebratory music. To the viewer's right of the three ch‚Äôoks, leading to the west wall, there are eight (regional governors). Of particular note is HF 71, standing in a familiar pose to smokers of today, as he, too, embraces a long, thin cigarette, expressing some combination of calm, lack of interest and boredom. Behind him, HF's 73 and 74, as well as HF's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together, holding parasols that frame the Initial Series Text right above them on the middle register. These are the only quotation marks in all of the Pre-Columbian New World. On the lower register of the north wall, still more musicians (HF's 43 and 44) blast their trumpets, while other performers (HF's 45-50) wear various costumes, including that of a crocodile (HF 48). Of all the images of visiting messengers, nobles and dancers held within the upper register, a few individuals, and one recently discovered detail in particular, stand out. Conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall, just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure, stands a lone figure (HF 16) presenting a child (HF 15) to the lords. At first, many thought that this child was the young heir; however, as noted previously, the central dancing figure below (HF 63) was the heir to the throne at Bonampak. Yet, even without having decoded the glyphs next to the three festive brothers, one notices a couple of peculiarities. Firstly, the young figure is actually wearing face paint and garments that are suggestive of a girl, perhaps a wife for the future ruler. Secondly, no one is looking at the child, not even the individual holding her. In fact, he is glancing over his left shoulder into the upper register of the west wall at the figure (HF 19) sitting upon an elevated throne. This seated figure is likely Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak. It is important to mention here that the caption above this individual, like so many captions in Structure 1, was left blank. Therefore, the identification of HF 19 as Yajaw Chaan Muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based on a name glyph. Beneath the throne, one can view five bundles, albeit with some difficulty. It was not until Professor Mary Miller's aforementioned Bonampak Documentation Project that scholars finally knew what these bundles contained. After analyzing infrared images of this scene, glyphs for ‚Äú5 pi kakaw‚Äù were revealed. ‚ÄúKakaw‚Äù was the classic Maya term for the cacao bean, and Harvard University professor David Stuart has suggested that the ‚Äúpi‚Äù glyph represents units of 8,000 beans. Therefore, if this is so, it appears that there has been a tribute payment to Yajaw Chaan Muwan of 40,000 cacao beans, which is a considerable sum of wealth. Finally, in the vault across the whole scene in Room 1, the faces of the Sun God are shown as it moves across the sky. On the east wall, a large crocodilian, representing the vault of the sky, carries the myriad avatars of the Sun God upon its back. Room 2: This is the scene of what has been referred to as the greatest battle scene in all of Maya art. Room 2 is the largest of the three, which alludes to its greater importance. It also contains more human figures than either Room 1 or Room 2, with 139 of them. The south wall, which is the first that is viewed upon entering, along with the east and the west walls, depict warriors in the heat of battle. Bodies are intertwined on both the lower and the upper registers. Trumpets blast as the battle rages on (HF 7). As one begins to focus more and more on the individuals, a couple of artistic elements and their symbolic meanings become clear. The ancient Maya believed that to be left-handed was a sign of femininity and weakness, thus the warriors who are shown as defeated‚Äîincluding already being stripped nude, with the victors gripping them by the hair‚Äîor those in the process of being defeated, are depicted as being left-handed (e.g., HF's 61 and 67). Some are even illustrated with two left hands. To contrast this sharply, several victors are given two right hands, doubling their strength and masculinity. In addition to left-handedness, the losers are also all wearing some element of a bird‚Äîor, at least those that are still in their battle costumes, and have not yet been stripped of them. This is also indicative of defeat. The victors, on the other hand, all wear costumes with feline elements‚Äîspecifically, the jaguar. Therefore, it is of no surprise to see the main character on the upper register of the south wall, Yajaw Chan Muwaan (HF 55), firmly gripping a jaguar skin-covered spear in his right hand while donning a large, extravagant jaguar headdress‚Äîwhich may contain a water-lily scroll‚Äîand wearing a jaguar jerkin and jaguar boots. Although it is clear that the events surrounding the ascension to the thrown of Chooj depicted in Structure 1 are narrating actual events, it is equally clear that Bonampak's version of the actual events is more propagandistic in nature. The aforementioned outfits of the losers underscore this fact. That is, no one intending to win would enter battle wearing costumes related to defeat, nor would all of the warriors of the losing side be left-handed. Professor Mary Miller describes the battle scene of Room 2 as an ‚Äú...official historical portraiture, not by any means a photographic glimpse of Maya warfare.‚Äù Above the chaotic battle, the south vault depicts three individuals within ancestor centipede cartouches. Between them are two bound captives. As one turns to view the north wall, the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle: torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle. To view the north wall, a visitor would have sat on the south bench above bound captives, as though becoming a part of the scene. The north wall is one of pain and suffering. Nude and almost nude captives (only wearing a loin cloth) are depicted in deep agony, as some of them are in the process of getting their fingernails ripped off, or have already undergone this torture and bleed from their wounds (HF's 101-109). HF 101 may have even had his teeth removed, while HF 106 has already expired, and HF 120 is only a severed head. Yajaw Chan Muwaan is the main figure here, too, wearing only a slightly different variant of his battle costume from the south wall. He stands stately over his captives, while several warriors and nobles observe the ritual, including his wife (HF 97). In the vault, directly above this scene, are four cartouches representing various celestial imagery. Note: During a radar survey of Structure 1 in 2010, archaeologists discovered a tomb beneath Room 2. It is small and relatively simple. It contained the body of one man between the ages of 35 and 42. It was a complete skeleton, minus the cranium, which scientists believe is simply due to natural erosion, and not evidence of beheading. The skeleton was accompanied by jade earrings, a jade necklace and bracelets, a spondylus shell pendant, two polychrome plates, an alabaster vase with a hole in the base, and a stone knife. The last two items‚Äîperforated vase and a stone knife‚Äîlead some to believe that this individual was one of the sacrifice victims depicted in Room 2. Other theories include him being a wounded warrior, or a possible relative of Yajaw Chan Muwaan, as his jewelry matched that of the nobles depicted in Room 1. It is clear that this tomb was part of the original construction of Structure 1 and was not, therefore, created at a later date. Room 3: alt= This is the scene of ritual celebration for victory in battle, including bloodletting by nobles, and contains 65 human figures. As with Rooms 1 and 2, the south wall is the first to be viewed. What captures one's attention immediately are the three elaborately dressed individuals in the upper register (HF's 16, 21, and 24) wearing tall, green, quetzal-feathered headdress and dancers wings. These are the same brothers from Room 1, with the young heir, Chooj, in the center (HF 21). Each brother holds a bloody femur bone that has been modified into a ritual ax. Right below Chooj is another figure (HF 22) on his knees; he is also holding an ax in his right hand and another object in his left. Here is another instance where the Bonampak Documentation Project was able to decipher that which is not able to be seen by the naked eye‚Äîin this instance, the paint had been completely eroded in this area. However, the infrared images revealed that what HF 22 had in his left hand was none other than the still beating heart of the sacrificial victim below (HF 19), who is being dragged down the pyramid steps by two attendants (HF's 18 and 20). Covering almost the entire bottom register of the south and west walls are seven more elaborately costumed characters (HF's 13, 15, 17, 26, 26, 27 and 28) with similar headdresses to those of the brothers above them. They are depicted with one heel raised and arms stretched out, as if captured right before a spinning dance, perhaps to imitate the flight of the quetzal. Above the entire south wall scene, set among a background of yellow ‚Äîthe first appearance of a color not representing reality‚Äî is a supernatural entity with square eyes, and a single frontal, pointed tooth. It lacks pupils and a real nose; behind it emerge two serpent-like supernatural entities that expel additional entities. The upper register of the west wall contains a musical procession with masked performers, carrying a dwarf (HF 42) who is lifted into the yellow background of the vault, demonstrating his connection to the supernatural world. The upper register of the east wall shows the noble women of Bonampak (HF's 2, 5 and 6) holding stingray spines to their tongues in a bloodletting ritual. Meanwhile, a large man (HF 7) offers bloodletting supplies to the women on the throne. Of note is the fact that these individuals also seem to appear previously‚ÄîHF 7 in Room 2 on the middle of the east wall; the others in Room 1 on the west wall throne scene. Above them, surrounded by yellow, another supernatural entity appears to spew blood. Turning to the north wall, one can see an almost identical supernatural in the vault as that of the south wall vault. Below, 10 ebeets (lords) dressed in white mantles engage in conversation, while nine more seated individuals below also gesticulate as they talk to one another, perhaps commenting on the performance taking place on the south wall in front of them. Finally, on the bottom register, more musicians raise their instruments skyward as part of the procession on the west wall. Room 3 engulfs the viewer in the celebration. Professor Mary Miller wrote, \\"Perhaps no single artifact from the ancient New World offers as complex a view of Prehispanic society as do the Bonampak paintings. No other work features so many Maya engaged in the life of the court and rendered in such great detail, making the Bonampak murals an unparalleled resource for understanding ancient society.\\"  Monuments  Stele 1 = Stele 1 = It is located in the central part of the Great Plaza, it represents the moment of the height of Chan Muwan II, the importance of the character is reflected in the way it is represented and in the difficulty to elaborate the monument, that is, in a huge slab of stone of little thickness without suffering any fracture. With its almost 6 meters high it is one of the highest in the Mayan world. Chan Muwan II is standing and carrying a ceremonial cane, the styling of the pupil gives him a greater strength to his look; in the lower part of the stele is observed the monster of the earth from which the faces of the young god of corn emerge. A band of glyphs under the feet of the ruler refers to his genealogy, while in another vertical band the emblem glyph of the city can be observed. = Stele 2 = It is located on a low terrace right in the center of the Acropolis and next to Stela 3, it shows Chan Muwan II richly dressed in the company of two women, in front of him her mother Lady Shield Skull and behind him his wife the Lady Green Rabbit of Yaxchil√°n who wear a huipil. The scene revolves around the ritual of self-sacrifice, performed by the ruler who carries in his right hand a bag with copal from which the face of the bat god is seen and assisted by his mother, who carries the stingray spines to perform the piercing while his wife holds the basket with the strips of paper ready to receive the blood drops of the ruler, which will later be incinerated in honor of their deities. = Stele 3 = It represents a scene in which Chan Muwan II is standing in front of a second person squatting and in a position of submission wearing paper ear-rings, symbol of the captives.

Biography Born in Valentano, he was the second son of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, grandson of Pope Paul III, and brother to Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese. On 4 November 1538 he married Margaret of Austria, the illegitimate daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Ottavio was 14 years old, while Margaret, recently widowed by the death of Alessandro de' Medici, was 15. At first she disliked her youthful bridegroom, but when he returned wounded from an expedition to Algiers in 1541 her aversion was turned to affection. Ottavio Farnese, bust in Milan, Sforza Castle. Farnese had become lord of Camerino in 1540, but he gave up that fief when his father became duke of Parma in 1545. After the Parmesan nobility assassinated Pierluigi Farnese in 1547, troops of the Emperor occupied Piacenza. Pope Paul III attempted to regain Piacenza; he set aside Ottavio's claims to the succession of Parma, where he appointed a papal legate, giving him back Camerino in exchange, and then claimed Piacenza from the emperor -- not for the Farnese, but for the Church. Farnese attempted to seize Parma by force, and having failed, entered into negotiations with Ferrante Gonzaga. This rebellion on the part of his grandson is believed to have hastened the Pope's death on 10 November 1549. During the interregnum that followed, Ottavio again tried to induce the governor of Parma to give up the city to him, but met with no better success; however, on the election of Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte to the papacy as Julius III, the duchy was conferred on him in 1551. This did not end Farnese's quarrel with the Emperor Charles V, for Gonzaga refused to give up Piacenza and even threatened to occupy Parma, so that Ottavio was driven into the arms of France. Julius III, who was anxious to be on good terms with Charles V on account of the Council of Trent which was then sitting, ordered Farnese to hand Parma over to the papal authorities once more, and on his refusal hurled censures and admonitions at his head, and deprived him of his Roman fiefs, while Charles did the same with regard to those in Lombardy. A French army came to protect Parma, the War of Parma broke out, and Gonzaga at once laid siege to the city. But the duke came to an arrangement with his father-in-law, by which he regained Piacenza and his other fiefs. The rest of his life was spent quietly at home, where the moderation and wisdom of his rule won for him the affection of his people. At his death in 1586 his only legitimate son Alessandro succeeded him.

He served as the 23rd Governor of California from 1911 to 1917 and as a United States Senator from 1917 to 1945. He was also Theodore Roosevelt's running mate in the 1912 presidential election on the Progressive (also known as the \\"Bull Moose\\") ticket. After working as a stenographer and reporter, Johnson embarked on a legal career. He began his practice in his hometown of Sacramento, California, but moved to San Francisco, where he worked as an assistant district attorney. Gaining statewide notoriety for his prosecutions of public corruption, Johnson won the 1910 California gubernatorial election with the backing of the Lincoln‚ÄìRoosevelt League. He instituted several progressive reforms, establishing a railroad commission and introducing aspects of direct democracy such as the power to recall state officials. Johnson joined with Roosevelt and other progressives to form the Progressive Party and won the party's 1912 vice presidential nomination. In one of the best third party performances in U.S. history, the ticket finished second nationally in the popular and electoral vote. Johnson won election to the Senate in 1916, becoming a leader of the chamber's Progressive Republicans. But he emerged as an early voice for Liberal Progressive isolationism, opposing U.S. entry into World War I and U.S. participation in the League of Nations. As a postwar Liberal Republican, he helped enact the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely restricted immigration from East Asian countries. Johnson unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1920 and 1924 and supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Johnson supported many of the New Deal programs but came to oppose Roosevelt as the latter's tenure continued. Johnson remained in the Senate until his death in 1945. Early years Johnson was born in Sacramento, California on September 2, 1866; his father was Grove Lawrence Johnson, a Republican Representative and a member of the California State Legislature who was accused of election irregularities and using his political offices to look after his personal financial interests. His mother was Annie De Montfredy, a descendant of a family of Huguenots who had left France to escape religious persecution after the Edict of Fontainebleau. Annie was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution as the result of her descent from Pierre Van Cortlandt and Philip Van Cortlandt. Johnson had a brother and three sisters. After attending public schools and Heald College, Johnson first worked as a shorthand reporter and stenographer in law offices. He eventually pursued a legal career, studying at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He was admitted to the bar in 1888 and commenced practice in his hometown. In 1902, he moved to San Francisco. He served as assistant district attorney and became active in reform politics, taking up an anti-corruption mantle. He attracted statewide attention in 1908 when he assisted Francis J. Heney in the graft prosecution of Abe Ruef and Mayor Eugene Schmitz. His success was due in large measure to the fact that after Heney was gunned down in the courtroom, he took the lead for the prosecution and won the case. He married Minne L. McNeal; the couple had two sons. Governor Johnson during his tenure as governor Johnson and newly elected Lieutenant Governor A.J. Wallace, right, in the Los Angeles Herald, November 9, 1910 In 1910, Johnson won the gubernatorial election as a member of the Lincoln‚ÄìRoosevelt League, a Progressive Republican movement running on an anti-Southern Pacific Railroad platform. During his campaign, he toured the state in an open automobile, covering thousands of miles and visiting small communities throughout California inaccessible by rail. In office, Johnson was a populist who implemented many important reforms. Among them was the popular election of U.S. senators, which stripped away the sole franchise of the California State Legislature to vote for federal senators. Johnson's administration also pushed for the ability of candidates to register in more than one political party, a reform that he believed would cripple the influence of what he viewed as a monolithic political establishment. In 1911, Johnson and the Progressives added initiative, referendum, and recall to the state government, giving California a degree of direct democracy unmatched by any other U.S. state. Johnson was instrumental in the establishment of a railroad commission to regulate the power of the Southern Pacific Railroad. On taking office, Johnson soon paroled the convicted Southern Pacific train bandit Chris Evans but required that he leave California. Although initially opposed to the bill, Johnson eventually gave in to political pressure and supported the California Alien Land Law of 1913 as a fledgling Liberal Progressive, legislation which prevented Asian immigrants (excluded from naturalized citizenship because of their race) from owning land in the state. Nationally, Johnson was a founder of the Progressive Party in 1912. That same year, he was the party's vice presidential candidate, sharing a ticket with former President Theodore Roosevelt; his selection helped Roosevelt to carry California by 0.2 percent of the votes. The Progressives finished second nationally ahead of the incumbent Republican, President William Howard Taft, but still lost the election to the Democrats and their candidate, Woodrow Wilson. Johnson was re- elected governor of California in 1914, almost doubling his opponent's vote total.California gubernatorial election, 1914 Senator Time cover, 29 Sep 1924 In 1916, Johnson ran successfully for the U.S. Senate, defeating Democrat George S. Patton Sr., and assuming office on March 16, 1917. It is alleged that was the year that he spoke the words for which he is best remembered today: \\"The first casualty when war comes is truth\\" about United States entry into World War I. However, the source of the famous quote has yet to be determined.Wikiquote, Hiram Johnson From 1917 to 1929, he resided at Riversdale in Riverdale Park, Maryland. Following Theodore Roosevelt's death in January 1919, Johnson was regarded as the natural leader of the Progressive Party. In 1920, however, he did not attempt to revive the Progressive Party, but ran for President as a liberal Republican. He was defeated for the Republican presidential nomination by conservative U.S. Senator Warren Harding of Ohio. Johnson also did not get the support of Roosevelt's family, who instead supported Roosevelt's long-time friend Leonard Wood. At the convention, Johnson was asked to serve as Harding's running mate, but he declined. As a Liberal Republican, Johnson helped push through the Immigration Act of 1924, having worked with Valentine S. McClatchy and other anti-Japanese lobbyists to prohibit Japanese and other East Asian immigrants from entering the United States. Johnson sought the 1924 Republican nomination against President Calvin Coolidge, but his campaign was derailed after he lost the California primary. Johnson declined to challenge Herbert Hoover for the 1928 presidential nomination, instead choosing to seek re-election to the Senate. When the motion picture industry sought someone to establish a self-regulatory process and to help the industry fend off official censorship, three candidates were identified: Herbert Hoover, Johnson and Will H. Hays. Hays, who had campaigned actively for Harding among industry leaders, was ultimately named to head the new Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America in early 1922.\\"Will Hays: America's Morality Czar\\" , \\"Source: 'Will Hays.' Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Vol. 21. Gale Group, 2001.\\" Retrieved 2011-09-12. As a senator, Johnson proved extremely popular. In 1934, he was re-elected with 94.5 percent of the popular vote because he was nominated by both Republicans and Democrats and his only opponent was Socialist George Ross Kirkpatrick. Hiram Johnson at the 1913 California State Fair In the 1932 presidential election, Johnson broke with President Hoover, and was one of the most prominent Republicans in the country to support Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the early presidency of Roosevelt, Johnson supported the president's economic recovery package, the New Deal, and frequently crossed the floor to aid the Democrats. He even endorsed FDR in the 1932 and 1936 presidential elections, although he never switched party affiliation. He became disenchanted with Roosevelt and the New Deal following FDR's unsuccessful attempt to increase the size of the Supreme Court. As a staunch isolationist, Johnson voted against the League of Nations. He was not present when the Senate voted to ratify the treaty to create a similar organization, the United Nations, but he made it known that he would have voted against ratification; only senators Henrik Shipstead and William Langer actually cast votes against the United Nations Charter. In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made by British scholar Isaiah Berlin for his Foreign Office stated that Johnson: :is the Isolationists' elder statesman and the only surviving member of the [William E. ] Borah- [Henry Cabot] Lodge-Johnson combination which led the fight against the League in 1919 and 1920. He is an implacable and uncompromising Isolationist with immense prestige in California, of which he has twice been Governor. His election to the Senate has not been opposed for many years by either party. He is acutely Pacific-conscious and is a champion of a more adequate defence of the West Coast. He is a member of the Farm Bloc and is au fond, against foreign affairs as such; his view of Europe as a sink of iniquity has not changed in any particular since 1912, when he founded a short-lived progressive party. His prestige in Congress is still great and his parliamentary skill should not be underestimated. During his Senate career, Johnson served as chairman of the Committees on Cuban Relations (Sixty-sixth Congress), Patents (Sixty-seventh Congress), Immigration (Sixty-eighth through Seventy-first Congresses), Territories and Insular Possessions (Sixty-eighth Congress), and Commerce (Seventy-first and Seventy-second Congresses). He was California's longest-serving senator. Death The front page of the Los Angeles Times for August 7, 1945, reporting the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and the death of Johnson. Having served in the Senate for almost thirty years, Johnson died in the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on August 6, 1945, ironically (for a staunch isolationist) on the date of the first deployment of nuclear weapons in warfare, by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. He was interred in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. Legacy Johnson gained some recognition in the media and general public during the 2003 California recall election because he was the most important person behind the introduction of the law that allowed state officials to be recalled. Also, the gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger referred to Johnson's progressive legacy in his campaign speeches before he won the election. On August 25, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, announced that Johnson would be one of 13 inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

History Teampall Brecan, Inishmore Little is known about the first inhabitants to cross over to the islands, but it is likely that they came across in search of a safe haven from attack. The Islands are made up of Carboniferous limestone and do not have naturally occurring topsoil. Early settlers augmented the soil with seaweed and sand from the shore. Drystone walls were built to protect the soil. There are seven prehistoric stone forts on the islands. D√∫n Aonghasa on Inishmore, dates back to 1100 BC.\\"Western Stone Forts\\", The Heritage Council Enda of Aran founded the Killeany monastery in Inishmore, AD 490. It became a center of learning, piety, and asceticism. Also on Inishmore is Tempull Breccain, the 5th century Church of Saint Brecan.Harbison, Peter (1995-04-01). Pilgrimage in Ireland: The Monuments and the People. Syracuse University Press. A ringfort on Inisheer, called D√∫n Formna became the site of a castle built by the O'Briens around the 14th century. Cromwell's soldiers destroyed the castle and all but two of the seven churches established by Brecan. The typical settlement was a Clachan, a scattered cluster of small single-story cottages with a thatched roof. Typical clothing for an Aran man was homespun trousers and waistcoats made of grey or light brown tweed; for women, a calf-length woven skirt along with a knitted sweater. Aran knitters were highly skilled.\\"Eight incredible things you didn't know about Ireland's Aran Islands\\", Irish Post, June 29, 2017 In the 1820s, harvesting kelp was an important sideline to raise money for the land rents.

Here‚Äôs what it found\\", The Irish Times, September 13, 2018  Geology  A view over the karst landscape on Inishmore, from D√∫n Aonghasa, an ancient stone fort. The islands' geology is mainly karst limestone, related to the Burren in County Clare (to the east), not the granites of Connemara to the north. This is most obvious in the construction of the walls around the fields. The limestones date from the Vis√©an age of the Lower Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins, and ammonites. Glaciation following the Namurian facilitated greater denudation. The result is that the Aran Islands are one of the finest examples of a Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the islands overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. Any karstification now seen dates from approximately 11,000 years ago and the island karst is thus recent. Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grykes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. Huge boulders up to above the sea at parts of the west facing cliffs are in some cases an extreme form of storm beach, cast there by giant waves that occur on average once per century, though more are glacial erratics. Climate and agriculture The islands have an unusually temperate climate. Average air temperatures range from in July to in January. The soil temperature does not usually drop below (the winter of 2010 recorded a prolonged period of snow, the first in living memory). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above , this means that the island (like the neighbouring Burren) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth. Late May is the sunniest time and also likely the best time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later). Demographics Flora and fauna The islands supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are renowned for their remarkable assemblage of plants and animals. The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids. Notable insects present include butterflies (the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis)); moths (the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Odontognophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis)); and the hoverfly Doros profuges.  Traditional life and Irish language  A view over Inishmore, from D√∫n Eochla, with Inishmaan and Cliffs of Moher in the background. On the cliff tops, ancient forts such as D√∫n Aonghasa (D√∫n Aengus) on Inishm√≥r and D√∫n Chonch√∫ir (Fort of Conchobar) on Inishmaan are some of the oldest archaeological remains in Ireland. A lacework of ancient stone walls across all three islands ( in all) encloses networks of small fields to contain local livestock. Also found are early cloch√°ns (dry-stone beehive huts from the early-Christian period). Enda of Aran founded the first true Irish monastery near Killeany (Cill √âinne or Church of Enda). In time there were a dozen monasteries on Inishm√≥r alone. Many Irish saints had some connection with Aran: St. Brendan was blessed for his voyage there; Jarlath of Tuam, Finnian of Clonard, and St. Columba called it the \\"Sun of the West\\". In total, there are 38 national monuments on the Aran Islands. The islands were first populated in larger numbers probably at the time of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the mid-17th century, when the Catholic population of Ireland had the choice of going \\"to hell or to Connacht\\". Many fled to the numerous islands off the west coast of Ireland where they adapted themselves to the raw climatic conditions, developing a survival system of total self- sufficiency. Their methods included mixing layers of sand and seaweed on top of rocks to create fertile soil, a technique used to grow potatoes and other vegetables. The same seaweed method also provided grazing grass within stone- wall enclosures for cattle and sheep, which in turn provided wool and yarn to make handwoven trousers, skirts and jackets, hand-knitted sweaters, shawls, caps, and hide shoes. The islanders also constructed unique boats for fishing, building their thatched cottages from the materials available or trading with the mainland. The Aran Islands are an official Gaeltacht, which gives full official status to Irish as the medium of all official services including education. An unusually high rate of Irish-language monolingualism was found among senior natives until the end of the 20th century, in large part because of the isolating nature of the traditional trades practised and the natural isolation of the islands in general from mainland Ireland over the course of the Islands' history. Young Islanders can take their leaving examination at 18 on the islands and then most leave for third level education. Many blame the decline of Irish-speaking among young members of the island community on English-language television, available since the 1960s; furthermore, many younger islanders leave for the mainland when they come of age. Transport Year-round ferry passenger services exist. Aran Island Ferries operate a year- round service from Rossaveal in County Galway, connected by a bus service from Galway city. A heavy cargo service operates several times a week from Galway Harbour, and is operated by Lasta Mara. Aer Arann Islands operates an air service from Inverin to Inishmore Airport which has a connecting bus from Galway city. The airline announced that it would cease all flights in December 2018, but an agreement was reached to continue the service until 30 September 2019. Ferries are also available to the Aran Islands from Doolin in County Clare (Seasonal 1 April ‚Äì 31 October). A road network exists on each of the islands and a speed limit of applies. Cars on the islands are exempt from road-worthiness testing. Most visitors to the island hire bikes as it is the most convenient way to see the islands. Road in Inishmore.

Since the year 2000, √Åras √âanna Arts Centre, Inisheer has been welcoming Artists in Residence both local and international to stay and work on the inspirational Aran Islands for periods of one month. Cl√≠odhna Lyons, born on the islands, is an Irish cartoonist, animator and printmaker who has created several comics and zines and is now a director for Brown Bag Films. =Visiting artists= View of Inishmore coastline. The islands have had an influence on world literature and arts disproportionate to their size. From 1908, Harry Clarke spent a number of weeks each summer for six years on Inis O√≠rr, accompanied by friends and his future wife, Margaret Clarke (artist). Sketches by and of Clarke exist from these trips, regarded as formative in his upbringing as they marked the first occasions in which it was necessary for the artist to convalesce off the mainland of Ireland. The unusual cultural and physical history of the islands has made them the object of visits by a variety of writers and travellers who recorded their experiences. Beginning around the late 19th century, many Irish writers travelled to the Aran Islands; Lady Gregory, for example, came to Aran in the late nineteenth century to learn Irish. At the start of the 20th century and throughout his life one of Ireland's leading artists, Se√°n Keating, spent time every year on the islands translating on to canvas all the qualities that make the inhabitants of these Atlantic Islands so unusual and in many respects remarkable. Elizabeth Rivers moved from London and lived in Aran where she created two books of art and was herself visited by artists such as Basil Rakoczi. Many wrote of their experiences in a personal vein, alternately casting them as narratives about finding, or failing to find, some essential aspect of Irish culture that had been lost to the more urban regions of Ireland. A second, related kind of visitor were those who attempted to collect and catalogue the stories and folklore of the island, treating it as a kind of societal \\"time capsule\\" of an earlier stage of Irish culture. Visitors of this kind differed in their desires to integrate with the island culture, and most were content to be considered observers. The culmination of this mode of interacting with the island might well be Robert J. Flaherty's 1934 classic documentary Man of Aran. One might consider John Millington Synge's The Aran Islands as a work that straddles these first two modes, it being both a personal account and also an attempt at preserving information about the pre- (or a-) literate Aran culture in literary form. The motivations of these visitors are exemplified by W. B. Yeats' advice to Synge: \\"Go to the Aran Islands, and find a life that has never been expressed in literature.\\"John Millington Synge (1906). The Aran Islands. [S.l.]: Maunsel & Roberts. In the second half of the twentieth century, up until perhaps the early 1970s, one sees a third kind of visitor to the islands. These visitors came not necessarily because of the uniquely \\"Irish\\" nature of the island community, but simply because the accidents of geography and history conspired to produce a society that some found intriguing or even beguiling and that they wished to participate in directly. At no time was there a single \\"Aran\\" culture: any description is necessarily incomplete and can be said to apply completely only to parts of the island at certain points in time. However, visitors that came and stayed were mainly attracted to aspects of Aran culture such as: # Isolated from mainstream print and electronic media, and thus reliant primarily on local oral tradition for both entertainment and news. # Rarely visited or understood by outsiders. # Strongly influenced in its traditions and attitudes by the unusually savage weather of Galway Bay. # In many parts characterised by subsistence, or near-subsistence, farming and fishing. # Adapted to the absence of luxuries that many parts of the Western world had enjoyed for decades and in some cases, centuries. For these reasons, the Aran Islands were \\"decoupled\\" from cultural developments that were at the same time radically changing other parts of Ireland and Western Europe. Though visitors of this third kind understood that the culture they encountered was intimately connected to that of Ireland, they were not particularly inclined to interpret their experience as that of \\"Irishness\\". Instead, they looked directly towards ways in which their time on the islands put them in touch with more general truths about life and human relations, and they often took pains to live \\"as an islander\\", eschewing help from friends and family at home. Indeed, because of the difficult conditions they found‚Äîdangerous weather, scarce food‚Äîthey sometimes had little time to investigate the culture in the more detached manner of earlier visitors. Their writings are often of a more personal nature, being concerned with understanding the author's self as much as the culture around him. This third mode of being in Aran died out in the late 1970s due in part to the increased tourist traffic and in part to technological improvements made to the island, that relegated the above aspects to history. A literary product of this third kind of visitor is An Aran Keening, by Andrew McNeillie, who spent a year on Aran in 1968. Another, P√°draig √ì S√≠och√°in, a Dublin author and lawyer, learning to speak Gaelic to the fluency of an islander became inextricably linked to the Aran handknitters and their Aran Sweaters, extensively promoting their popularity and sale around the world for nearly forty years. A fourth kind of visitor to the islands, still prominent today, comes for spiritual reasons often connected to an appreciation for Celtic Christianity or more modern New Age beliefs, the former of which finds sites and landscapes of importance on the islands. Finally, there are many thousands of visitors who come for broadly touristic reasons: to see the ruins, hear Irish spoken (and Irish music played) in the few pubs on the island, and to experience the often awe-inspiring geology of cliffs. Tourists today far outnumber visitors of the four kinds discussed above. Tourists and visitors of the fourth kind, however, are under- represented as creators of literature or art directly connected to the island; there are few ordinary \\"travelogues\\" of note, perhaps because of the small size of the islands, and there are no personal accounts written about Aran that are primarily concerned with spirituality. Tim Robinson's Stones of Aran: Pilgrimage (1986) and Stones of Aran: Labyrinth (1995), and his accompanying detailed map of the islands, are another resource on the Aran Islands. Robinson's work is an exhaustive, but not exhausting, survey of the Aran geography and its influence on Aran culture from the Iron Age up to recent times. Robinson also has written, and continues to write, about the Connemara region that faces the Aran Islands on the Galway mainland. Island crafts Plassey sits on the shore of Inisheer, one of the Aran Islands. Fishing is a small but important part of the area's economy. =Aran Island sweater= The islands are the home of the Aran sweater, which gained worldwide appeal during the course of the 20th century.Corrigan, Vawn (2019). Irish Aran, History, Tradition, Fashion. O'Brien Press. http://www.obrien.ie/irish-aranA Journey Into Ireland's Literary Revival by R. Todd Felton, page 54 Many of the sweaters sold in the islands are made elsewhere in Ireland.. =Aran currach= The (modern) Aran version of the lightweight boat called the currach (Aran Islands Dialect: k√∏r…ôx, kor…ôx) is made from canvas stretched over a sparse skeleton of thin laths, then covered in tar. It is designed to withstand the very rough seas that are typical of islands that face the open Atlantic. Indeed, it is said that the Aran fishermen would not learn to swim, since they would certainly not survive any sea that swamped a currach and so it would be better to drown quickly. Despite the undoubted strength of these boats, they are very vulnerable to puncture. The islanders were always totally self-sufficient. In calmer weather the currachs would go out and spend the night fishing under the Cliffs of Moher, returning after dawn full with fish. Nowadays they are only used inshore, tending lobster-pots. More modern versions are still built for racing at the many local regattas, or \\"Cruinnithe\\" up and down the west coast of Ireland during the summer months. Conventional shoes cannot be worn, so the fishermen wear soft calf-skin moccasins called pampooties, made of goatskin or cowskin. Sport Some of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers. GAA sports such as Gaelic Football, hurling and Irish Handball are the islands' main sports. As well as that the annual Red Bull cliff diving world championships are held on Inis m√≥r every year.  In popular culture  * John Millington Synge (J.M.

This ship is of the ' longship type. Viking ships were marine vessels of unique structure, built by the Vikings during the Viking Age. The boat-types were quite varied, depending on what the ship was intended for, but they were generally characterized as being slender and flexible boats, with symmetrical ends with true keel. They were clinker built, which is the overlapping of planks riveted together. Some might have had a dragon's head or other circular object protruding from the bow and stern for design, although this is only inferred from historical sources. Viking ships were not just used for their military prowess but for long-distance trade, exploration and colonization.Jones, Gwyn, A history of the Vikings (Oxford 2001). In the literature, Viking ships are usually seen divided into two broad categories: merchant ships and warships. These categories are overlapping; some kinds of merchant ships, built for transporting cargo specifically, could also be used as warships. The majority of Viking ships were designed for sailing rivers, fjords and coastal waters, while a few types, such as the knarr, could navigate the open sea and even the ocean. The Viking ships ranged from the Baltic Sea to far from the Scandinavian homelands, to Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Newfoundland, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and Africa.Were also seen in the Egypt Red Sea  Development  The ship has been functioning as the centerpiece of Scandinavian culture for millennia, serving both pragmatic and religious purposes, and its importance was already deeply rooted in the Scandinavian culture when the Viking Age began. Scandinavia is a region with relatively high inland mountain ranges, dense forests and easy access to the sea with many natural ports. Consequently, trade routes were primarily operated via shipping, as inland travel was both more hazardous and cumbersome. Many stone engravings from the Nordic Stone Age and in particular the Nordic Bronze Age, depict ships in various situations and valuable ships were sacrificed as part of ceremonial votive offerings since at least the Nordic Iron Age, as evidenced by the Hjortspring and Nydam boats. The Viking kingdoms developed into coastal towns and forts, all of which were deeply dependent on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea for survival and development. Control of the waterways was of critical importance, and consequently, advanced warships were in high demand. But in fact, because of their overwhelming importance, ships became a mainstay of the Viking religion, as they evolved into symbols of power and prowess. Throughout the first millennium, respectable Viking chieftains and their relatives were commonly buried with an intact, luxurious ship to transport them in the afterlife. Furthermore, the Hedeby coins, among the earliest known Danish currency, have impressions of ships as emblems, showing the importance of naval vessels in the area. Through such cultural and practical significance, the Viking ship progressed into the most powerful, advanced naval vessel in Viking Age Europe.  Faering  A faering is an open rowboat with two pairs of oars, commonly found in most boat-building traditions in Western and Northern Scandinavia, dating back to the Viking Age.What is a norse f√¶ring? (Vikingskip.com)  Knarr  Knarr is the Norse term for ships that were built for Atlantic voyages. They were cargo ships averaging a length of about , a beam of , and a hull capable of carrying up to 24 tons.Peter Sawyer, (1975) The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings. Oxford University Press Overall displacement: 50 tons. This is shorter than the Gokstad type of longships, but knarrs are sturdier by design and they depended mostly on sail-power, only putting oars to use as auxiliaries if there was no wind on the open water. Because of this, the knarr was used for longer voyages, ocean-going transports and more hazardous trips than the Gokstad type. It was capable of sailing in one day, and held a crew of about 20‚Äì30. KnarrsPlural of knarr is knerrir. routinely crossed the North Atlantic in the Viking Age, carrying livestock and goods to and from Greenland and the North Atlantic islands. The design of the knarr later influenced the design of the cog, used in the Baltic Sea by the Hanseatic League. The best-preserved Viking Age knarr is the √Ñskek√§rr ship, which was found in Sweden in 1933, and is believed to be from about 930 AD.  Longship  The Gokstad ship, on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway. Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship's design evolved over many years, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship but lay in the range of 5‚Äì10 knots, and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around 15 knots. Animal head from Oseberg Ship The long-ship is characterized as a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around; this trait proved particularly useful in northern latitudes where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions sported a rectangular sail on a single mast which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys. Longships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board. Types ranged from the Karvi, with 13 rowing benches, to the Busse, one of which has been found with an estimated 34 rowing positions. Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time and were highly valued possessions. They were often owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by the king in times of conflict, in order to build a powerful naval force. While longships were deployed by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used for troop transports, not as warships. In the tenth century, these boats would sometimes be tied together in battle to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. Longships were called dragonships (drakuskippan) by the Franks because they had a dragon-shaped prow. = Karve = The Karve was a small type of Viking longship, with a broad hull somewhat similar to the knarr. They were used for both war and ordinary transport, carrying people, cargo or livestock. Because they were able to navigate in very shallow water, they were also used for coasting. Karves had broad beams of approximately .  Ship construction  Viking ships varied from other contemporary ships, being generally more seaworthy and lighter. This was achieved through use of clinker (lapstrake) construction. The planks from which Viking vessels were constructed were rived (split) from large, old-growth trees‚Äîespecially oaks. A ship's hull could be as thin as one inch (2.5 cm), as a split plank is stronger than a sawed plank found in later craft.Lapstrake hull schematic Working up from a stout oaken keel, the shipwrights would rivet the planks together using wrought iron rivets and roves. Ribs maintained the shape of the hull sides. Each tier of planks overlapped the one below, and waterproof caulking was used between planks to create a strong but supple hull. Remarkably large vessels could be constructed using traditional clinker construction. Dragon-ships carrying 100 warriors were not uncommon. Furthermore, during the early Viking Age, oar ports replaced rowlocks, allowing oars to be stored while the ship was at sail and to provide better angles for rowing. The largest ships of the era could travel five to six knots using oar power and up to ten knots under sail.Richard Hall, The World of the Vikings (New York, 2007), 55.  Navigation  With such technological improvements, the Vikings began to make more and more ocean voyages, as their ships were more seaworthy. However, in order to sail in ocean waters, the Vikings needed to develop methods of relatively precise navigation. Most commonly, a ship's pilot drew on traditional knowledge to guide the ship's path. Essentially, the Vikings simply used prior familiarity with tides, sailing times, and landmarks in order to route courses. For example, scholars contend that the sighting of a whale allowed the Vikings to determine the direction of a ship. Because whales feed in highly nutritious waters, commonly found in regions where landmasses have pushed deep-water currents towards shallower areas, the sighting of a whale functioned as a signal that land was near. On the other hand, some academics have proposed that the Vikings also developed more advanced aids to navigation, such as the use of a sun compass. A wooden half-disc found on the shores of Narsarsuaq, Greenland initially seemed to support this hypothesis. However, further investigation of the object revealed that the slits inscribed in the disc are disproportionately spaced, and so the object could not in fact function as an accurate compass. Rather it has been suggested that the instrument is instead a ‚Äúconfession disc‚Äù used by priests to count the number of confessions in their parish.Hall, The World of the Vikings, 54. Similarly, researchers and historians continually debate the use of the sunstone in Viking navigation. Because a sunstone is able to polarize light, it is a plausible method for determining direction. By showing which direction light waves are oscillating, the sunstone has the potential to show the sun's position even when the sun is obscured by clouds. The stone changes to a certain color, based on the direction of the waves, but only when the object is held in an area with direct sunlight. Thus, most scholars debate the reliability and the plausibility of using a navigational tool that can only determine direction in such limited conditions. Viking sagas routinely tell of voyages where Vikings suffered from being \\"hafvilla\\" (bewildered)‚Äîvoyages beset by fog or bad weather, where they completely lost their sense of direction. This description suggests they did not use a sunstone when the sun was obscured. Moreover, the fact that this same bewilderment could arise when the winds died suggests that the Vikings relied on prevailing winds to navigate, as expected if their skills depended principally on traditional knowledge.Hafvilla: A Note on Norse Navigation, G. J. Marcus, Speculum, Vol. 30, No. 4 (Oct., 1955), pp. 601‚Äì05, Published by: Medieval Academy of America, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2849616 (accessed November 2, 2011).  Culture and traditions  One Viking custom was to bury dead chieftains in their ships. The dead man's body would be carefully prepared and dressed in his best clothes. After this preparation, the body would be transported to the burial- place in a wagon drawn by horses. The man would be placed on his ship, along with many of his most prized possessions. The chieftain's favorite horses, often a faithful hunting-dog and occasionally thralls and households, were sacrificially killed and also buried with the deceased. The Vikings firmly believed that the dead man would then sail to the after-life. An example of a Viking ship burial was excavated near the Danish village of Ladby and can be found on display here. The preserved remains of the Oseberg Ship, now located in the Viking Ship Museum (Oslo). Burial of ships is an ancient tradition in Scandinavia, stretching back to at least the Nordic Iron Age, as evidenced by the Hjortspring boat (400‚Äì300 BC) or the Nydam boats (200‚Äì450 AD), for example. Ships and bodies of water have held major spiritual importance in the Norse cultures since at least the Nordic Bronze Age.  Preserved ships  Skuldelev ship 3 in the Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde). Several original Viking ships have been found through the ages, but only a few have been relatively intact and subsequently preserved. The most notable of these few ships include: * Gokstad ship: overall length ‚Äì approximately * Oseberg ship: overall length ‚Äì approximately * Tune ship: may have been up to 18.7 metres (61 ft) long * Skuldelev ships * Gjellestad ship burial: estimated length 20 metres (excavation ongoing as of June 2020)  Replicas  Viking ship replicas are one of the more common types of ship replica. Viking, the very first Viking ship replica, was built by the R√∏dsverven shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway. In 1893 it sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition. There are a considerable number of modern reconstructions of Viking Age ships in service around Northern Europe and North America. The Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, has been particularly prolific in building accurate reconstructions of archaeological finds in its collection.

(2009). The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata: an abridged translation. Penguin Classics (), p. 200 The other ages are called Satya/Krita Yuga, Treta Yuga, and Dvapara Yuga. The \\"Kali\\" of Kali Yuga means \\"strife\\", \\"discord\\", \\"quarrel\\" or \\"contention\\" and Kali Yuga is associated with the demon Kali (not to be confused with the goddess KƒÅlƒ´). According to Puranic sources,The Bhagavata Purana (1.18.6), Vishnu Purana (5.38.8), and Brahma Purana (2.103.8) state that the day Krishna left the earth was the day that the Dvapara Yuga ended and the Kali Yuga began: ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî Krishna's departure marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE.See: Matchett, Freda, \\"The Puranas\\", p 139 and Yano, Michio, \\"Calendar, astrology and astronomy\\" in Based on a starting year of 3102 BCE and a duration of 432,000 years (1200 divine years), Kali Yuga began roughly years ago and has years remaining as of CE. Kali Yuga will end in the year 428,899 CE. Possible starting and ending dates Information kiosk at Bhalka, the place from where Krishna returned to his heavenly abode According to the Surya Siddhanta, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCE.The Induand the Rg-Veda, Page 16, By Egbert Richter-Ushanas, This is also considered the date on which Krishna left the earth to return to Vaikuntha. This information is placed at the temple of Bhalka, the place of this incident (see photo). According to the astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata the Kali Yuga started in 3102 BCE. He finished his book Aryabhattiyam in 499 CE, in which he gives the exact year of the beginning of Kali Yuga. He writes that he wrote the book in the \\"year 3600 of the Kali Age\\" at the age of 23. As it was the 3600th year of the Kali Age when he was 23 years old, and given that Aryabhata was born in 476 CE, the beginning of the Kali Yuga would come to (3600 - (476 + 23) + 1 (As only one year elapses between 1 BCE and 1 CE)) = 3102 BCE.H.D. Dharm Chakravarty Swami Prakashanand Saraswati. Encyclopedia Of Authentic Hinduism The True History and the Religion of India, Hardbound, 2nd Edition, 2003, Retrieved 2015-01-21 According to K. D. Abhyankar, the starting point of Kali Yuga is an extremely rare planetary alignment, which is depicted in the Mohenjo-daro seals. Going by this alignment the year 3102 BCE is slightly off. The actual date for this alignment is 7 February 3104 BCE. There is also sufficient proof to believe that Vrdhha Garga knew of precession at least by 500 BCE. Garga had calculated the rate of precession to within 30% of what the modern scholars estimate. Attributes Hindus believe that human civilization degenerates spiritually during the Kali Yuga.Dimitri Kitsikis, L'Orocc, dans l'√¢ge de Kali, Editions Naaman,1985, Common attributes and consequences are spiritual bankruptcy, mindless hedonism, breakdown of all social structure, greed and materialism, unrestricted egotism, afflictions and maladies of mind and body. Hinduism often symbolically represents morality (dharma) as an Indian bull. In Satya Yuga, the first stage of development, the bull has four legs, but in each age morality is reduced by one quarter. By the age of Kali, morality is reduced to only a quarter of that of the golden age, so that the bull of Dharma has only one leg. 1.16.20 =References in the Mahabharata= The Kurukshetra War and the decimation of Kauravas thus happened at the Yuga-Sandhi, the point of transition from one yuga to another. The scriptures mention Narada as having momentarily intercepted the demon Kali on his way to the Earth when Duryodhana was about to be born in order to make him an embodiment of arishadvargas and adharma in preparation of the era of decay in values and the consequent havoc. Prophesied events A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of Kali Yuga.Mahabharata SECTION CLXXXIX In relation to rulers, it lists: * Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes unfairly. * Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world. * People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source. * \\"At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the subject of God, even at the residences of so-called saints and respectable gentlemen of the three higher varnas (guna or temperament) and when nothing is known of the techniques of sacrifice, even by word, at that time the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser.\\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7) It is also scheduled that the Bhagavata Purana will be composed. With regard to human relationships, Markandeya's discourse says: * Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur. * Religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, tolerance, mercy, physical strength and memory diminish with each passing day. * People will have thoughts of murder with no justification and will see nothing wrong in that. * Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life. * Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish. * People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs. * Gurus will no longer be respected and their students will attempt to injure them. Their teachings will be insulted, and followers of Kama will wrest control of the mind from all human beings. * All the human beings will declare themselves as gods or boon given by gods and make it as a business instead of teachings. * People will no longer get married and live with each other just for sexual pleasure. * Weather and environment will degrade with time and frequent and unpredictable rainfalls will happen. * Earthquakes will be common. * Maximum age of humans will be 50 years by the end of Kali Yuga. * Many fake ideologies will spread throughout the world. * The powerful people will dominate the poor people. * Many diseases will spread. * At the end of Kali Yuga, lord Vishnu will take birth on earth to wipe out the sinners. 10,000 year \\"Golden Age\\" The Brahma Vaivarta Purana (related to Rathantara kalpa) mentions a ten thousand-year period, starting from the traditional dating of the Kali Yuga epoch, during which bhakti yogis will be present.Ramesh Chaturvedi, Shantilal Nagar. Online Book 4, Chapter 129, versus 49‚Äì60 Krishna foretold that Kali Yuga will be full of extreme hardships for people with ideals and values. The Brahma-vaivarta Purana has words spoken by Krishna to Mother Ganga just before the beginning of the Kali Yuga (the age of quarrel and strife). The Kali Yuga began approximately five thousand years ago, that golden age is being described below by Krishna. Predicted in Brahma-vaivarta Purana 4.129. The fourth part of the Brahma-vaivarta is called K·πõ·π£·πáa-janma-khanda. Chapter 129 is called Golokarohanam, because it describes how Krishna returns to His abode. This specific dialogue is between Krishna and Mother Ganga. Verse 49 is a question by Ganga, verses 50‚Äì60 are Krishna's answer. This text is taken from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana [14] Text 59: The above is supported in 4.90.32‚Äì33: Personification Kalki and his horse, Devadatta. Kali is the reigning lord of Kali Yuga and his nemesis is Kalki, the tenth and final Avatar of Vishnu. According to the Vishnu Purana, Kali is a negative manifestation working towards the cause of 'the end' or rather towards eventual rejuvenation of the universe. In Shaivism Some Shaivites maintain that the ill effects of Kali Yuga can only be moderated by the manifestation of Shiva himself. Shastriji, one of the followers of Haidakhan Babaji, gave the following narration: \\"Once Parvati asked Lord Shiva, her husband: 'You have done good work for the people in all ages, but I am afraid for the people in the Kali Yuga; how will they safeguard themselves?' Then Lord Shiva told Parvati: ‚ÄúI will appear in the Kali Yuga and I will create a new state, a new centre of religion - a most important place, where I will live and establish all the Gods there.‚ÄùThe Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981. Shastriji went further to suggest that this promise manifested through the person of Haidakhan Babaji.\\"Having some doubt, Kartikeya, son of Lord Shiva, once asked what would happen to man during the Kali Yuga when there would be so much trouble in the world. The Holy utterance of Lord Shiva was that he would manifest in the Kali Yuga to uplift the world and liberate those who turn to God. Shiva now lives among us in Shri Babaji, who is doing the services for mankind now from Herakhan Vishwa Mahadham.\\" The Teachings of Babaji. 30 October 1982. One of the central tenets of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings is the message of Karma Yoga or hard work. In the context of Kali Yuga Haidakhan Babaji explained: \\"As I have told you before, the thing needed in this Age is work (karma). In every Age people have reached salvation through different types of action and sadhana (spiritual discipline), but in this Age one can reach liberation only through hard work. I want real, practical human beings and only he is a true human being who lives in accordance with this Age. We need not consider religion or caste, but look only to hard work.\\"The Teachings of Babaji. 21 March 1983. In Sikhism In Sikhism, Kali Yuga is metaphorically used to describe the state of the world as was commonly understood in the 16th century. It is stressed that one should meditate as much as possible to reach the state of mukti and be liberated or be one with God. Guru Granth Sahib on Ang:1185 says: Other usage The Kali Yuga is an important concept in both Theosophy and Anthroposophy, and in the writings of Helena Blavatsky, W.Q. Judge, Rudolf Steiner, and Traditionalist philosophers such as Ren√© Gu√©non and Julius Evola, among others. Rudolf Steiner believed that the Kali Yuga ended in 1900.

It is mostly used to describe one of the four dharmic ages - Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga or Kali Yuga -, or a cycle of the four ages, Chatur YugaA kalpa is described as lasting 1,000 catur-yuga in Bhagavata Purana 12.4.2 (\\"catur-yuga\\") and Bhagavad Gita 8.17 (\\"yuga\\") : . Depending on context, it can refer to one of the seasons, generations, reigns, kalpas (days of Brahma), stages of creation (manifest, maintain, unmanifest), or 1,000 year periods. Etymology The archaic form of the Sanskrit word \\"yuga\\" is \\"yug\\". Other forms are \\"yugam\\", \\"yugƒÅnƒÅ·πÉ\\" and \\"yuge\\". In latin language, \\"juga\\", or \\"jug\\", is used from \\"jugum\\", meaning \\"yoke\\", used to connect two oxen (e.g. cali-juga = kali-yuga). The word \\"yuga\\", as well as \\"yoga\\", is derived from , believed to be derived from proto-Indo-European language yeug, 'to join or unite'hypothetical source of yeug.. Yuga characteristics There are a total of four yugas: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga, each having 1/4th less duration and dharma than the previous (Satya most, Kali least). The descending yugas see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, lifespan, emotional and physical strength. Within a yuga are Sandhis, or a starting Sandhya and ending Sandhyansa, both lasting 1/10th the main part of the yuga. Most of the characteristic changes can occur in these Sandhyas and Sandhyansas, especially if that change is from Kali Yuga to Satya Yuga (two extremes). * Satya Yuga (Krita Yuga, \\"the age of truth\\", or \\"hindu golden age\\"): the first and best yuga. It is the age of truth and perfection. This yuga has no crime, and all humans are kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga is so named because humans are long living, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas are one. All mankind can attain to supreme blessedness. There is no agriculture or mining, as the earth yields those riches on its own. Weather is pleasant, and everyone is happy. There is no disease, decrepitude, or fear of anything. Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature is 21 cubits (33 ft, 6 inches). Average human lifespan is 400 years. * Treta Yuga: this is the second yuga in chronological order. \\"Treta\\" means the \\"third\\", there are 3 quarter virtues or truth, and 1 quarter sin or untruth. In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished, compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent. There are 3 quarter virtues and 1 quarter sin. Normal human stature is 14 cubits (22 ft, 4 inches). Average human lifespan is 300 years. * Dvapara Yuga: this is the third yuga in order. \\"Dvapara\\" means \\"two\\"/\\"second, there are 2 quarter virtues or truth and 2 quarter sin or untruth. In this age, people become tainted with qualities, and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries. There are 1 half virtue and 1 half sin. Normal human stature is 7 cubits (11 ft, 2 inches). Average human lifespan is 200 years. * Kali Yuga: the final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following dharma, and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse, and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost, and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. There is 1 quarter virtue, and 3 quarter sins. Normal human stature is 3.5 cubits (5 ft, 3 inches). Average human lifespan is 100 years.

In 2020, Telemark merged with the former county of Vestfold to form the county of Vestfold og Telemark. Telemark borders the traditional regions and former counties of Vestfold, Buskerud, Hordaland, Rogaland and Aust-Agder. The various geographic sub-regions of Telemark have distinct cultural traditions in terms of dialect, music, clothing, handcrafts, food, and architecture. The name Telemark means the \\"mark of the Thelir\\", the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now known as Upper Telemark in the Migration Period and the Viking Age. In the Middle Ages, the agricultural society of Upper Telemark was considered the most violent region of Norway. Today, half of the buildings from medieval times in Norway are located here. The dialects spoken in Upper Telemark also retain more elements of Old Norse than those spoken elsewhere in the country. Upper Telemark is also known as the birthplace of skiing. The southern part of Telemark, Grenland, is more urban and influenced by trade with the Low Countries, northern Germany, Denmark and the British Isles. Telemark has been one of Norway's most important industrial regions for centuries, marked in particular by the Norske Skog Union paper mills in Grenland and the Norsk Hydro heavy water and fertilizer production in Upper Telemark.  History  The 13th century Eidsborg Stave Church in L√•rdal, Upper Telemark Summer landscape in Vinje, Upper Telemark Winter landscape in Upper Telemark Telemark county was established as the fief Bratsberg in the late Middle Ages, during Norway's union with Denmark. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1662 it became a county, and it was renamed Telemark in 1919 and was a county until 2020. The county administration was in the port town Skien, which was in the early modern period Norway's most important city, ahead of Christiania. Telemark consists of several distinct historical regions. It takes its name from the largest of them, which is now called Upper Telemark, but which was historically simply called Telemark. Telemark is named for the Thelir (√ûilir in Old Norse), the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now known as Upper Telemark since the Migration Period and during the Viking Age. The Norse form of the name was √ûelam«´rk. The first element is the genitive plural case of √ûilir while the last element is m«´rk \\"woodland, borderland, march\\". Traditional Telemark, i.e. Upper Telemark, is located in the inland and comprises more than two thirds of it according to its traditional definition. Both in medieval times and later (Upper) Telemark was the region of Norway with the most self-owning farmers.Hans Jacob Orning, \\"Et lokalt maktspill\\", Norgeshistorie.no, 28 November 2016 It retained Norse culture to a larger degree than any other region in Norway, with respect to its more egalitarian organisation of society, religion, traditional values and language. Thus the people of Telemark were often described during the Middle Ages and early modern era as the most violent in Norway.Hans Jacob Orning, \\"De voldelige telemarksb√∏ndene\\", Norgeshistorie.no, 28 November 2016 The dialects of Upper Telemark are also the dialects of Norwegian that are closest to Old Norse. The farmers of Telemark were marked by a strong-willed conservatism and belief in their traditional values that often defied the central authorities of Denmark-Norway; for example they held on to aspects of both Old Norse religion and later of Catholicism longer than other regions in Norway. (Upper) Telemark traditionally lacks cities entirely. Grenland and the Skien fjord are flatter regions located closer to or at the coast. Historically Grenland referred to what is now called Midt-Telemark, but over time the name Grenland has come to refer to the Skien fjord area. The latter is traditionally characterized by its cities and its involvement in seafaring and trade. It also includes several larger agricultural properties and estates, as well as industry. The culture and social structure are more urban, far less traditional, more influenced by contact with continental Europe and far less egalitarian. The most important city of the region, Skien, was historically one of Norway's most important cities, although its importance declined after the Napoleonic Wars. The playwright Henrik Ibsen was a native of Skien, and many of his plays are set in places reminiscent of the city and area. During the Dano-Norwegian union the traditional regions of Telemark and Grenland/the Skien fjord became the fief (len) and later county (amt) of Bratsberg (Bradsberg). The fief and county was named after the farm Bratsberg, since this was the seat of the governor. In 1919 Bratsberg county was renamed Telemark. Despite this, Grenland retains a separate identity that is distinct from Telemark proper; the minority in the Storting voted for the name Grenland‚ÄìTelemark in 1918. (Upper) Telemark, particularly Kviteseid, is known as the birthplace of skiing as a modern sport. Telemark lent its name to Telemark skiing, a style invented by Sondre Norheim, and the characteristic Telemark landing of ski jumping. Telemark is also known as the centre of the Bunad movement. Telemark has more buildings from medieval times than any other Norwegian region. Geography Nisser Lake in Nissedal is Telemark's largest lake at 76 km2. Telemark is located in southeastern Norway, extending from the Hardangervidda mountain plateau in the North to the Skagerrak coast in the South. Telemark has a varied and scenic landscape, including a rugged coastline, valleys, lakes, hills mountains, and mountain plateaus.  Infrastructure  The international road E18 goes through the southern parts of Telemark, namely Grenland and the municipality of Krager√∏. E134, another important motorway and the fastest route between Oslo and Bergen, goes through the municipalities of Vinje, Tokke, Kviteseid, Seljord, Hjartdal and Notodden. RV36, stretching from Porsgrunn to Seljord, links the E18 and E134 motorways. Telemark is well served by railways. The S√∏rlandet Line runs through the traditional districts of Vestmar and Midt-Telemark, serving the municipalities of Drangedal, Nome, B√∏ and Sauherad. Grenland is primarily served by the Vestfold Line, but also has connections through the Bratsberg Line which runs between Skien and Notodden. From Langesund, Fjordline operates ferry services to Sweden and Denmark. The main bus lines in the region are operated by Telemark Bilruter, serving western and middle parts of the region, and Nettbuss which serves the middle, eastern and southern parts of the region. Drangedal Bilruter serves the Vestmar region. Population The largest population centres are Skien, Porsgrunn, Notodden, Rjukan and Krager√∏. Other important places are B√∏, Seljord, Fyresdal and Vinje. Coat-of-arms The coat-of-arms is from modern times (1970). It shows an old type of battle axe, significant for the county.

Road in the village of Treungen (Nissedal). The county is conventionally divided into traditional districts. Traditionally the county is mainly divided into Upper Telemark (historically called simply Telemark or more recently Telemark proper) and Grenland. Upper Telemark is sometimes subdivided into Vest-Telemark and Aust-Telemark. The name Lower Telemark traditionally refers to Grenland and Midt-Telemark, but was more of an administrative region than a cultural one. Regardless of definition, Upper Telemark constitutes the largest part by far. For example, the modern provostship of Upper Telemark comprises 12 municipalities and more than 80% of Telemark, also including Midt-Telemark. An additional district, Vestmar is disputed. The district borders of this county are highly overlapping and to a certain extent undefined and/or disputed.  Municipalities  { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - bgcolor=\\"pink\\" ! Rank ! Name !

Flaherty about life on the Aran Islands off the western coast of Ireland. It portrays characters living in premodern conditions, documenting their daily routines such as fishing off high cliffs, farming potatoes where there is little soil, and hunting for huge basking sharks to get liver oil for lamps. Some situations are fabricated, such as one scene in which the shark fishermen are almost lost at sea in a sudden gale. Additionally, the family members shown are not actually related, having been chosen from among the islanders for their photogenic qualities. George Stoney's 1978 documentary How the Myth was Made, which is included in the special features of the DVD, relates that the Aran Islanders had not hunted sharks in this way for over fifty years at the time the film was made. Man of Aran is Flaherty's recreation of culture on the edges of modern society, even though much of the primitive life depicted had been left behind by the 1930s. It is impressive, however, for its drama, for its spectacular cinematography of landscape and seascape, and for its concise editing. Plot Man has to fight for his existence in the Aran Islands. Three men, among them \\"A Man of Aran\\", land a flimsy currach in the midst of high winds and huge waves with help from \\"His Wife\\" and \\"Their Son\\". The Man and his Wife work to make a field on the barren rocks using seaweed and soil scraped out of rock crevices. The Man fixes a hole in his boat with a mixture of cloth and tar. His Son sits on the edge of a cliff and uses a crab he caught earlier as bait to catch a fish in the water below. The Man, working with four other fishermen in a slightly larger boat than before, harpoons a giant basking shark. They lose that one after a fight and later spend two days wearing another one down before they can bring it back to shore. The whole village comes down to the beach to either watch or to help drag the carcass out of the water. The Wife renders the shark's liver to get oil for the lamps on the island. More sharks are still passing by on their migration, so the local fishermen head back out to sea, even though the weather looks like it might turn. No one will take the Son with them. There is a storm, and the Wife and Son can only watch from shore while the Man and his two shipmates struggle to get their boat to land safely against the elements. Everyone is reunited, but the Man's boat is crushed by the waves and rocks. The family turns and makes their way back to their cottage. Cast * Colman 'Tiger' King as A Man of Aran * Maggie Dirrane as His Wife * Michael Dillane as Their Son * Pat Mullen as Shark Hunter * Patch 'Red Beard' Ruadh as Shark Hunter * Patcheen Faherty as Shark Hunter * Tommy O'Rourke as Shark Hunter * 'Big Patcheen' Conneely of the West as Canoeman * Stephen Dirrane as Canoeman * Pat McDonough as Canoeman Production Stung by criticism that British films were flaccid imitations of Hollywood, Michael Balcon of Gaumont British hired the acclaimed writer/director Robert Flaherty and his wife Frances (Nanook of the North (1922), Moana (1926), Elephant Boy (1937), The Land (1942), Louisiana Story (1948)) to prove the British film industry‚Äôs cultural excellence as well as commercial success. In 1931, Robert Flaherty set up a studio and laboratory facilities on Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands.Calder-Marshall Flaherty had promised Balcon he could shoot the entire film for ¬£10,000.Croft, Thomas Andrew, Balcon's Folly, the manufacture and assessment of Man of Aran Over the next two years, he shot over 200,000 feet of film for a 74-minute documentary, oftentimes filming the same event time after time.Calder-Marshall As Flaherty says, \\"our films are made with film and time, I need lots of both.\\" Leacock, Richard; On Working With Robert and Frances Flaherty April 26, 1990 Balcon eventually called a halt to filming as the costs approached ¬£40,000.O‚ÄôBrien Like most 1930s documentaries, Man of Aran was shot as a silent film.Russell Patrick, Sight and Sound 21.5 (May 2011) The intermittent voices, the sound effects, and music are only accompaniments to the visuals and not considered integral to the production.Barsam Paul Rotha in Documentary Film says, ‚ÄúMan of Aran avoided all important issues raised by sound.‚Äù Flaherty continued to experiment with cinematography especially the long focal lens that he first used in Nanook. He used a variety of lens sizes, even a seventeen-inch long lens, which was twice the size of the camera.Barsam He used a spring driven camera that ‚Äúwas simpler in operation than any I have seen and not much heavier to carry than a portable typewriter.‚ÄùBarsam, Richard, Nonfiction Film: A Critical History, IUP 1992 Release and initial reception On 25 April 1934, Man of Aran premiered at the New Gallery in London. The screening had been preceded by a major publicity drive. A stuffed basking shark was put on display in the window of Gaumont British in Wardour Street, and Irish Guards played Irish folk music in the theater foyer on the first night. The islanders were brought over from Aran and paraded before the press and public in their simple homespun island garb. Man of Aran won top prize for the best foreign film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, the Mussolini Cup.McLoone During the first six months of its release the film grossed about ¬£50,000; many films had grossed more, but according to Michael Balcon it brought Gaumont British the prestige he wanted.Calder-Marshall When it opened in Dublin on 6 May 1934, Man of Aran was a major political and cultural event to the nascent Irish Free State and was attended by the charismatic √âamon de Valera.Blake, Martin: A Critical Study of the Implications of the Problem of Reality in the Documentary Film: University of Southern California, Dissertations Publishing, 1972. The Irish government saw it as confirmation of their social and economic policies and so enthusiastically received the film. Man of Aran suited Fianna F√°il, as it encouraged an image of Ireland that was fiercely traditional, definitively rural, and resilient in the face of hardship.O'Brien The film's depiction of man's courage and repudiation of the intellect also appealed to the Nazis, who raved over it during the Berlin Festival in 1935.McLoon As written by Luke Gibbons, this portrayal of the harsh life on the west coast of Ireland was often taken to heart by those who viewed it. Some critics believed Man of Aran socially irrelevant. Instead of returning with a film about Island poverty and an indictment of the absentee landlord, they claim Flaherty brought back a film about dewy-eyed urchins.Corliss Grierson argues that Flaherty‚Äôs 'NeoRousseauism', the glorification of a simpler and more primitive way of life, meant he could not develop a form adequate to the more immediate material in the modern world.Tagg, John; The Disciplinary Frame: Photographic Truths and the Capture of Meaning UMP 2009 Paul Rotha faulted Man of Aran for its alleged avoidance of economic and social reality.Barsam At the time of Man of Aran‚Äôs release, socialist critic Ralph Bond commented ‚Äú‚Ä¶we are more concerned with what Flaherty has left out than with what he has put in‚Ä¶Flaherty would have us believe that there is no class struggle on Aran despite ample evidence to the contrary.‚ÄùBond, \\"Man of Aran Reviewed,\\" Cinema Quarterly, II, No. 4 Summer, 1934 It is claimed that Flaherty ignored the effects of such worldwide events as the depression of the 1930s, suggesting to the audience that the Aran Islands were isolated economically as they were geographically.Barsam Subsequent analysis and criticism The current reputation of Man of Aran rests as much on controversies over truth and accuracy as on its aesthetic achievement.McLoone, Martin; The Cinema of Britain and Ireland, ed McFarlane, Wallflower Press 2005 Some contend that Man of Aran is more valuable as a documentary of Robert Flaherty‚Äôs vision of life than it is of life itself.O'Brien, Harvey; The Real Ireland: The Evolution of Ireland in Documentary Film. MUP Others see it as a betrayal of documentary‚Äôs mission, ‚Äúto tell it like it is‚Äù.MacBean, James Roy: Two Laws from Australia, One White One Black, Film Quarterly Spring 1983, Vol 36, No.3 And yet, according to Richard Barsam, Flaherty is one of the great innovators of the documentary form‚Ä¶creating a nonfiction genre all of his own.Barsam, R: The Vision of Robert Flaherty, The Artist as Myth and Filmmaker; Indiana Press 1988 According to anthropologist John Messenger, there are over 100 factual errors in the film.Barsam Among the more notable is the shark-hunting sequence, which dominates the latter half of the story. Kimball says this practice had disappeared so long ago that the islanders didn't know how to make or use the harpoons and had to be taught the skills of the hunt.Kimball, S.T: American Anthropologist, Vol 79, No3 Messenger, who visited Islands between 1958 and 1968, goes further, claiming that the islanders never had engaged in shark hunting then, or at any time in the past. Flaherty brought fishermen from Scotland to teach the locals how it is done. ‚ÄúFlaherty...created new customs, such as shark fishing, and seriously distorted numerous indigenous ones in order to make the Man of Aran fit his preconceptions and titillate the camera.‚ÄùMessenger, John C: Visual Anthropology 2001, Vo 14, 343, 368 Flaherty himself admits the shark fishing sequence was needed for the box-office.Hockings Paul, American Anthropologist, Vol 109, No.1 However, the claim is not correct as whale and shark fishing were both known and commercial up until much more recent times. Arranmore Whaling Co. 1908-1913; Blacksod Whaling Co. 1910‚Äì1914; Akties Nordhavet Co.(Northern Seas) / Blacksod Whaling Co 1920‚Äì1922 only 11 years not hundreds as claimed in critique, and only 11 years back whaling was occurring on a commercial scale.https://www.marinetours.ie/wildlife-log/64-captain- whalesgalore-wonderful-winter-wildlife-log.html Other claims of falsehoods include creating the Aran family who were unrelated cast members handpicked by Flaherty to play the roles of mother, father, and son.Winston B, \\"How the Myth Was Deconstructed\\", Wide Angle, Volume 21, Number 2, March 1999, pp. 71-86 In another sequence, Flaherty shows the mother buffeted by a storm as she carries seaweed along the Inishmore cliffs. What appears to be a traditional activity carried out by Aran women is a fabrication.The seaweed is collected for fertilization and is gathered from the low-lying shores twice per month, and only when the tides are absolutely calm.Messenger And Kimball points out that religion, which is rooted in the islanders lives, even among the locally recruited actors, is entirely absent.Kimball Flaherty also exposed the islanders to great risk, asking them to perform the most astonishing feats in stormy seas despite the fact none of the islanders could swim.Calder-Marshall, The innocent eye; The life of Robert Flaherty. Pelican 1963 As Flaherty says, ‚Äúlooking back I should have been shot for what I asked these superb people to do for the film...for the enormous risks...and all for the sake of a keg of porter and five pound a piece.‚ÄùCalder- Marshall The full extent of Man of Aran‚Äôs deceptions was revealed at the 1978 Ethnographic Film Conference in Canberra, Australia.MacBean, James Roy: Two Laws from Australia, One White One Black, Film Quarterly Spring 1983, Vol 36, No.3 The conference had gathered, in part, to praise direct cinema which, in contrast to the classic tradition, promised a new level of realistic interpretation.MacBean This new form swept away staging and reconstruction to present a more accurate picture of the world.Winston The debate was touched off by a screening of Flaherty‚Äôs Man of Aran followed by George Stoney‚Äôs just completed documentary exploration of Robert Flaherty‚Äôs Man of Aran, How the Myth Was Made, and the resulting exchange was ‚Äútumultuous‚Äù.MacBean As James Roy MacBean says: ‚ÄúWhile appreciative of Flaherty‚Äôs poetic imagery [George Stoney] had popped the lid off all the distortions and omissions in Flaherty‚Äôs highly romanticized depiction of life on the Aran Islands.‚ÄùMacBean At the time, Stoney‚Äôs revelatory documentary had left many at the conference incensed at what they now saw as Flaherty‚Äôs blatant falsification of the life he had been purported to be documenting.MacBean According to Barsam, ‚ÄúFlaherty‚Äôs subjective view of reality ‚Äì his making it all up ‚Äì has a romantic basis, idealizing the simple, natural even non-existent life.‚ÄùBarsam He argues that even though Flaherty habitually transforms reality, his essential achievement is that of the realist filmmaker.Barsam The idea of Flaherty as Romantic is shared by Aufderheide: ‚ÄúFlaherty had a powerful romantic belief in the purity of native cultures and he believed that his own culture was spiritually impoverished by comparison.‚ÄùAufderheide, P: Documentary Film, A Very Short Introduction, OUP 2007 Taken to the extreme, this approach makes no attempt to capture reality but create a romanticized picture of it: ‚ÄúThe tragedy is that, being a poet, with a poet's eye, Flaherty‚Äôs lie is greater, for he can make romance seem real.‚ÄùMontagu, Ivor, cited in Aufderheide Aufderheide says, ‚Äúdocumentary movies are about real life: they are not real life they are not even windows onto real life. They are portraits of real life, using real life as their raw material...You might then say: [a documentary] is a movie that does its best to represent real life and that doesn‚Äôt manipulate it...and yet, there is no way to make a film without manipulating the information.Auderheide As Flaherty acknowledges, ‚Äúone often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit.‚ÄùBarsam How much a documentarian can manipulate and still credibly claim their film to be a truthful portrayal of real life ‚Äúis a never-ending discussion with many answers.‚ÄùAuderheide Despite these controversies, Flaherty remains a pioneer of the documentary whose films are situated in a class of their own within the documentary genre.Malcolm, Derek; Nanook of the North, The Guardian, April 2000. Kimball argues that Man of Aran never was intended to be an ethnographic documentary film. As he explains, ‚Äúin a cosmic anthropological sense it could be counted as an artistic rendition of the struggle of man against nature.‚ÄùKimball Flaherty had immersed himself in the culture to tell the essence of the truth about the Islanders, ‚Äú[and] for this reason ethnographic accuracy is an unimportant consideration when the larger goal is some fundamental aspect of mankind.‚ÄùKimball In Stoney‚Äôs film How the Myth Was Made, John Goldman, the editor on Man of Aran, is emphatic, ‚Äúit was not a documentary, it was not intended to be a documentary...it was a piece of poetry.‚ÄùStoney, George, How the Myth Was Made: A Study of Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran (1978) McNab calls it \\"not so much a conventional documentary as a poetic meditation.‚ÄùMcNab, G, Sight and Sound, Dec 2006 Arthur Calder-Marshall explains, ‚ÄúFlaherty wasn‚Äôt interested in actuality, he was interested in his own idea of life.‚ÄùCalder-Marshall If the film was intended to be a poetic statement instead of a factual documentary, one has no right to treat it as an ethnographic film now.Hockings Barsam asks, is it unreasonable for the artist to distill life over a period of time and deliver only the essence of it? Seen as the story of mankind over a thousand years, the story of Aran is this story of man against the sea...It is a simple story, but it is an essential story, for nothing emerges from time except bravery.Barsam Calder-Marshall suggests the controversies over Man of Aran could have been avoided if [Flaherty] had had a publicity adviser, someone as verbally agile as Grierson, who had made it publicly plain that Man of Aran was not a ‚Äòdocument‚Äô but an ‚Äòeclogue‚Äô - a pastoral and marine poem.Calder-Marshall Brian Winston cautions against unconditionally praising Flaherty‚Äôs poetic talent. He argues we have to acknowledge his manipulations and distortions because that is at the heart of understanding both his genius and his contribution to the documentary form.Winston What Flaherty grasped was not only our desire for drama, but that it should arise from the life being observed and not imposed from without.Winston By using drama and reconstruction, Flaherty created a unique form of documentary, which thrives between ‚Äúa life as lived and life as narrativised.‚ÄùWinston Artistic legacy Richard Leacock, who went to school with the Flaherty's daughters and later worked as the cinematographer on Louisiana Story, says that Flaherty taught him to concentrate on finding images: ‚ÄúYou look, you search. You think of the image not merely as a way of showing something but also as a way of withholding information, of creating tension in the viewer. Of not revealing too much. Of seeing things with different perspectives by using different focal-length lenses.‚ÄùLeacock, Richard; On Working With Robert and Frances Flaherty April 26, 1990 Flaherty says he owes almost everything to these long lenses and with them captured some of the most memorable sea footage ever recorded.Barsam Corliss says Man of Aran was very different from his earlier work, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the chiaroscuro compositions, charcoal rock, black-clad figures against a gray sky, are light- years removed from the natural grandeur of Nanook of the North or the easy elegance of Moana.Corliss, R; The Man in the Iron Myth, Film comment, Nov-Dec 1973 Corliss suggests there are enough similarities between Flaherty and John Ford, Chaplin, Borzage, even Disney that place him firmly in a tradition of the romantic visionary American.Corliss Winston sees the influence of Flaherty in Leni Riefenstahl films, arguing that her aesthetics of manipulation owed much to his pioneering work.Winston McLoon goes further, suggesting ‚Äúthe cult of beauty, and fetishism of courage‚Äù in Man of Aran are the tropes of Fascism. He goes on to exonerate Flaherty of any Nazi connection saying ‚Äúit is a measure of the apolitical nature of Flaherty‚Äôs vision that he was unaware of this problem inherent in his nineteenth-century primitive sensibility.‚ÄùMcLoon The Cripple of Inishmaan (1996) by Martin McDonagh is a play set on the Aran Islands at the time of the filming of Man of Aran. The UK rock band British Sea Power was asked to record a new soundtrack for the film's 2009 DVD release, performing the score at a series of live events in the UK including one accompanying the film itself at the British Film Institute.British Sea Power Soundtrack. 'Man of Aran' nears release, ClashMusic.com, 23 January 2009. Accessed online 8 April 2009. Flaherty's legacy is the subject of the 2010 British Universities Film & Video Council award-winning and FOCAL International award-nominated documentary A Boatload of Wild Irishmen (so named because, after the staged climactic sequence of Man of Aran, Flaherty said he'd been accused of \\"trying to drown a boatload of wild Irishmen\\"), written by Professor Brian Winston of University of Lincoln, UK, and directed by Mac Dara √ì Curraidh√≠n.

Human evolution has primarily occurred in small groups, as opposed to mass societies, and people naturally maintain a social network. In popular culture, tribalism may also refer to a way of thinking or behaving in which people are loyal to their social group above all else,Definition of \\"Tribalism\\". Macmillan Dictionary. 2018. or, derogatorily, a type of discrimination or animosity based upon group differences.\\"Tribalism\\". Merriam- Webster Dictionary. 2018.  Definition  The word \\"tribe\\" can be defined to mean an extended kin group or clan with a common ancestor, or can also be described as a group with shared interests, lifestyles and habits. The proverb \\"birds of a feather flock together\\" describes homophily, the human tendency to form friendship networks with people of similar occupations, interests, and habits. Some tribes can be located in geographically proximate areas, like villages or bands, though telecommunications enables groups of people to form digital tribes using tools like social networking websites. In terms of conformity,Dictionary definitions of Tribalism: * Definition of tribalism ‚Äì Oxford dictionary; * Definition of tribalism ‚Äì Macmillan dictionary; * Definition of tribalism ‚Äì Merriam-Webster dictionary tribalism has been defined as a \\"subjectivity\\" or \\"way of being\\" social frame in which communities are bound socially beyond immediate birth ties by the dominance of various modalities of face-to-face and object integration. Ontologically, tribalism is oriented around the valences of analogy, genealogy and mythology. That means that customary tribes have their social foundations in some variation of these tribal orientations, while often taking on traditional practices (e.g. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), and modern practices, including monetary exchange, mobile communications, and modern education.James, Paul; et al., Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea (2012) pdf  Social structure  The social structure of a tribe can vary greatly from case to case, but the relatively small size of customary tribes makes social life of such tribes usually involve a relatively undifferentiated role structure, with few significant political or economic distinctions between individuals. A tribe often refers to itself using its own language's word for \\"people\\", and refers to other, neighboring tribes with various epithets. For example, the term \\"Inuit\\" translates to \\"people\\".  Types  Tribalism implies the possession of a strong cultural or ethnic identity that separates one member of a group from the members of another group. Based on strong relations of proximity and kinship, members of a tribe tend to possess a strong feeling of identity. Objectively, for a customary tribal society to form there needs to be ongoing customary organization, enquiry and exchange. However, intense feelings of common identity can lead people to feel tribally connected. The distinction between these two definitions for tribalism, objective and subjective, is an important one because while tribal societies have been pushed to the edges of the Western world, tribalism, by the second definition, is arguably undiminished. A few writers have postulated that the human brain is hard-wired towards tribalism by its evolutionary advantages, but that claim is usually linked to equating original questions of sociality with tribalism.  Concept evolution  Tribalism has a very adaptive effect in human evolution. Humans are social animals and ill-equipped to live on their own. Tribalism and social bonding help to keep individuals committed to the group, even when personal relations may fray. That keeps individuals from wandering off or joining other groups. It also leads to bullying when a tribal member is unwilling to conform to the politics of the collective. Some scholars argue that inclusive fitness in humans involves kin selection and kin altruism, in which groups of an extended family with shared genes help others with similar genes, based on their coefficient of relationship (the amount of genes they have in common). Other scholars argue that fictive kinship is common in human organizations, allowing non-kin members to collaborate in groups like fraternities. Socially, divisions between groups fosters specialized interactions with others, based on association: altruism (positive interactions with unrelated members), kin- selectivity (positive interactions with related members) and violence (negative interactions). Thus, groups with a strong sense of unity and identity can benefit from kin selection behaviour such as common property and shared resources. The tendencies of members to unite against an outside tribe and the ability to act violently and prejudicially against that outside tribe likely boosted the chances of survival in genocidal conflicts. Modern examples of tribal genocide rarely reflect the defining characteristics of tribes existing prior to the Neolithic Revolution; for example, small population and close-relatedness. According to a study by Robin Dunbar at the University of Liverpool, social group size is determined by primate brain size. Dunbar's conclusion was that most human brains can really understand only an average of 150 individuals as fully developed, complex people. That is known as Dunbar's number. In contrast, anthropologist H. Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth have done a variety of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties, 290, roughly double Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard‚ÄìKillworth median of 231 is lower because of upward straggle in the distribution, but it is still appreciably larger than Dunbar's estimate.H. Russell Bernard. \\"Honoring Peter Killworth's contribution to social network theory.\\" Paper presented to the University of Southampton, 28 September 2006. Malcolm Gladwell expanded on this conclusion sociologically in his book, The Tipping Point, where members of one of his types, Connectors, were successful by their larger-than-average number of close friendships and capacity for maintaining them, which tie together otherwise-unconnected social groups. According to such studies, then, \\"tribalism\\" is hard to escape fact of human neurology simply because many human brains are not adapted to working with large populations. Once a person's limit for connection is reached, the human brain resorts to some combination of hierarchical schemes, stereotypes and other simplified models to understand so many people.  Negative outcomes  Anthropologists engage in ongoing debate on the phenomenon of warfare among tribes. While fighting typically and certainly occurs among horticultural tribes, an open question remains whether such warfare is a typical feature of hunter-gatherer life or is an anomaly found only in certain circumstances, such as scarce resources (as with the Inuit or Arabs) or only among food- producing societies. Tribes use forms of subsistence such as horticulture and foraging that cannot yield the same number of absolute calories as agriculture. That limits tribal populations significantly, especially when compared to agricultural populations. Jesse Mathis writes in War Before Civilization that examples exist with low percentage rates of casualties in tribal battle, and some tribal battles were much more lethal as a percentage of population than, for example, the Battle of Gettysburg. He concludes that no evidence consistently indicates that primitive battles are proportionately less lethal than civilized ones. The realistic conflict theory is a model of intergroup conflict, arguing that in a real or perceived zero-sum system, conflicts arise over shared interests for finite resources. The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment involved researchers putting 12-year old boys into groups, where they formed their own ingroups, before then developing hostility and negativity towards the other group during simulated conflict over finite resources in a zero-sum game.

Humanitarianism is today primarily understood as voluntary emergency aid in a transnational context, but it overlaps with human rights advocacy, actions taken by governments, development assistance, and domestic philanthropy. Other critical issues include the correlation with religious beliefs; the motivation of aid between the poles of altruism and social control; market affinity; imperialism and neo-colonialism; gender and class relations; and the types of humanitarian agencies and endeavours that characterise different epochs. p. 3 A practitioner is known as a humanitarian. An informal ideology Humanitarianism is an informal ideology of practice; it is \\"the doctrine that people's duty is to promote human welfare.\\" Humanitarianism is based on a view that all human beings deserve respect and dignity and should be treated as such. Therefore, humanitarians work towards advancing the well-being of humanity as a whole. It is the antithesis of the \\"us vs. them\\" mentality that characterizes tribalism and ethnic nationalism. Humanitarians abhor slavery, violation of basic and human rights, and discrimination on the basis of features such as skin colour, religion, ancestry, or place of birth. Humanitarianism drives people to save lives, alleviate suffering, and promote human dignity in the middle of man-made or natural disasters. Humanitarianism is embraced by movements and people across the political spectrum. The informal ideology can be summed up by a quote from Albert Schweitzer: \\"Humanitarianism consists in never sacrificing a human being to a purpose.\\" A universal doctrine Jean Pictet, in his commentary on The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, argues for the universal characteristics of humanitarianism: :The wellspring of the principle of humanity is in the essence of social morality which can be summed up in a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot. Historical examples and periodization Historically, humanitarianism was publicly seen in the social reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s, following the economic turmoil of the Industrial Revolution in England. Many of the women in Great Britain who were involved with feminism during the 1900s also pushed humanitarianism. The atrocious hours and working conditions of children and unskilled laborers were made illegal by pressure on Parliament by humanitarians. The Factory Act of 1833 and the Factory Act of 1844 were some of the most significant humanitarian bills passed in Parliament following the Industrial Revolution. In the middle of the 19th century, humanitarianism was central to the work of Florence Nightingale and Henry Dunant in emergency response and in the latter case led to the founding of the Red Cross. The Humanitarian League (1891‚Äì1919), was an English advocacy group, formed by Henry S. Salt, which sought to advance the humanitarian cause. Various suggestions of distinct periods of humanitarianism exist, drawing either on geopolitical or socioeconomic factors that determine humanitarian action. The first approach is exemplified by Michael Barnett's proposition to distinguish ages of \\"imperial humanitarianism\\" (up to 1945), \\"neo- humanitarianism\\" (1945‚Äì1989), and \\"liberal humanitarianism\\". Norbert G√∂tz, Georgina Brewis, and Steffen Werther are advocates of the socioeconomic and cultural approach, arguing that there have been ages of \\"ad hoc humanitarianism\\" (up to c. 1900), \\"organized humanitarianism\\" (c. 1900‚Äì1970), and \\"expressive humanitarianism\\" (since 1970). They suggest we might currently be entering \\"a novel kind of defensive humanitarianism with roots in the expressive age, with automated interfaces, and with thick 'firewalls' between donors and recipients.\\" p. 307 Emergency response Today, humanitarianism is particularly used to describe the thinking and doctrines behind the emergency response to humanitarian crises. In such cases it argues for a humanitarian response based on humanitarian principles, particularly the principle of humanity. Nicholas de Torrente, Executive Director of MSF-USA writes: > \\"The most important principles of humanitarian action are humanity, > neutrality, independence and impartiality, which posits the conviction that > all people have equal dignity by virtue of their being human based solely on > need, without discrimination among recipients. Humanitarian organizations > must refrain from taking part in hostilities or taking actions that > advantage one side of the conflict over another, the ¬ßaction serves the > interests of political, religious, or other agendas. > > \\"These fundamental principles serve two essential purposes. They embody > humanitarian action‚Äôs single-minded purpose of alleviating suffering, > unconditionally and without any ulterior motive. They also serve as > background document to develop operational tools that help in obtaining both > the consent of communities for the presence and activities of humanitarian > organizations, particularly in highly volatile contexts. Digital humanitarianism Patrick Meier, first started using the term 'digital humanitarianism' after crowdmapping for the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2011, Paul Conneally gave a TED talk on digital humanitarianism in which he states that humanitarianism's \\"origins are firmly routed in the analogue age\\" with \\"a major shift coming\\". In 2015 he authored the book Digital Humanitarians: How Big Data Is Changing the Face of Humanitarian Response. Vincent Fevrier notes that \\"social media can benefit the humanitarian sector [...] by providing information to give better situational awareness to organisations for broad strategic planning and logistics\\" and that \\"crisis mapping really emerged in 2010 during the Haiti earthquake\\" with \\"software and digital humanitarian platforms such as Standby Task Force, OpenStreetMap, and many others\\" being active during many disasters since then. In fact, the role of social media in digital humanitarian efforts is a considerable one. Ten days after the 2010 earthquake, the \\"Hope for Haiti Now\\" telethon event was launched in the United States, effectively taking over the mediasphere and reaching hundreds of millions of households and viewers. It focused on appealing to the viewing public's empathy for the survivors of the disaster, allowing ordinary citizens to help in a collective relief effort by contributing money donations to NGOs providing Humanitarian aid to earthquake survivors. The telethon attracted support through a variety of celebrity musical performances and staged calls for empathy, using digital social networks to disseminate its appeal to the moral responsibility of the viewer- consumers who are able to reinforce identification with a national identity of the American 'savior' through participation in this Humanitarian project. During the summer of 2010, when open fires raged across Russia, causing many to die from smog inhalation, the use of social media allowed digital humanitarians to map the areas in need of support. This is because Russians who were hoping to be evacuated were posting online about the conditions they were in which prompted thousands of Russian bloggers to coordinate relief efforts online. The digital humanitarian efforts in Russia were crucial to responding to the fires in 2010 considering the Russian government was vastly unprepared to deal with such a large-scale disaster. Within digital humanitarianism, big data has featured strongly in efforts to improve digital humanitarian work and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. It has been argued that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which digital humanitarians claim both the formal humanitarian sector and victims of crises need the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians. Earlier in 2005, a question was raised as to whether Wikipedia can be seen as digital humanitarianism.

Telemark skiing is a skiing technique that combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing. Telemark skiing is named after the Telemark region of Norway, where the discipline originated. Sondre Norheim is often credited for first demonstrating the turn in ski races, which included cross country, slalom and jumping, in Norway around 1868. Sondre Norheim also experimented with ski and binding design, introducing side cuts to skis and heel bindings (like a cable).  History of Telemark skiing  = 19th and 20th centuries = In the 1800s skiers in Telemark challenged each other on \\"wild slopes\\" (ville l√•mir), more gentle slopes had the adjective \\"sla\\". Some races were on \\"bumpy courses\\" (kneikel√•m) and sometimes included \\"steep jumps\\" (spr√∏ytehopp) for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (\\"Telemark turn\\") on a field or icy lake.B√∏, Olav (1993). Skiing throughout history. Oslo: Samlaget. . Telemark skiing (colloquially referred to as \\"tele skiing\\" or tele-ing\\") was reborn in 1971 in the United States. Doug Buzzell, Craig Hall, Greg Dalbey, Jack Marcial and Rick Borcovec are credited with reintroducing the style after reading the book Come Ski With Me by Stein Eriksen. Telemark skiing gained popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. = Telemark skiing today = The appeal of Telemark skiing lies in access: long pieces of synthetic fabric, known as skins, can be attached to the bottom of the skis to allow travel uphill in the backcountry. With the invention of light-weight alpine touring (A.T.) skis, however, telemark skiing has decreased in popularity in the backcountry. Telemark skiing uses a specialized type of equipment. Generally, Telemark skiers use flexible Alpine skis with specially designed bindings that fix only the toe of the ski boot to the ski, thereby creating the \\"free heel\\". Oftentimes the heel is attached to the front of the binding by a hinged cable, which holds the ski boot firmly in the binding. These bindings are often non-releasable. Telemark racing Originally made popular as a mode of backcountry transportation, Telemark skiing is now a World Cup sport focused on carving. At its core, the Telemark discipline combines elements of Alpine racing, Nordic skate skiing, and ski jumping. World Cup Telemark is offered in a number of race formats, including Classic, Sprint Classic, and Parallel Sprint. A typical Classic Telemark race involves a jump that must be landed in a lunged position, a series of gates, a skate section, and a 360 degree banking turn known as the reipel√∏kke. Telemark Racing was governed by the International Telemark Federation (ITF) until 1995, when Telemark skiing was officially recognized by the Federation International de Ski Telemark committee (FIS). The first FIS Telemark World Championships were held at Hafjell, in Lillehammer, Norway. Today, Telemark Racing is organized by FIS and by national sport committees such as the United States Telemark Ski Association, and the British Telemark Ski Team. Olympic bid The FIS Telemark Committee have announced that their proposal for Telemark Parallel Sprint and Team Parallel Sprint is to be included in a FIS proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The proposal was approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS) at the Congress held in Costa Navarino (Greece) May 2018. However, in a July ruling, the IOC voted not to include the Telemark Parallel Sprint in the 2022 Beijing Games.

In 1940, subordinates of his led by Frank Rowlett broke Japan's PURPLE cipher, thus disclosing Japanese diplomatic secrets before America's entrance into World War II.  Early life  Friedman was born Wolf Friedman (, ), in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Bessarabia, the son of Frederick Friedman, a Jew from Bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the Russian Postal Service, and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant. Friedman's family fled Russia in 1892 to escape the virulent anti-Semitism there, ending up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\"William W. Friedman: Principal Cryptologist\\" Three years later, his first name was changed to William. As a child, Friedman was introduced to cryptography in the short story \\"The Gold-Bug\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. He studied at the Michigan Agricultural College (known today as Michigan State University) in East Lansing and received a scholarship to work on genetics at Cornell University. Meanwhile, George Fabyan, who ran a private research laboratory to study any personally interesting project, decided to set up his own genetics project and was referred to Friedman. Friedman joined Fabyan's Riverbank Laboratories outside Chicago in September 1915. As head of the Department of Genetics, one of the projects he ran studied the effects of moonlight on crop growth, and so he experimented with the planting of wheat during various phases of the moon.  Initial work in cryptology  William and Elizebeth Friedman, recently married, at Riverbank in 1917 Riverbank Laboratories Another of Fabyan's pet projects was research into secret messages which Sir Francis Bacon had allegedly hidden in various texts during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. The research was carried out by Elizabeth Wells Gallup. She believed that she had discovered many such messages in the works of William Shakespeare, and convinced herself that Bacon had written many, if not all, of Shakespeare's works. Friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects, and was asked to travel to England on several occasions to help Gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research. He became fascinated with the work as he courted Elizebeth Smith, Gallup's assistant and an accomplished cryptographer. They married, and he soon became director of Riverbank's Department of Codes and Ciphers as well as its Department of Genetics. During this time, Friedman wrote a series of 8 papers on cryptography, collectively known as the \\"Riverbank Publications\\", including the first description of the index of coincidence, an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis. With the entry of the United States into World War I, Fabyan offered the services of his Department of Codes and Ciphers to the government. No Federal department existed for this kind of work (although both the Army and Navy had had embryonic departments at various times), and soon Riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the US Government. During this period, the Friedmans broke a code used by German-funded Indian radicals in the US who planned to ship arms to India to gain independence from Britain. Analyzing the format of the messages, Riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort, a cryptographic technique common at the time. The Friedmans soon managed to decrypt most of the messages, but only long after the case had come to trial did the book itself come to light: a German-English dictionary published in 1880. W. F. Friedman in 1924  Signals Intelligence Service  The United States government decided to set up its own cryptological service, and sent Army officers to Riverbank to train under Friedman. To support the program, Friedman wrote a series of technical monographs, completing seven by early 1918. He then enlisted in the Army and went to France to serve as the personal cryptographer for General John J. Pershing. He returned to the US in 1920 and published an eighth monograph, \\"The Index of Coincidence and its Applications in Cryptography\\", considered by some to be the most important publication in modern cryptography to that time. His texts for Army cryptographic training were well thought of and remained classified for several decades. In 1921 he became chief cryptanalyst for the War Department and later led the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS)‚Äîa position he kept for a quarter century. In 1929, after The American Black Chamber in New York City was disbanded, its files were entrusted to SIS, and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the War Department. Friedman coined several terms, including \\"cryptanalysis\\", and wrote many monographs on cryptography. One of these (written mostly in his spare time) was the first draft of his Elements of cryptanalysis, which later was expanded to four volumes and became the U.S. Army's cryptographic main textbook and reference. Realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to SIS' work, Friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge. They were Solomon Kullback, Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov, each of whom went on to distinguished service for decades. In addition he also was finally able to hire a man fluent in Japanese, John Hurt. During this period Elizebeth Friedman continued her own work in cryptology, and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the Coast Guard and FBI during Prohibition.  Solution of cipher machines  Friedman with an AT&T; cipher machine During the 1920s, several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry. An early example was the Hebern Rotor Machine, designed in the US in 1915 by Edward Hebern. This system offered such security and simplicity of use that Hebern heavily promoted it to investors. Friedman realized that the new rotor machines would be important, and devoted some time to analyzing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features which allowed cracking of the generated code included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) at either end of the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine. SIGABA cipher machine Friedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks. The best of the lot was the SIGABA‚Äîwhich was destined to become the US's highest-security cipher machine in World War II after improvements by Frank Rowlett and Laurance Safford. Just over 10,000 were built. A patent on SIGABA was filed at the end of 1944, but kept secret until 2001, after Friedman had died, when it was finally issued as . In 1939, the Japanese introduced a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as \\"RED.\\" The new cipher, which SIS called \\"PURPLE\\", was different and much more difficult. The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS thought it might be related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges. Leo Rosen of SIS built a machine using ‚Äî as was later discovered ‚Äî the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen. Thus, by the end of 1940, SIS had constructed an exact analog of the PURPLE machine without ever having seen one. With the duplicate machines and an understanding of PURPLE, SIS could decrypt increasing amounts of Japanese traffic. One such intercept was the message to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., ordering an end (on December 7, 1941) to negotiations with the US. The message gave a clear indication of impending war, and was to have been delivered to the US State Department only hours prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy over whether the US had foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack has roiled well into the 21st century. In 1941, Friedman was hospitalized with a \\"nervous breakdown\\", widely attributed to the mental strain of his work on PURPLE. While he remained in hospital, a four-man team ‚Äî Abraham Sinkov and Leo Rosen from SIS, and Lt. Prescott Currier and Lt. Robert Weeks from the U.S. Navy's OP-20-G ‚Äî visited the British establishment at the \\"Government Code and Cypher School\\" at Bletchley Park. They gave the British a PURPLE machine, in exchange for details on the design of the Enigma machine and on how the British decrypted the Enigma cipher. However Friedman visited Bletchley Park in April 1943 and played a key role in drawing up the 1943 BRUSA Agreement.  National Security Agency  Bust of Friedman on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, where he is identified as the \\"Dean of American Cryptology\\". Following World War II, Friedman remained in government signals intelligence. In 1949 he became head of the cryptographic division of the newly formed Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the National Security Agency (NSA) when it was formed to take over from AFSA. Friedman produced a classic series of textbooks, \\"Military Cryptanalysis\\", which was used to train NSA students. (These were revised and extended, under the title \\"Military Cryptanalytics\\", by Friedman's assistant and successor Lambros D. Callimahos, and used to train many additional cryptanalysts.) During his early years at NSA, he encouraged it to develop what were probably the first super- computers, although he was never convinced a machine could have the \\"insight\\" of a human mind. Friedman spent much of his free time trying to decipher the famous Voynich Manuscript, said to be written sometime between 1403‚Äì1437. However, after four decades of study he finally had to admit defeat, contributing no more than an educated guess as to its origins and meaning. In 1955, Friedman initiated, on behalf of the NSA, a secret agreement with Crypto AG, a Swiss manufacturer of encryption machines. The agreement resulted in many of the company's machines being compromised, so that the messages produced by them became crackable by the NSA. Friedman retired in 1956 and, with his wife, turned his attention to the problem that had originally brought them together: examining Bacon's supposed codes. Together they wrote a book entitled The Cryptologist Looks at Shakespeare, which won a prize from the Folger Library and was published under the title The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined. The book demonstrated flaws in Gallup's work and in that of others who sought hidden ciphers in Shakespeare's work. At NSA's request Friedman prepared Six Lectures Concerning Cryptography and Cryptanalysis, which he delivered at NSA. But later the Agency, concerned about security, confiscated the reference materials from Friedman's home.  Death and legacy  Friedman's health began to fail in the late 1960s, and he died in 1969. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Friedman and his wife donated their archives to the library of the George C. Marshall Foundation, which also has had material reclassified and removed by the NSA. Friedman has been inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and there is a building named after William and Elizebeth at the NSA complex at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. He was also presented the Medal for Merit by President Harry Truman, and the National Security Medal by Dwight Eisenhower. Friedman and his wife Elizebeth are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. alt= Friedman has the distinction of having one of the longest known suppressed patent applications, for , a patent for a \\"cryptographic system\\". It was filed on July 25, 1933, issued on August 1, 2000.  Children  Friedman had two children with his wife, Elizebeth. Barbara Friedman (later Atchison) (born 1923), and John Ramsay Friedman (1926‚Äì2010).  In popular culture  Commander Schoen, a character appearing in Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon, is to a large extent inspired by Friedman. Schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with Friedman, including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army, breaking Japanese codes prior to Japan's involvement in World War II, and the psychological problems that he suffered from as a result. In his acknowledgements, Stephenson writes \\"Among all these great wartime hackers, some kind of special recognition must go to William Friedman, who sacrificed his health to break the Japanese machine cipher called Purple before the war even began.\\"  Awards and honors  * 1944: Commendation for Exceptional Civilian Service * 1946: Medal for Merit * 1955: National Security Medal.

He was succeeded by Edvard Bene≈°.  Wartime  In September 1938 the Sudetenland was occupied by German forces and Masaryk resigned as ambassador in protest, although he remained in London. Other government members including Bene≈° also resigned. In March 1939 Germany occupied the remaining parts of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and a puppet Slovak state was established in Slovakia. When a Czechoslovak government-in-exile was established in Britain in 1940, Masaryk was appointed Foreign Minister. During the war he regularly made broadcasts over the BBC to occupied Czechoslovakia. Foreword by Madeleine Albright. He had a flat at Westminster Gardens, Marsham Street in London but often stayed at the Czechoslovak Chancellery residence at Wingrave or with President Bene≈° at Aston Abbotts, both near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. In 1942 Masaryk received an LL.D. from Bates College.  After the war  Masaryk remained Foreign Minister following the liberation of Czechoslovakia as part of the multi-party, communist-dominated National Front government.Cook, Bernard A. (2001) Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p. 251 New York: Taylor & Francis The Communists under Klement Gottwald saw their position strengthened after the 1946 elections but Masaryk stayed on as Foreign Minister.Owen, John M. (2010) The Clash of Ideas in World Politics, p. 185 Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press He was concerned with retaining the friendship of the Soviet Union, but was dismayed by the veto they put on Czechoslovak participation in the Marshall Plan. Czechoslovakia sold arms to Israel during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The deliveries from Czechoslovakia proved important for the establishment of Israel. Masaryk personally signed the first contract on January 14, 1948. Because Masaryk was viewed as the most sympathetic to the Jews of members of the postwar government, he was given the task of \\"appeasing Jewish organisations in the west\\" in terms of the government's plans to expel the country's German population, including German Jews. Flag of the World Federation of United Nations Associations of which Jan Masaryk was President from 1947 to 1948. In February 1948 the majority of the non-communist cabinet members resigned, hoping to force new elections, but instead a communist government under Gottwald was formed in what became known as the Czech coup (Victorious February in the Eastern Bloc). Masaryk remained Foreign Minister, and was the only prominent minister in the new government who was neither a Communist nor a fellow traveller. However, he was apparently uncertain about his decision and possibly regretted his decision not to oppose the communist coup by broadcasting to the Czech people on national radio, where he was a much loved celebrity. Masaryk served as the President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. A memorial to his memory and his presidency of the Organisation is located in Geneva, Switzerland. Flowers are laid anualy by the Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the United Nations.

It is a reference to the Czechoslovak national motto Pravda v√≠tƒõz√≠ (Truth prevails). Jan Masaryk with Laurence Steinhardt, the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. On 10 March 1948 Masaryk was found dead, dressed only in his pyjamas, in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry (the ƒåern√≠n Palace in Prague) below his bathroom window.Axelrod, Alan (2009) The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past, p. 133 New York: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. The Ministry of the Interior claimed that he had committed suicide by jumping out of the window, but it was at the time, and is still, widely assumed that he was murdered on behest of the nascent Communist government. (Others in the country put it thus: \\"Jan Masaryk was a very tidy man. He was such a tidy man that when he jumped he shut the window after himself.\\") On the other hand, many of his close associates (e.g. his secretary Anton√≠n Sum, or Viktor Fischl) have always defended the suicide story. In a second investigation taken in 1968 during the Prague Spring, Masaryk's death was ruled an accident, not excluding a murder and a third investigation in the early 1990s after the Velvet Revolution concluded that it had been a murder. In his 1981 autobiography History and Memory, US Ambassador Charles W. Yost, a friend of Masaryk who worked with him in Prague in 1947, and also a friend of Masaryk's fianc√© Marcia Davenport, wrote, \\"The Communists used him and, when his usefulness was past, flung him out of a window to his death.\\" Discussions about the mysterious circumstances of his death continued for some time. Those who believe that Masaryk was murdered called it the Third Defenestration of Prague, and point to the presence of nail marks on the window sill from which Masaryk fell, as well as smearings of feces and Masaryk's stated intention to leave Prague the next day for London. Members of Masaryk's family‚Äîincluding his former wife, Frances Crane Leatherbee, a former in-law named Sylvia E. Crane, and his sister Alice Masarykov√° ‚Äî stated their belief that he had indeed killed himself, according to a letter written by Sylvia E. Crane to The New York Times, and considered the possibility of murder a \\"cold war clich√©\\".Crane, John O. & Sylvia E. (1991) Czechoslovakia: Anvil of the Cold War, pp. xiv, 321-323 New York: Praeger However, a Prague police report in 2004 concluded after forensic research that Masaryk had indeed been thrown out of the window to his death.Cameron, Rob, \\"Police close case on 1948 death of Jan Masaryk - murder, not suicide\\", Radio Prague, 06-01-2004. This report was seemingly corroborated in 2006 when a Russian journalist claimed that his mother knew the Russian intelligence officer who threw Masaryk out of the window of the west bathroom of Masaryk's flat.Cameron, Rob, \\"Masaryk murder mystery back in headlines as Russian journalist speaks out\\", Radio Prague, 18-12-2006. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, described his conversation with Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, who told him about \\"ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill\\". Jan Masaryk was one of them.The Kremlin‚Äôs Killing Ways, at National Review Online, by Ion Mihai Pacepa; published November 28, 2006; retrieved October 15, 2015 Czech historian V√°clava Jandeƒçkov√° has tentatively suggested in her 2015 monograph \\"Kauza Jan Masaryk: Nov√Ω pohled\\" (The Jan Masaryk Case: A New Perspective) that Masaryk might have been murdered by Jan Byd≈æovsk√Ω and Franti≈°ek Fryƒç, who believed they were working for the British intelligence service SIS, but most probably fell victim to NKVD agents. Byd≈æovsk√Ω confessed to murdering Masaryk when interrogated in prison by the Czech secret police StB in the 1950s (in an unrelated case); but later denied it. Jandeƒçkov√° argues that this confession cannot be so easily dismissed as has been believed, especially since Byd≈æovsk√Ω certainly was not hallucinating or drugged, and the interrogators seem to have been surprised by his confession (at his trial, the Masaryk murder was not \\"used\\" or even mentioned, although a separate re-investigation by the StB continued for more than a year).  Private life  From 1924 until their divorce in 1931, Masaryk was married to Frances Crane Leatherbee (1887-1954). An heiress to the Crane piping, valves and elevator fortune, and the former wife of Robert Leatherbee, she was a daughter of Charles R. Crane, a U.S. minister to China; and a sister of Richard Teller Crane II, a U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia. By that marriage, Masaryk had three stepchildren: Charles Leatherbee, Robert Leatherbee Jr., and Richard Crane Leatherbee.Leatherbee, Richard, \\"My Family Tree, 1772 - present\\" , genealogyboard.com, December 13, 2005. Stepson Charles Leatherbee (Harvard 1929) co-founded the University Players, a summer stock company in Falmouth, Massachusetts, in 1928 with Bretaigne Windust. He married Mary Lee Logan (1910-1972), younger sister of Joshua Logan, who became one of the co-directors of the University Players in 1931.See, Houghton, Norris. But Not Forgotten: The Adventure of the University Players. New York, William Sloane Associates: 1951. Masaryk was a skilled amateur pianist. In that capacity, he accompanied Jarmila Novotn√° in a recital of Czech folk songs issued on 78 RPM records to commemorate the victims of the Nazi eradication of Lidice.Crutchfield, Will, \\"CLASSICAL MUSIC; Once, the Voice Was Melody Itself.

It is reported that when he was a young Czechoslovak Ambassador to the US, he attended many parties and once the hostess invited him to play the violin. Accepting gracefully, he played a Czech nursery song to enthusiastic applause from the audience. Leaving the party with a friend, he was asked why had he been asked to play the violin, to which he replied: \\"Oh, it's all very simple-- don't you see? They have mixed me up with my father; they mixed him up with Paderewski. And they mixed the piano up with the violin.\\"Clifton Fadiman (ed.) The Little Brown Book of Anecdotes, Little Brown, Boston 1985, p. 389 At the time of his death, Masaryk was reportedly planning to marry the American writer Marcia Davenport.

Tire irons have been in common use for automobile tires since the shift to the use of tubeless tires in the late 1950s. Bicycle tire irons are still in use for those tires which have a separate inner tube, and can have a hooked C-shape cut into one end of the iron so that it may be hooked on a bicycle spoke to hold it in place.  Description and use  Tire irons, which usually come in pairs or threes, are used to pry the edge of a tire away from the rim of the wheel it has been mounted on. After one iron has pried a portion of the tire from its wheel, it is held in position while a second iron is applied further along the tire to pry more of the tire away from the wheel. This allows enough of the tire to be separated so that the first iron can be removed, and used again on the far side of the other iron. Alternating in this way, a person can work all the way around the tire to fully remove it from the wheel, in order to reach the tube that sits inside. In the first half of the 20th Century, they became a colloquial term of strength, as in \\"I couldn't get rid of him with a pair of tire irons,\\" and frequently appeared in cartoons in similar situations. The usage is obviously now considered passe.  Bicycle tire irons  Tire irons for bicycles are usually referred to as \\"tire levers\\", as they are often made of plastic, not metal. Tire levers for bicycle tires have one end that is tapered and slightly curved. The other end is usually hooked so that it can be hooked around a spoke to keep the tire bead free of the rim at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment of the tire bead from the rim.Cuthbertson, Tom Anybody's Bike Book p.110 Ten Speed Press, 1979 A common feature of tire levers is the lack of sharp edges. The slightest pinch of an inner tube by a lever can weaken or puncture the tube. It is good practice to examine a set of tire levers for any sharp edges and to file them smooth and round. Classically, tire levers were made of metal. However plastic ones are now manufactured which are even less sharp and less likely to puncture the tube. There are also some single-lever varieties, which can be inserted under the bead at one point then quickly pushed around the rim to pop the bead off. Tire levers are not necessary or desirable in all cases. In some cases, the tire can be reinserted on the rim, and sometimes removed from the rim, without the use of tire levers. This reduces the chance of puncture caused by pinching the tube between the rim and the tire bead. Sometimes they are used to fit the tire back on, but this can be done without the levers.

On January 1, 2006, As had a total population of 7,497. The total area is 22.07 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 340 inhabitants per km¬≤. History In 1971 the municipality was formed by the merger of two villages - As and Niel-bij-As, which both lie on the Bosbeek brook on the Campine plateau between the Demer and Meuse Rivers. The location of the settlements close to a water course in this dry region gave rise to the villages' names: \\"As\\" is a prehistoric name for water (\\"Aska\\") which first referred to the Bosbeek brook and later the village itself. Archaeological finds indicate an early prehistoric settlement, including objects made of flint dating from the earliest Stone Age. The area was inhabited from 500 BC as shown by a cemetery in the field between Genk and As. The Romans built the road from Tongeren to Venlo via Munsterbilzen and As. The current road next to the brook and the roads to Niel and Dorne follow the course of the Roman road. However, the Romans did not establish any settlements in the area as the sandy soil was not fertile enough. After the fall of Rome, the Francs invaded the area and established themselves in As. The Merovingian cemetery indicates that As was an important village from 500 - 700. The region started to be Christianised from the eighth century, and the first church was built on the site of the current Saint Aldegonde's Church. The church is first mentioned in a letter dated 1108 in which Otbert, Prince- Bishop of Luik reported to the abbey of Rolduc about \\"income from the churches of Riemst, Genk, As and Gellik\\". Niel was first mentioned in a charter of 1253 in which Arnold, Earl of Borgloon, was granted the Villa of Dilsen with Niel and the castle of Stokkem. In 1299 the Earl of Borgloon was recorded appointing Arnold van Gellik as pastor of As. In 1303 the Abbey was granted a perpetual lease on the village of As. The people of Niel, however, still relied on Dilsen for religious obligations, until 1721 when Pastor Bex from Dilsen created Niel as an independent parish. Bex's cousin Adam Dellecomminne became the first pastor of Niel. Since the early Middle Ages, the original oak and birch forests were cleared more and more for agriculture and heathland fields. The present hamlets, of which Oeleinde is the oldest, developed into a farming village. In 1901 the first coal was discovered in As, which led to the industrialisation of the region. Now, As is mainly a residential municipality set along large heathland fields and woodland areas.

History =Origins= Beringen was already inhabited in Celtic times, as proven by the 1995 archeological finds of gold coins and artifacts on its territory. These date from around 90 BC and are the most northerly late-Iron-Age gold objects found in Europe.De Keltische goudschat van Beringen (Limburg) Other finds, including of Roman coins, indicate a very early establishment.Beringen historisch The first mention of Beringen dates to 1120 when it was known as 'Beringe', a word derived from the Germanic Beringum, which meant 'with the people of Bero'. During Carolingian times, the land of Beringen had been donated to the abbey of Corbie in France. For most of the medieval period, it was part of the County of Loon, from which it received its city charter in 1239. The city was then protected by impressive moats and gated walls. The county of Loon as a whole was annexed to the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge in 1366. Beringen became one of the bishopric's 23 bonnes villes (principal cities) and shared its history until its dissolution in 1795.De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed: Beringen (ID: 20879) =Mining past= Under Andr√© Dumont‚Äôs guidance, the first coal- bearing drill cores were obtained in Campine in 1901, leading to several coalmines being established in the region. The first production in Koersel dates from 1919. The golden age of coal production started right after World War II and lasted until the late 1950s, when cheaper energy sources were made available elsewhere. The last coal mine in Beringen closed its doors on October 28, 1989. The remaining slag heaps and mining buildings are still very obvious around the city.

The municipality only comprises the town of Genk itself. It is one of the most important industrial towns in Flanders, located on the Albert Canal, between Antwerp and Li√®ge. History =Celtic and medieval origins= Genk probably originated as a Celtic village, and was converted to Christianity in the 10th century. The remains of a little wooden church dating from that period were found in the area. The first mention of Genk as Geneche can be found in a document dating from 1108, ceding the territory to the Abbey of Rolduc. Politically, Genk belonged to the County of Loon until it was annexed by the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge in 1365. = 19th century = During a century of on-going industrialisation further south in Belgium, Limburg modernised only slowly: Genk remained unimportant and small, growing slowly to a population of 2,000 around 1900. The peaceful village was the home of landscape painters and writers such as Neel Doff. =20th-century development= In 1901, Andr√© Dumont found a large quantity of coal in the nearby village of As. Soon after, the \\"Black Gold\\" was also found in Genk. After World War I, the village started to attract a large quantity of both Belgian and foreign immigrants, and quickly became the biggest town in Limburg after Hasselt, peaking to a population of 70 000. However, in 1966 the coal mine of Zwartberg closed down, and Genk had to develop new industries, mainly along the Albert Canal and highways. By the end of the 1980s, the two remaining coal mines at Winterslag and Waterschei were also closed. In 2000, Genk officially became a city. Economy Headstock at the former Winterslag Colliery Genk is the industrial centre of the province of Limburg and offers over 45,000 jobs, making it economically the third most significant city in Flanders. In 1900, Genk was a quiet village with around 2,000 residents. At that time, Genk was known for its natural environment, popular among artists and painters who used Genk as a setting for their pieces. In 1901, coal was discovered in Genk and three mining sites were developed: Zwartberg, Waterschei and Winterslag (C-mine today). As a result, the population grew exponentially: today Genk has about 65,000 inhabitants with 107 different ethnic backgrounds. The mines had some good years, but in 1966 the Zwartberg mine closed, followed by Winterslag (C-mine today) in 1986 and Waterschei in 1987. The Genk Body & Assembly factory of Ford Motor Company was the largest and most important employer in Genk until recently, employing some 5,000 people and building the Mondeo sedan and hatchback, the Galaxy (second generation, from 2006 and onwards) MPV/minivan, and the S-MAX sub-MPV. The factory closed in 2014. =C-Mine= The city went looking for new opportunities for the enormous mine sites on its territory, including the Winterslag site. In 2000, the idea began to grow to accommodate a creative hub in the buildings of the old coal mine of Winterslag. In 2001, the city of Genk bought the site from LRM (Limburgse Reconversie Maatschappij) and the name \\"C-mine\\" was born in 2005. As regards content, the creative hub works on four cornerstones: education, creative economy, creative recreation and artistic creation and presentation. With a university college specialised in various artistic graduation subjects, an incubator for young entrepreneurs, a cultural centre, a design centre, a cinema, C-mine expedition, etc. the C-mine mission has succeeded. It has created 330 jobs in 42 companies and organisations, including around 200 jobs in the creative sector in 33 creative companies. Each day, C-mine produces: games, apps, websites, sets for television, drones, light shows, design items, stage productions, etc. C-mine is a site of creative makers in each of the four segments. * Companies in C-Mine: * Pingvalue.com : Pingvalue is a vibrant social community of local members all over the world that share what they love most about their neighborhood. * E-nventors Lab / C-mine crib : E-nventors Lab is the research & development department of E-nvention that examines the latest technologies.

On 1 January 2006 Heusden-Zolder had a total population of 30,769. The total area is 53.23 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 578 inhabitants per km¬≤. Heusden-Zolder was the result of the merger on 1 January 1977 of the two former municipalities of Heusden and Zolder, and currently consists of the former Heusden parishes of Heusden centre, Berkenbos and Eversel, and the former Zolder parishes of Zolder centre, Boekt, Viversel, Bolderberg and Lindeman. Heusden-Zolder is home to almost 2,000 immigrants from all over the world. This is due to the (now closed) coal mine of Zolder. During the 1960s Belgian coal mines faced an enormous shortage of employees. To address this problem, foreigner labourers were encouraged to immigrate and work near the mines. After their closure (the mine in Zolder was the last one in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg to close in 1992) most of the immigrants chose to stay, which makes Heusden-Zolder a relatively multicultural place. Local infrastructure The town hall, a large glass construction, is located in Zolder centre since the merger. As a compromise, the former town hall of Heusden is now used instead by the local social security department (OCMW). Heusden-Zolder has one hospital, the Sint- Franciscusziekenhuis. Also, it has one secondary school, the Sint- Franciscuscollege, which is spread over two campusses: one in Heusden centre and one in Berkenbos. Heusden-Zolder also has a railway station, called \\"Zolder station\\". The town is easily accessible via the Albert Canal and the highway E314 and has therefore several industrial zones, such as 'Zolder- Lummen'.

Kasteel Lagendal is situated in this municipality. The historic coat of arms features the crests of the Houses of Arenberg, La Marck and Arrazola de O√±ate. In 2008 however, the municipality chose to use a new logo on its official documents instead. Originally this was an estate (\\"villa\\") of the Prince Bishop of Li√®ge. The core of this (Lummen-Koersel) was one parish until 1180. From the 10th to the 12th centuries, the County of Loon expanded in a northerly direction and seized the villa and the Counts founded an allodium, but in 1203 this area was again transferred to the Prince Bishop and taken on loan. It was given to Lodewijk van Walcourt afterwards. In 1350 Lummen came into possession of the Huis van der Mark-Arenberg. This family remained in possession of the glory until the French period (1794). However, the Dukes of Brabant also claimed to be entitled to a part of Lummen, while the (Loon) lords of Lummen sometimes attempted to found a free state in the area, whereby the Dukes of Brabant tried to sell their rights to these Loon lords several times. . The Heren van Lummen also owned the patronage rights of the parishes in their area, which also included Linkhout and Koersel, and from 1260 also Schulen. On August 17, 1943, a German fighter plane downed an American B17 bomber of the 94th bomber group over Lummen. The debris of the aircraft ended up in the area of the current Kanadastraat. Six crew members died, two were taken to Germany as prisoners of war and two escaped. A memorial was unveiled on 17 August 2013 in the parking lot of the Oosterhof, near the crash. On February 21, 1945, an Avro Lancaster bomber of the Royal Australian Air Force crashed in the Goeren in Linkhout after being shot by a German night fighter.

The city is in the centre of Belgium's fruit-producing region, Haspengouw (Hesbaye), and is renowned for its pears, apples (Jonagold), and sweet cherries. History =Origins and Golden Age= The municipality formed around an abbey founded by St. Trudo, a Frankish nobleman, in the 7th century. Legend has it that as a boy, Trudo was playing while building a small church with some rocks. When a woman scornfully kicked over the rocks she was struck by sudden blindness. Trudo cured her from this blindness after she asked for his forgiveness. He also allegedly was able to spring water and cure other illnesses. After Trudo's death, the abbey (the later Sint-Truiden Abbey) became the centre of a pilgrimage, which brought wealth to the neighbouring town. The 11th century was particularly prosperous and witnessed an important growth in population. This was the time when abbot Adelardus, reporting to the prince-bishop of Metz, built the abbey's main church and two additional churches in town: Our Lady (Lievenvrouwenkerk) and Sint-Gangulfus. Under his direction, Sint-Truiden also received an earth wall surmounted by a wooden fence and fortified gates. A proper stone wall, gates and towers, were built in 1129. The economy of this new oppidum city was based on the linen industry and commerce with foreign lands such as England, Champagne, and Germany. In the 13th century, the fortified town became one of the 23 bonnes villes (main cities) belonging to the Bishopric of Li√®ge. A market hall was built at the site where the current city hall stands, the social life of the city was organized by the various guilds, and a perron was erected on the central square, symbolizing the local government's authority in political affairs. =15th century until now= Charles the Bold captured the town in 1467, marking the beginning of a slow decline that lasted until the 19th century. The city's fortifications were dismantled in 1675, and many of the religious congregations were disbanded under the French regime at the end of the 18th century. After 1830, these empty buildings were turned into educational and medical facilities. The city was also the centre of a prosperous agricultural region, which from the end of the 19th century became well known for its fruit production. It occupied an important strategical position with regard to the N.E. frontier of Belgium, and General Henri Alexis Brialmont recommended its fortification. On 9 August 1914, at the outset of Germany's invasion of Belgium, 20 civilians were executed and a number of houses destroyed. The reconstruction and building of brand new neighbourhoods accelerated well into the 20th century. During World War II, its airfield was the base of one of the most famous Luftwaffe Night Fighter squadron, NJG1, with units II/NJG1 and IV/NJG1 operating Junkers Ju88 and Heinkel He219 aircraft from here in 1944. The highest scoring German night fighter pilot, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer (121 air victories, most of them on night) was referred to as \\"The spook of St. Trond\\" by British Bomber crews that flew over Germany on night raids. The airport EBST is still in use. Transport =Air= The airport of Sint- Truiden, Limburg Regional Airport ‚Äì EBST is PPR.

Canberra: Australian National University Press, pp. 47‚Äì65. Alternative death rituals emphasizing one method of disposal of a body‚Äîinhumation (burial), cremation, or exposure‚Äîhave gone through periods of preference throughout history. In the Middle East and Europe, both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the Neolithic era. Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The ancient Egyptians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to Herodotus, embalmed their dead. Early Persians practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the Zoroastrian Period. Phoenicians practiced both cremation and burial. From the Cycladic civilisation in 3000 BCE until the Sub-Mycenaean era in 1200‚Äì1100 BCE, Greeks practiced inhumation. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, constituting a new practice of burial, probably influenced by Anatolia. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location. Romans practiced both, with cremation the rule until the later imperial period. In Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) in the Pannonian Plain and along the middle Danube. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the Urnfield culture (from c. 1300 BCE). In the Iron Age, inhumation again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the Villanovan culture and elsewhere. Homer's account of Patroclus' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus, similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later. The Aztec emperor Ahuitzotl being cremated. Surrounding him are a necklace of jade and gold, an ornament of quetzal feathers, a copilli (crown), his name glyph and three slaves to be sacrificed to accompany him in the afterlife. Criticism of burial rites is a common form of aspersion by competing religions and cultures, including the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice. Hinduism and Jainism are notable for not only allowing but prescribing cremation. Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the formative stage of Vedic civilization. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers \\"both cremated (agnidagdh√°-) and uncremated (√°nagnidagdha-)\\" are invoked. Cremation remained common but not universal, in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. According to Cicero, in Rome, inhumation was considered the more archaic rite. The rise of Christianity saw an end to cremation in Europe, though it may have already been in decline. This stance was influenced by its roots in Judaism, the belief in the resurrection of the body, and the example of Christ's burial. Anthropologists have been able to track the advance of Christianity throughout Europe with the appearance of cemeteries. In early Roman Britain, cremation was usual but diminished by the 4th century. It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the pyre, and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the Anglo-Saxon migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an \\"urn cemetery\\". The custom again died out with the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the 7th century, when Christian burial became general.S.J. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times (Tempus Publishing, Stroud 2005), 1‚Äì62. Modern history in the Western World =Middle Ages= In parts of Europe, cremation was forbidden by law, and even punishable by death if combined with Heathen rites. Cremation was sometimes used by Catholic authorities as part of punishment for accused heretics, which included burning at the stake. For example, the body of John Wycliff was exhumed years after his death and burned to ashes, with the ashes thrown in a river, explicitly as a posthumous punishment for his denial of the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. The first to advocate for the use of cremation was the physician Sir Thomas Browne in 1658. Honoretta Brooks Pratt became the first recorded cremated European individual in modern times when she died on 26 September 1769 and was illegally cremated at the burial ground on Hanover Square in London. =Reintroduction= The Woking Crematorium, built in 1878 as the first facility in England after a long campaign led by the Cremation Society of Great Britain. In Europe, a movement to reintroduce cremation as a viable method for body disposal began in the 1870s. This was made possible by the invention of new furnace technology and contact with eastern cultures that practiced it. At the time, many proponents believed in the miasma theory, and that cremation would reduce the \\"bad air\\" that caused diseases.\\"USA.\\" Encyclopedia of Cremation. Surrey: Ashgate Publishing, 2005. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012. These movements were associated with secularism and gained a following in cultural and intellectual circles. In Italy, the movement was associated with anti- clericalism and Freemasonry, whereas these were not major themes of the movement in Britain. In 1869, the idea was presented to the Medical International Congress of Florence by Professors Coletti and Castiglioni \\"in the name of public health and civilization\\". In 1873, Professor Paolo Gorini of Lodi and Professor Ludovico Brunetti of Padua published reports of practical work they had conducted. A model of Brunetti's cremating apparatus, together with the resulting ashes, was exhibited at the Vienna Exposition in 1873 and attracted great attention Meanwhile, Sir Charles William Siemens had developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s. His furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, Carl Friedrich von Siemens perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in Dresden. The radical politician, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility. The first crematorium in the Western World opened in Milan, Italy in 1876. Milan's \\"Crematorium Temple\\" was built in the Monumental Cemetery. The building still stands but ceased to be operational in 1992.Encyclopedia of Cremation by Lewis H. Mates (p. 21-23) William Price confirmed that cremation was legal in the United Kingdom. He was himself cremated after his death in 1893. Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet, a surgeon and Physician to the Queen Victoria, had seen Gorini's cremator at the Vienna Exhibition and had returned home to become the first and chief promoter of cremation in England. His main reason for supporting cremation was that \\"it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied\\". In addition, he believed, cremation would prevent premature burial, reduce the expense of funerals, spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment, and urns would be safe from vandalism. He joined with other proponents to form the Cremation Society of Great Britain in 1874.\\" They founded the United Kingdom's first crematorium in Woking, with Gorini travelling to England to assist the installation of a cremator. They first tested it on 17 March 1879 with the body of a horse. However, after protests and an intervention by the Home Secretary, Sir Richard Cross, their plans were put on hold. In 1884, the Welsh Neo-Druidic priest William Price was arrested and put on trial for attempting to cremate his son's body. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that allowed the Cremation Society to proceed. In 1885, the first official cremation in the United Kingdom took place in Woking. The deceased was Jeanette Pickersgill, a well-known figure in literary and scientific circles. By the end of the year, the Cremation Society of Great Britain had overseen two more cremations, a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the UK that year. In 1888, 28 cremations took place at the venue. In 1891, Woking Crematorium added a chapel, pioneering the concept of a crematorium being a venue for funerals as well as cremation. Advertisement for woollen envelopes to wrap the body in for cremation, appearing in the Undertaker's Journal, 1889. Other early crematoria in Europe were built in 1878 in the town of Gotha in Germany and later in Heidelberg in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. Like many early proponents, he was motivated by a belief it would be beneficial for public health. Before LeMoyne's crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations.Sanburn, Josh. \\"The New American Way of Death.\\" Time 181.24 (2013): 30. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 September 2013. Other countries that opened their first crematorium included Sweden (1887 in Stockholm), Switzerland (1889 in Zurich) and France (1889 in P√®re Lachaise, Paris). =Early spread= Some of the various Protestant churches came to accept cremation, with the rationale being, \\"God can resurrect a bowl of ashes just as conveniently as he can resurrect a bowl of dust.\\" In Anglican and Nordic Protestant countries, cremation gained acceptance (though did not yet become the norm) first by the higher classes and cultural circles, and then by the rest of the population. In 1905, Westminster Abbey interred ashes for the first time; by 1911 the Abbey was expressing a preference for interring ashes. The 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia was critical of the development, referring to them as a \\"sinister movement\\" and associating them with Freemasonry, although it said that \\"there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation.\\" In the U.S. only about one crematory per year was built in the late 19th century. As embalming became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge. Not to be left behind, crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful. They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls. Australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies. Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the West Terrace Cemetery in the South Australian capital of Adelaide in 1901. This small building, resembling the buildings at Woking, remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s. The oldest operating crematorium in Australia is at Rookwood Cemetery, in Sydney. It opened in 1925. In the Netherlands, the foundation of the Association for Optional CremationDutch, Vereniging voor Facultatieve Lijkverbranding in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation. Laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 (two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the Netherlands), though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955. = World War II = Crematorium at Dachau concentration camp During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Nazi Germany used specially built furnaces in at least six extermination camps throughout occupied Poland including at Auschwitz- Birkenau, Che≈Çmno, Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, where the bodies of those murdered by gassing were disposed of using incineration. The efficiency of industrialised killing of Operation Reinhard during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust produced too many corpses, therefore the crematoria manufactured to SS specifications were put into use in all of them to handle the disposals around the clock, day and night.Holocaust Timeline: The Camps. The Vrba‚ÄìWetzler report offers the following description. A sketch from the Vrba‚ÄìWetzler report, showing the rough layout of the crematoria used at Auschwitz, one of the several Nazi German extermination camps in occupied Poland The Holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers, with the best known and most common being Topf and Sons as well as Kori Company of Berlin, whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies, slid inside from the back side. The ashes were taken out from the front side. The furnaces were also unique, in that they were of a \\"stand alone\\" type, meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gases. These furnaces, based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators, instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor, with the help of a draft fan located at the far end of the structure. Once outside, the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney, most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself, nor had a visible duct leading into it. = Modern era = In the 20th century, cremation gained varying degrees of acceptance in most Christian denominations. William Temple, the most senior bishop in the Church of England, was cremated after his death in office in 1944. The Roman Catholic Church accepted the practice more slowly. In 1963, at the Second Vatican Council Pope Paul VI lifted the ban on cremation, and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies. This is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred, not scattered. Many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant, if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an unprecedented phase of crematorium construction in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290753255_Designing_a_place_for_goodbye_The_architecture_of_crematoria_in_the_Netherlands - Designing a place for goodbye: The architecture of crematoria in the Netherlands - Jan 2012 Starting in the 1960s, cremation has become more common than burial in several countries where the latter is traditional. This has included the United Kingdom (1968), Canada (early 2000s), the United States (2016) and Finland (2017). Factors cited include cheaper costs (especially a factor after the 2008 recession), growth in secular attitudes and declining opposition in some Christian denominations.  Modern cremation process  An electric cremator in Austria human corpse inside an electric cremator The cremation occurs in a cremator, which is located at a crematorium or crematory. In many countries, the crematorium is a venue for funerals as well as cremation. A cremator is an industrial furnace that is able to generate temperatures of to ensure the disintegration of the corpse.https://www.cremationresource.org/cremation/how-is-a-body-cremated.html Modern cremator fuels include oil, natural gas, propane, and, in Hong Kong, coal gas. Coal and coke were used until the early 1960s. Modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside. The time required for cremation varies from body to body, with the average being 90 minutes for an adult body. A cremator is not designed to cremate more than one human body at a time. Crematoria may occasionally make exceptions for cases such as still-born twins, or a baby and mother who died during childbirth. The chamber where the body is placed is called a cremation chamber or retort and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time. The body is required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container. This allows the body to be quickly and safely slid into the cremator. It also reduces health risks to the operators. The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the cremator as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss. Some crematoria allow relatives to view the charging. This is sometimes done for religious reasons, such as in traditional Hindu and Jain funerals, and is also customary in Japan. = Body container = chedi shaped vial and displayed inside Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai. In the United States federal law does not dictate any container requirements for cremation. Certain states, however, may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated-cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation. Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, which is designed to look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used. Funeral homes may also offer rental caskets, which are traditional caskets used only during the services, after which the bodies are transferred to other containers for cremation. Rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable beds and liners, which are replaced after each use. In the United Kingdom, the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above. The body is cremated with the coffin which is why all British coffins that are to be used for cremation must be combustible. The Code of Cremation Practice forbids the opening of the coffin once it has arrived at the crematorium, and rules stipulate that it must be cremated within 72 hours of the funeral service.Code of Cremation Practice , Doncaster: Cemeteries, Crematorium, retrieved 26 November 2009 Therefore, in the United Kingdom, bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker's, although the regulations allow the use of an approved \\"cover\\" during the funeral service. It is recommended that jewellery be removed before the coffin is sealed, for this reason. When cremation is finished, the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal, which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or, increasingly, recycled. The ashes are entered into a cremulator to further grind the remains down into a finer texture before being given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist. In Germany, the process is mostly similar to that of the United Kingdom. The body is cremated in the coffin. A piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning. The remains are then placed in a container called an ash capsule, which generally is put into a cinerary urn. In Australia, the deceased is cremated in a coffin supplied by the undertaker. Reusable or cardboard coffins are becoming popular, with several manufacturers now supplying them. For low cost, a plain, particle-board coffin (known in the trade as a \\"chippie\\") can be used. Handles (if fitted) are plastic and approved for use in a cremator. Coffins vary from natural cardboard and unfinished particle board (covered with a velvet pall if there is a service) to solid timber; most are veneered particle board. Cremations can be \\"delivery only\\", with no preceding chapel service at the crematorium (although a church service may have been held) or preceded by a service in one of the crematorium chapels. Delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the cremators, perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator, allowing a lower fee to be charged. Delivery-only is sometimes called west chapel service in industry jargon. = Burning and ashes collection = File:Schamottestein.jpg(Germany) A piece of fire clay used for identifying the ash after burning the dead body File:UrneGeschlossen.jpg(Germany) A cinerary urn.

During the cremation process, the greater portion of the body (especially the organs and other soft tissues) is vaporized and oxidized by the intense heat; gases released are discharged through the exhaust system. The process usually takes 90 minutes to two hours, with larger bodies taking a longer time. Jewelry, such as necklaces, wrist-watches and rings, are ordinarily removed before cremation, and returned to the family. Several implanted devices are required to be removed. Pacemakers and other medical devices can cause surprisingly large, dangerous explosions. In the Netherlands these are removed by either the undertaker or the hospital where the person died. Contrary to popular belief, the cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a Cremulator‚Äîessentially a high-capacity, high-speed blender‚Äîto process them into \\"ashes\\" or \\"cremated remains\\",\\"Cremulator\\" is a trademark of DWF Europe. although pulverisation may also be performed by hand. This leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color, able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter, though the size of the grain varies depending on the Cremulator used. The mean weight of an adult's remains is 2.4 kg; the mean weight for adult males is about 1 kg higher than that for adult females. There are various types of Cremulators, including rotating devices, grinders, and older models using heavy metal balls. The grinding process typically takes about 20 seconds. Bone-picking ceremony at a Japanese funeral In East Asian countries such as China, Japan or Taiwan, the bones are not pulverised, unless requested beforehand. When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes. The appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ashes, although a non-technical term sometimes used is \\"cremains\\", a portmanteau of \\"cremated\\" and \\"remains\\". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word \\"cremains\\" not be used for referring to \\"human cremated remains\\". The reason given is that \\"cremains\\" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's \\"cremated remains\\" has a more identifiable human connection.) After final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box. An unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations. = Ash weight and composition = Cremated ashes still in plastic bag Cremated remains are mostly dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about 1% -4% of carbon remainshttps://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/cremation-science-memorial- diamonds-052634/ as carbonate. The ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight. Ashes of adults can be said to weigh from , with women's ashes generally weighing below and men's ashes generally weighing above . Not all that remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and surgical implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants do not have to be removed before cremation.Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths,‚Äô‚Äô Incompra Press, 2012, Some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.  Methods of retaining or disposing of the cremated remains  A U.S. Navy sailor scatters cremated remains at sea. Visible is the clear plastic inner bag containing the remains, and next to it the labeled black plastic box that contained the inner bag. This is normal in American packaging. Cremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular plastic container, which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains. Cremated remains can be kept in an urn, stored in a special memorial building (columbarium), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or in the sea. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies offer a service to turn part of the cremated remains into synthetic diamonds which can then be made into jewelry. Cremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs. The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight. Ashes are mildly acidic. In some areas such as Snowdon, Wales, environmental authorities have warned that the frequent scattering of ashes can change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology. The final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river Ganges, preferably at one of the holy cities Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, Varanasi, or Haridwar in India. The Sikhs immerse the remains in Sutlej, usually at Sri Harkiratpur. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river Kaveri at Paschima vahini in Srirangapattana at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment. Reasons for choosing cremation Cremation allows for very economical use of cemetery space. Mini-gravestones in Helsinki. Aside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some; many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.Sublette & Flagg, p. 53 Other people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn. The cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire. For surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together. Cremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or columbarium niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (¬£36 to incumbent and ¬£78 to church council) a total of ¬£114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked‚Äîsuch as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as space burial and offered by companies such as Elysium Space, Celestis and Ascending Memories). Cremated remains can now also be converted to diamonds.  Environmental impact  Despite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation also has environmental advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial (the study did not address natural burials), while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis (sometimes called green cremation or resomation) had less impact than both. The study was based on Dutch practice; American crematoria are more likely to emit mercury, but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins. Keijzer's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral's environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater. Each cremation requires about of fuel and releases about of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about of carbon dioxide, which is more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and relaxing the requirement for a cremation to take place on the same day that the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board. Burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants, with the major ones being formaldehyde and the coffin itself. Cremation can also release contaminants, such as mercury from dental fillings. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury. Another environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a concrete vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns. Many cemeteries, particularly in Japan and Europe as well as those in larger cities, have run out of permanent space. In Tokyo, for example, traditional burial plots are extremely scarce and expensive, and in London, a space crisis led Harriet Harman to propose reopening old graves for \\"double-decker\\" burials. Some cities in Germany do not have plots for sale, only for lease. When the lease expires, the remains are disinterred and a specialist bundles the bones, inscribes the forehead of the skull with the information that was on the headstone, and places the remains in a special crypt.  Religious views  = Christianity = In Christian countries and cultures, cremation has historically been discouraged, but now in many denominations it is accepted.  Catholicism  Christians preferred to bury the dead rather than to cremate the remains, as was common in Roman culture. The Roman catacombs and veneration of relics of saints witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of Summa Theologiae, says that Aquinas is \\"...quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato [...] which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on,\\" and that Aquinas believed that \\"we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being.\\" See They looked on the body as sanctified by the sacramentsDavies & Mates, \\"Cremation, Death and Roman Catholicism\\", p. 107 and itself the temple of the Holy Spirit, and thus requiring to be disposed of in a way that honours and reveres it, and they saw many early practices involved with disposal of dead bodies as pagan in origin or an insult to the body. The idea that cremation might interfere with God's ability to resurrect the body was refuted as early as the 2nd-century Octavius of Minucius Felix, in which he said: \\"Every body, whether it is dried up into dust, or is dissolved into moisture, or is compressed into ashes, or is attenuated into smoke, is withdrawn from us, but it is reserved for God in the custody of the elements. Nor, as you believe, do we fear any loss from sepulture, but we adopt the ancient and better custom of burying in the earth.\\"The full text of Octavius is available online from ccel.org. See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108. And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in Medieval Europe, cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a battle, after a pestilence or famine, and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred. Beginning in the Middle Ages, and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,Prothero, p. 74-75 although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.Prothero, p. 74. Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with \\"professed enemies of God.\\" When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the Holy See forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban, but in 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in many circumstances.[Edward McNamara, \\"Mixing Ashes of the Dead\\"] The current 1983 Code of Canon Law, states: \\"The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of burial be retained; but it does not forbid cremation, unless this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 1176 ¬ß3 ; cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2301. There are no universal rules governing Catholic funeral rites in connection with cremation, but episcopal conferences have laid down rules for various countries. Of these, perhaps the most elaborate are those established, with the necessary confirmation of the Holy See, by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and published as Appendix II of the United States edition of the Order of Christian Funerals. Although the Holy See has in some cases authorized bishops to grant permission for funeral rites to be carried out in the presence of cremated remains, it is preferred that the rites be carried out before cremation, in the presence of the still intact body. Practices that show insufficient respect for the ashes of the dead such as turning them into jewelry or scattering them are forbidden for Catholics, but burial on land or sea or enclosing in a niche or columbarium is acceptable. Anglicanism and Lutheranism In 1917, Volume 6 of the American Lutheran Survey stated that \\"The Lutheran clergy as a rule refuse\\" and that \\"Episcopal pastors often take a stand against it.\\" Indeed, in the 1870s, the Anglican Bishop of London stated that the practice of cremation would \\"undermine the faith of mankind in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, and so bring about a most disastrous social revolution.\\" In The Lutheran Pastor, George Henry Gerberding stated: However, Protestant churches welcomed the use of cremation at a much earlier date than the Catholic Church; pro-cremation sentiment was not unanimous among Protestants, however.Prothero, p. 77. The first crematoria in the Protestant countries were built in the 1870s, and in 1908, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey‚Äîone of the most famous Anglican churches‚Äîrequired that remains be cremated for burial in the abbey's precincts.Davies & Mates, \\"Westminster Abbey\\", p. 423. Today, \\"scattering\\", or \\"strewing,\\" is an acceptable practice in many Protestant denominations, and some churches have their own \\"garden of remembrance\\" on their grounds in which remains can be scattered. Other groups also support cremation. Some denominations, like Lutheran churches in Scandinavia, favour the urns being buried in family graves. A family grave can contain urns of many generations and also the urns of spouses and loved ones.  Methodism  An early Methodist tract titled Immortality and Resurrection noted that \\"burial is the result of a belief in the resurrection of the body, while cremation anticipates its annihilation.\\" The Methodist Review noted that \\"Three thoughts alone would lead us to suppose that the early Christians would have special care for their dead, namely, the essential Jewish origin of the Church; the mode of burial of their founder; and the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, so powerfully urged by the apostles, and so mighty in its influence on the primitive Christians. From these considerations, the Roman custom of cremation would be most repulsive to the Christian mind.\\"  Eastern Orthodox and others who forbid cremation  On the other hand, some branches of Christianity oppose cremation, including some minority Protestant groups and Orthodox. Most notably, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches forbid cremation, as a custom, but not dogmatically. Exceptions are made for circumstances where it may not be avoided (when civil authority demands it, or epidemics) or if it may be sought for good cause, but when a cremation is willfully chosen for no good cause by the one who is deceased, he or she is not permitted a funeral in the church and may also be permanently excluded from liturgical prayers for the departed. In Orthodoxy, cremation is perceived by some a rejection of the dogma of the general resurrection. The Church of God (Restoration) also forbids the practice of cremation, believing it to be a pagan practice. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has, in past decades, discouraged cremation without expressly forbidding it. In the 1950s, for example, Apostle Bruce R. McConkieMcConkie, Bruce R. Mormon Doctrine, A Compendium of the Gospel, 1958 wrote that \\"only under the most extraordinary and unusual circumstances\\" would cremation be consistent with LDS teachings. However, more recent LDS publications have provided instructions for how to dress the deceased when they have received their temple endowments (and thus wear temple garments) prior to cremation for those wishing to do so, or in countries where the law requires cremation. Except where required by law, the family of the deceased may decide whether the body should be cremated, though the Church \\"does not normally encourage cremation.\\" = Indian religions = Burning ghats of Manikarnika, Varanasi.jpgBurning ghats of Manikarnika, at Varanasi, India.

Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism practice cremation. The founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni Buddha, was cremated. For Buddhist spiritual masters who are cremated, one of the results of cremation is the formation of Buddhist relics. A dead adult Hindu is mourned with a cremation, while a dead child is typically buried.J Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , pages 59‚Äì60 The rite of passage is performed in harmony with the Hindu religious view that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.Terje Oestigaard, in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial (Editors: Sarah Tarlow, Liv Nilsson Stut), Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 497‚Äì501 The soul (Atman, Brahman) is the essence and immortal that is released at the Antyeshti ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements ‚Äì air, water, fire, earth and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, , pages 99‚Äì100 The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows: The final rite in the case of untimely death of a child is usually not cremation but a burial. This is rooted in Rig Veda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to \\"neither harm our girls nor our boys\\", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.Sukta XVIII ‚Äì Rigveda, English Translation: HH Wilson (Translator), pages 46‚Äì49 with footnotes; Wendy Doniger (1981), The Rig Veda, Penguin Classics, , see chapter on Death Ashes of the cremated bodies are usually spread in a river, which are considered holy in the Hindu practice. Ganga is considered to be the holiest river and Varanasi, which is on the banks of river Ganga the holiest place to be cremated at.  Bali, Indonesia  Cremation of the dead by Hindus in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. Balinese Hindu dead are generally buried inside the container for a period of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system (\\"Saka\\"). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation. = Islam = Islam strictly forbids cremation. Islam has specific rites for the treatment of the body after death. = Judaism = Judaism traditionally disapproved of cremation in the past (it was the traditional means of disposing the dead in the neighboring Bronze Age cultures). It has also disapproved of preservation of the dead by means of embalming and mummifying, a practice of the ancient Egyptians. Through history and up to the philosophical movements of the current era Modern Orthodox, Orthodox, Haredi, and Hasidic movements in Judaism have maintained a strict biblical line against cremation, and disapprove of it as Halakha (Jewish law) forbids it. This halakhic concern is grounded in the upholding of bodily resurrection as a core belief of traditional Judaism, as opposed to other ancient trends such as the Sadducees, who denied it as well as the clear wording of the Torah in Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 \\"Bury, you will bury him the same day; for the (unburied body) is a curse to God\\" with both a positive command derived from this verse to command one to bury a dead body and a negative command forbidding neglecting to bury a dead body.Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 Some from the generally liberal Conservative Jewish also oppose cremation, some very strongly. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, as the Jewish cemeteries in many European towns had become crowded and were running out of space, in a few cases cremation for the first time became an approved means of corpse disposal among the emerging liberal and Reform Jewish movements in line with their across the board rejection of traditional Torah ritual laws having mandatory standing. Current liberal movements like Reform Judaism still support cremation, although burial remains the preferred option. In Israel, where religious ritual events including free burial and funeral services for all who die in Israel and all citizens including the majority Jewish population including for the secular or non-observant are almost universally facilitated through the Rabinate of Israel which is an Orthodox organization following traditional Jewish law, there were no formal crematories until 2004 when B&L; Cremation Systems Inc. became the first crematory manufacturer to sell a retort to Israel. In August 2007, an orthodox youth group in Israel was accused of burning down the country's sole crematorium. The crematorium was rebuilt within weeks by its owner and the retort replaced. =Other= Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith forbids cremation, \\"He feels that, in view of what ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° has said against cremation, the believers should be strongly urged, as an act of faith, to make provisions against their remains being cremated. Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h has laid down as a law, in the Aqdas, the manner of Bah√° º√≠ burial, and it is so beautiful, befitting and dignified, that no believer should deprive himself of it.\\" Zoroastrianism Traditionally, Zoroastrianism disavows cremation or burial to preclude pollution of fire or earth. The traditional method of corpse disposal is through ritual exposure in a \\"Tower of Silence\\", but both burial and cremation are increasingly popular alternatives. Some contemporary adhererents of the faith have opted for cremation. Parsi-Zoroastrian singer Freddie Mercury of the group Queen was cremated after his death. China Neo-Confucianism under Zhu Xi strongly discourages cremation of one's parents' corpses as unfilial. Han Chinese traditionally practiced burial and viewed cremation as taboo and as a barbarian practice. Traditionally, only Buddhist monks in China exclusively practiced cremation because ordinary Han Chinese detested cremation, refusing to do it. But now, the atheist Communist party enforces a strict cremation policy on Han Chinese. However, exceptions are made for Hui who do not cremate their dead due to Islamic beliefs. The minority Jurchen and their Manchu descendants originally practiced cremation as part of their culture. They adopted the practice of burial from the Han, but many Manchus continued to cremate their dead. Pet cremation Pet cremation is practiced internationally. In Japan, more than 465 companion animal temples are in operation. These venues hold funerals and rituals for dead pets. In Australia, pet owners can purchase services to have their companion animal cremated and placed in a pet cemetery or taken home.Chur-Hansen, Anna. \\"Cremation Services Upon The Death of a Companion Animal: Views Of Service Providers And Service Users.\\" Society & Animals 19.3 (2011): 248‚Äì260. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 September 2013. The cost of pet cremation depends on location, where the cremation is done, and time of cremation. The American Humane Society's cost for cremation of 22.5 kg (50 lb). or less pet is $110 while 23 kg (51 lb). or more is $145. The cremated remains are available for the owner to pick up in seven to ten business days. Urns for the companion animal range from $50 to $150.\\"Cremation Services.\\" Animal Humane Society. N/D. Web. 11 October 2013. Controversial cases in recent history =Tri-State Crematory incident= In early 2002, 334 corpses that were supposed to have been cremated in the previous few years at the Tri-State Crematory were found intact and decaying on the crematorium's grounds in the U.S. state of Georgia, having been dumped there by the crematorium's proprietor. Many of the corpses were decayed beyond identification. Some families received \\"ashes\\" that were made of wood and concrete dust. Operator Ray Brent Marsh had 787 criminal charges filed against him. On 19 November 2004, Marsh pleaded guilty to all charges. Marsh was sentenced to two 12-year prison sentences, one each from Georgia and Tennessee, to be served concurrently; he was also sentenced to probation for 75 years following his incarceration. Civil suits were filed against the Marsh family as well as a number of funeral homes who shipped bodies to Tri-State; these suits were ultimately settled. The property of the Marsh family has been sold, but collection of the full $80-million judgment remains doubtful. Families have expressed the desire to return the former Tri-State crematory to a natural, parklike setting. =Indian Ocean tsunamis= The magnitude 9.0‚Äì9.3 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake triggered a series of lethal tsunamis on 26 December 2004 that killed almost 300,000 people, making them the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history. The tsunamis killed people over an area ranging from the immediate vicinity of the quake in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand, and the northwestern coast of Malaysia), to thousands of kilometers away in the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives), the Horn of Africa (Somalia), and the African Great Lakes (Kenya and Tanzania). Authorities had difficulties dealing with the large numbers of bodies, and as a result, thousands of bodies were cremated together out of fear that decaying bodies would cause disease. Many of these bodies were not identified or viewed by relatives prior to cremation. A particular point of objection was that the bodies of Westerners were kept separate from those of Asian descent, who were mostly locals. This meant that the bodies of tourists from other Asian nations, such as Japan and South Korea, were mass cremated, rather than being returned to their country of origin for funeral rites. Rates The cremation rate varies considerably across countries with Japan reporting a 99% cremation rate while Poland reported a rate of 6.7% in 2008. The cremation rate in the United Kingdom has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 34.70% in 1960 to 75.44% in 2015. According to the National Funeral Directors Association the cremation rate in the United States in 2016 was 50.2 percent and this was expected to increase to 63.8 percent by 2025 and 78.8 percent in 2035.

He was an influential theologian who supported the Nicene Creed and opposed the heresies of the early Christian church, fighting against both Arianism and the followers of Apollinaris of Laodicea. His ability to balance his theological convictions with his political connections made Basil a powerful advocate for the Nicene position. In addition to his work as a theologian, Basil was known for his care of the poor and underprivileged. Basil established guidelines for monastic life which focus on community life, liturgical prayer, and manual labor. Together with Pachomius, he is remembered as a father of communal monasticism in Eastern Christianity. He is considered a saint by the traditions of both Eastern and Western Christianity. Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa are collectively referred to as the Cappadocian Fathers. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches have given him, together with Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, the title of Great Hierarch. He is recognized as a Doctor of the Church in the Roman Catholic Church. He is sometimes referred to by the epithet Ouranophantor (Greek: ), \\"revealer of heavenly mysteries\\". Life =Early life and education= Basil was born into the wealthy family of Basil the Elder,Quasten(1986), p. 204. and Emmelia of Caesarea, in Cappadocia, around 330.Bowersock et al. (1999), p.336 His parents were known for their piety.Oratio 43.4, PG 36. 500B, tr. p.30, as presented in Rousseau (1994), p.4 His maternal grandfather was a Christian martyr, executed in the years prior to Constantine I's conversion.Davies (1991), p. 12.Rousseau (1994), p. 4. His pious paternal grandmother, Macrina, a follower of Gregory Thaumaturgus (who had founded the nearby church of Neocaesarea),Rousseau (1994), p. 12 & p. 4, respectively raised Basil and his four siblings (who also are now venerated as saints): Macrina the Younger, Naucratius, Peter of Sebaste, and Gregory of Nyssa. Basil received more formal education in Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia (modern-day Kayseri, Turkey) around 350-51.Hildebrand (2007), p. 19. There he met Gregory of Nazianzus. Gregory went to Alexandria, while Basil went to Constantinople for further studies, including the lectures of Libanius. The two later met again in Athens and became fast friends. There they met a fellow student who would become the emperor Julian the Apostate.Ruether (1969), pp. 19, 25.Rousseau (1994), pp. 32‚Äì40. Basil left Athens in 356, and after travels in Egypt and Syria, he returned to Caesarea. For around a year he practiced law and taught rhetoric.Rousseau (1994), p. 1. Basil's life changed radically after he encountered Eustathius of Sebaste, a charismatic bishop and ascetic.Hildebrand (2007), pp. 19‚Äì20. Abandoning his legal and teaching career, Basil devoted his life to God. In a letter he described his spiritual awakening: =Annesi= Russian icon of Basil of Caesarea After his baptism, Basil traveled in 357 to Palestine, Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia to study ascetics and monasticism.Quasten (1986), p. 205.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (15th ed.) vol. 1, p. 938. He distributed his fortunes among the poor, and went briefly into solitude near Neocaesarea of Pontus (mod. day Niksar, Turkey) on the Iris. Basil eventually realized that while he respected the ascetics' piety and prayerfulness, the solitary life did not call him.Merredith (1995), p. 21. Eustathius of Sebaste, a prominent anchorite near Pontus, had mentored Basil. However, they also eventually differed over dogma.McSorley, Joseph. \\"St. Basil the Great,\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 31 May 2016 Basil instead felt drawn toward communal religious life, and by 358 he was gathering around him a group of like-minded disciples, including his brother Peter. Together they founded a monastic settlement on his family's estate near AnnesiEncyclop√¶dia Britannica (15th ed.) vol. 1, p. 938. (modern Sonusa or Uluk√∂y, near the confluence of the Iris and Lycos riversmod. Ye≈üilƒ±rmak and Kelkit √áayi rivers, see Rousseau (1994), p. 62.). His widowed mother Emmelia, sister Macrina, and several other women, joined Basil and devoted themselves to pious lives of prayer and charitable works (some claim Macrina founded this community).The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History: The Early, Medieval, and Reformation Eras, vol.1, Westminster John Knox Press, 2008, , p. 75. Here Basil wrote about monastic communal life. His writings became pivotal in developing monastic traditions of the Eastern Church.Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. The Penguin Dictionary of Saints. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. . In 358, Basil invited his friend Gregory of Nazianzus to join him in Annesi.Rousseau (1994), p. 66. When Gregory eventually arrived, they collaborated on Origen's Philocalia, a collection of Origen's works.Merredith (1995), pp. 21‚Äì22. Gregory decided to return to his family in Nazianzus. Basil attended the Council of Constantinople (360). He at first sided with Eustathius and the Homoiousians, a semi-Arian faction who taught that the Son was of like substance with the Father, neither the same (one substance) nor different from him.Meredith (1995), p. 22. The Homoiousians opposed the Arianism of Eunomius but refused to join with the supporters of the Nicene Creed, who professed that the members of the Trinity were of one substance (\\"homoousios\\"). However, Basil's bishop, Dianius of Caesarea, had subscribed only to the earlier Nicene form of agreement. Basil eventually abandoned the Homoiousians, and emerged instead as a strong supporter of the Nicene Creed. =Caesarea= Icon of the Three Holy Hierarchs: Basil the Great (left), John Chrysostom (center) and Gregory the Theologian (right)‚Äîfrom Lipie, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland. In 362, Bishop Meletius of Antioch ordained Basil as a deacon. Eusebius then summoned Basil to Caesarea and ordained him as presbyter of the Church there in 365. Ecclesiastical entreaties rather than Basil's desires thus altered his career path. Basil and Gregory Nazianzus spent the next few years combating the Arian heresy, which threatened to divide Cappadocia's Christians. In close fraternal cooperation, they agreed to a great rhetorical contest with accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors.McGuckin (2001), p. 143. In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the Church. Basil next took on functional administration of the city of Caesarea. Eusebius is reported as becoming jealous of the reputation and influence which Basil quickly developed, and allowed Basil to return to his earlier solitude. Later, however, Gregory persuaded Basil to return. Basil did so, and became the effective manager of the city for several years, while giving all the credit to Eusebius. In 370, Eusebius died, and Basil was chosen to succeed him, and was consecrated bishop on June 14, 370.Meredith (1995), p. 23 His new post as bishop of Caesarea also gave him the powers of exarch of Pontus and metropolitan of five suffragan bishops, many of whom had opposed him in the election for Eusebius's successor. It was then that his great powers were called into action. Hot-blooded and somewhat imperious, Basil was also generous and sympathetic. He personally organized a soup kitchen and distributed food to the poor during a famine following a drought. He gave away his personal family inheritance to benefit the poor of his diocese. His letters show that he actively worked to reform thieves and prostitutes. They also show him encouraging his clergy not to be tempted by wealth or the comparatively easy life of a priest, and that he personally took care in selecting worthy candidates for holy orders. He also had the courage to criticize public officials who failed in their duty of administering justice. At the same time, he preached every morning and evening in his own church to large congregations. In addition to all the above, he built a large complex just outside Caesarea, called the Basiliad, which included a poorhouse, hospice, and hospital, and was compared by Gregory of Nazianzus to the wonders of the world. His zeal for orthodoxy did not blind him to what was good in an opponent; and for the sake of peace and charity he was content to waive the use of orthodox terminology when it could be surrendered without a sacrifice of truth. The Emperor Valens, who was an adherent of the Arian philosophy, sent his prefect Modestus to at least agree to a compromise with the Arian faction. Basil's adamant negative response prompted Modestus to say that no one had ever spoken to him in that way before. Basil replied, \\"Perhaps you have never yet had to deal with a bishop.\\" Modestus reported back to Valens that he believed nothing short of violence would avail against Basil. Valens was apparently unwilling to engage in violence. He did however issue orders banishing Basil repeatedly, none of which succeeded. Valens came himself to attend when Basil celebrated the Divine Liturgy on the Feast of the Theophany (Epiphany), and at that time was so impressed by Basil that he donated to him some land for the building of the Basiliad. This interaction helped to define the limits of governmental power over the church. Basil then had to face the growing spread of Arianism. This belief system, which denied that Christ was consubstantial with the Father, was quickly gaining adherents and was seen by many, particularly those in Alexandria most familiar with it, as posing a threat to the unity of the church. Basil entered into connections with the West, and with the help of Athanasius, he tried to overcome its distrustful attitude toward the Homoiousians. The difficulties had been enhanced by bringing in the question as to the essence of the Holy Spirit. Although Basil advocated objectively the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, he belonged to those, who, faithful to Eastern tradition, would not allow the predicate homoousios to the former; for this he was reproached as early as 371 by the Orthodox zealots among the monks, and Athanasius defended him. He maintained a relationship with Eustathius despite dogmatic differences. Basil corresponded with Pope Damasus in the hope of having the Roman bishop condemn heresy wherever found, both East and West. The pope's apparent indifference upset Basil's zeal and he turned around in distress and sadness. Death and legacy Basil died before the factional disturbances ended. He suffered from liver disease; excessive ascetic practices also contributed to his early demise. Historians disagree about the exact date Basil died.Rousseau (1994), pp. 360‚Äì363, Appendix III: The Date of Basil's Death and of the Hexaemeron The great institute before the gates of Caesarea, the Ptochoptopheion, or \\"Basileiad\\", which was used as poorhouse, hospital, and hospice became a lasting monument of Basil's episcopal care for the poor. Many of St. Basil's writings and sermons, specifically on the topics on money and possessions, continue to challenge Christians today. Writings Fresco of Basil the Great in the cathedral of Ohrid.

The principal theological writings of Basil are his On the Holy Spirit, a lucid and edifying appeal to Scripture and early Christian tradition (to prove the divinity of the Holy Spirit), and his Refutation of the Apology of the Impious Eunomius, written about in 364, three books against Eunomius of Cyzicus, the chief exponent of Anomoian Arianism. The first three books of the Refutation are his work; his authorship of the fourth and fifth books is generally considered doubtful.Jackson, Blomfield. \\"Basil: Letters and Select Works\\", Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, (Philip Schaff and Henry Wace, eds.) .T&T; Clark, Edinburgh Basilii Magni Opera (1523) He was a famous preacher, and many of his homilies, including a series of Lenten lectures on the Hexa√´meron (also Hexa√´meros, \\"Six Days of Creation\\"; ), and an exposition of the psalter, have been preserved. Some, like that against usury and that on the famine in 368, are valuable for the history of morals; others illustrate the honor paid to martyrs and relics; the address to young men on the study of classical literature shows that Basil was lastingly influenced by his own education, which taught him to appreciate the propaedeutic importance of the classics.Deferrari, Roy J. \\"The Classics and the Greek Writers of the Early Church: Saint Basil.\\" The Classical Journal Vol. 13, No. 8 (May, 1918). 579‚Äì91. In his exegesis Basil was a great admirer of Origen and the need for the spiritual interpretation of Scripture. In his work on the Holy Spirit, he asserts that \\"to take the literal sense and stop there, is to have the heart covered by the veil of Jewish literalism. Lamps are useless when the sun is shining.\\" He frequently stresses the need for Reserve in doctrinal and sacramental matters. At the same time he was against the wild allegories of some contemporaries. Concerning this, he wrote: > \\"I know the laws of allegory, though less by myself than from the works of > others. There are those, truly, who do not admit the common sense of the > Scriptures, for whom water is not water, but some other nature, who see in a > plant, in a fish, what their fancy wishes, who change the nature of reptiles > and of wild beasts to suit their allegories, like the interpreters of dreams > who explain visions in sleep to make them serve their own end.\\". Cf. > Hexameron, 3.9 (Ibid., pp. 70‚Äì71). His ascetic tendencies are exhibited in the Moralia and Asketika (sometimes mistranslated as Rules of St. Basil), ethical manuals for use in the world and the cloister, respectively. There has been a good deal of discussion concerning the authenticity of the two works known as the Greater Asketikon and the Lesser Asketikon. It is in the ethical manuals and moral sermons that the practical aspects of his theoretical theology are illustrated. So, for example, it is in his Sermon to the Lazicans that we find Basil explaining how it is our common nature that obliges us to treat our neighbor's natural needs (e.g., hunger, thirst) as our own, even though he is a separate individual. His three hundred letters reveal a rich and observant nature, which, despite the troubles of ill-health and ecclesiastical unrest, remained optimistic, tender and even playful. His principal efforts as a reformer were directed towards the improvement of the liturgy, and the reformation of the monastic institutions of the East. Most of his extant works, and a few spuriously attributed to him, are available in the Patrologia Graeca, which includes Latin translations of varying quality. Several of Basil's works have appeared in the late twentieth century in the Sources Chr√©tiennes collection. Statue of Saint Basil, depicting him in Western vestments, in the Church of St. Nicholas, Mala Strana, Prague, Czech Republic. Liturgical contributions Basil of Caesarea holds a very important place in the history of Christian liturgy, coming as he did at the end of the age of persecution. Basil's liturgical influence is well attested in early sources. Though it is difficult at this time to know exactly which parts of the Divine Liturgies which bear his name are actually his work, a vast corpus of prayers attributed to him has survived in the various Eastern Christian churches. Most of the liturgies bearing the name of Basil are not entirely his work in their present form, but they nevertheless preserve a recollection of Basil's activity in this field in formularizing liturgical prayers and promoting church-song. Patristics scholars conclude that the Liturgy of Saint Basil \\"bears, unmistakably, the personal hand, pen, mind and heart of St. Basil the Great\\".Bebis (1997), p. 283 One liturgy that can be attributed to him is The Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great, a liturgy that is somewhat longer than the more commonly used Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. The difference between the two is primarily in the silent prayers said by the priest, and in the use of the hymn to the Theotokos, All of Creation, instead of the Axion Estin of John Chrysostom's Liturgy. Chrysostom's Liturgy has come to replace Basil's on most days in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic liturgical traditions. The Eastern Churches preserve numerous other prayers attributed to Basil, including three prayers of exorcism, several morning and evening prayers, and the \\"Prayer of the Hours\\" which is read at each service of the Daily Office. Influence on Monasticism Through his examples and teachings Basil effected a noteworthy moderation in the austere practices which were previously characteristic of monastic life.Murphy (1930), p. 94. He is also credited with coordinating the duties of work and prayer to ensure a proper balance between the two.Murphy (1930), p. 95. Basil is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the development of Christian monasticism. Not only is Basil recognized as the father of Eastern monasticism; historians recognize that his legacy extends also to the Western church, largely due to his influence on Benedict.See K. E. Kirk, The Vision of God: The Christian Document of the summum bonum (London, 1931), 9.118, (as quoted in Meredith) Patristic scholars such as Meredith assert that Benedict himself recognized this when he wrote in the epilogue to his Rule that his monks, in addition to the Bible, should read \\"the confessions of the Fathers and their institutes and their lives and the Rule of our Holy Father, Basil.Meredith (1995), p.24 Basil's teachings on monasticism, as encoded in works such as his Small Asketikon, was transmitted to the west via Rufinus during the last 4th century.Silvas (2002), pp. 247‚Äì259, in Vigliae Christanae As a result of Basil's influence, numerous religious orders in Eastern Christianity bear his name. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Basilian Fathers, also known as The Congregation of St. Basil, an international order of priests and students studying for the priesthood, is named after him. Commemorations Basil was given the title Doctor of the Church in the Western Church for his contributions to the debate initiated by the Arian controversy regarding the nature of the Trinity, and especially the question of the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Basil was responsible for defining the terms \\"ousia\\" (essence/substance) and \\"hypostasis\\" (person/reality), and for defining the classic formulation of three Persons in one Nature. His single greatest contribution was his insistence on the divinity and consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son. In Greek tradition, Basil brings gifts to children every January 1 (St Basil's Day). It is traditional on St Basil's Day to serve vasilopita, a rich bread baked with a coin inside. It is customary on his feast day to visit the homes of friends and relatives, to sing New Year's carols, and to set an extra place at the table for Saint Basil. Basil, being born into a wealthy family, gave away all his possessions to the poor, the underprivileged, those in need, and children. For Greeks and others in the Orthodox tradition, Basil is the saint associated with Santa Claus as opposed to the western tradition of St Nicholas. According to some sources, Basil died on January 1, and the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates his feast day together with that of the Feast of the Circumcision on that day. This was also the day on which the General Roman Calendar celebrated it at first; but in the 13th-century it was moved to June 14, a date believed to be that of his ordination as bishop, and it remained on that date until the 1969 revision of the calendar, which moved it to January 2, rather than January 1, because the latter date is occupied by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. On January 2 Saint Basil is celebrated together with Saint Gregory Nazianzen.Calendarium Romanum, Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969, p. 84 Some traditionalist Catholics continue to observe pre-1970 calendars. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod commemorates Basil, along with Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa on January 10. The Church of England celebrates Saint Basil's feast on January 2, but the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada celebrate it on June 14. In the Byzantine Rite, January 30 is the Synaxis of the Three Holy Hierarchs, in honor of Saint Basil, Saint Gregory the Theologian and Saint John Chrysostom. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria celebrates the feast day of Saint Basil on the 6th of Tobi (6th of Terr on the Ethiopian calendar of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church). At present, this corresponds to January 14, January 15 during leap year. There are numerous relics of Basil throughout the world. One of the most important is his head, which is preserved to this day at the monastery of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos in Greece. The mythical sword Durandal is said to contain some of Basil's blood.

By his restatement of Sadi Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle, he gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, \\"On the Moving Force of Heat\\", published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem which applied to heat. Life Clausius was born in K√∂slin (now Koszalin, Poland) in the Province of Pomerania in Prussia. His father was a Protestant pastor and school inspector,Emilio Segr√® (2012). From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries. Courier Dover Publications. p. 228 and Rudolf studied in the school of his father. In 1838, he went to the Gymnasium in Stettin. Clausius graduated from the University of Berlin in 1844 where he had studied mathematics and physics since 1840 with, among others, Gustav Magnus, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Jakob Steiner. He also studied history with Leopold von Ranke. During 1848, he got his doctorate from the University of Halle on optical effects in Earth's atmosphere. In 1850 he became professor of physics at the Royal Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin and Privatdozent at the Berlin University. In 1855 he became professor at the ETH Z√ºrich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich, where he stayed until 1867. During that year, he moved to W√ºrzburg and two years later, in 1869 to Bonn. In 1870 Clausius organized an ambulance corps in the Franco- Prussian War. He was wounded in battle, leaving him with a lasting disability. He was awarded the Iron Cross for his services. His wife, Adelheid Rimpau died in 1875, leaving him to raise their six children. In 1886, he married Sophie Sack, and then had another child. Two years later, on 24 August 1888, he died in Bonn, Germany. Work Clausius's PhD thesis concerning the refraction of light proposed that we see a blue sky during the day, and various shades of red at sunrise and sunset (among other phenomena) due to reflection and refraction of light. Later, Lord Rayleigh would show that it was in fact due to the scattering of light, but regardless, Clausius used a far more mathematical approach than some have used. His most famous paper, Ueber die bewegende Kraft der W√§rme (\\"On the Moving Force of Heat and the Laws of Heat which may be Deduced Therefrom\\"). See English Translation: On the Moving Force of Heat, and the Laws regarding the Nature of Heat itself which are deducible therefrom. Phil. Mag. (1851), series 4, 2, 1‚Äì21, 102‚Äì119. Also available on Google Books. was published in 1850, and dealt with the mechanical theory of heat. In this paper, he showed that there was a contradiction between Carnot's principle and the concept of conservation of energy. Clausius restated the two laws of thermodynamics to overcome this contradiction (the third law was developed by Walther Nernst, during the years 1906-1912). This paper made him famous among scientists. Clausius' most famous statement of thermodynamics second law was published in German in 1854, and in English in 1856. During 1857, Clausius contributed to the field of kinetic theory after refining August Kr√∂nig's very simple gas-kinetic model to include translational, rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of 'Mean free path' of a particle.Clausius, R. (1864), Abhandlungen √ºber die Mechanische W√§rmetheorie. Electronic manuscript from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Clausius deduced the Clausius‚ÄìClapeyron relation from thermodynamics. This relation, which is a way of characterizing the phase transition between two states of matter such as solid and liquid, had originally been developed in 1834 by √âmile Clapeyron. =Entropy= In 1865, Clausius gave the first mathematical version of the concept of entropy, and also gave it its name. Clausius chose the word because the meaning (from Greek ·ºêŒΩ en \\"in\\" and œÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ tropƒì \\"transformation\\") is \\"content transformative\\" or \\"transformation content\\" (\\"Verwandlungsinhalt\\").

He was also a military leader of South Russia (as commander in chief).  Childhood  Denikin was born in Szpetal Dolny village, part of the city W≈Çoc≈Çawek in Warsaw Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Poland). His father, Ivan Efimovich Denikin, had been born a serf in the province of Saratov. Sent as a recruit to do 25 years of military service, the elder Denikin became an officer in the 22nd year of his army service in 1856. He retired from the army in 1869 with the rank of major. In 1869 Ivan Denikin married Polish seamstress El≈ºbieta Wrzesi≈Ñska as his second wife. Anton Denikin, the couple's only child, spoke both Russian and Polish growing up. His father's Russian patriotism and devotion to the Russian Orthodox religion led Anton Denikin to the Russian army. The Denikins lived very close to poverty, with the retired major's small pension as their only source of income, and their finances worsened after Ivan's death in 1885. Anton Denikin at this time began tutoring younger schoolmates to support the family. In 1890 Denikin enrolled at the Kiev Junker School, a military college from which he graduated in 1892. The twenty-year-old Denikin joined an artillery brigade, in which he served for three years. In 1895 he was first accepted into the General Staff Academy, where he did not meet the academic requirements in the first of his two years. After this disappointment, Denikin attempted to attain acceptance again. On his next attempt he did better and finished fourteenth in his class. However, to his misfortune, the Academy decided to introduce a new system of calculating grades and as a result Denikin was not offered a staff appointment after the final exams. He protested the decision to the highest authority (the Grand Duke). After being offered a settlement according to which he would rescind his complaint in order to attain acceptance into the General Staff school again, Denikin declined, insulted. Denikin first saw active service during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. In 1905 he won promotion to the rank of colonel. In 1910 he became commander of the 17th infantry regiment. A few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War, Denikin reached the rank of major-general.  World War I  By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Denikin was chief of staff of the Kiev Military District. He was initially appointed quartermaster of General Brusilov's 8th Army. Not one for staff service, Denikin petitioned for an appointment to a fighting front. He was transferred to the 4th Rifle Brigade, which was transformed into the 4th Rifle Division in 1915. This was one of the formations cited by Brusilov in his Order No. 643 of 5 (18) April 1916, which sought to end fraternization between Russian and Austrian troops. Jukes, Geoffrey. Carpathian Disaster: Death of an Army, pp. 117-120. New York: Ballantine Books, 1971. In October 1916 he was appointed to command the Russian 8th Army Corps and lead troops in Romania. Following the February Revolution and the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II, he became Chief of Staff to Mikhail Alekseev, then Aleksei Brusilov, and finally Lavr Kornilov. Denikin was concurrently commander of the Southwestern Front from July 20 (2 August) to 16 (29) August 1917. He supported the attempted coup of his superior, Kornilov, in September 1917 and was arrested and imprisoned with him. After this Alekseev would be reappointed commander-in-Chief.Jukes, pp. 155-157.  Civil War  Denikin in 1918 A temporary takeover of the Tsaritsyn (present-day Volgograd) by Denikin's troops in July 1919 Following the October Revolution both Denikin and Kornilov escaped to Novocherkassk in the Northern Caucasus and, with other Tsarist officers, formed the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army, initially commanded by Alekseev. Kornilov was killed in April 1918 near Ekaterinodar and the Volunteer Army came under Denikin's command thanks in part to the support of fellow general Sergey Markov. Kornilov's disastrous attempt to take the city was finally cancelled and the army retreated towards the north-east, evading destruction and ending the campaign which would become known as the Ice March. There was some sentiment to place Grand Duke Nicholas in overall command but Denikin was not interested in sharing power. In June-November 1918, Denikin launched the highly successful Second Kuban Campaign which gave him control of the entire area between the Black and Caspian Sea. In the summer of 1919, Denikin led the assault of the southern White forces in their final push to capture Moscow . For a time, it appeared that the White Army would succeed in its drive; Leon Trotsky, as the supreme commander of the Red Army, hastily concluded an agreement with Nestor Makhno's anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (the 'Black Army') for mutual support. Makhno duly turned his Black Army east and led it against Denikin's extended lines of supply, forcing the Whites to retreat. Denikin's army would be decisively defeated at Orel in October 1919, some 360 km south of Moscow. The White forces in southern Russia would be in constant retreat thereafter, eventually reaching the Crimea in March 1920. On 4 January 1920, with defeat and capture by the Bolsheviks in Siberia imminent, Admiral Alexander Kolchak named Denikin as his successor as Supreme Ruler (Verkhovnyy Pravitel), but Denikin accepted neither the functions nor the style of Supreme Leader.\\"Russian Civil War Polities\\". http://worldstatesmen.org/Russia_War.html Meanwhile, the Soviet government immediately tore up its agreement with Makhno and attacked his anarchist forces. After a seesaw series of battles in which both sides gained ground, Trotsky's more numerous and better equipped Red Army troops decisively defeated and dispersed Makhno's Black Army. In the summer of 1919 Denikin's troops captured Kharkiv = Anti-Semitism and Anti-Masonry = Sverdlov, Zinoviev, Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Radek ‚Äì sacrifice an allegorical character representing Russia to a statue of Karl Marx. During the Russian Civil War, an estimated 50,000 Jews perished in pogroms. Ukrainian forces, nominally under the control of Symon Petliura, perpetrated approximately 40 percent of the recorded pogroms (although Petliura never ordered his forces to engage in such activity and eventually exhorted his troops to refrain from the violenceThe YIVO encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe by YIVO institute for Jewish Research.).The White Army is associated with 17 percent of the attacks, and was generally responsible for the most active propaganda campaign against Jews, whom they openly associated with communism. The Red Army is blamed for 9 percent of the pogroms. In the territories it occupied, Denikin's army carried out mass executions and plunder, in what was later known as the White Terror. In the town of Maykop in Circassia during September 1918, more than 4,000 people were massacred by General Pokrovsky's forces.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏'; –†–∞—Ç—å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, –ò.–°.; –•–æ–¥—è–∫–æ–≤, –ú.–í.; –ò–∑–¥-–≤–æ: –°–ü–±: –õ–∞–Ω—å, 2001 –≥.; . –°. 57 In the small town of Fastov alone, Denikin's Volunteer Army murdered over 1,500 Jews, mostly elderly, women, and children. The press of the Denikin regime regularly incited violence against communist Jews and Jews seen as communists in the context of treason committed by Red agents. For example, a proclamation by one of Denikin's generals incited people to \\"arm themselves\\" in order to extirpate \\"the evil force which lives in the hearts of Jew-communists.\\" Religious and faithful to the Russian Orthodox Church, Denikin did not criticise the pogroms against the Jewish population until the end of 1919. Denikin believed that most people had reasons to hate Jews and wished to avoid an issue that divided his officers. Many of them, intensely anti-Semitic, allowed pogroms under their watch, which turned into a method of terror against the Jewish population and served to earn the favour of the Ukrainian people for much of 1919. Western sponsors were dismayed at the widespread antisemitism in the Whites' officer ranks, especially as the Bolsheviks sought to officially prohibit acts of anti-Semitism. Winston Churchill personally warned General Denikin that: John Ernest Hodgson, a British war correspondent with Denikin's forces, said the following of Denikin's and his officers' antisemitism:  Exile  Facing increasingly sharp criticism and emotionally exhausted, Denikin resigned in April 1920 in favor of General Baron Pyotr Wrangel. Denikin left the Crimea by ship to Constantinople and then to London. He spent a few months in England, then moved to Belgium, and later to Hungary. From 1926 Denikin lived in France. Although he remained bitterly opposed to Russia's Communist government, he chose to exist discreetly on the periphery of exile politics, spending most of his time writing and lecturing. This did not prevent the Soviets from unsuccessfully targeting him for abduction in the same effort that snared exile General Alexander Kutepov in 1930 and later General Yevgeny Miller in 1937. White Against Red - The Life of General Anton Denikin gives possibly the definitive account of the intrigues during these early Soviet \\"wet-ops\\". Denikin was a writer, and prior to World War I had written several pieces in which he criticised the shortcomings of his beloved Russian Army. His voluminous writings after the Russian Civil War (written while living in exile) are notable for their analytical tone and candour. Since he enjoyed writing and most of his income was derived from it, Denikin began to consider himself a full-time writer and developed close friendships with several Russian √©migr√© authors‚Äîamong them Ivan Bunin (a Nobel Laureate), Ivan Shmelev, and Aleksandr Kuprin. Although respected by some of the community of Russian exiles, Denikin was disliked by √©migr√©s of both political extremes, right and left. With the fall of France in 1940, Denikin left Paris in order to avoid imprisonment by the Germans. Although he was eventually captured, he declined all attempts to co-opt him for use in Nazi anti-Soviet propaganda. The Germans did not press the matter and Denikin was allowed to remain in rural exile. Denikin's coffin in St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral, New-York. At the conclusion of World War II, correctly anticipating their likely fate at the hands of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, Denikin attempted to persuade the Western Allies not to forcibly repatriate Soviet POWs (see also Operation Keelhaul). He was largely unsuccessful in his effort. From 1945 until his death in 1947, Denikin lived in the United States, in New York City. On August 8, 1947, at the age of 74, he died of a heart attack while vacationing near Ann Arbor, Michigan. General Denikin was buried with military honours in Detroit. His remains were later transferred to St. Vladimir's Cemetery in Jackson, New Jersey. His wife, Xenia Vasilievna Chizh (1892‚Äì1973), was buried at Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois cemetery near Paris. On October 3, 2005, in accordance with the wishes of his daughter Marina Denikina and by authority of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, General Denikin's remains were transferred from the United States and buried at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow. The importance of Denikin's diary for explaining the relationship between \\"Great and little Russia, Ukraine\\" was cited by Putin during his May 24, 2009 visit to the Donskoy Monastery. \\"He says nobody should be allowed to interfere between us.

One of his most significant works, it sums up his own thoughts from his book, On the Tragic, and, as a theory describes a reinterpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche's √úbermensch. Zapffe believed that existential angst in humanity was the result of an overly evolved intellect, and that people overcome this by \\"artificially limiting the content of consciousness.\\" The human condition Zapffe views the human condition as tragically overdeveloped, calling it \\"a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature.\\" Zapffe viewed the world as beyond humanity's need for meaning, unable to provide any of the answers to the fundamental existential questions. Throughout the essay, Zapffe alludes to Nietzsche, \\"the poster case, as it were, of seeing too much for sanity.\\" After placing the source of anguish in human intellect, Zapffe then sought as to why humanity simply didn't just perish. He concluded humanity \\"performs, to extend a settled phrase, a more or less self-conscious repression of its damaging surplus of consciousness\\" and that this was \\"a requirement of social adaptability and of everything commonly referred to as healthy and normal living.\\" He provided four defined mechanisms of defense that allowed an individual to overcome their burden of intellect. Remedies against panic *Isolation is the first method Zapffe noted. It is defined as \\"a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling\\". He cites \\"One should not think, it is just confusing\\" as an example. *Anchoring, according to Zapffe, is the \\"fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness\\". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe compared this mechanism to Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen's concept of the life-lie from the play The Wild Duck, where the family has achieved a tolerable modus vivendi by ignoring the skeletons and by permitting each member to live in a dreamworld of his own. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated \\"God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future\\" are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments. He noted flaws in the principle's ability to properly address the human condition, and warned against the despair provoked resulting from discovering one's anchoring mechanism was false. Another shortcoming of anchoring is conflict between contradicting anchoring mechanisms, which Zapffe posits will bring one to destructive nihilism. *Distraction is when \\"one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions.\\" Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself. *Sublimation is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. The last messiah Zapffe concluded that \\"As long as humankind recklessly proceeds in the fateful delusion of being biologically fated for triumph, nothing essential will change.\\" Humankind will get increasingly desperate until 'the last messiah' arrives, \\"the man who, as the first of all, has dared strip his soul naked and submit it alive to the outmost thought of the lineage, the very idea of doom. A man who has fathomed life and its cosmic ground, and whose pain is the Earth's collective pain.\\" Zapffe compares his messiah to Moses, but ultimately rejects the precept to \\"be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,\\" by saying \\"Know yourselves ‚Äì be infertile, and let the earth be silent after ye.\\" Influence In his book The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, horror writer and philosopher Thomas Ligotti refers frequently to \\"The Last Messiah\\" and quotes sections of the essay, using Zapffe's work as an example of philosophical pessimism.

It comprises the former municipalities of Mechelen-aan- de-Maas, Vucht, Leut, Meeswijk, Uikhoven, Eisden, Opgrimbie, Boorsem, and Kotem. As a result of both Maasmechelen's location near the border and its coalmining history quite a few of its current inhabitants are from Dutch, German, Eastern European (e.g., Polish) or Mediterranean (mainly Italian) origin. History =Prehistoric and Roman times= The plateau of Campine was built up during the ice age with deposits of sand and other material that the Meuse river had eroded in the upstream Ardennes region. The higher elevation and the proximity of fertile river clay made this location an attractive one for the prehistoric tribes who established themselves here in the 2nd millennium BC and for the Celtic peoples who moved in the area in the 1st millennium BC. In Roman times, this region was at the border between the provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. The main Roman road crossed the river near Maastricht, to the south. Settlements were built where Maasmechelen lies today to service the garrison that was maintained to protect the bridge in Maastricht. =Middle Ages= The few centuries that followed the fall of the Roman Empire were marked by a sharp decline in travel and trade. The Franks were now the new masters of the land. International commercial activities resumed on the river around the 7th century. This was also a time when the river progressively moved eastward. The Roman colonies that were originally built on the right bank of the river now found themselves on the left bank. The abundance of streams and wetlands favoured stockbreeding over agriculture. The feudal system and the practice of paying civil servants with land resulted in endless territory subdivisions. Some parcels, including Mechelen-aan-de-Maas and parts of Opgrimbie, were given to the abbey of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. Other parcels came into the hands of local lords, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Yet other parts of the territory came into the possession of local religious communities. Churches and cloisters were built and enlarged to accommodate a growing population. =19th and 20th century= The aftermath of the French Revolution brought a series of dramatic changes that include the dismantlement of most religious organizations, the closing of churches, and the reorganization of the territory into new administrative entities. During the 19th century, the area had still an unmistakable rural character. On May 20, 1901, Andr√© Dumont found commercial-grade coal in neighbouring As. This led to the exploitation of coal mines in Eisden from 1923 to 1987. A garden city and a new church dedicated to Saint Barbara, also known as the mining cathedral, were built there. The industrial development attracted workers from all over Europe, which accounts for the numerous international restaurants still found today in Eisden.

Tongeren is the oldest town in Belgium, as the only Roman administrative capital within the country's borders. As a Roman city, it was inhabited by the Tungri, and known as Atuatuca Tungrorum, it was the administrative centre of the Civitas Tungrorum district. The city is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. History =Atuatuca Tungrorum= Tongeren Roman wall The Romans referred to Tongeren as Aduatuca Tungrorum or Atuatuca Tongrorum, and it was the capital of the large Roman province of Civitas Tungrorum, an area which covered modern Belgian Limburg, and at least parts of all the areas around it. Before the Roman conquests, this area was inhabited by the group of Belgic tribes known as the Germani cisrhenani. (Despite being known as the Germani, whether they spoke a Germanic language is debated, and the names of their tribes and their leaders were Celtic.) Specifically the Eburones were the largest of these tribes and the one living around Tongeren. Caesar referred to the fort of the Eburones as Aduatuca, and this has led to a widely accepted proposal that this can be equated to Tongeren. There are counter arguments that the word \\"Aduatuca\\" was probably a general word for a fort in this region, meaning that there might have been more places with the same name, and that Tongeren shows no signs of pre-Roman occupation, nor the hilly terrain described by Caesar. There was also a distinct tribe in the area known as the Aduatuci. On the other hand, it has the same name and function as a local capital, and is in generally the right area. If it is not Tongeren itself, the Aduatuca of the Eburones might be the ancient fortification of Caestert in nearby Riemst. During Julius Caesar‚Äôs campaigns in this part of Gaul in the first century BC, the Belgae revolted against the campaign of Caesar, led by the Eburones. They destroyed a legion that had demanded the right to winter among them in 54 BC. Caesar reported that he sold the Aduatuci into slavery, and annihilated the name of the Eburones, many of whom however he reported having fled successfully, including Ambiorix the leader of the revolt. Instead of risking Roman lives to pursue them he invited tribes from over the Rhine, such as the Sigambri to come and plunder. This back-fired when Eburones pointed out to the Sigambri that the Romans had all the booty at Aduatuca, and were the more attractive target. The Tungri, not mentioned by Caesar, came to dominate this area in the Roman era, and are the reason for the name of the modern name Tongeren. Tacitus says that Tungri was a new name for the original tribes who had previously been called the Germani. But many modern writers believe that the Gallo-Roman population of the area contained a significant amount of more recent Germanic immigrants from across the Rhine. Located on the important road linking Cologne to Bavay via the relay of Liberchies, and surrounded by the fertile lands of the Hesbaye region, Roman Tongeren quickly became one of the largest Gallo-Roman administrative and military towns in the first century. It suffered from a destructive fire during the Batavian siege in 70 AD, which was part of the Batavian revolt. In the second century, it erected a defensive wall, portions of which can still be seen today. Typical Roman buildings were built in town, while villas and mound graves (tumuli) dotted the surrounding area. In 358 the future emperor Julian met, in Tongeren, a delegation of Salian Franks who had recently settled in Toxandria (the modern Campine region), to the north of Tongeren. They wanted peace but spoke \\"as if the ground they had seized were rightfully their own\\". Julian gave ambiguous replies and then after the meetings sent a surprise attack along the Maas or Meuse river, and \\"they met him with entreaties rather than with resistance, he received the submission of them and their children\\".Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XVII.8.3-4 They became increasingly important after this time. Zosimus reports that Julian used them as part of his forces in fights against other Germanic tribes.Zosimus Nova Historia Book III =Middle Ages= The monumental \\"Moerenpoort\\", a gate in the medieval city-wall Already in the fourth century, just as the Salian Franks were settling to the north, the city became the center of a Christian diocese under the influence of Saint Servatius, bishop of Tongeren, who died in 384 AD. In the meantime, the Franks to the north and east were pagan and so many areas had to be reconverted over the course of the following centuries, with several missionaries becoming martyrs. The seat of the Tungrian bishopric however eventually moved to nearby Maastricht, after Saint Servatius was buried near the Roman towns there. Much later, Li√®ge became the seat of what would become the Roman Catholic Diocese of Li√®ge, the church equivalent to the Civitas Tungrorum. This was the resting place of Saint Lambert of Maastricht, one of the last missionaries in the area, who died about 700 AD. Aduatuca Tungrorum may have been destroyed by the Huns in 451 AD. Tongeren therefore lost some importance during this period. Waves of Germanic settlers and invaders changed the area significantly. The Merovingian period between the fifth and the eighth century is not well documented. The building of a new church and the foundation of a chapter of canons took place in Carolingian times, at the very place where the old bishops‚Äô houses stood, and where the basilica still stands today. The construction of the current basilica started at the beginning of the thirteenth century in the prevalent Gothic style of that period. Other buildings were added to the religious core of the city, including new commercial areas, hospitals and artisans quarters. The thirteenth century also saw the building of the medieval defensive wall, several new churches and cloisters, and the beguinage. The city became one of the ‚Äúbonnes villes‚Äù (\\"good cities\\") of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. Perroen\\", the historic symbol of being one of the \\"bonnes villes\\". =From seventeenth century until contemporary age= In 1677, the city was burned almost entirely by Louis XIV‚Äôs troops, a catastrophe from which Tongeren never completely recovered. The rebirth of the city dates from after 1830. In 1977 the neighbouring municipalities of Berg, Diets-Heur, Henis, 's-Herenelderen, Koninksem, Lauw, Mal, Neerrepen, Nerem, Overrepen, Piringen, Riksingen, Rutten, Sluizen, Vreren and Widooie merged into Tongeren. Tongeren is currently the judicial capital of the province of Belgian Limburg. Main sights The Tongeren Basilica *The B√©guinage, founded in 1257, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. Its enclosure wall was destroyed in the nineteenth century: it separated the beguinage from the rest of the city and thus guaranteed peace and quiet for the small religion-inspired community. In the seventeenth century the beguinage counted some 300 beguines; it was also able to survive the 1677 fire that destroyed most of the city. *The Tongeren Basilica (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe Basiliek), built in Gothic style in the thirteenth century, where recent excavations have produced some of the richest archaeological finds in Flanders. Archaeological excavations have proven the presence of an edifice here starting from the fourth century, while a Carolingian prayer house existed here in the ninth century. The building of the choir of the present basilica began in 1240. Nave, transepts and side chapels were added between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. The original Romanesque tower was replaced by the present, Gothic tower from 1442 until 1541. The basilica's interior is home to the statue of Our Lady of Tongeren, erected in 1475. The treasury is housed in the former hall of the Chapter and comprises one of the richest collections of religious art in Belgium. *Church of St. Catherine, built in Gothic style in 1294 but modified later in different styles. Works of art include the 1711 pulpit by Robrecht Verburgh, the main altarpiece by Gaspar de Crayer (17th century) and a sculpture of the \\"Suffering Christ\\", donated by the beguine Anna de Floz. *The Gallo-Roman Museum, which houses Celtic gold, Roman glassware, Merovingian filigree work, and a Roman dodecahedron, an unusual Gallo-Roman object found during excavations *The original Roman wall, dating from the second century, still visible for more than . *Some of the medieval defensive towers, also still visible today. *Statue of Ambiorix, erected in 1866. *Several Tumuli are found around the city. *The Pliniuspark features the Plinius spring, a natural spring described by Pliny the Elder in 77-79 a.d. *At the location of a former Roman temple in the Keverstraat, a modern representation of that temple can be found. Because no drawings, apart from the floor plans, of the original temple exist, everything has been rebuilt up to 1 meter high. *Partly 3 meters below the Basilica of Our Lady and partly inside the Basilica, the Teseum-museum shows the archaeological findings at the location of the Basilica, as well as exhibitions about the history of the church. *Tongeren houses a youth detention center.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Geography Toul is located between Commercy and Nancy, and situated between the Moselle River and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin. History Toul was known to the Romans as , and was the capital of the Gaulish tribe of the Leuci. In 550, King Theudebald convoked a synod at Toul. In 612, King Theudebert II of Austrasia was defeated by King Theuderic II of Burgundy near Toul. By the Treaty of Meerssen of 870, Toul became part of East Francia, the later Holy Roman Empire. During the High Middle Ages, it became a Free Imperial City. Toul was annexed to France by King Henry II in 1552; this was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. It then was a part of the French province of the Three Bishoprics. Toul was the seat of the bishops of Toul; the diocese was founded around 365 and existed until 1807. During the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, the last time that Toul's defenses were used as a classic fortress, 64 guns opened fire at 6:00 a.m. on 23 September, and the fortress surrendered at 3:00 p.m. after 2,433 shells had been fired. The city was also the primary base of the Air Service, United States Army, a predecessor organization of the United States Air Force during World War I. As such, it was a base for many of the 45 wartime squadrons of the First Army Air Service, including the squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group, First Army Observation Group and others. The Americans referred to the area around Toul as the Toul Sector. Two large operations were launched from this area: the St. Mihiel Offensive and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, both in September 1918. During World War II, the American 358th Fighter Group used Toul-Croix De Metz Airfield (A-90) during the fall of 1944 and spring of 1945, and Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base (BA 136) was an American NATO air base during the 1950s and 1960s. Sights The most striking features are the impressive stone ramparts. Those that exist today are the work of S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, Louis XIV's military engineer. In 1698 he designed a new enclosure and work began in 1699-1700. Several of Vauban's fortifications in France are listed as a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although the fortifications at Toul are not in that list they do follow the general defiladed fortification pattern for which Vauban is known. There appears to have been a fortified town at this location since the earliest recorded history. Today, the ramparts encircle and define the old town. They are built of dressed white stone, and topped with grass, and in places are over five metres high. There is a great deal of Roman arch√¶ology in the area and allegedly some in the town. The Roman fortified town of Grand is some 30 km away, with its great amphitheatre and temple to the Cult of Apollo. The old town's architecture is dominated by past glories in various states of decay, including a major Gothic cathedral, which is in a poor condition and is being slowly restored. Many of the houses were built as canonical residences in the Late Middle Ages and bear vestiges in the form of ornamental stonework. There is no trace of the monastery, however its wine-cellars still exist, under the shops on the north side of the Rue Gambetta. (Access is possible via the Camera Shop). Transportation Toul is at the intersection of the Moselle River (which divides into the river proper and the Moselle Canalis√©e just outside the town) with the Canal de la Marne au Rhin, and was once, consequently, an important port. The barges known as p√©niches still navigate these watercourses commercially, typically carrying steel, though in the summer much more of the water traffic is for pleasure. There is a main-line railway station at Toul, the last major station before the (once vast, and still very large) marshalling yards at Nancy. However, the Paris-Strasbourg TGV line, now under construction, will pass about 20 km north of Toul, approximately midway between Metz and Nancy. Its completion will likely reduce Toul's importance as a station. Economy The surrounding countryside is a wine-growing region, in which the AOC C√¥tes de Toul vintage is produced. Particularly notable is the Gris de Toul. Administration Toul is the seat and part of the canton of Toul, and of the arrondissement of Toul.

By Karel Kl√≠ƒç, 1869. Maximilian Steiner (27 August 1830 ‚Äì 29 May 1880) was an Austrian actor and theater director and manager. He is known particularly for his leadership of Vienna's Theater an der Wien from 1869 to 1880, a period during which the theater reduced the importance of folk plays (dialect drama) and was prominent in developing and promoting the fashion of a Viennese style of operetta.W.

Steiner's business acuity helped the Theater stay open after the stock market crash in 1873,Crittenden, p. 72. but he did lose control for several months in 1877 due to another set of financial difficulties; he gained control again later in the same year with the help of friends and other backers.N.

Although he and Geistinger came to emphasize operetta more and more, Steiner still built the theater's seasons by emphasizing variety:N. Rubey, \\"Steiner Maximilian.\\" the typical fare included folk plays, burlesques with music, and operetta. He gradually phased out spoken-word dramas, contributing fundamentally to the Viennese operetta boom that continued till well into the twentieth century. He produced both well- proven and new stage works by Offenbach but also discovered young talent such as the playwright Ludwig Anzengruber, the last prominent author of folk plays, and the composer Carl Mill√∂cker, who became the Theater's Kapellmeister in 1869.N. Rubey, \\"Steiner Maximilian\\"; Crittenden, p. 71. When the first wife of Johann Strauss, jr., brought some of the composer's musical sketches to Steiner, he took on himself responsibility for encouraging Strauss to write operetta.Robert Ignatius Letellier, Operetta: A Sourcebook, Volume 1, p. 473; Richard Traubner, Operetta: A Theatrical History (2004), p. 107 As it happened, Strauss, piqued by the Viennese successes of Jacques Offenbach, had already started working on an operetta, a project that fell through when it was discovered that his intended lead, Josefine Gallmeyer, was unavailable.Traubner, p. 107. Steiner then collaborated with Strauss on Indigo and the Forty Thieves, which premiered on 10 February 1871 and for which Steiner wrote the libretto. Strauss's second operetta, Die Fledermaus (1874) became a fixture of German-language theaters and has remained in the canon of operetta to this day.Kurt G√§nzl, \\"Die Fledermaus,\\" Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, as reproduced on the Operetta Research Center website. The initial production starred Geistinger as Rosalinde. Second and third productions followed in 1875 and 1876. The latter is notable for introducing, as Dr. Falke, Alexander Girardi, who stayed with the Theater's company for twenty two years and was a central figure in many successful operetta productions. Steiner organized a playwright's guild, staged yearly benefit shows, and at the time of his death was one of the most popular figures in Vienna.Constantin von Wurzbach, \\"Steiner, Maximilian,\\" p. 80. With his wife, Rosa (Kollinsky), he had two sons: Franz Steiner, who took over his functions in the theater in 1880 and remained until 1884; and Gabor Steiner, who also became a theater manager and operator of a music hall. Gabor's son was Max Steiner, who worked in London theaters, then in New York, and after 1929 was a Hollywood film composer.

The Ath municipality includes the old communes of Lanquesaint, Irchonwelz, Ormeignies, Bouvignies, Ostiches, Rebaix, Maffle, Arbre, Houtaing, Ligne, Mainvault, Moulbaix, Villers-Notre-Dame, Villers-Saint-Amand, Ghislenghien (), Isi√®res, Meslin-l'Ev√™que, and Gibecq. Ath is known as the \\"City of Giants\\" after the Ducasse d'Ath festivities which take place every year on the fourth weekend in August. Huge figures representing Goliath, Samson, and other allegoric figures are paraded through the streets, and Goliath's wedding and his famous fight with David are re- enacted. History =Pre‚Äì1500= Archeological records show the existence of several Gallo-Roman settlements in the Ath area. The origin of the city of Ath, however, dates from around 1160, when Count Baudouin IV of Hainaut, bought some territory from his liegeman, Gilles de Trazegnies. A few years later, Baldwin built the Burbant Tower - which can still be seen today - to protect his new acquisition. The new city was soon given privileges and its newly built (1325) market hall on the Grand-Place began to attract residents. Ath was the setting of the \\"Peace of Ath\\", signed on June4, 1357, to end the question of the Brabant succession. By then, the weekly Ath market, which took place - and still takes place - on Thursdays, had started attracting sellers from a much larger region. The production of linen, cloth, hide, and luxury items such as gold ware, cabinets, and sculptures was growing fast. The population growth necessitated the building of a second wall, which was completed at the end of the 14th century. In 1416, the city built a school for the study of Latin, which Justus Lipsius attended. The city counted then about 5,000 people. =1501‚Äìpresent= In 1667, Ath was conquered in a single day by the army of Louis XIV and became the first French city of the Spanish Netherlands. Soon after, Vauban built new fortifications, which included eight bastions. The city suffered again at the hands of the French army in 1745. At the end of the 18th century, Ath counted about 7,300 inhabitants but the population count decreased in the first half of the 19th century. In 1816, two military engineering surveys concluded that Ath defences should be improved, the British survey recommended a garrison of 3,000 troops and the building cost would be ¬£143,599. The Dutch wished to spend an additional ¬£266,000. The Duke of Wellington agreed to the Dutch plan. The funding was paid for by England (30%), Holland (30%) and by French war reparations (40%). In 1824, the Dutch under King William I, built the F√©ron Fort, and the city once more gained strategic value. A treaty drafted in London on 15 November 1831, which the Netherlands refused to sign, was followed by the Treaty of London (1839), which created the Kingdom of Belgium. Part of the terms of the treaty required the fort, amongst others, to be dismantled. The freed up land assisted the town for the activities of a growing population. A new growth period took place between 1850 and 1914 driven by the forestry, agricultural (breweries, mills) and textile industries. In the 20th century, most of these industries went into decline and were replaced by commercial, administrative and educational activities. In the last 30 years, several neighbourhoods have been revitalized and developed, and the city's monuments renovated or restored. = July 30, 2004 explosions = The Ghislenghien industrial park near Ath was the scene of one of Belgium's worst ever industrial disasters on July 30, 2004. Around 8:30 am local time, workers constructing a new factory for abrasives firm Diamant Boart (a subsidiary of the Electrolux Group)http://www.electrolux.com/node684.asp reported a strong smell of gas. It is believed the gas was escaping from a high-pressure underground pipeline conveying natural gas from Zeebrugge to France, operated by gas transportation company Fluxys. Firefighters were soon on the scene and were attempting to clear the area when at least two explosions occurred at around 9:00 am. The strongest of these demolished the partly built Diamant Boart structure, and fires were started in several other buildings. The official death-toll has risen to 23, with over 120 injured. Five volunteer firemen and one police officer were among the dead. The cause of the leak has not yet been ascertained. After the explosion, signs of damage by a construction machine were discovered on the exploded part of the pipeline and the adjacent parts. Probably these were the result of construction works a few weeks before the explosion. The pipeline probably ruptured completely on July 30, 2004, when operator Fluxys raised the pressure. Sights * The 12th-century Burbant tower was built by Baudouin IV and named after the neighbouring Landgraviate of Brabant. * The town hall dates from the 17th century. * The church of Saint Julien, rebuilt after a fire in the 19th century, still keeps a Gothic tower and apsidal chapel, as well as a famous 16th-century carillon. * The church of Saint Martin and the exterior oak calvary both date from the 16th century. Festivities * The ‚ÄúDucasse‚Äù originated from a yearly procession developed in the 15th century (first mentioned in 1399) as a celebration of the consecration of the local Saint Julien church. This procession illustrated stories from the Old Testament, New Testament, Golden Legend, and Carolingian cycle. Today, the ‚ÄúDucasse‚Äù is a very popular celebration that includes various festivities and lasts several days spanning the end of August and beginning of September. The highlight is the cortege of giants (in French: Cort√®ge des g√©ants), with David and Goliath as the most famous characters.

He declared himself thirty-one and thirty-two during his arraignment in 1610. - 27 May 1610) was a French Catholic zealot who assassinated King Henry IV of France in 1610. Biography =Early life and education= Ravaillac was born at Angoul√™me of an educated family: his grandfather Fran√ßois Ravaillac, was prosecutor of Angoul√™me, and two of his uncles were canons of the Cathedral of Angoul√™me.Anita M. Walker and Edmund H. Dickerman, \\"Mind of an assassin: Ravaillac and the murder of Henry IV of France\\", Canadian Journal of History, August 1995, p. 2; Genealogy of Fran√ßois Ravaillac His father Jean Ravaillac was a violent man whose many misdeeds were a public scandal and caused legal difficulties; his mother Fran√ßoise Dubreuil (sister of the canons) was known for her Catholic piety. The son Ravaillac began work as a servant, later becoming a school teacher. Obsessed by religion, he sought admission to the ascetic Feuillants order, but after a short probation, he was dismissed as being \\"prey to visions.\\" An application in 1606 for admission to the Society of Jesus was also unsuccessful. =Regicide= Assassination of Henry IV, engraving by Gaspar Bouttats. Ravaillac murdering Henry IV, rue de la Ferronnerie in Paris In 1609, Ravaillac claimed to have experienced a vision instructing him to convince King Henry IV to convert the Huguenots to Catholicism. Between Pentecost 1609 and May 1610, Ravaillac made three separate trips to Paris to tell his vision to the king, and lodged with Charlotte du Tillet, mistress of Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, duc d'√âpernon. Unable to meet the king, Ravaillac interpreted Henry's decision to invade the Spanish Netherlands as the start of a war against the Pope. Determined to stop him, he decided to kill the king. On 14 May 1610, Ravaillac lay in wait in the Rue de la Ferronnerie in Paris (now south of the Forum des Halles); when the king passed, his carriage was halted by a blockage in the street, and Ravaillac stabbed Henry to death. Pierre de l'Estoile, the chronicler, stated of the king: Hercule, Duke of Montbazon riding with Henry was wounded in the attack. Ravaillac was immediately seized by police and taken to the H√¥tel de Retz to avoid a mob lynching. He was transferred to the Conciergerie. =Trial and execution= During interrogation, Ravaillac was frequently tortured to make him identify accomplices, but he denied that he had any and insisted that he acted alone. His knowing the king's route and the blockage of traffic that put the king within reach excited speculation. The king was on his way to visit Sully, who lay ill in the Arsenal; his purpose was to make final preparations for imminent military intervention in the disputed succession to J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg after the death of Duke John William. The intervention on behalf of a Calvinist candidate would have brought him in conflict with the Catholic Habsburg dynasty.Walker and Dickerman 1995, on-line text page 1. Ravaillac seems to have learned of the plans; in his tortured mind, \\"he had seen that the king wanted to make war on the pope, in order to transfer the Holy See to Paris.\\"Ravaillac, quoted in Anita W. Walker and Edmund H. Dickerman, \\"Mind of an assassin: Ravaillac and the murder of Henry IV of France\\", Canadian Journal of History (August 1995); [ on-line text] At the start of the interrogation, Ravaillac said, \\"I know very well he is dead; I saw the blood on my knife and the place where I hit him. But I have no regrets at all about dying, because I've done what I came to do.\\"Proc√®s, examen de Ravaillac, M√©moires de Cond√©, 6 vols. (Amsterdam, 1743), 6:217, quoted in Walker and Dickerman 1995 (on-line text, page 1). On May 27, he was taken to the Place de Gr√®ve in Paris and was tortured one last time before being pulled apart by four horses, a method of execution reserved for regicides. Alistair Horne describes the torture Ravaillac suffered: \\"Before being drawn and quartered... he was scalded with burning sulphur, molten lead and boiling oil and resin, his flesh then being torn by pincers.\\" Following his execution, Ravaillac's parents were forced into exile, and the rest of his family was ordered never to use the name \\"Ravaillac\\" again. In January 1611, Mme Jacqueline d'Escoman, who had known Ravaillac, denounced the Duc d'√âpernon as the one responsible for the death of Henry IV; she was jailed for the rest of her life. Philippe Erlanger, in his book L'√âtrange Mort de Henri IV (1957, rev. 1999), reveals √âpernon's association with Ravaillac through his mistress. He concludes that he, the King's mistress Henriette d'Entragues and Charlotte du Tillet planned the assassination. The contrary view, that Ravaillac had no accomplices but his confessors,\\"Almost up to the time of the assassination he continued to consult with clerics, a risky and highly ambivalent behaviour which invited discovery or prevention, and at the same time precluded both.\\" (Walker and Dickerman 1995 (on-line text p.17) is expressed by Roland Mousnier in L'Assassinat d'Henri IV: 14 mai 1610 (Paris, 1964).

IntServ can for example be used to allow video and sound to reach the receiver without interruption. IntServ specifies a fine-grained QoS system, which is often contrasted with DiffServ's coarse-grained control system. Under IntServ, every router in the system implements IntServ, and every application that requires some kind of QoS guarantee has to make an individual reservation. Flow specs describe what the reservation is for, while RSVP is the underlying mechanism to signal it across the network. Flow specs  There are two parts to a flow spec: * What does the traffic look like? Done in the Traffic SPECification part, also known as TSPEC. * What guarantees does it need? Done in the service Request SPECification part, also known as RSPEC. TSPECs include token bucket algorithm parameters. The idea is that there is a token bucket which slowly fills up with tokens, arriving at a constant rate. Every packet which is sent requires a token, and if there are no tokens, then it cannot be sent. Thus, the rate at which tokens arrive dictates the average rate of traffic flow, while the depth of the bucket dictates how 'bursty' the traffic is allowed to be. TSPECs typically just specify the token rate and the bucket depth. For example, a video with a refresh rate of 75 frames per second, with each frame taking 10 packets, might specify a token rate of 750 Hz, and a bucket depth of only 10. The bucket depth would be sufficient to accommodate the 'burst' associated with sending an entire frame all at once. On the other hand, a conversation would need a lower token rate, but a much higher bucket depth. This is because there are often pauses in conversations, so they can make do with less tokens by not sending the gaps between words and sentences. However, this means the bucket depth needs to be increased to compensate for the traffic being burstier. RSPECs specify what requirements there are for the flow: it can be normal internet 'best effort', in which case no reservation is needed. This setting is likely to be used for webpages, FTP, and similar applications. The 'Controlled Load' setting mirrors the performance of a lightly loaded network: there may be occasional glitches when two people access the same resource by chance, but generally both delay and drop rate are fairly constant at the desired rate. This setting is likely to be used by soft QoS applications. The 'Guaranteed' setting gives an absolutely bounded service, where the delay is promised to never go above a desired amount, and packets never dropped, provided the traffic stays within spec.  RSVP  The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is described in RFC 2205. All machines on the network capable of sending QoS data send a PATH message every 30 seconds, which spreads out through the networks. Those who want to listen to them send a corresponding RESV (short for \\"Reserve\\") message which then traces the path backwards to the sender. The RESV message contains the flow specs. The routers between the sender and listener have to decide if they can support the reservation being requested, and, if they cannot, they send a reject message to let the listener know about it. Otherwise, once they accept the reservation they have to carry the traffic. The routers then store the nature of the flow, and also police it. This is all done in soft state, so if nothing is heard for a certain length of time, then the reader will time out and the reservation will be cancelled. This solves the problem if either the sender or the receiver crash or are shut down incorrectly without first cancelling the reservation. The individual routers may, at their option, police the traffic to check that it conforms to the flow specs.  Problems  In order for IntServ to work, all routers along the traffic path must support it. Furthermore, many states must be stored in each router. As a result, IntServ works on a small-scale, but as the system scales up to the size of the Internet, it is difficult to keep track of all of the reservations. One way to solve the scalability problem is by using a multi-level approach, where per- microflow resource reservation (such as resource reservation for individual users) is done in the edge network, while in the core network resources are reserved for aggregate flows only. The routers that lie between these different levels must adjust the amount of aggregate bandwidth reserved from the core network so that the reservation requests for individual flows from the edge network can be better satisfied.RFC 3175 References * \\"Deploying IP and MPLS QoS for Multiservice Networks: Theory and Practice\\" by John Evans, Clarence Filsfils (Morgan Kaufmann, 2007, ) External links * RFC 1633 - Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: an Overview * RFC 2211 - Specification of the Controlled-Load Network Element Service * RFC 2212 - Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service * RFC 2215 - General Characterization Parameters for Integrated Service Network Elements * RFC 2205 - Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) * Cisco.com, Cisco Whitepaper about IntServ and DiffServ Internet Standards Internet architecture Quality of service ","title":"Integrated services"},{"id":"175207","text":"The Act of Uniformity 1662 (14 Car 2 c 4) is an Act of the Parliament of England. (It was formerly cited as 13 & 14 Ch.2 c. 4, by reference to the regnal year when it was passed on 19 May 1662.) It prescribed the form of public prayers, administration of sacraments, and other rites of the Established Church of England, according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. Adherence to this was required in order to hold any office in government or the church, although the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer prescribed by the Act was so new that most people had never even seen a copy. The Act also required that the Book of Common Prayer 'be truly and exactly Translated into the British or Welsh Tongue'. It also explicitly required episcopal ordination for all ministers, i.e. deacons, priests and bishops, which had to be reintroduced since the Puritans had abolished many features of the Church during the Civil War. A few sections of this Act were still in force in the United Kingdom at the end of 2010.The Chronological Table of the Statutes, 1235 - 2010. The Stationery Office. 2011. . Part I. Page 63, read with pages viii and x. Great Ejection As an immediate result of this Act, over 2,000 clergymen refused to take the oath and were expelled from the Church of England in what became known as the Great Ejection of 1662. Although there had already been ministers outside the established church, this created the concept of non-conformity, with a substantial section of English society excluded from public affairs for a century and a half. Clarendon Code The Act of Uniformity itself is one of four crucial pieces of legislation, known as the Clarendon Code, named after Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, Charles II's Lord Chancellor. They are: *The Corporation Act (1661) - This first of the four statutes which made up the Clarendon Code required all municipal officials to take Anglican communion, and formally reject the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. The effect of this act was to exclude nonconformists from public office. This legislation was rescinded in 1828. *The Act of Uniformity 1662 - This second statute made use of the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious service. Upwards of 2000 clergy refused to comply with this act, and were forced to resign their livings. *The Conventicle Act (1664) - This act forbade conventicles (a meeting for unauthorized worship) of more than 5 people who were not members of the same household. The purpose was to prevent dissenting religious groups from meeting. *The Five Mile Act (1665) - This final act of the Clarendon Code was aimed at Nonconformist ministers, who were forbidden from coming within five miles of incorporated towns or the place of their former livings. They were also forbidden to teach in schools. This act was not rescinded until 1812. Combined with the Test Act, the Corporation Acts excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Another Act, the Quaker Act (1662), required subjects to swear an oath of allegiance to the king, which Quakers did not do out of religious conviction. The Book of Common Prayer introduced by Charles II was substantially the same as Elizabeth's version of 1559, itself based on Cranmer's earlier versions of 1549 and 1552. Apart from minor changes this remains the official and permanent legal version of prayer authorised by Parliament and Church. Act of Toleration The Toleration Act 1688 allowed certain dissenters places and freedom to worship, provided they accept to subscribe to an oath. Modified in 1872 The provisions of the Act of Uniformity 1662 were modified and partly revoked by the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act 1872.

It was one of the English penal laws that sought to enforce conformity to the established Church of England, and to expel any who did not conform. It forbade clergymen from living within five miles (8 km) of a parish from which they had been expelled, unless they swore an oath never to resist the king, or attempt to alter the government of Church or State. The latter involved swearing to obey the 1662 prayer book. Thousands of ministers were deprived of a living under this act. As an example Theodosia Alleine and her husband Joseph Alleine were obliged to move in Somerset after her husband's conviction as a non-conformist. They moved, but they were still harassed and had to move to live with friends to avoid their critic's attention.

The penal laws in general were repealed in the 19th century during the process of Catholic Emancipation. Penal actions are civil in nature and were not English common law. Elizabethan * The Act of Supremacy 1558 (1 Eliz 1 c 1), confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and imposed an Oath of Supremacy which required any person taking public or church office in England to swear allegiance to the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. It also made it a crime to assert the authority of any foreign prince, prelate, or other authority, and was aimed at abolishing the authority of the Pope in England. All who maintained the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority of any foreign prelate were to forfeit all goods and chattels, both real and personal, and all benefices for the first offence, or in case the value of these was below 20 pounds, to be imprisoned for one year; they were liable to the forfeitures of praemunire for the second offence. The penalties of praemunire were: exclusion from the sovereign's protection, forfeiture of all lands and goods, arrest to answer to the Sovereign and Council.Burton, Edwin, Edward D'Alton, and Jarvis Kelley. \\"Penal Laws.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 28 August 2018 * The Act of Uniformity 1558 (1 Eliz 1 c 2) set the order of prayer to be used in the English Book of Common Prayer and required all persons to go to church once a week or be fined. It punished all clerics who used any other service by deprivation and imprisonment. * The Supremacy of the Crown Act 1562 (5 Eliz 1 c 1) made a second offence of refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy treason. =Response to Regnans in Excelsis= In 1570 Pope Pius V excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I with the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis. In response: * 13 Eliz. c.1 made it high treason to affirm that the queen ought not to enjoy the Crown, or to declare her to be a heretic or schismatic; * 13 Eliz. c. 2, which made it high treason to put into effect any papal Bull of absolution, to absolve or reconcile any person to the Catholic Church, or to be so absolved or reconciled, or to procure or publish any papal Bull or writing whatsoever. The penalties of praemunire were enacted against all who brought into England or who gave to others \\"Agnus Dei\\" or articles blessed by the pope or by any one through faculties from him. * 13 Eliz. c. 3, was designed to stop Catholics from taking refuge abroad, and declared that any subject departing the realm without the queen's license, and not returning within six months, should forfeit the profits of his lands during life and all his goods and chattels. * The Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience (23 Eliz. c. 1), passed in 1581. This made it high treason to reconcile anyone or to be reconciled to \\"the Romish religion\\", prohibited Mass under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. This act also increased the penalty for not attending the Anglican service to the sum of twenty pounds a month, or imprisonment till the fine be paid, or till the offender went to the Anglican Church. A further penalty of ten pounds a month was inflicted on anyone keeping a schoolmaster who did not attend the Anglican service. The schoolmaster himself was to be imprisoned for one year. * An act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons, (27 Eliz.1, c. 2) commanded all Roman Catholic priests to leave the country in 40 days or they be punished for high treason, unless within the 40 days they swore an oath to obey the Queen. Those who harbored them, and all those who knew of their presence and failed to inform the authorities would be fined and imprisoned, or where the authorities wished to make an example of them, they might be executed. This statute, under which most of the English martyrs suffered, made it high treason for any Jesuit or any seminary priest to be in England at all, and felony for any one to harbour or relieve them. The penalties of praemunire were imposed on all who sent assistance to the seminaries abroad, and a fine of 100 pounds for each offence on those who sent their children overseas without the royal licence. Clarendon Code While some of the Penal Laws were much older, they took their most drastic shape during the reign of Charles II, especially the laws known as the Clarendon Code and the Test Act. The four penal laws collectively known as Clarendon Code are named after Charles II's chief minister Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, though Clarendon was neither their author nor fully in favour of them.History Learning Site - The Clarendon Code These included: *the Corporation Act (1661) required all municipal officials to take Anglican communion, and formally reject the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. The effect of this act was to exclude nonconformists from public office. While the legislation was not rescinded until 1828, the legal power to enforce it lapsed in 1663, and therefore many evicted officials were able to regain their positions after a few years. Harris, Tim, Politics Under the Later Stuarts: Party Conflict In a Divided Society, 1660-1715. London: Longman, 1993. p. 39. *the Act of Uniformity (1662) made use of the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious service. Over two thousand clergy refused to comply and so were forced to resign their livings (the Great Ejection). The provisions of the act were modified by the Act of Uniformity Amendment Act, of 1872. *the Conventicle Act (1664) forbade conventicles (a meeting for unauthorized worship) of more than five people who were not members of the same household. The purpose was to prevent dissenting religious groups from meeting. *the Five Mile Act (1665) forbade nonconformist ministers from coming within five miles of incorporated towns or the place of their former livings. They were also forbidden to teach in schools. Most of the Act's effects were repealed by 1689, but it was not formally abolished until 1812. Combined with the Test Act, the Corporation Act excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Further penal laws in Great Britain In the late 17th and 18th centuries, many non-conformist Protestants successfully evaded the political disabilities imposed by the Test Act by taking communion in the Church of England as required, while otherwise attending non-conformist meetings. High churchmen and Tories, empowered late in Queen Anne's reign, sought to close this loophole with the passing of the Occasional Conformity Bill in 1711, however the Act was repealed after the Hanoverian Succession with the return to power of the Whigs, who were generally allied with non-conforming Protestants. In the wake of the Jacobite Rising of 1715, the British parliament also passed the Disarming Act of 1716. Penal laws in Ireland The Penal Laws were introduced into Ireland in the year 1695, disenfranchising nonconformists in favour of the minority established Church of Ireland. Though the laws also affected adherents of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (who were concentrated in Ulster), their principal victims were members of the Catholic Church, meaning over three quarters of the population. These laws included: *Education Act 1695 *Banishment Act 1697 *Registration Act 1704 *Popery Act 1704 and 1709 *Disenfranchising Act 1728 The laws were eventually repealed from the 1770s by the Papists Act 1778 and the 1774 Quebec Act. The British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was followed in Ireland in 1793. Finally in 1829 Catholic emancipation was enacted, largely due to Irish political agitation organised under Daniel O'Connell in the 1820s, but effects of the laws in terms of sectarianism between Catholics and Protestants can still be seen, particularly in Northern Ireland, today.

The related term cryptohistory is applied to a pseudohistory based upon or derived from the superstitions inherent to occultism. Pseudohistory is related to pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap. Although pseudohistory comes in many forms, scholars have identified many features that tend to be common in pseudohistorical works. One such feature is that pseudohistory is nearly always motivated by a contemporary political, religious, or personal agenda. Pseudohistory also frequently presents a big lie or sensational claims about historical facts which would require the radical revision (re-writing) of the historical record. Another very common feature of pseudohistory is the assumption that there is a conspiracy among scholars to suppress the \\"true\\" history in favor of \\"mainstream history\\", which is commonly corroborated by elaborate conspiracy theories. Works of pseudohistory often rely exclusively on sources that appear to support the thesis being promoted while ignoring sources that contradict it. Many works of pseudohistory treat myths, legends, and other unreliable sources as literal historical truth while ignoring or dismissing evidence to the contrary. Sometimes a work of pseudohistory may adopt a position of extreme skepticism, sometimes insisting that there is really no such thing as historical truth and that any hypothesis is just as good as any other. Many works of pseudohistory conflate mere possibility with actuality, assuming that if something could have happened, then it did. Definition and etymology The term pseudohistory was coined in the early nineteenth century, which makes the word older than the related terms pseudo- scholarship and pseudoscience. Monthly magazine and British register, Volume 55 (February 1823), p. 449, in reference to John Galt, Ringan Gilhaize: Or, The Covenanters, Oliver & Boyd, 1823. In an attestation from 1815, it is used to refer to the Contest of Homer and Hesiod, a purportedly historical narrative describing an entirely fictional contest between the Greek poets Homer and Hesiod.C. A. Elton, Remains of Hesiod the Ascraean 1815, p. xix. The pejorative sense of the term, labelling a flawed or disingenuous work of historiography, is found in another 1815 attestation.The Critical review: or, Annals of literature, Volume 1 ed. Tobias George Smollett, 1815, p. 152 Pseudohistory is akin to pseudoscience in that both forms of falsification are achieved using the methodology that purports to, but does not, adhere to the established standards of research for the given field of intellectual enquiry of which the pseudoscience claims to be a part, and which offers little or no supporting evidence for its plausibility. Writers Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman define pseudohistory as \\"the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes\\". Other writers take a broader definition; Douglas Allchin, a historian of science, contends that when the history of scientific discovery is presented in a simplified way, with drama exaggerated and scientists romanticized, this creates wrong stereotypes about how science works, and in fact constitutes pseudohistory, despite being based on real facts. Characteristics Robert Todd Carroll has developed a list of criteria to identify pseudo-historic works. He states that: \\"Pseudohistory is purported history which: * Treats myths, legends, sagas and similar literature as literal truth * Is neither critical nor skeptical in its reading of ancient historians, taking their claims at face value and ignoring empirical or logical evidence contrary to the claims of the ancients * Is on a mission, not a quest, seeking to support some contemporary political or religious agenda rather than find out the truth about the past * Often denies that there is such a thing as historical truth, clinging to the extreme skeptical notion that only what is absolutely certain can be called 'true' and nothing is absolutely certain, so nothing is true * Often maintains that history is nothing but mythmaking and that different histories are not to be compared on such traditional academic standards as accuracy, empirical probability, logical consistency, relevancy, completeness, fairness, honesty, etc., but on moral or political grounds * Is selective in its use of ancient documents, citing favorably those that fit with its agenda, and ignoring or interpreting away those documents which don't fit * Considers the possibility of something being true as sufficient to believe it is true if it fits with one's agenda * Often maintains that there is a conspiracy to suppress its claims because of racism, atheism or ethnocentrism, or because of opposition to its political or religious agenda\\"Carroll, Robert Todd. The skeptic's dictionary. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons (2003), p. 305. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke prefers the term \\"cryptohistory.\\" He identifies two necessary elements as \\"a complete ignorance of the primary sources\\" and the repetition of \\"inaccuracies and wild claims\\".Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, p. 225 (Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2005 edition). Other common characteristics of pseudohistory are: * The arbitrary linking of disparate events so as to form ‚Äì in the theorist's opinion ‚Äì a pattern. This is typically then developed into a conspiracy theory postulating a hidden agent responsible for creating and maintaining the pattern. For example, the pseudohistorical The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail links the Knights Templar, the medieval Grail Romances, the Merovingian Frankish dynasty and the artist Nicolas Poussin in an attempt to identify lineal descendants of Jesus. * Hypothesising the consequences of unlikely events that \\"could\\" have happened, thereby assuming tacitly that they did. * Sensationalism, or shock value * Cherry picking evidence that helps the historical argument being made and suppressing evidence that hurts it.Ellis, Joseph J. American Dialogue: The Founders and Us. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2018. p. 168. Categories and examples The following are some common categories of pseudohistorical theory, with examples. Note that not all theories in a listed category are necessarily pseudohistorical; they are rather categories that seem to attract pseudohistorians. =Ancient aliens, ancient technologies, and lost lands= Immanuel Velikovsky's books Worlds in Collision (1950), Ages in Chaos (1952), and Earth in Upheaval (1955), which became \\"instant bestsellers\\", demonstrated that pseudohistory based on ancient mythology held potential for tremendous financial success and became models of success for future works in the genre. In 1968, Erich von D√§niken published Chariots of the Gods?, which claims that ancient visitors from outer space constructed the pyramids and other monuments. He has since published other books in which he makes similar claims. These claims have all been categorized as pseudohistory. Similarly, Zechariah Sitchin has published numerous books claiming that a race of extraterrestrial beings from the Planet Nibiru known as the Anunnaki visited Earth in ancient times in search of gold, and that they genetically engineered humans to serve as their slaves. He claims that memories of these occurrences are recorded in Sumerian mythology, as well as other mythologies all across the globe. These speculations have likewise been categorized as pseudohistory. The ancient astronaut hypothesis was further popularized in the United States by the History Channel television series Ancient Aliens. History professor Ronald H. Fritze observed that the pseudohistorical claims promoted by von D√§niken and the Ancient Aliens program have a periodic popularity in the US: \\"In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions.\\" The author Graham Hancock has sold over four million copies of books promoting the pseudohistorical thesis that all the major monuments of the ancient world, including Stonehenge, the Egyptian pyramids, and the moai of Easter Island, were built by a single ancient supercivilization, which Hancock claims thrived from 15,000 to 10,000 BC and possessed technological and scientific knowledge equal to or surpassing that of modern civilization. He first advanced the full form of this argument in his 1995 bestseller Fingerprints of the Gods, which won popular acclaim, but scholarly disdain. Christopher Knight has published numerous books, including Uriel's Machine (2000), expounding pseudohistorical assertions that ancient civilizations possessed technology far more advanced than the technology of today.Merriman, Nick, editor, Public Archaeology, Routledge, 2004 p. 260Tonkin, S., 2003, Uriel's Machine ‚Äì a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions. The claim that a lost continent known as Lemuria once existed in the Pacific Ocean has likewise been categorized as pseudohistory. =Antisemitic pseudohistory= American edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion from 1934 The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is a fraudulent work purporting to show a historical conspiracy for world domination by Jews. The work was conclusively proven to be a forgery in August 1921, when The Times revealed that extensive portions of the document were directly plagiarized from Maurice Joly's 1864 satirical dialogue The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, as well as Hermann Goedsche's 1868 anti-Semitic novel Biarritz.. The Khazar theory is an academic fringe theory that postulates that the bulk of European Jewry are of Central Asian (Turkic) origin. In spite of mainstream academic consensus, this theory has been promoted in Anti-Semitic and Anti-Zionist circles alike, arguing that Jews are an alien element both in Europe and in Palestine. Holocaust denial and genocide denial in general are widely categorized as pseudohistory. Major proponents of Holocaust denial include David Irving and others, who argue that the Holocaust, Holodomor, Armenian genocide, and other genocides did not occur, or were exaggerated greatly. Many Muslims deny the Jewish history of Jerusalem and in particular deny the existence of the Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount.Hazony, David. \\"Temple Denial In the Holy City\\", The New York Sun, March 7, 2007. =Alternative chronologies= An alternative chronology is a revised sequence of events that deviates from the standard timeline of world history accepted by mainstream scholars. An example of an \\"alternative chronology\\" is Anatoly Fomenko's New Chronology, which claims that recorded history actually began around the year 800 AD and all events that allegedly occurred prior to that point either never really happened at all or are simply inaccurate retellings of events that happened later. Other, less extreme examples, are the phantom time hypothesis, which asserts that the years AD 614‚Äì911 never took place; and the New Chronology of David Rohl, which claims that the accepted timelines for ancient Egyptian and Israelite history are wrong.\\"In his book A Test of Time (1995), Rohl argues that the conventionally accepted dates for strata such as the Middle and Late Bronze Ages in Palestine are wrong\\" ‚Äì in Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani, Israel and The Palestinian Territories: The Rough Guide, p. 424 (Rough Guides Ltd., 2nd revised edition, 1998). =Historical falsification= Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, a scene from which is shown in this fifteenth-century illumination, was a popular work of pseudohistory during the Middle Ages. In the eighth century, a forged document known as Donation of Constantine, which supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope, became widely circulated. In the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth published the History of the Kings of Britain, a pseudohistorical work purporting to describe the ancient history and origins of the British people. The book synthesises earlier Celtic mythical traditions to inflate the deeds of the mythical King Arthur. The contemporary historian William of Newburgh wrote around 1190 that \\"it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others\\". =Historical revisionism= The Shakespeare authorship question is a fringe theory that claims that the works attributed to William Shakespeare were actually written by someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.Hope, Warren and Kim Holston.

Shakespeare scholars regard Oxfordianism as pseudo-scholarship which arbitrarily discards the methods used by real historians. ...

This argument currently finds very little support among scholars and historians of all faiths and has been described as pseudohistorical.In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, Bart Ehrman (a secular agnostic) wrote: \\"He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees\\" B. Ehrman, 2011 Forged : writing in the name of God . p. 285Robert M. Price (an atheist who denies the existence of Jesus) agrees that this perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars: Robert M.

Beilby & Paul Rhodes Eddy, 2009 InterVarsity, p. 61Michael Grant (a classicist) states that \\"In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary.\\" in Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels by Michael Grant 2004 p. 200Richard A.

Confederate revisionists (a.k.a. \\"Civil War revisionists\\"), Lost Cause of the Confederacy, and Neo- Confederates argue that the Confederate States of America's prime motivation was the maintenance of states' rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of slavery. =Ethnocentric revisionism= Most Afrocentric (i.e. Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories, see Ancient Egyptian race controversy) ideas have been identified as pseudohistorical, alongside the \\"Indigenous Aryans\\" theories published by Hindu nationalists during the 1990s and 2000s. The \\"crypto-history\\" developed within Germanic mysticism and Nazi occultism has likewise been placed under this categorization.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. 1985. The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany, 1890‚Äì1935. Wellingborough, England: The Aquarian Press. . (Several reprints.) Expanded with a new Preface, 2004, I.B. Tauris & Co. Among leading Nazis, Heinrich Himmler is believed to have been influenced by occultism and according to one theory, developed the SS base at Wewelsburg in accordance with an esoteric plan. The Sun Language Theory is a pseudohistorical ideology which argues that all languages are descended from a form of proto-Turkish. The theory may have been partially devised in order to legitimize Arabic and Semitic loanwords occurring in the Turkish language by instead asserting that the Arabic and Semitic words were derived from the Turkish ones rather than vice versa.Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. , p. 165. A large number of nationalist pseudohistorical theories deal with the legendary Ten Lost Tribes of ancient Israel. British-Israelism, also known as Anglo-Israelism, the most famous example of this type, has been conclusively refuted by mainstream historians using evidence from a vast array of different fields of study. Another form of ethnocentric revisionism is nationalistic pseudohistory. The \\"Ancient Macedonians continuity theory\\" is one such pseudohistorical theory, which postulates demographic, cultural and linguistic continuity between Macedonians of antiquity and the main ethnic group in present-day North Macedonia.Anastas Vangeli, Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/00905992.2010.532775 Published online by Cambridge University Press: 20 November 2018. =Racist pseudohistory= Josiah Priest and other nineteenth-century American writers wrote pseudohistorical narratives that portrayed African Americans and Native Americans in an extremely negative light. Priest's first book was The Wonders of Nature and Providence, Displayed. (1826). The book is regarded by modern critics as one of the earliest works of modern American pseudohistory. Priest attacked Native Americans in American Antiquities and Discoveries of the West (1833) and African-Americans in Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro (1843). Other nineteenth-century writers, such as Thomas Gold Appleton, in his A Sheaf of Papers (1875), and George Perkins Marsh, in his The Goths in New England, seized upon false notions of Viking history to promote the superiority of white people (as well as to oppose the Catholic Church). Such misuse of Viking history and imagery reemerged in the twentieth century among some groups promoting white supremacy. =Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories= Most theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, excluding the Norse colonization of the Americas, and other reputable scholarship, have been classified as pseudohistory, including claims that the Americas were actually discovered by Arabs or Muslims. Gavin Menzies' book 1421: The Year China Discovered the World, which argues for the idea that Chinese sailors discovered America, has also been categorized as a work of pseudohistory. =Psychohistory= Psychohistory is an amalgam of psychology, history, and related social sciences and the humanities.Paul H. Elovitz, Ed., Psychohistory for the Twenty-First Century (2013) p. 1-3. Note that there are varying definitions by accomplished and often distinguished psychohistorians such as Peter Loewenberg (UCLA), Charles B. Strozier (CUNY Graduate School), George Kren (Kansas State University), Bruce Mazlish (MIT), Paul Roazen (York University--Canada), J. Donald Hughes (University of Denver), Vamik Volkan (University of Virginia Medical School), Henry Lawton (Author of The Psychohistorians Handbook, 1988), Jacques Szaluta (US Merchant Marine Academy) and others. It examines the \\"why\\" of history, especially the difference between stated intention and actual behavior. It works to combine the insights of psychology, especially psychoanalysis, with the research methodology of the social sciences and humanities to understand the emotional origin of the behavior of individuals, groups and nations, past and present. Mainstream historians have categorized it as pseudohistory. =Religious pseudohistory= The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln is a book which purports to show that certain historical figures, such as Godfrey of Bouillon, and contemporary aristocrats are the lineal descendants of Jesus. Mainstream historians have widely panned the book, categorizing it as pseudohistory, and pointing out that the genealogical tables used in it are now known to be spurious. Nonetheless, the book was an international best-seller and inspired Dan Brown's bestselling mystery thriller novel The Da Vinci Code. Although historians and archaeologists consider the Book of Mormon to be an anachronistic invention of Joseph Smith, many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that it describes ancient historical events in the Americas. Another example of religious pseudohistory is the thesis, found in the writings of David Barton and others, asserting that the United States was founded as an exclusively Christian nation.Boston Theological Institute Newsletter Volume XXXIV, No. 17, Richard V. Pierard, January 25, 2005 Mainstream historians instead support the traditional position, which holds that the American founding fathers intended for church and state to be kept separate.Boston, Rob (2007). \\"Dissecting the religious right's favorite Bible Curriculum\\", Americans United for Separation of Church and State, American Humanist Association. Retrieved on April 9, 2013 Searches for Noah's Ark have also been categorized as pseudohistory.Dietz, Robert S. \\"Ark-Eology: A Frightening Example of Pseudo-Science\\" in Geotimes 38:9 (Sept. 1993) p. 4. In her books, starting with The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), English author Margaret Murray claimed that the witch trials in the early modern period were actually an attempt by chauvinistic Christians to annihilate a secret, pagan religion, which she claimed worshipped a Horned God. Murray's claims have now been widely rejected by respected historians. Nonetheless, her ideas have become the foundation myth for modern Wicca, a contemporary Neopagan religion. Belief in Murray's alleged witch-cult is still prevalent among Wiccans, but is gradually declining. Hinduism The belief that Ancient India was technologically advanced to the extent of being a nuclear power is gaining popularity in India. Emerging extreme nationalist trends and ideologies based on Hinduism in the political arena promote these discussions. Vasudev Devnani, the education minister for the western state of Rajasthan, said in January 2017 that it was important to \\"understand the scientific significance\\" of the cow, as it was the only animal in the world to both inhale and exhale oxygen. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of doctors and medical staff at a Mumbai hospital that the story of the Hindu god Ganesha showed genetic science existed in ancient India. Many new age pseudohistorians who focus on converting mythological stories into history are well received among the crowd. Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy is a related event when Capt. Anand J. Bodas, retired principal of a pilot training facility, claimed that aircraft more advanced than today's versions existed in ancient India at the Indian Science Congress.

Rhizomes are also called creeping rootstalks or just rootstalks. Rhizomes develop from axillary buds and grow horizontally. The rhizome also retains the ability to allow new shoots to grow upwards. A rhizome is the main stem of the plant. A stolon is similar to a rhizome, but a stolon sprouts from an existing stem, has long internodes, and generates new shoots at the end, such as in the strawberry plant. In general, rhizomes have short internodes, send out roots from the bottom of the nodes, and generate new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes. A stem tuber is a thickened part of a rhizome or stolon that has been enlarged for use as a storage organ. In general, a tuber is high in starch, e.g. the potato, which is a modified stolon. The term \\"tuber\\" is often used imprecisely and is sometimes applied to plants with rhizomes. If a rhizome is separated each piece may be able to give rise to a new plant. The plant uses the rhizome to store starches, proteins, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter. This is a process known as vegetative reproduction and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants. This also allows for lateral spread of grasses like bamboo and bunch grasses. Examples of plants that are propagated this way include hops, asparagus, ginger, irises, lily of the valley, cannas, and sympodial orchids. Some rhizomes that are used directly in cooking include ginger, turmeric, galangal, fingerroot, and lotus. Stored rhizomes are subject to bacterial and fungal infections, making them unsuitable for replanting and greatly diminishing stocks. However, rhizomes can also be produced artificially from tissue cultures. The ability to easily grow rhizomes from tissue cultures leads to better stocks for replanting and greater yields. The plant hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid have been found to help induce and regulate the growth of rhizomes, specifically in rhubarb. Ethylene that was applied externally was found to affect internal ethylene levels, allowing easy manipulations of ethylene concentrations. Knowledge of how to use these hormones to induce rhizome growth could help farmers and biologists producing plants grown from rhizomes more easily cultivate and grow better plants. Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some Iris species, and ferns, whose spreading stems are rhizomes. Plants with underground rhizomes include gingers, bamboo, the Venus flytrap, Chinese lantern, western poison-oak, hops, and Alstroemeria, and the weeds Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, and purple nut sedge. Rhizomes generally form a single layer, but in giant horsetails, can be multi-tiered. Many rhizomes have culinary value, and some, such as zhe'ergen, are commonly consumed raw.

As of January 1, 2006, Ch√¢telet had a total population of 35,621. The total area of the municipality is 27.03 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 1,318 inhabitants per km¬≤. It is composed of three separate entities: Ch√¢telet, Bouffioulx and Ch√¢telineau. Ch√¢telet was a long established independent city prior to its fusion with the other entities. History =Origins and Middle Ages= The first settlers of the site of Ch√¢telet, dating from paleolithic times, were attracted by the ford on the river, the nearby wooded areas and flint-rich highlands. This region was continuously populated, first by Celtic, then Gallo-Roman peoples, until the Germanic invasions of the 4th and 5th century. In the 9th century, the land was likely part of emperor Louis the Pious‚Äôs estate. The first occurrence of the name Ch√¢telet appears in a text dating from the time when its territory was given to the chapter of the Li√®ge cathedral in the 12th century. Ch√¢telet obtained its charter of rights in 1220, symbolized by the perron. The protection later afforded by the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge made the city into an important administrative, cultural, and economic centre, which could boast four annual trade fairs and a weekly cattle market. It became one of the 23 bonne villes (main cities) of the prince-bishopric in 1655. While Ch√¢telet's economy was dominated by artisanal guilds and trade, that of its neighbours, including Ch√¢telineau and Bouffioulx, remained mostly agricultural. =18th century until now= The 18th century first witnessed the gradual shift of the regional economic power from Ch√¢telet to the newly founded neighbouring city of Charleroi. This was also a time of political instability as the various powers of the day (Spain, France, Austria) fought for supremacy in this region. By the end of the century, the main economic drivers of the whole Sambre valley had become coal and heavy industry. The prosperity that came with the industrial revolution accounts for much of the population growth of the 1800s: Ch√¢telet grew by a factor 5 in less than a century; Ch√¢telineau grew by a factor 20 between 1811 and 1950 to more than 18,000 inhabitants. Many of the current city streets can be dated from that period. Cultural activities and artistic talent flourished as well. Chatelet, and, in particular, Bouffioux, became well known for the production of its potteries. Originally formed in coal-fired kilns, the works from the region became internationally sought after. Three major producers still exist in the region and continue to produce artistic, as well as useful, pottery, but on a much smaller scale. The 20th century was not kind to the region but despite having witnessed two world wars and the decline of most of its industries, Ch√¢telet is now again a regional center for trade, culture, and educational services.

This law was enforced by the writ of praemunire facias, a writ of summons from which the law takes its name. The name praemunire may denote the statute, the writ, or the offence. Praemunire in classical Latin means to fortify. In medieval Latin, praemunire was confused with and used for praemonere, to forewarn, as the writ commanded that the sheriff do (facias) warn (praemunire) the summoned person to appear before the Court.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. praemunire. Second edition, 1989. Background A controversy arose between the English kings and the Court of Rome concerning the filling of ecclesiastical benefices by means of papal provisions \\"by which the Pope, suspending for the time the right of the patron, nominated of his own authority, to the vacant benefice\\" the papal nominee being called a provisor. Pope Gregory IX (1227‚Äì1241) pronounced against the propriety of such provisions as interfering with the rights of lay patrons; and Pope Innocent IV expressed, in 1253, general disapprobation of these nominations. The Statute of Provisors (1306), passed in the reign of Edward I, was, according to Sir Edward Coke, the foundation of all subsequent statutes of praemunire. This statute enacted \\"that no tax imposed by any religious persons should be sent out of the country whether under the name of a rent, tallage, tribute or any kind of imposition\\". A much greater check on the freedom of action of the popes was imposed by the Statute of Provisors (1351) and the Statute of Praemunire passed in the reign of Edward III. The former of these, after premising \\"that the Pope of Rome, accroaching to him the seignories of possession and benefices of the holy Church of the realm of England doth give and grant the same benefices to aliens which did never dwell in England, and to cardinals, which might not dwell here, and to others as well aliens as denizens, as if he had been patron or advowee of the said dignities and benefices, as he was not of right by the laws of England\\", ordained the free election of all dignities and benefices elective in the manner as they were granted by the king's progenitors. Origin The Statute of Praemunire (16 Ric. 2, c. 5) was passed by the Parliament of England during the reign of Richard II, who purchased various loans from foreign creditors and rulers as well as bulls from Rome in 1392. It was only one of numerous stringent measures passed for the purpose of restraining the Holy See and all forms of papal authority in England and of eliminating in general the influence of foreign powers especially creditors and the Holy Roman Emperor. Because the Papacy had long claimed a form of temporal supremacy over England and Ireland, from the beginning of the 14th century, papal intervention had been particularly active, more especially in two forms. The one, the disposal of ecclesiastical benefices, before the same became vacant, to men of the pope's own choosing; the other, the encouragement of resort to himself and his curia, rather than to the courts of the country, for legal justice. Later developments The Statute of Praemunire (the first statute so called) (1353), though especially levelled at the pretensions of the Roman Curia, was also levelled against the pretensions of any foreign power and therefore was created to maintain the independence of the crown against all pretensions against it. By it, the king \\"at the grievous and clamorous complaints of the great men and commons of the realm of England\\" enacts \\"that all the people of the king's ligeance of what condition that they be, which shall draw any out of the realm in plea\\" or any matter of which the cognizance properly belongs to the king's court shall be allowed two months in which to answer for their contempt of the king's rights in transferring their pleas abroad. The penalties which were attached to the offence under this statute involved the loss of all civil rights, forfeiture of lands, goods and chattels, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure.Kenny, C. Outlines of Criminal Law (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 323 Many other statutes followed that of 1353, but that which was passed in the sixteenth year of Richard II's reign is, as mentioned before, usually referred to as the Statute of Praemunire. This statute, after first stating \\"that the right of recovering the presentments to churches, prebends, and other benefices ... belongeth only to the king‚Äôs court of the old right of his crown, used and approved in the time of all his progenitors kings of England\\", proceeds to condemn the practice of papal translation, and after rehearsing the promise of the three estates of the realm to stand with the king in all cases touching his crown and his regality, enacts \\"that if any purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued in the court of Rome, or elsewhere, any such translations, processes, and sentences of excommunications, bulls, instruments or any other things whatsoever ... he and his notaries, abettors and counsellors\\" shall be put out of the king's protection, and their lands escheat. Praemunire declined in importance, but experienced a resurgence under Henry VIII as the Protestant Reformation unfolded. First individuals were indicted for praemunire, then groups of clergy, and lastly the entire English clergy was accused of being agents of a foreign power (the Pope). In time, Henry asserted himself as \\"of the Church of England in Earth under Jesus Christ Supreme Head\\", and the clergy of the Church of England no longer answered to a foreign power. During the 19th century the Camerlengo of the time would on occasion communicate the death of a Pope to the British monarch (along with other rulers), and made occasional other communications. There was some discussion as to whether the Statute of Praemunire meant that no response could be made: the compromises reached included conveying messages on a 'private' rather than 'official' level, or going via the Hanoverian minister at London (responding as King of Hanover). Eventually it was decided that there was no legal obstacle to establishing formal diplomatic relations.FO 95/736, The National Archives The abolition in 1870 of forfeiture as a penalty for treason and felony did not apply to praemunire because it was a misdemeanour. As of the Criminal Law Act 1967 coming into effect, praemunire facias is no longer an offence in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. At the 2018 Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, suggested that the government might be in breach of this defunct law in regard to its proposed departure settlement with the European Union.

Villages The following villages are part of the municipality of Pont-√†-Celles: Buzet, Liberchies, Luttre, Obaix, Pont-√†-Celles (village that gave its name to the municipality), Thimeon, Viesville. Origin of the name Pont-√†-Celles draws its name from Latin Cella, meaning room or cell of monk, probably because of the presence of the monastery founded in the 7th century, by Saint Amand (apostle of Belgium). The jurisdiction on which this primitive monastery was established, and then the priory of the Park, was called Celles, and later Pont-√†-Celles. The name of Pont-√†-Celles appears for the first time during the 16th century, when the monks of the Park built a bridge over the Pieton river near the church. The parishioners of Luttre and Hairiamont then had to cross the bridge for going to service (hence bridge to Celles, or Pont-√†-Celles in French). Gradually, this name extended to all the parish whose territory covered six seigniories. When in 1795, the French replaced these six seigniories by a newly created municipality, they adopted the name of the parish (Pont-√†-Celles). In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon in Waterloo, its territories were annexed to the Netherlands. With this occasion, the department of Jemappes (to which Pont-√†-Celles belonged) became the province of Hainaut. Notable people from Pont-√†-Celles The famous Jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt was born in Liberchies. Every May, the community honors him with the open air Django Reinhardt Jazz Festival.

A significant milestone was reached in June 1977 when the plant produced its 500,000th vehicle, an Austin Allegro 1300 Special. The Seneffe plant was closed in 1982 as the company's aging model range lost market share across Europe, with further loss of demand resulting from the depressed state of the UK economy at the time. With alternative employment opportunities limited, the plant closure triggered considerable bitterness locally.

The term is used for either the material or the aroma. Incense is used for aesthetic reasons, aromatherapy, meditation, and ceremony. It may also be used as a simple deodorant or insect repellent. Incense is composed of aromatic plant materials, often combined with essential oils. The forms taken by incense differ with the underlying culture, and have changed with advances in technology and increasing number of uses. Incense can generally be separated into two main types: \\"indirect-burning\\" and \\"direct- burning\\". Indirect-burning incense (or \\"non-combustible incense\\") is not capable of burning on its own, and requires a separate heat source. Direct- burning incense (or \\"combustible incense\\") is lit directly by a flame and then fanned or blown out, leaving a glowing ember that smoulders and releases a smoky fragrance. Direct-burning incense is either a paste formed around a bamboo stick, or a paste that is extruded into a stick or cone shape. History The word incense comes from Latin incendere meaning \\"to burn\\". Egyptian Incense Burner, 7th century BC Combustible bouquets were used by the ancient Egyptians, who employed incense in both pragmatic and mystical capacities. The purpose of the usage of incense stickincense, sticks are available distinct sizes and price range. each has an exceptional name and a exceptional fragrance. varies; some human beings use it for the duration of meditation and rituals, even as some use it to kill insects. Incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation, but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma. Resin balls were found in many prehistoric Egyptian tombs in El Mahasna, giving evidence for the prominence of incense and related compounds in Egyptian antiquity. One of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the 5th dynasty. The Temple of Deir-el-Bahari in Egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense. The Babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining oracles. Incense spread from there to Greece and Rome. Incense burners have been found in the Indus Civilization (3300‚Äì1300 BCE). Evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma. India also adopted techniques from East Asia, adapting the formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora. This was the first usage of subterranean plant parts in incense. New herbs like Sarsaparilla seeds, frankincense, and cypress were used by Indians. At around 2000 BCE, Ancient China began the use of incense in the religious sense, namely for worship.Herrera, Matthew D. (2012). Holy Smoke: The Use of Incense in the Catholic Church (2nd ed.). San Luis Obispo: Tixlini Scriptorium. Page 1. Incense was used by Chinese cultures from Neolithic times and became more widespread in the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. The earliest documented use of incense comes from the ancient Chinese, who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products (such as cassia, cinnamon, styrax, and sandalwood) as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites. Incense usage reached its peak during the Song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies. Brought to Japan in the 6th century by Korean Buddhist monks, who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites, the delicate scents of Koh (high-quality Japanese incense) became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the Imperial Court during the Heian Era 200 years later. During the 14th-century Ashikaga shogunate, a samurai warrior might perfume his helmet and armor with incense to achieve an aura of invincibility (as well as to make a noble gesture to whoever might take his head in battle). It wasn't until the Muromachi period during the 15th and 16th century that incense appreciation (k≈çd≈ç) spread to the upper and middle classes of Japanese society. Composition Some commonly used raw incense and incense-making materials (from left to right, top down) Makko powder (Machilus thunbergii), Borneol camphor (Dryobalanops aromatica), Sumatra Benzoin (Styrax benzoin), Omani frankincense (Boswellia sacra), Guggul (Commiphora wightii), Golden Frankincense (Boswellia papyrifera), the new world Tolu balsam (Myroxylon toluifera) from South America, Somali myrrh (Commiphora myrrha), Labdanum (Cistus villosus), Opoponax (Commiphora opoponax), and white Indian sandalwood powder (Santalum album) A variety of materials have been used in making incense. Historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients. For example, sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of North America. Trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the Silk Road and other trade routes, one notably called the Incense Route.Herrera, Matthew D. Holy Smoke: The Use of Incense in the Catholic Church. San Luis Obispo: Tixlini Scriptorium, 2011. www.SmellsBells.com Local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style, but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners, such as clergy and physicians. =Combustible base= A R√§ucherkerzchen ‚Äì A charcoal-based incense cone The combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a self-sustained ember, which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark time. The base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell. Commercially, two types of incense base predominate: *Fuel and oxidizer mixtures: Charcoal or wood powder provides the fuel for combustion while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense. Fragrant materials are added to the base prior to shaping, as in the case of powdered incense materials, or after, as in the case of essential oils. The formula for charcoal-based incense is superficially similar to black powder, though it lacks the sulfur. *Natural plant-based binders: Gums such as Gum Arabic or Gum Tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together. Mucilaginous material, which can be derived from many botanical sources, is mixed with fragrant materials and water. The mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit. The dry binding powder usually comprises about 10% of the dry weight in the finished incense. These include: **Makko (incense powder) made from the bark of various trees in the genus Persea (such as Persea thunbergii) **Xiangnan pi (made from the bark of trees of genus Phoebe such as Phoebe nanmu or Persea zuihoensis. **Jigit: a resin based binder used in India **Laha or Dar: bark based powders used in Nepal, Tibet, and other East Asian countries. Typical compositions burn at a temperature between 220 ¬∞C and 260 ¬∞C. Types Incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing. They can generally be separated into \\"direct-burning\\" and \\"indirect-burning\\" types. Preference for one form or another varies with culture, tradition, and personal taste. The two differ in their composition due to the former's requirement for even, stable, and sustained burning. =Indirect-burning= Indirect-burning incense, also called \\"non-combustible incense\\", is an aromatic material or combination of materials, such as resins, that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source. Finer forms tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually, having less surface area. Heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers. In the West, the best known incense materials of this type are the resins frankincense and myrrh, likely due to their numerous mentions in the Bible. Frankincense means \\"pure incense\\", though in common usage refers specifically to the resin of the boswellia tree. *Whole: The incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers. *Powdered or granulated: Incense broken into smaller pieces burns quickly and provides brief but intense odor. *Paste: Powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky incombustible binder, such as dried fruit, honey, or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles. These may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite. Much Arabian incense, also called \\"Bukhoor\\" or \\"Bakhoor\\", is of this type, and Japan has a history of kneaded incense, called nerik≈ç or awasek≈ç, made using this method. Within the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition, raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweet-smelling essential oils. =Direct- burning= Incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an East Asian temple Direct-burning incense, also called \\"combustible incense\\", is lit directly by a flame. The glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn the rest of the incense without further application of external heat or flame. Direct-burning incense is either extruded, pressed into forms, or coated onto a supporting material. This class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground (or liquid) incense materials and odourless binder. The composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning. The following types are commonly encountered, though direct-burning incense can take nearly any form, whether for expedience or whimsy. Burning incense stick and its smoke *Coil: Extruded and shaped into a coil without a core, coil incense can burn for an extended period, from hours to days, and is commonly produced and used in Chinese cultures. *Cone: Incense in this form burns relatively quickly. Incense cones were invented in Japan in the 1800s. *Cored stick: A supporting core of bamboo is coated with a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core. Higher-quality variations have fragrant sandalwood cores. This type of incense is commonly produced in India and China. When used in Chinese folk religion, these are sometimes known as \\"joss sticks\\". *Dhoop or solid stick: With no bamboo core, dhoop incense is easily broken for portion control. This is the most commonly produced form of incense in Japan and Tibet. *Powder: The loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing. Powder incense is typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks. *Paper: Paper infused with resin or oils extracted from fragrant material, folded accordion style, is lit and blown out. Examples include Carta d'Armenia and Papier d'Arm√©nie. *Rope: The incense powder is rolled into paper sheets, which are then rolled into ropes, twisted tightly, then doubled over and twisted again, yielding a two-strand rope. The larger end is the bight, and may be stood vertically, in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles. The smaller (pointed) end is lit. This type of incense is easily transported and stays fresh for extremely long periods. It has been used for centuries in Tibet and Nepal. Moxa tablets, which are disks of powdered mugwort used in Traditional Chinese medicine for moxibustion, are not incenses; the treatment is by heat rather than fragrance. Joss sticks in the Temple of Literature, Hanoi in Hanoi, Vietnam Incense sticks may be termed joss sticks, especially in parts of East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Among ethnic Chinese and Chinese-influenced communities these are traditionally burned at temples, before the threshold of a home or business, before an image of a religious divinity or local spirit, or in shrines, large and small, found at the main entrance of every village. Here the earth god is propitiated in the hope of bringing wealth and health to the village. They can also be burned in front of a door or open window as an offering to heaven, or the devas. The word \\"joss\\" is derived from the Latin deus (god) via the Portuguese deos through the Javanese dejos, through Chinese pidgin English. Production Drying cored stick incense, Vietnam The raw materials are powdered and then mixed together with a binder to form a paste, which, for direct burning incense, is then cut and dried into pellets. Incense of the Athonite Orthodox Christian tradition is made by powdering frankincense or fir resin, mixing it with essential oils. Floral fragrances are the most common, but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon. The incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately 1 cm thick and left until the slab has firmed. It is then cut into small cubes, coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion, and allowed to fully harden and dry. In Greece this rolled incense resin is called 'Moskolibano', and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance, with pink being rose and green being jasmine. Raw Charcoal Incense Sticks Certain proportions are necessary for direct-burning incense: *Oil content: an excess of oils may prevent incense from smoldering effectively. Resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense are typically balanced with \\"dry\\" materials such as wood, bark and leaf powders. *Oxidizer quantity: Too little oxidizer in gum-bound incense may prevent the incense from igniting, while too much will cause the incense to burn too quickly, without producing fragrant smoke. *Binder: Water-soluble binders such as \\"makko\\" ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry, dilute the mixture. *Mixture density: Incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing, or over-compressed while being formed, which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture, causing the incense to burn unevenly, too slowly, or too quickly. *Particulate size: The incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates. Uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burned. alt= \\"Dipped\\" or \\"hand-dipped\\" direct-burning incense is created by dipping \\"incense blanks\\" made of unscented combustible dust into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil. These are often sold in the United States by flea-market and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles. This form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture, since the blanks are pre-formed in China or South East Asia. Incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes. Small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough. The incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense, or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense. The formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried. Incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried, and as such must be placed in climate-controlled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process. Traditionally, the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick. In a process known as \\"splitting the foot of the incense stick\\", the bamboo is trimmed to length, soaked, peeled, and split in halves until the thin sticks of bamboo have square cross sections of less than 3mm. This process has been largely replaced by machines in modern incense production. In the case of cored incensed sticks, several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture: *Paste rolling: A wet, malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long, thin coil, using a paddle. Then, a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved. The stick is then cut to the desired length and dried. *Powder- coating: Powder-coating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil (up to 1 meter in diameter) or cored stick forms. A bundle of the supporting material (typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers) is soaked in water or a thin water/glue mixture for a short time. The thin sticks are evenly separated, then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plant-based binder. The dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the sticks while they are spread apart. The sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks. Three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks, forming a 2 mm thick layer of incense material on the stick. The coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air. Additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying. Incense sticks produced in this fashion and burned in temples of Chinese folk religion can have a thickness between 2 and 4 millimeters. *Compression: A damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression, similar to the way uncored sticks are formed. This form is becoming more common due to the higher labor cost of producing powder- coated or paste-rolled sticks. Burning incense Indirect-burning incense is burned directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible. In Japan a similar censer called a is used by several Buddhist sects. The eg≈çro is usually made of brass, with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, makk≈ç powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The makk≈ç is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method is known as sonae-k≈ç (religious burning). For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. The flame is then fanned or blown out, leaving the incense to smolder. Cultural variations =Arabian= In most Arab countries, incense is burned in the form of scented chips or blocks called bakhoor ( . Incense is used on special occasions like weddings or on Fridays or generally to perfume the house. The bakhoor is usually burned in a mabkhara, a traditional incense burner (censer) similar to the Somali Dabqaad. It is customary in many Arab countries to pass bakhoor among the guests in the majlis ('congregation'). This is done as a gesture of hospitality. =Chinese= Incense at Yonghe Temple in Beijing, China For over two thousand years, the Chinese have used incense in religious ceremonies, ancestor veneration, Traditional Chinese medicine, and daily life. Agarwood (ch√©nxiƒÅng) and sandalwood (t√°nxiƒÅng) are the two most important ingredients in Chinese incense. Along with the introduction of Buddhism in China came calibrated incense sticks and incense clocks. The first known record is by poet Yu Jianwu (487-551): \\"By burning incense we know the o'clock of the night, With graduated candles we confirm the tally of the watches.\\"Schafer, Edward H. (1963). The Golden Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics. University of California Press. p. 155. The use of these incense timekeeping devices spread from Buddhist monasteries into Chinese secular society. Big Dragon incense sticks Incense-stick burning is an everyday practice in traditional Chinese religion. There are many different types of stick used for different purposes or on different festive days. Many of them are long and thin. Sticks are mostly coloured yellow, red, or more rarely, black. Thick sticks are used for special ceremonies, such as funerals. Spiral incense, with exceedingly long burn times, is often hung from temple ceilings. In some states, such as Taiwan, Singapore, or Malaysia, where they celebrate the Ghost Festival, large, pillar-like dragon incense sticks are sometimes used. These generate so much smoke and heat that they are only burned outside. Unpacked incense sticks in Buddhist/Taoist shrine in Malaysia Chinese incense sticks for use in popular religion are generally odorless or only use the slightest trace of jasmine or rose, since it is the smoke, not the scent, which is important in conveying the prayers of the faithful to heaven. They are composed of the dried powdered bark of a non-scented species of cinnamon native to Cambodia, Cinnamomum cambodianum. Inexpensive packs of 300 are often found for sale in Chinese supermarkets. Though they contain no sandalwood, they often include the Chinese character for sandalwood on the label, as a generic term for incense. Highly scented Chinese incense sticks are used by some Buddhists. These are often quite expensive due to the use of large amounts of sandalwood, agarwood, or floral scents used. The sandalwood used in Chinese incenses does not come from India, its native home, but rather from groves planted within Chinese territory. Sites belonging to Tzu Chi, Chung Tai Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, Xingtian Temple, or City of Ten Thousand Buddhas do not use incense. =Indian= Incense in India Incense sticks, also known as agarbathi (or agarbatti) and joss sticks, in which an incense paste is rolled or moulded around a bamboo stick, are the main forms of incense in India. The bamboo method originated in India and is distinct from the Nepali/Tibetan and Japanese methods of stick making without bamboo cores. Though the method is also used in the west, it is strongly associated with India. The basic ingredients are the bamboo stick, the paste (generally made of charcoal dust and joss/jiggit/gum/tabu powder ‚Äì an adhesive made from the bark of litsea glutinosa and other trees), and the perfume ingredients - which would be a masala (spice mix) powder of ground ingredients into which the stick would be rolled, or a perfume liquid sometimes consisting of synthetic ingredients into which the stick would be dipped. Perfume is sometimes sprayed on the coated sticks. Stick machines are sometimes used, which coat the stick with paste and perfume, though the bulk of production is done by hand rolling at home. There are about 5,000 incense companies in India that take raw unperfumed sticks hand-rolled by approximately 200,000 women working part-time at home, and then apply their own brand of perfume, and package the sticks for sale. An experienced home-worker can produce 4,000 raw sticks a day. There are about 50 large companies that together account for up to 30% of the market, and around 500 of the companies, including a significant number of the main ones, including Moksh Agarbatti and Cycle Pure, are based in Mysore. = Jewish Temple in Jerusalem = Ketoret was the incense offered in the Temple in Jerusalem and is stated in the Book of Exodus to be a mixture of stacte, onycha, galbanum and frankincense. = Tibetan = Tibetan incense refers to a common style of incense found in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. These incenses have a characteristic \\"earthy\\" scent to them. Ingredients vary from cinnamon, clove, and juniper, to kusum flower, ashvagandha, and sahi jeera. Many Tibetan incenses are thought to have medicinal properties. Their recipes come from ancient Vedic texts that are based on even older Ayurvedic medical texts. The recipes have remained unchanged for centuries. =Japanese= Stacks of incense at a temple in Japan In Japan incense appreciation folklore includes art, culture, history, and ceremony. Incense burning may occasionally take place within the tea ceremony, just like calligraphy, ikebana, and scroll arrangement. , the art of incense appreciation, is generally practiced as a separate art form from the tea ceremony, and usually within a tea room of traditional Zen design. and are the two most important ingredients in Japanese incense. The characters in agarwood mean \\"incense that sinks in water\\" due to the weight of the resin in the wood. Sandalwood is used in the Japanese tea ceremony. The most valued sandalwood comes from Mysore in the state of Karnataka in India. Japanese incense companies divide agarwood into six categories depending on its properties and the region from which it is obtained. Kyara (‰ºΩÁæÖ), a type of agarwood, is currently worth more than its weight in gold. Usage ;Practical The giant Botafumeiro thurible swinging from the ceiling of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela Mosquito repellent is often manufactured in coil form and burned in a similar manner as incense. Papier d'Armenie was used to disinfect. Incense fragrances can be of such great strength that they obscure other less desirable odours. This utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay. An example, as well as of religious use, is the giant Botafumeiro thurible that swings from the ceiling of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. It is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired, unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. A similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the post-Reformation Church of England. Although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the Oxford Movement, it was common to have incense (typically frankincense) burned before grand occasions, when the church would be crowded. The frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a 'perfuming pan'. In iconography of the day, this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat, with a single long handle on one side. The perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible, as the latter would have likely offended the Protestant sensibilities of the 17th and 18th centuries. The regular burning of direct-burning incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks. These devices can range from a simple trail of incense material calibrated to burn in a specific time period, to elaborate and ornate instruments with bells or gongs, designed to involve multiple senses. Incense made from materials such as citronella can repel mosquitoes and other irritating, distracting, or pestilential insects. This use has been deployed in concert with religious uses by Zen Buddhists who claim that the incense that is part of their meditative practice is designed to keep bothersome insects from distracting the practitioner. Currently, more effective pyrethroid-based mosquito repellent incense is widely available in Asia. Papier d'Arm√©nie was originally sold as a disinfectant as well as for the fragrance. Incense is also used often by people who smoke indoors and do not want the smell to linger. ;Aesthetic Many people burn incense to appreciate its smell, without assigning any other specific significance to it, in the same way that the foregoing items can be produced or consumed solely for the contemplation or enjoyment of the aroma. An example is the , where (frequently costly) raw incense materials such as agarwood are appreciated in a formal setting. ;Religious Incense burning at a temple in Taipei, Taiwan Religious use of incense is prevalent in many cultures and may have roots in the practical and aesthetic uses, considering that many of these religions have little else in common. One common motif is incense as a form of sacrificial offering to a deity. Such use was common in Judaic worship and remains in use for example in the Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches, Taoist and Buddhist Chinese jingxiang (Êï¨È¶ô \\"offer incense [to ancestors/gods]), etc. Aphrodisiac Incense has been used as an aphrodisiac in some cultures. Both ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian mythology suggest the usage of incense by goddesses and nymphs. Incense is thought to heighten sexual desires and sexual attraction. Time-keeper Incense clocks are used to time social, medical and religious practices in parts of eastern Asia. They are primarily used in Buddhism as a timer of mediation and prayer. Different types of incense burn at different rates; therefore, different incense are used for different practices. The duration of burning ranges from minutes to months. Healing stone cleanser Incense is claimed to cleanse and restore energy in healing stones. The technique used is called ‚Äúsmudging‚Äù and is done by holding a healing stone over the smoke of burning incense for 20 to 30 seconds. Some people believe that this process not only restores energy but eliminates negative energy. Health risks from incense smoke Incense smoke contains various contaminants including gaseous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and adsorbed toxic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic metals). The solid particles range between ~10 and 500 nm. In a comparison, Indian sandalwood was found to have the highest emission rate, followed by Japanese aloeswood, then Taiwanese aloeswood, while Chinese smokeless sandalwood had the least. Research carried out in Taiwan in 2001 linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (including benzopyrene) within Buddhist temples. The study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes, which are carcinogenic and mutagenic, in incense smoke. A survey of risk factors for lung cancer, also conducted in Taiwan, noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung, though the finding was not deemed significant. In contrast, epidemiologists at the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society, Aichi Cancer Center in Nagoya, and several other centers found: \\"No association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough, chronic sputum, chronic bronchitis, runny nose, wheezing, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or pneumonia among the three populations studied: i.e. primary school children, their non-smoking mothers, or a group of older non-smoking female controls. Incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among non-smokers, but it significantly reduced risk among smokers, even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount.\\" However, the researchers qualified their findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain low-cancer-risk dietary habits, and concluded that \\"diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health.\\" Although several studies have not shown a link between incense and lung cancer, many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incense. A study published in 2008 in the medical journal Cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract, with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer. Those who used incense heavily also were 80% more likely to develop squamous-cell carcinomas. The link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors, including cigarette smoking, diet and drinking habits. The research team noted that \\"This association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke, and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense, these findings carry significant public health implications.\\" In 2015, the South China University of Technology found toxicity of incense to Chinese hamsters' ovarian cells to be even higher than cigarettes. Incensole acetate, a component of Frankincense, has been shown to have anxiolytic-like and antidepressive-like effects in mice, mediated by activation of poorly- understood TRPV3 ion channels in the brain.

The Mouscron municipality also includes the old municipalities of Dottignies ('), Luingne (), and Herseaux (). In accordance with the national law, the municipality offers dual language services in French and Dutch. Kortrijk, in Flanders, is located just to the north of Mouscron. The city substantially grew during the 19th and early 20th century with the development of the textile industry in the north of France. The symbol of the city is the Hurlu: a character representing Protestant activists, who plundered the countryside during the Wars of Religion (16th century).  Geography  Mouscron is divided into 7 districts: the downtown (le centre), the train station (la gare), Mont-√†-Leux, Tuquet, Risquons-Tout, Nouveau-Monde and Coquinie. The municipality of Mouscron now also includes the old municipalities of Dottignies, Luingne, and Herseaux since the Fusion of the Belgian municipalities. The metropolitan area of Mouscron forms a conurbation with the French metropolitan area of Lille and is at the crossroad of three different administrative regions: Wallonia, France and Flanders. Mouscron is located 9 km from Roubaix, 11 km from Kortrijk, 23 km from Lille and 25 km from Tournai. The city has been part of the French-speaking province of Hainaut since 1963 and, as a result, part of the administrative region of Wallonia. History =Middle Ages= Funerary Monument to Oste de la Barre, Lord of Mouscron (c. 1380‚Äì1446) and his second wife, C√©cile de Mourkercke (c. 1400‚Äì1462) - St. Bartholomew's Church A few archaeological discoveries were made in this area proving the existence of settlements during Roman times. The name Dottignies - a village that is now part of Mouscron - appeared for the first time in the 9th century, while that of Mouscron only appeared in 1060. In 1066, Baldwin V, Count of Flanders ceded the local buildings and territories to the estate of the Church of Saint- Pierre in Lille. In 1149, the right to collect tithes in the Mouscron area was ceded in part to the Abbey of Saint Martin in Tournai, in part to the Chapter of the Tournai Cathedral. The rights to the neighbouring villages of Herseaux and Luingne - now also part of Mouscron - were also given to the Tournai Cathedral in 1178. In the 14th century, the Seigneury of Mouscron was eventually sold to a lord of Tournai, and in 1430, the Castle of the Counts (Ch√¢teau des Comtes) became the lord's manor, which can still be seen today. The future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor stopped there for dinner on May 27, 1516. =16th to 18th centuries= In 1575, in the middle of the Wars of Religion, the castle was strengthened. It was nevertheless besieged and taken by the Geuzen, locally known as the Hurlus in 1579, before being taken back three months later. In 1627, Philip IV of Spain promoted the seigneury to the rank of county. The Franco-Dutch War under Louis XIV devastated this mostly agricultural region. Mouscron and the surrounding area became French after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). Part of it rejoined the Southern Netherlands after the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), which drew the frontier right through its territory. It was finally completely ceded to the Southern Netherlands under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The textile industry started in Mouscron in the 1760s thanks to the imposition by Lille of a ban on the fabrication of molletons, a mixture of flax and wool, in Roubaix and Tourcoing. With the Battle of Fleurus (1794), Mouscron went back to France. =19th and 20th centuries= At the beginning of the 19th century, the textile industry flourished and added cotton as one of its prime materials. On March 29, 1848, the Belgian army intervened near Mouscron against a troop of French republican sympathizers who were ready to invade Belgium, in what was known as the Risquons-Tout incident. By the end of the century, several cotton mills and carpet plants were built, leading the village to expand into a much larger urban area, especially after the close of World War I. During World War II, from May 22 to 27, 1940, artillery fire brought British and German soldiers into conflict in the Risquons-Tout district. 15 British soldiers, 10 German soldiers and 5 civilians were killed in the incident. In 1963, Mouscron was transferred from the province of West Flanders, to the province of Hainaut, to reflect the predominantly francophone population (94% in 1846 and 74% in 1947). Mouscron was officially recognized as a city in 1986. Sights Mouscron town hall *The town hall and the main square (Grand Place). The town hall was opened in 1890. It was designed by the architect Ren√© Aim√© Buyck from Bruges and the style may be defined as neo gothic from maritime Flanders. The building is outstanding because of the harmony of its proportions and the fineness of its sculptures. *The Saint-Barth√©l√©my church *The medieval castle known as the Ch√¢teau des Comtes can still be visited. The oldest extant parts date from the 15th century. Four families of lords lived in it during six centuries. From this big domain remains its courtyard marked by annexes from 16th to 17th centuries and moats. *Mouscron's public park dates back to the 1930s. With its ponds and manicured green areas, it has grown into one of the most beautiful parks of the country. It is home to all the plant varieties that can be grown in the local climate and it extends over an area of 7 hectares. It was inaugurated in 1932 by Fernand Cocq. *The house of Picardy (Maison Picarde). The building was built around 1922. The inside is worth visiting. The painted earthenware that adorns the main hall of the second story were classified as historical artifacts. They depict bucolic scenes which praise the values of socialism, work, empowerment, knowledge and family. They were made by the studio of Jules Biesbroek. *The Urban Renewal (La R√©novation urbaine). At the beginning of 1980's, a big revitalization project was decided. The old Green Square was transformed and renamed Emmanuel de Neckere Square. The paving is worth looking at in more detail as it depicts the city's motto: ‚ÄúLoyal to the King, up to carrying the beggar's pouch‚Äù (French: ‚ÄúFid√®le au roy, jusqu‚Äô√† porter la besace‚Äù). At the center of this modern atrium, you can see the fountain made by Bernard Verhaeghe, a local artist, in 1987. *The olympic-size swimming pool (Les dauphins); *The cultural center (Marius Staquet); has 3 main facilities: the Raymond Devos theater, the Andr√© Demey√®re auditorium and the Jacques Brel exhibition hall *The exhibition hall (Centr‚Äôexpo); hosts exhibitions, fairs and events *The Art Gallery; set up in the old swimming pool *The stadium (Cannonier); can hold 10,830 spectators *The public library *The El bar caf√©; hosts concerts *Studio RQC (Radio qui chifel); the independent radio station of the city Festivities *The Hurlus Festival (F√™te des Hurlus): The Hurlus Festival happens every first weekend of October. On Friday evening, children from across the city gather on the main square for the lantern procession. Children are accompanied by fanfare, musicians and other traditional groups. They walk around the city and sing the main couplet of the traditional song. On Saturday, the inhabitants walk around the downtown to see traditional groups, majorettes, itinerant traders, musicians and craftsmen and a big bowls competition is organized. Then, the historical procession starts in the streets of the city. It is based on two main legendary events: the kidnapping of the Spanish-allied Adins vicar by the Hurlus and the fight in five trials between the Spanish leader (Don Ferrante de la Plancha y otros barrios) and the leader of the Hurlus. If the Hurlu leader wins the reenactment, little Hurlus dolls will be tossed into the crowd. Celebrations are in full swing to the beat of drums and trumpets until Sunday when Hurlus dolls are tossed from a raised platform on the main square. *The Hand Festival () in Dottignies. Every third week-end of September, a company of Gilles roams the streets of the village and distributes the traditional oranges to passers-by. The festival takes its name from the copper hand, possibly a symbol of fraternity, which tops the steeple of the church of Dottignies. * A Christmas Market takes place every year on the main square. *The vingt-quatre heure de Mouscron takes place every September. The ultimate goal of the event is to raise money for charity. The event includes groups of sportsmen running around the city for 24 hours.  The musical period  From 1960 to 1980, the city experienced a vibrant period in the music industry. The studio of Marcel De Keukeleire and Jean Van Loo produced famous European artists like Chocolat's (Brasilia Carnaval), Patrick Hernandez (Born to Be Alive), Amadeo (Moving Like A Superstar), J.J. Lionel (Chicken dance) and the Crazy Horse band, which was partly made up of people from Mouscron. In 1967, Jimi Hendrix gave his only Belgian concert at the Twenty club. In this club, many famous artists of the sixties also performed: The Animals, The Small Faces, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, Gene Vincent, The Moody Blues. The latter stayed in Mouscron for the writing of their album ‚ÄúDays of Future Passed‚Äù. In 1978, their Song ‚ÄúTop rank suite‚Äù alludes to the city's name with the sentence: ‚ÄúThey played a good game of football in Mucron‚Äù. The Moody Blues were certainly fans of football but they blatantly forgot how to spell the city's name. Legend says Madonna would have been noticed by Jean Van Loo and Patrick Hernandez during a casting in New-York. However, their offer would have been later declined by the American artist (relevance to Mouscron?). Eventually, the beginning of the song ‚ÄúLes Bourgeois‚Äù of Jacques Brel, anecdotally mentions the name of ‚ÄúAdrienne du Mont-√†-Leux‚Äù, who was the owner of a popular caf√© in the city.

The story describes him as a superbly handsome man and a genius. Genji is the second son of a Japanese emperor, but he is relegated to civilian life for political reasons and lives as an imperial officer. The first part of the story concentrates on his romantic life, and in the second, his and others' internal agony is depicted. He appears from the first volume \\"Kiritsubo\\" to the 40th volume \\"Illusion\\". \\"Genji\\" is the surname as a noble demoted from royalty. His true given name is never referred to in the story, like most other characters. \\"Hikaru\\" means \\"shining\\", which is a nickname deriving from his appearance. He is also referred to as , sometimes abbreviated as . He is often called Genji when speaking of the story. He is a fictitious person but it is thought the author was inspired by some historical figures, including Minamoto no T≈çru, who was a grandson of Emperor Saga, hence one of the Saga Genji clan. Life of Hikaru Genji in Tale of Genji Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu, the author of The Tale of Genji. The ages of characters are counted in , as the story discusses. It is common to divide the tale into three parts, and this article follows that customary, but the division is not what's given by Lady Murasaki. = Part one = Hikaru Genji was born the second son of Emperor Kiritsubo (Ê°êÂ£∫Â∏ù) by his lower ranked consort, . Genji was blessed with peerless beauty and genius, even from infancy, and was nicknamed \\"the Shining Prince\\". His mother died when he was only three years old. Persuasion of the ideal of his mother is an important element which defines his love. His father Emperor Kiritsubo considered appointing Hikaru the crown prince. He was however worried that his second son had no support from his maternal line. Also discouraged by a prediction by a Korean fortuneteller that the country would be thrown into chaos if Hikaru would ascend to the throne, the Emperor lowered Hikaru's rank to civilian, giving him the clan name Minamoto (Genji). Genji adored his stepmother , a later favorite consort of Emperor Kiritsubo, because of her close resemblance to the dead Lady Kiritsubo, and that similarity was also the reason that Emperor Kiritsubo had her enter his court. As a result of Fujitsubo and Genji's forbidden love, she bore a boy, later , to Genji when he is 19, but almost no one knew the truth of his birth, and the child was raised as a prince and son of Emperor Kiritsubo. He had two wives in the legal sense during his life; he married Lady Aoi (Aoi no UeÔΩ§Ëëµ„ÅÆ‰∏ä) in his youth, and much later (meaning \\"The Third Princess\\", called so in Japanese, and known as Ny≈çsan in the Arthur Waley translation.) Lady Aoi died after she bore a son to Genji. But Genji's de facto wife and most beloved one was Lady Murasaki, , a niece of Fujitsubo. Genji met her by chance when she was very young - at the age of 10, and when he was 18 years old. When her grandmother who brought her up died, and before her real father could take her to his mansion, Genji kidnapped Murasaki and brought her up himself. After Aoi died, Genji made her his unofficial wife. Although their marriage didn't follow the whole protocol of official marriage, she received as many honours as the factual wife of Genji. But she remained officially his concubine, and that was one of the reasons Genji was offered the opportunity to marry the Third Princess in the second part of the story. Genji couldn't reject this offer because of his affection for Fujitsubo, but Onna san no miya was so young that she turned out to be too na√Øve, and he was very disappointed and had many regrets. Genji had many love affairs. He even made love to one of his brother's de facto consorts . She was nominally the Head of Ladies-in-waiting and no official consort, but it was a scandal, and gave a pretext to political opponents. Genji moved to Suma, in Harima Province, before he could be expelled officially. In Harima province, Genji met Lady Akashi and had a daughter by her. Later his brother Emperor Suzaku was afflicted by illness and feared it was a result of the wrath of his late father's spirit, by his poor treatment of his brother, Genji. Genji was invited to return to Miyako (nowadays Kyoto). He left Lady Akashi and the child, and returned to Kyoto. After Genji was back in Kyoto, Emperor Suzaku abdicated in favor of the crown prince (Reizei) who was really the son of Genji and Fujitsubo. This prince ascended to the throne, but he learned the secret of his birth by chance, and wanted to abdicate in favor of his real father, Genji. It was however impossible and as the second best, Emperor Reizei later gave Genji nearly the same rank as an abdicated emperor. After rising to this noblest rank, Genji was called , a name taken from his mansion. Genji wanted his daughter to be the next Empress. He invited Lady Akashi and the child (known as Princess Akashi, ÊòéÁü≥„ÅÆÂß´Âêõ) to Kyoto. Later, Lady Murasaki adopted this girl and brought her up. This girl later became a consort of the crown prince and eventually his empress. = Part two = At the age of forty, he married his niece Onna san no Miya, who was a daughter of his elder half- brother , and her mother was a lady whose half-sister was Empress Fujitsubo, hence her another niece. This marriage did not make him happy. , a friend of his son , hence a nephew of Lady Aoi, lusted after Onna san no Miya and sought her love even after her marriage with Genji. Finally he intruded into Rokujoin and raped her. She bore a boy whose father was Kashiwagi. Genji later came to know the secret and got angry, but finally realized it was just what he had done to his father, and it was a punishment of his past treachery to his father and emperor. He decided to keep the secret of the birth of this boy and to bring him up as his real and third child. After Lady Murasaki died, he became a monk and secreted himself in .

It follows nearly the same plot with some modern adaptation. It was originally published from 1980 to 1993. It spanned thirteen volumes and was published by Kodansha. The series was partially translated into English (as The Tale of Genji) by Stuart Atkin and Yoko Toyosaki as a part of Kodansha's attempts to publish bilingual manga as a study guide for Japanese students. The Tale of Genji sold 14 million copies with its 13 tank≈çbon volumes by May 2006. The first ten volumes focus on Hikaru Genji and his life, the final three volumes follow two princes, lord Kaoru and Niou no miya (Royal Prince with Perfumes) after Hikaru Genji's death. An anime adaptation was scheduled to air in Fuji Television's noitaminA block, starting January 2009, but the producer decided to make the anime directly from the original Tale of Genji, calling the new anime Genji Monogatari Sennenki.  Characters  = The First Part = Volumes 1 to 10 * Hikaru Genji - royal prince, 2nd son of Emperor Kiritsubo. Because of his beauty and excellence, people called him the Shining Prince. His father, the Emperor, loved this beautiful prince, and gave him a branch house, called Gen. This meant he was no longer part of the royal family and lost the right to succeed the throne, since his mother was a concubine of low rank. Therefore, he was called Gen-ji, shining Gen-ji (Hikaru Genji). * Emperor Kiritsubo - father of Genji. He wished Genji to become his successor, but it would be impossible since his mother Kiritsubo-koui's was of low rank and the mother of his 1st son, Kokiden-nyougo, was of high rank. * Kiritsubo-koui - 2nd class concubine of Emperor Kiritsubo, mother of Genji. The emperor loved her most, but it resulted in death of Kiritsubo-koui under jealousy and hatred of other concubines in the palace. * Kokiden-nyougo - 1st class concubine, mother of 1st royal prince (later, Emperor Suzaku) of Emperor Kiritsubo. Daughter of the Minister at the right. * Fujitsubo-nyougo - royal princess and 1st class concubine of Emperor Kiritsubo. Fujitsubo very looked like late Kiritsubo-koui. Emperor Kiritsubo loved her and she became the Empress consort (Chuuguu). Lord Genji loved and adored Fujitsubo. And he committed adultery with her. * Murasaki no ue - daughter of the Prince Lord Minister of Ceremony, niece of Empress consort Fujitsubo. Lord Genji first met her when she was 12 years old. Later, Genji married her and she was called Murasaki no ue (high Dame Murasaki). * Aoi no ue - daughter of the Minister at the left. She was 4 years older than Genji. Aoi was the first spouse of Genji - therefore she was called Aoi no ue (high Dame Aoi). She has been raised to be married to the next emperor, but was instead married to Genji who was the second son of the emperor. This has made Aoi cold and distant from her husband. Aoi was killed by jealous living ghost of royal Dame Rokujou. * Rokujou-miyasudokoro - mother of princess Umetsubo-nyougo, 1st class concubine of the former Crown Prince who was an elder brother of Emperor Kiritsubo. After her husband's death, she has locked herself up in her mansion and only comes out during a poetry recital. Considered to be very popular at court and carries the reputation of being both wise and beautiful. She became Genji's mistress. Her love overwhelmed the Prince Genji which eventually drove him away from her.\\"Miyasudokoro\\" is title of mother of royal prince/princess. * Yuugiri - 2nd son of Genji. His mother was high Dame Aoi. * Emperor Suzaku - 1st son of Emperor Kiritsubo. His mother was Kokiden-nyougo. Suzaku succeeded his father Kiritsubo's throne and became emperor. Kokiden-nyougo was, then, grand Empress consort. * Emperor Reizei - son of Empress consort Fujitsubo. He was considered as the royal prince, son of Emperor Kiritsubo, but his real father was Lord Genji. He was a child of adultery. * Tou-no-chuujou - eldest son of the Minister at the left, elder brother of Aoi. He was a rival and good friend of Genji. * Yuugao - a young lady from middle class but reputed to be beautiful and young. She was one of Genji's loves. She was killed by living ghost of jealous Rokujou-miyasudokoro at the age of nineteen. Her death left Genji into a pit of depression. She left a girl baby, later called Tamakadura, who was just a daughter of Tou-no-chuujou. * Hana-chiru-sato - a young lady, sister of the concubine of Emperor Suzaku. One of Genji's loves. Not so beautiful, but warm-hearted lady. * Oborodukiyo - daughter of the Minister at the right, younger sister of grand Empress consort Kokiden. She was beautiful and brave lady. Kokiden planned to make her 1st class concubine of Emperor Suzaku. But she had love affairs with Lord Genji. Then, she became the chief Lady of Chamber (Naishi-no-kami) of Emperor Suzaku. Kokiden got anger, and Genji retired to the seashore place at Suma. * Akashi-no-okata - daughter of Priest Akashi. A beautiful, elegant, young lady. Genji and his followers met with disaster by typhoon at Suma. They moved to Akashi according to invitation by Priest Akashi. Genji, then, made love with her and begot a girl baby (later, Akashi-no-nyougo). * (shin)-Kokiden-nyougo - daughter of Tou-no- chuujou, elder sister of Kumoi-no-Kari.

She was Royal princess and entered into the palace of Emperor Reizei as nyougo (1st class concubine). Royal Dame Rokujou had died. Genji became her father in palace low. Emperor Reizei became aware that Genji was his real father. Reizei fell in agony, and at last accepted the fact. Reizei raised Umetsubo to the Empress consort for she was Genji's daughter in low. Umetsubo became Akikonomu-chuuguu. Genji became de facto Ex-Emperor, Rokujou-in. * Kumoi-no-Kari - daughter of Tou-no-chuujou. Younger sister of shin-Kokiden-nyougo. She fell in love with Yuugiri, the son of Genji. She married Yuugiri. * Tamakadura - daughter of Tou-no-chuujou and Yuugao. Beautiful young lady. She left Kyoto for Dazai-fu at Kyushu in her very young age. After having grown up and become a young lady she returned to Kyoto. Genji found her and announced she was her daughter.

The underlying principle was that only people taking communion in the established Church of England were eligible for public employment, and the severe penalties pronounced against recusants, whether Catholic or nonconformist, were affirmations of this principle. Similar laws were introduced in Scotland with respect to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. In practice nonconformists were often exempted from some of these laws through the regular passage of Acts of Indemnity. After 1800 they were seldom enforced, except at Oxbridge, where nonconformists and Catholics could not matriculate (Oxford) or graduate (Cambridge). The Conservative government repealed them in 1828 with little controversy. Corporation Act 1661 The Corporation Act of James I provided that all such as were naturalized or restored in blood should receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It was not, however, until the reign of Charles II that actually receiving communion in the Church of England was made a precondition for holding public office. The earliest imposition of this test was by the Corporation Act of 1661 requiring that, besides taking the Oath of Supremacy, all members of corporations were, within one year after election, to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites of the Church of England. Test Act of 1673 This act was followed by the Test Act of 1673University of London & History of Parliament Trust (25 Car. II. c. 2) (the long title of which is \\"An act for preventing dangers which may happen from popish recusants\\"'Charles II, 1672: An Act for preventing Dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628‚Äì80 (1819), pp. 782‚Äì85. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47451. Date accessed: 6 March 2007.). This act enforced upon all persons filling any office, civil or military, the obligation of taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance and subscribing to a declaration against transubstantiation and also of receiving the sacrament within three months after admittance to office. The oath for the Test Act of 1673 was: > I, N, do declare that I do believe that there is not any transubstantiation > in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or in the elements of the bread and > wine, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever. The act was passed in the parliamentary session that began on 4 February 1673 (Gregorian calendar), the act is however dated as 1672 in some accounts due to the Julian calendar then in force in England.Plunknett, Theodore, Studies in English Legal History Hambledon Press 1983 p. 323 1678 Act Initially, the Act did not extend to peers; but in 1678 the Act was extended by a further Act (30 Car. II. st. 2'Charles II, 1678: (Stat. 2.) An Act for the more effectuall preserving the Kings Person and Government by disableing Papists from sitting in either House of Parlyament.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628‚Äì80 (1819), pp. 894‚Äì96. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47482. Date accessed: 6 March 2007.) which required that all peers and members of the House of Commons should make a declaration against transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrament of Mass. The effect of this was to exclude Catholics from both houses, and in particular the \\"Five Popish Lords\\" from the House of Lords, a change motivated largely by the alleged Popish Plot. The Lords deeply resented this interference with their membership; they delayed passage of the Act as long as possible, and managed to greatly weaken it by including an exemption for the future James II, effective head of the Catholic nobility, at whom it was largely aimed.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot 2nd Edition Phoenix Press 2000 pp. 104‚Äì5 Scotland In Scotland a religious test was imposed immediately after the Reformation, and by a 1567 law no one was to be appointed to a public office or to be a notary who did not profess Calvinism. The Scottish Test Act was passed in 1681 and rescinded in 1690. Later attempts to exclude Scotland from the English Test Acts were rejected by the Parliament of Scotland. In 1707, anyone bearing office in any university, college or school in Scotland were to profess and subscribe to the Confession of Faith. All persons were to be free of any oath or test contrary to or inconsistent with the Protestant religion and Presbyterian Church government. The reception of the Eucharist was never a part of the test in Scotland as it was in England and Ireland. The necessity for subscription to the Confession of Faith by persons holding a university office was removed in an act of 1853. The act provided that in place of subscription every person appointed to a university office was to subscribe a declaration according to the form in the act, promising not to teach any opinions opposed to the divine authority of Scripture or to the Confession of Faith, and to do nothing to the prejudice of the Church of Scotland or its doctrines and privileges. All tests were finally abolished by an act of 1889 (52 & 53 Vict. c. 55). Repeal A 1790 cartoon satirizing the efforts of Charles James Fox to get the Test and Corporation Acts repealed. British natural philosopher and theologian Joseph Priestley is depicted preaching from atop a pile of his own works, in a pulpit made from a barrel inscribed \\"FANATICISM\\", to Fox seated in a box pew. Fox asks, \\"Pray, Doctor is there such a thing as a Devil?\\" Priestley responds \\"No\\", as the devil himself announces, \\"If you had eyes behind, you'd know better my dear Doctor\\". The necessity of receiving the sacrament as a qualification for office was repealed in 1828 and all acts requiring the taking of oaths and declarations against transubstantiation were repealed by the Catholic Relief Act 1829. Sir Robert Peel took the lead for the government in the repeal and collaborated with Anglican Church leaders.Norman Gash, Mr Secretary Peel (1961) pp: 460‚Äì65; Richard A.

Retrieved 14 March 2020. by the pre-Columbian people of Ancient Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a newer more modern version of the game, ulama, is still played by the indigenous populations in some places.Fox, John (2012). The ball : discovering the object of the game\\", 1st ed., New York: Harper. . Cf. Chapter 4: \\"Sudden Death in the New World\\" about the Ulama game. The rules of the game are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were probably similar to racquetball, where the aim is to keep the ball in play. The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game. In the most common theory of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber and weighed as much as 4 kg (9 lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played. The game had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events. Late in the history of the game, some cultures occasionally seem to have combined competitions with religious human sacrifice. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and may have been played by women as well.The primary evidence for female ballplayers is in the many apparently female figurines of the Formative period, wearing a ballplayer loincloth and perhaps other gear. In The Sport of Life and Death, editor Michael Whittington says: \\"It would [therefore] seem reasonable that women also played the game‚Äîperhaps in all-female teams‚Äîor participated in some yet to be understood ceremony enacted on the ballcourt.\\" (p. 186). In the same volume, Gillett Griffin states that although these figurines have been \\"interpreted by some as females, in the context of ancient Mesoamerican society the question of the presence of female ballplayers, and their role in the game, is still debated.\\" (p. 158). Pre-Columbian ballcourts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as for example at Cop√°n, as far south as modern Nicaragua, and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of Arizona.The evidence for ballcourts among the Hohokam is not accepted by all researchers and even the proponents admit that the proposed Hohokam Ballcourts are significantly different from Mesoamerican ones: they are oblong, with a concave (not flat) surface. See Wilcox's article and photo at end of this article. These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with slanted side-walls against which the balls could bounce. Names The Mesoamerican ballgame is known by a wide variety of names. In English, it is often called pok-ta-pok (or pok-a-tok). This term originates from a 1932 article by Danish archaeologist Frans Blom, who adapted it from the Yucatec Maya word . In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, it was called () or (). In Classical Maya, it was known as . In modern Spanish, it is called ('Maya ballgame'), ('Mesoamerican ballgame'), or simply ('Maya ball'). Origins Map showing sites where early ballcourts, balls, or figurines have been recovered It is not known precisely when or where ≈çllamaliztli originated, although it is likely that the game originated earlier than 1400 BCE in the low-lying tropical zones home to the rubber tree.Shelton, pp. 109‚Äì110. There is wide agreement on game originating in the tropical lowlands, likely the Gulf Coast or Pacific Coast. One candidate for the birthplace of the ballgame is the Soconusco coastal lowlands along the Pacific Ocean.Taladoire (2001) pp. 107‚Äì108. Here, at Paso de la Amada, archaeologists have found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered, dated to approximately 1400 BCE. A view of the Chichen Itza Ballgame (Yucat√°n, Mexico), from the pyramid \\"El Castillo. The other major candidate is the Olmec heartland, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec along the Gulf Coast.Miller and Taube (1993, p.42) The Aztecs referred to their Postclassic contemporaries who then inhabited the region as the Olmeca (i.e. \\"rubber people\\") since the region was strongly identified with latex production.These Gulf Coast inhabitants, the Olmeca- Xicalanca, are not to be confused with the Olmec, the name bestowed by 20th century archaeologists on the influential Gulf Coast civilization which had dominated that region three thousand years earlier. The earliest-known rubber balls in the world come from the sacrificial bog at El Manat√≠, an early Olmec- associated site located in the hinterland of the Coatzacoalcos River drainage system. Villagers, and subsequently archaeologists, have recovered a dozen balls ranging in diameter from 10 to 22 cm from the freshwater spring there. Five of these balls have been dated to the earliest-known occupational phase for the site, approximately 1700‚Äì1600 BCE.Ortiz and Rodr√≠guez (1999), pp. 228‚Äì232, 242‚Äì243. These rubber balls were found with other ritual offerings buried at the site, indicating that even at this early date ≈çllamaliztli had religious and ritual connotations.Diehl, p. 27Uriarte, p. 41, who finds that the juxtaposition at El Manat√≠ of the deposited balls and serpentine staffs (which may have been used to strike the balls) shows that there was already a \\"well-developed ideological relationship between the [ball]game, power, and serpents.\\" A stone \\"yoke\\" of the type frequently associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts was also reported to have been found by local villagers at the site, leaving open the distinct possibility that these rubber balls were related to the ritual ballgame, and not simply an independent form of sacrificial offering.Ortiz and Rodr√≠guez (1999), p. 249Ort√≠z, \\"Las ofrendas de El Manat√≠ y su posible asociaci√≥n con el juego de pelota: un yugo a destiempo\\", pp. 55‚Äì67 in Uriarte Relief of the Crown showing a scene from the Mesoamerican Ball Game. Excavations at the nearby Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n have also uncovered a number of ballplayer figurines, radiocarbon-dated as far back as 1250‚Äì1150 BCE. A rudimentary ballcourt, dated to a later occupation at San Lorenzo, 600‚Äì400 BCE, has also been identified.Diehl, p. 32, although the identification of a ballcourt within San Lorenzo has not been universally accepted. From the tropical lowlands, ≈çllamaliztli apparently moved into central Mexico. Starting around 1000 BCE or earlier, ballplayer figurines were interred with burials at Tlatilco and similarly styled figurines from the same period have been found at the nearby Tlapacoya site. It was about this period, as well, that the so-called Xochipala-style ballplayer figurines were crafted in Guerrero. Although no ballcourts of similar age have been found in Tlatilco or Tlapacoya, it is possible that the ballgame was indeed played in these areas, but on courts with perishable boundaries or temporary court markers. By 300 BCE, evidence for ≈çllamaliztli appears throughout much of the Mesoamerican archaeological record, including ballcourts in the Central Chiapas Valley (the next oldest ballcourts discovered, after Paso de la Amada),Finca Acapulco, San Mateo, and El Vergel, along the Grijalva, have ballcourts dated between 900 and 550 BCE (Agrinier, p. 175). and in the Oaxaca Valley, as well as ceramic ballgame tableaus from Western Mexico (see photo below). Material and formal aspects 250px As might be expected with a game played over such a long period of time by many cultures, details varied over time and place, so the Mesoamerican ballgame might be more accurately seen as a family of related games. In general, the hip-ball version is most popularly thought of as the Mesoamerican ballgame, and researchers believe that this version was the primary‚Äîor perhaps only‚Äîversion played within the masonry ballcourt.Cohodas, pp. 251‚Äì288 Ample archaeological evidence exists for games where the ball was struck by a wooden stick (e.g., a mural at Teotihuacan shows a game which resembles field hockey), racquets, bats and batons, handstones, and the forearm, perhaps at times in combination. Each of the various types of games had its own size of ball, specialized gear and playing field, and rules. Games were played between two teams of players. The number of players per team could vary, between two to four.The 16th century Aztec chronicler Motolinia stated that the games were played by a two-man team vs. a two-man team, three-man team vs. a three-man team, and even a two-man team vs. a three-man team (quoted by Shelton, p. 107).Fagan, Brian M. The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World reports that four-man vs four-man team also existed Some games were played on makeshift courts for simple recreation while others were formal spectacles on huge stone ballcourts leading to human sacrifice. A modern Sinaloa ulama player. The outfit is similar to that worn by Aztec players. Even without human sacrifice, the game could be brutal and there were often serious injuries inflicted by the solid, heavy ball. Today's hip-ulama players are \\"perpetually bruised\\"Cal State L.A. while nearly 500 years ago Spanish chronicler Diego Dur√°n reported that some bruises were so severe that they had to be lanced open. He also reported that players were even killed when the ball \\"hit them in the mouth or the stomach or the intestines\\". The rules of ≈çllamaliztli, regardless of the version, are not known in any detail. In modern-day ulama, the game resembles a netless volleyball, with each team confined to one half of the court. In the most widespread version of ulama, the ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one team fails to return it or the ball leaves the court. In the Postclassic period, the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, the object being to pass the ball through one, an innovation that continued into the later Toltec and Aztec cultures. In the 16th-century Aztec ballgame that the Spaniards witnessed, points were lost by a player who let the ball bounce more than twice before returning it to the other team, who let the ball go outside the boundaries of the court, or who tried and failed to pass the ball through one of the stone rings placed on each wall along the center line.Day, p. 66, who further references Diego Dur√°n and Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. According to 16th-century Aztec chronicler Motolinia, points were gained if the ball hit the opposite end wall, while the decisive victory was reserved for the team that put the ball through a ring.Shelton, pp. 107‚Äì108, who quotes Motolinia. However, placing the ball through the ring was a rare event‚Äîthe rings at Chichen Itza, for example, were set six meters off the playing field‚Äîand most games were likely won on points. =Clothing and gear= Two palmas from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. These palmas were equipment used in the Mesoamerican ballgame and come from Veracruz, Mexico, ca. 700 - 1000 CE/AD. They are approximately 1¬Ω feet (50 cm) high. The game's paraphernalia‚Äîclothing, headdresses, gloves, all but the stone‚Äîare long gone, so knowledge on clothing relies on art‚Äîpaintings and drawings, stone reliefs, and figurines‚Äîto provide evidence for pre-Columbian ballplayer clothing and gear, which varied considerably in type and quantity. Capes and masks, for example, are shown on several Dainz√∫ reliefs, while Teotihuacan murals show men playing stick-ball in skirts. National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. A figure of a pelota player. The basic hip-game outfit consisted of a loincloth, sometimes augmented with leather hip guards. Loincloths are found on the earliest ballplayer figurines from Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, and the Olmec culture, are seen in the Weiditz drawing from 1528 (below), and, with hip guards, are the sole outfit of modern-day ulama players (above)‚Äîa span of nearly 3,000 years. In many cultures, further protection was provided by a thick girdle, most likely of wicker or wood covered in fabric or leather. Made of perishable materials, none of these girdles have survived, although many stone \\"yokes\\" have been uncovered. Misnamed by earlier archaeologists due to its resemblance to an animal yoke, the stone yoke is thought to be too heavy for actual play and was likely used only before or after the game in ritual contexts. In addition to providing some protection from the ball, the girdle or yoke would also have helped propel the ball with more force than the hip alone. Additionally, some players wore chest protectors called palmas which were inserted into the yoke and stood upright in front of the chest. Kneepads are seen on a variety of players from many areas and eras and are worn by forearm-ulama players today. A type of garter is also often seen, worn just below the knee or around the ankle‚Äîit is not known what function this served. Gloves appear on the purported ballplayer reliefs of Dainz√∫, roughly 500 BCE, as well as the Aztec players are drawn by Weiditz 2,000 years later (see drawing below).Dainzu gloves are discussed in Taladoire, 2004 Helmets (likely utilitarian) and elaborate headdresses (likely used only in ritual contexts) are also common in ballplayer depictions, headdresses being particularly prevalent on Maya painted vases or on Jaina Island figurines. Many ballplayers of the Classic era are seen with a right kneepad‚Äîno left‚Äîand a wrapped right forearm, as shown in the Maya image above. = Rubber balls = In this detail from the late 15th century Codex Borgia, the Aztec god Xiuhtecuhtli brings a rubber ball offering to a temple. The balls each hold a quetzal feather, part of the offering. The sizes or weights of the balls actually used in the ballgame are not known with any certainty. While several dozen ancient balls have been recovered, they were originally laid down as offerings in a sacrificial bog or spring, and there is no evidence that any of these were used in the ballgame. In fact, some of these extant votive balls were created specifically as offerings.Filloy Nadal, p. 22. However, based on a review of modern-day game balls, ancient rubber balls, and other archaeological evidence, it is presumed by most researchers that the ancient hip-ball was made of a mix from one or another of the latex-producing plants found all the way from the southeastern rain forests to the northern desert.Filloy Nadal Most balls were made from latex sap of the lowland Castilla elastica tree. Someone discovered that by mixing latex with sap from the vine of a species of morning glory (Calonyction aculeatum) they could turn the slippery polymers in raw latex into a resilient rubber. The size varied between (measured in hand spans) and weighed .Schwartz states that the ball used by present-day players is . The ball used in the ancient handball or stick-ball game was probably slightly larger and heavier than a modern-day baseball.Filloy Nadal, p. 30 Some Maya depictions, such as the painting above or this relief, show balls or more in diameter. Academic consensus is that these depictions are exaggerations or symbolic, as are, for example, the impossibly unwieldy headdresses worn in the same portrayals.Cohodas, p. 259. = Ballcourt = Ballcourt at Uaxactun, in the Pet√©n Basin region of the Maya lowlands 10px- shape ball court in Cihuatan site, El Salvador Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites in Phoenix, with mounds like ballcourts ≈ållamaliztli (ball game) was played within a large masonry structure. Built-in a form that changed remarkably little during 2,700 years, over 1,300 Mesoamerican ballcourts have been identified, 60% in the last 20 years alone.Taladoire (2001) p. 98. Note that there are slightly over 200 ballcourts also identified in the American Southwest which are not included in this total, since these are outside Mesoamerica and there is significant discussion whether these areas were used for ballplaying or not. Although there is a tremendous variation in size, in general, all ballcourts have the same shape: a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces. The walls were often plastered and brightly painted. Although the alleys in early ballcourts were open-ended, later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an 10px-shape when viewed from above. Although the length-to-width ratio remained relatively constant at 4-to-1,Quirarte, pp. 209‚Äì210. there was nonetheless tremendous variation in ballcourt size. The playing field of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, by far the largest, measures 96.5 meters long by 30 meters wide, while the Ceremonial Court at Tikal was only 16 meters by 5 meters.Taladoire (2001) p. 100. Note that Taladoire is measuring the \\"playing field\\", while other authors include the benches and other trappings. See Quirarte, pp. 205‚Äì208. It is thought that neither the Great Ballcourt nor Tikal's Ceremonial Court was used for ballgames (Scarborough, p. 137). Cross sections of some of the more typical ballcourts Across Mesoamerica, ballcourts were built and used for many generations. Although ballcourts are found within most sizable Mesoamerican ruins, they are not equally distributed across time or geography. For example, the Late Classic site of El Taj√≠n, the largest city of the ballgame-obsessed Classic Veracruz culture, has at least 18 ballcourts, while Cantona, a nearby contemporaneous site, sets the record with 24.Day, p. 75. In contrast, northern ChiapasTaladoire and Colsenet. and the northern Maya Lowlands have relatively few, and ballcourts are conspicuously absent at some major sites, including Teotihuacan, Bonampak, and Tortuguero, although ≈çllamaliztli iconography has been found there.Taladoire (2001) p. 99. Ancient cities with particularly fine ballcourts in good condition include Tikal, Yaxha, Cop√°n, Coba, Iximche, Monte Alb√°n, Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Yagul, Xochicalco, Mixco Viejo, and Zaculeu. Ballcourts were public spaces used for a variety of elite cultural events and ritual activities like musical performances and festivals, and, of course, the ballgame. Pictorial depictions often show musicians playing at ballgames, while votive deposits buried at the Main Ballcourt at Tenochtitlan contained miniature whistles, ocarinas, and drums. A pre-Columbian ceramic from western Mexico shows what appears to be a wrestling match taking place on a ballcourt.Day, p. 69. Cultural aspects =Proxy for warfare= Stela from El Ba√∫l in the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone, showing two ballplayers. ≈ållamaliztli was a ritual deeply ingrained in Mesoamerican cultures and served purposes beyond that of a mere sporting event. Fray Juan de Torquemada, a 16th-century Spanish missionary and historian, tells that the Aztec emperor Axayacatl played Xihuitlemoc, the leader of Xochimilco, wagering his annual income against several Xochimilco chinampas.Taladoire (2001) p. 97. Ixtlilxochitl, a contemporary of Torquemada, relates that Topiltzin, the Toltec king, played against three rivals, with the winner ruling over the losers.Santley, pp. 14‚Äì15. These examples and others are cited by many researchers who have made compelling arguments that ≈çllamaliztli served as a way to defuse or resolve conflicts without genuine warfare, to settle disputes through a ballgame instead of a battle.Taladoire and Colsenet, p. 174: \\"We suggest that the ballgame was used as a substitute and a symbol for war.\\"Gillespie, p. 340: the ballgame was \\"a boundary maintenance mechanism between polities\\". Over time, then, the ballgame's role would expand to include not only external mediation, but also the resolution of competition and conflict within the society as well. This \\"boundary maintenance\\" or \\"conflict resolution\\" theory would also account for some of the irregular distribution of ballcourts. Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between the degree of political centralization and the number of ballcourts at a site. For example, the Aztec Empire, with a strong centralized state and few external rivals, had relatively few ballcourts while Middle Classic Cantona, with 24 ballcourts, had many diverse cultures residing there under a relatively weak state.Day, p. 76Taladoire (2001) p. 114. Other scholars support these arguments by pointing to the warfare imagery often found at ballcourts: *The southeast panel of the South Ballcourt at El Taj√≠n shows the protagonist ballplayer being dressed in a warrior's garb.Wilkerson, p. 59. *Captives are a prominent part of ballgame iconography. For example: :::Several ceramic figurines show war captives holding game balls. :::The ballcourt at Tonin√° was decorated with sculptures of bound captives. :::A captive-within-the-ball motif is seen on the Hieroglyphic Stairs at Structure 33 in Yaxchilan and on Altar 8 at Tikal. *The modern-day descendant of the ballgame, ulama, \\"until quite recently was connected with warfare and many reminders of that association remain\\".California State University, Los Angeles, Department of Anthropology, . =Human sacrifice= One of a series of murals from the South Ballcourt at El Taj√≠n, showing the sacrifice of a ballplayer The association between human sacrifice and the ballgame appears rather late in the archaeological record, no earlier than the Classic era.Kubler, p. 147 The association was particularly strong within the Classic Veracruz and the Maya cultures, where the most explicit depictions of human sacrifice can be seen on the ballcourt panels‚Äîfor example at El Taj√≠n (850‚Äì1100 CE)Uriarte, p. 46. and at Chichen Itza (900‚Äì1200 CE)‚Äîas well as on the decapitated ballplayer stelae from the Classic Veracruz site of Aparicio (700‚Äì900 CE). The Postclassic Maya religious and quasi-historical narrative, the Popol Vuh, also links human sacrifice with the ballgame (see below). Captives were often shown in Maya art, and it is assumed that these captives were sacrificed after losing a rigged ritual ballgame.Schele and Miller, p. 249: \\"It would not be surprising if the game were rigged\\" Rather than nearly nude and sometimes battered captives, however, the ballcourts at El Taj√≠n and Chichen Itza show the sacrifice of practiced ballplayers, perhaps the captain of a team.Cohodas, p. 255Gillespie, p. 321. Decapitation is particularly associated with the ballgame‚Äîsevered heads are featured in much Late Classic ballgame art and appear repeatedly in the Popol Vuh. There has been speculation that the heads and skulls were used as balls.Schele and Miller, p. 243: \\"occasionally [sacrificial victims'] decapitated heads (sic) were placed in play\\" =Symbolism= Little is known about the game's symbolic contents. Several themes recur in scholarly writing. This is a photo of a monument in Mexico *Astronomy. The bouncing ball is thought to have represented the sun.The ball-as-sun analogy is common in ballgame literature; see, among others, Gillespie, or Blanchard. Some researchers contend that the ball represents not the sun, but the moon. The stone scoring rings are speculated to signify sunrise and sunset, or equinoxes. *War. This is the most obvious symbolic aspect of the game (see also above, \\"Proxy for warfare\\"). Among the Mayas, the ball can represent the vanquished enemy, both in the late- Postclassic K'iche' kingdom (Popol Vuh), and in Classic kingdoms such as that of Yaxchilan. *Fertility. Formative period ballplayer figurines‚Äîmost likely females‚Äîoften wear maize icons.. Bradley finds that a raised circular dot, or a U-shaped symbol with a dot in the middle, or raised U- or V-shaped areas each represent maize. At El Taj√≠n, the ballplayer sacrifice ensures the renewal of pulque, an alcoholic maguey cactus beverage. *Cosmologic duality. The game is seen as a struggle between day and night, and/or a battle between life and the underworld.Taladoire and Colsenet, p. 173. Courts were considered portals to the underworld and were built in key locations within the central ceremonial precincts. Playing ball engaged one in the maintenance of the cosmic order of the universe and the ritual regeneration of life. =Myth= Nahua According to an important Nahua source, the Leyenda de los Soles, the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the Tlalocs, with precious stones and quetzal feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified the beginning of the end of the Toltec reign. Maya Maya site of Chinkultic, dated to 591. The ball itself displays the finely incised portrait of a young deity. The Maya Twin myth of the Popol Vuh establishes the importance of the game (referred to in Classic Maya as pitz) as a symbol for warfare intimately connected to the themes of fertility and death. The story begins with the Hero Twins' father, Hun Hunahpu, and uncle, Vucub Hunahpu, playing ball near the underworld, Xibalba.These excerpts from the Popol Vuh can be found in Christenson's recent translation or in any work on the Popol Vuh. The lords of the underworld became annoyed with the noise from the ball playing and so the primary lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, sent owls to lure the brothers to the ballcourt of Xibalba, situated on the western edge of the underworld. Despite the danger the brothers fall asleep and are captured and sacrificed by the lords of Xibalba and then buried in the ballcourt. Hun Hunahpu is decapitated and his head hung in a fruit tree, which bears the first calabash gourds. Hun Hunahpu's head spits into the hands of a passing goddess who conceives and bears the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The Hero Twins eventually find the ballgame equipment in their father‚Äôs house and start playing, again to the annoyance of the Lords of Xibalba, who summon the twins to play the ballgame amidst trials and dangers. In one notable episode, Hunahpu is decapitated by bats. His brother uses a squash as Hunahpu's substitute head until his real one, now used as a ball by the Lords, can be retrieved and placed back on Hunahpu's shoulders. The twins eventually go on to play the ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba, defeating them. However, the twins are unsuccessful in reviving their father, so they leave him buried in the ball court of Xibalba. The ballgame in Mesoamerican civilizations = Maya civilization = Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza In Maya Ballgame the Hero Twins myth links ballcourts with death and its overcoming. The ballcourt becomes a place of transition, a liminal stage between life and death. The ballcourt markers along the centerline of the Classic playing field depicted ritual and mythical scenes of the ballgame, often bordered by a quatrefoil that marked a portal into another world. The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the Classic forerunner of Vucub Caquix of the Cop√°n ball court, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception. =Teotihuacan= No ballcourt has yet been identified at Teotihuacan, making it by far the largest Classic era site without one. In fact, the ballgame seems to have been nearly forsaken not only in Teotihuacan, but in areas such as Matacapan or Tikal that were under Teotihuacano influence.Taladoire (2001) p. 109, who states that Matacapan and Tikal did indeed build ballcourts but only after the fall of Teotihuacan. Despite the lack of a ballcourt, ball games were not unknown there. The murals of the Tepantitla compound at Teotihuacan show a number of small scenes that seem to portray various types of ball games, including: *A two-player game in an open- ended masonry ballcourt.Taladoire (2001) p. 112. (See third picture below.) *Teams using sticks on an open field whose end zones are marked by stone monuments. *Separate renditions of single players. (See side pictures above.) It has been hypothesized that, for reasons as yet unknown, the stick-game eclipsed the hip-ball game at Teotihuacan and at Teotihuacan-influenced cities, and only after the fall of Teotihuacan did the hip-game reassert itself.Taladoire (2001) p. 113.

Note that the four players are all holding batons, perhaps indicating that they are playing a type of racquet- or stick-ball. The Aztec version of the ballgame is called ≈çllamalitzli (sometimes spelled ullamaliztli)The Nahuatl word for the game, ≈çllamaliztli () was often spelled ullamaliztli‚Äîthe orthography with \\"u\\" is a misrendering of the N√°huatl word caused by the fact that the quality of the nahuatl vowel /≈ç/ sounds a little like Spanish /u/. and are derived from the word ≈çlli \\"rubber\\" and the verb ≈çllama or \\"to play ball\\". The ball itself was called ≈çllamaloni and the ballcourt was called a tlachtli .The name of the present day city of Taxco, Guerrero, comes from the Nahuatl word tlachcho meaning \\"in the ballcourt\\". In the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan the largest ballcourt was called Teotlachco (\\"in the holy ballcourt\\")‚Äîhere several important rituals would take place on the festivals of the month Panquetzalitzli, including the sacrifice of four war captives to the honor of Huitzilopochtli and his herald PaInal. For the Aztecs the playing of the ballgame also had religious significance, but where the 16th-century K¬¥iche¬¥ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may have seen it as a battle of the sun, personified by Huitzilopochtli, against the forces of night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess Coyolxauhqui and Coatlicue's sons the 400 Huitznahuah.De La Garza & Izquierdo, p. 315. But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.Wilkerson, p. 45 and others, although there is by no means a universal view; Santley, p. 8: \\"The game was played by nearly all adolescent and adult males, noble and commoner alike.\\" Aztec ullamaliztli players performing for Charles V in Spain, drawn by Christoph Weiditz in 1528. Young Aztecs would be taught ballplaying in the calmecac school‚Äîand those who were most proficient might become so famous that they could play professionally. Games would frequently be staged in the different city wards and markets‚Äîoften accompanied by large-scale betting. Diego Dur√°n, an early Spanish chronicler, said that \\"these wretches... sold their children in order to bet and even staked themselves and became slaves\\".Motolinia, another early Spanish chronicler, also mentioned the heavy betting that accompanied games in Since the rubber tree Castilla elastica was not found in the highlands of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs generally received balls and rubber as tribute from the lowland areas where it was grown. The Codex Mendoza gives a figure of 16,000 lumps of raw rubber being imported to Tenochtitlan from the southern provinces every six months, although not all of it was used for making balls. In 1528, soon after the Spanish conquest, Cort√©s sent a troupe of ≈çllamanime (ballplayers) to Spain to perform for Charles V where they were drawn by the German Christoph Weiditz.De La Garza & Izquierdo, p. 325. Besides the fascination with their exotic visitors, the Europeans were amazed by the bouncing rubber balls. =Pacific coast= Pok-ta-pok player in action Ballcourts, monuments with ballgame imagery and ballgame paraphernalia have been excavated at sites along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador including the Cotzumalhuapa nuclear zone sites of Bilbao and El Ba√∫l and sites right at the southeast periphery of the Mesoamerican region such as Quelepa. =Caribbean= Batey, a ball game played on many Caribbean islands including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the West Indies, has been proposed as a descendant of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.

Codd as part of the relational model, in order to provide a declarative database- query language for data manipulation in this data model. It formed the inspiration for the database-query languages QUEL and SQL, of which the latter, although far less faithful to the original relational model and calculus, is now the de facto standard database-query language; a dialect of SQL is used by nearly every relational-database-management system. Michel Lacroix and Alain Pirotte proposed domain calculus, which is closer to first- order logic and together with Codd showed that both of these calculi (as well as relational algebra) are equivalent in expressive power. Subsequently, query languages for the relational model were called relationally complete if they could express at least all of these queries.  Definition of the calculus  = Relational database = Since the calculus is a query language for relational databases we first have to define a relational database. The basic relational building block is the domain (somewhat similar, but not equal to, a data type). A tuple is a finite sequence of attributes, which are ordered pairs of domains and values. A relation is a set of (compatible) tuples. Although these relational concepts are mathematically defined, those definitions map loosely to traditional database concepts. A table is an accepted visual representation of a relation; a tuple is similar to the concept of a row. We first assume the existence of a set C of column names, examples of which are \\"name\\", \\"author\\", \\"address\\", etcetera. We define headers as finite subsets of C. A relational database schema is defined as a tuple S = (D, R, h) where D is the domain of atomic values (see relational model for more on the notions of domain and atomic value), R is a finite set of relation names, and :h : R ‚Üí 2C a function that associates a header with each relation name in R. (Note that this is a simplification from the full relational model where there is more than one domain and a header is not just a set of column names but also maps these column names to a domain.) Given a domain D we define a tuple over D as a partial function that maps some column names to an atomic value in D. An example would be (name : \\"Harry\\", age : 25). :t : C ‚á∏ D The set of all tuples over D is denoted as TD. The subset of C for which a tuple t is defined is called the domain of t (not to be confused with the domain in the schema) and denoted as dom(t). Finally we define a relational database given a schema S = (D, R, h) as a function :db : R ‚Üí 2TD that maps the relation names in R to finite subsets of TD, such that for every relation name r in R and tuple t in db(r) it holds that :dom(t) = h(r). The latter requirement simply says that all the tuples in a relation should contain the same column names, namely those defined for it in the schema. = Atoms = For the construction of the formulas we will assume an infinite set V of tuple variables. The formulas are defined given a database schema S = (D, R, h) and a partial function type : V ‚á∏ 2C, called at type assignment, that assigns headers to some tuple variables. We then define the set of atomic formulas A[S,type] with the following rules: # if v and w in V, a in type(v) and b in type(w) then the formula v.a = w.b is in A[S,type], # if v in V, a in type(v) and k denotes a value in D then the formula v.a = k is in A[S,type], and # if v in V, r in R and type(v) = h(r) then the formula r(v) is in A[S,type]. Examples of atoms are: * (t.age = s.age) ‚Äî t has an age attribute and s has an age attribute with the same value * (t.name = \\"Codd\\") ‚Äî tuple t has a name attribute and its value is \\"Codd\\" * Book(t) ‚Äî tuple t is present in relation Book. The formal semantics of such atoms is defined given a database db over S and a tuple variable binding val : V ‚Üí TD that maps tuple variables to tuples over the domain in S: # v.a = w.b is true if and only if val(v)(a) = val(w)(b) # v.a = k is true if and only if val(v)(a) = k # r(v) is true if and only if val(v) is in db(r) = Formulas = The atoms can be combined into formulas, as is usual in first-order logic, with the logical operators ‚àß (and), ‚à® (or) and ¬¨ (not), and we can use the existential quantifier (‚àÉ) and the universal quantifier (‚àÄ) to bind the variables. We define the set of formulas F[S,type] inductively with the following rules: # every atom in A[S,type] is also in F[S,type] # if f1 and f2 are in F[S,type] then the formula f1 ‚àß f2 is also in F[S,type] # if f1 and f2 are in F[S,type] then the formula f1 ‚à® f2 is also in F[S,type] # if f is in F[S,type] then the formula ¬¨ f is also in F[S,type] # if v in V, H a header and f a formula in F[S,type[v->H then the formula ‚àÉ v : H ( f ) is also in F[S,type], where type[v->H] denotes the function that is equal to type except that it maps v to H, # if v in V, H a header and f a formula in F[S,type[v->H then the formula ‚àÄ v : H ( f ) is also in F[S,type] Examples of formulas: * t.name = \\"C. J. Date\\" ‚à® t.name = \\"H. Darwen\\" * Book(t) ‚à® Magazine(t) * ‚àÄ t : {author, title, subject} ( ¬¨ ( Book(t) ‚àß t.author = \\"C. J. Date\\" ‚àß ¬¨ ( t.subject = \\"relational model\\"))) Note that the last formula states that all books that are written by C. J. Date have as their subject the relational model. As usual we omit brackets if this causes no ambiguity about the semantics of the formula. We will assume that the quantifiers quantify over the universe of all tuples over the domain in the schema. This leads to the following formal semantics for formulas given a database db over S and a tuple variable binding val : V -> TD: # f1 ‚àß f2 is true if and only if f1 is true and f2 is true, # f1 ‚à® f2 is true if and only if f1 is true or f2 is true or both are true, # ¬¨ f is true if and only if f is not true, # ‚àÉ v : H ( f ) is true if and only if there is a tuple t over D such that dom(t) = H and the formula f is true for val[v->t], and # ‚àÄ v : H ( f ) is true if and only if for all tuples t over D such that dom(t) = H the formula f is true for val[v->t]. = Queries = Finally we define what a query expression looks like given a schema S = (D, R, h): : { v : H  f(v) } where v is a tuple variable, H a header and f(v) a formula in F[S,type] where type = { (v, H) } and with v as its only free variable. The result of such a query for a given database db over S is the set of all tuples t over D with dom(t) = H such that f is true for db and val = { (v, t) }. Examples of query expressions are: * { t : {name}  ‚àÉ s : {name, wage} ( Employee(s) ‚àß s.wage = 50.000 ‚àß t.name = s.name ) } * { t : {supplier, article}  ‚àÉ s : {s#, sname} ( Supplier(s) ‚àß s.sname = t.supplier ‚àß ‚àÉ p : {p#, pname} ( Product(p) ‚àß p.pname = t.article ‚àß ‚àÉ a : {s#, p#} ( Supplies(a) ‚àß s.s# = a.s# ‚àß a.p# = p.p# ) }  Semantic and syntactic restriction of the calculus  = Domain-independent queries = Because the semantics of the quantifiers is such that they quantify over all the tuples over the domain in the schema it can be that a query may return a different result for a certain database if another schema is presumed. For example, consider the two schemas S1 = ( D1, R, h ) and S2 = ( D2, R, h ) with domains D1 = { 1 }, D2 = { 1, 2 }, relation names R = { \\"r1\\" } and headers h = { (\\"r1\\", {\\"a\\"}) }. Both schemas have a common instance: : db = { ( \\"r1\\", { (\\"a\\", 1) } ) } If we consider the following query expression : { t : {a}  t.a = t.a } then its result on db is either { (a : 1) } under S1 or { (a : 1), (a : 2) } under S2. It will also be clear that if we take the domain to be an infinite set, then the result of the query will also be infinite. To solve these problems we will restrict our attention to those queries that are domain independent, i.e., the queries that return the same result for a database under all of its schemas. An interesting property of these queries is that if we assume that the tuple variables range over tuples over the so-called active domain of the database, which is the subset of the domain that occurs in at least one tuple in the database or in the query expression, then the semantics of the query expressions does not change. In fact, in many definitions of the tuple calculus this is how the semantics of the quantifiers is defined, which makes all queries by definition domain independent. = Safe queries = In order to limit the query expressions such that they express only domain- independent queries a syntactical notion of safe query is usually introduced. To determine whether a query expression is safe we will derive two types of information from a query. The first is whether a variable-column pair t.a is bound to the column of a relation or a constant, and the second is whether two variable-column pairs are directly or indirectly equated (denoted t.v  s.w). For deriving boundedness we introduce the following reasoning rules: # in \\" v.a = w.b \\" no variable-column pair is bound, # in \\" v.a = k \\" the variable- column pair v.a is bound, # in \\" r(v) \\" all pairs v.a are bound for a in type(v), # in \\" f1 ‚àß f2 \\" all pairs are bound that are bound either in f1 or in f2, # in \\" f1 ‚à® f2 \\" all pairs are bound that are bound both in f1 and in f2, # in \\" ¬¨ f \\" no pairs are bound, # in \\" ‚àÉ v : H ( f ) \\" a pair w.a is bound if it is bound in f and w <> v, and # in \\" ‚àÄ v : H ( f ) \\" a pair w.a is bound if it is bound in f and w <> v. For deriving equatedness we introduce the following reasoning rules (next to the usual reasoning rules for equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity): # in \\" v.a = w.b \\" it holds that v.a  w.b, # in \\" v.a = k \\" no pairs are equated, # in \\" r(v) \\" no pairs are equated, # in \\" f1 ‚àß f2 \\" it holds that v.a  w.b if it holds either in f1 or in f2, # in \\" f1 ‚à® f2 \\" it holds that v.a  w.b if it holds both in f1 and in f2, # in \\" ¬¨ f \\" no pairs are equated, # in \\" ‚àÉ v : H ( f ) \\" it holds that w.a  x.b if it holds in f and w<>v and x<>v, and # in \\" ‚àÄ v : H ( f ) \\" it holds that w.a  x.b if it holds in f and w<>v and x<>v. We then say that a query expression { v : H  f(v) } is safe if * for every column name a in H we can derive that v.a is equated with a bound pair in f, * for every subexpression of f of the form \\" ‚àÄ w : G ( g ) \\" we can derive that for every column name a in G we can derive that w.a is equated with a bound pair in g, and * for every subexpression of f of the form \\" ‚àÉ w : G ( g ) \\" we can derive that for every column name a in G we can derive that w.a is equated with a bound pair in g. The restriction to safe query expressions does not limit the expressiveness since all domain-independent queries that could be expressed can also be expressed by a safe query expression. This can be proven by showing that for a schema S = (D, R, h), a given set K of constants in the query expression, a tuple variable v and a header H we can construct a safe formula for every pair v.a with a in H that states that its value is in the active domain. For example, assume that K={1,2}, R={\\"r\\"} and h = { (\\"r\\", {\\"a, \\"b\\"}) } then the corresponding safe formula for v.b is: : v.b = 1 ‚à® v.b = 2 ‚à® ‚àÉ w ( r(w) ‚àß ( v.b = w.a ‚à® v.b = w.b ) ) This formula, then, can be used to rewrite any unsafe query expression to an equivalent safe query expression by adding such a formula for every variable v and column name a in its type where it is used in the expression. Effectively this means that we let all variables range over the active domain, which, as was already explained, does not change the semantics if the expressed query is domain independent.

Biography The Vision of Daniel, 1650, Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin Bathsheba, 1654, oil on canvas, Louvre. He is a mysterious figure, closely associated with Rembrandt, with very few paintings clearly attributable to him.Slive, 116 He was presumably born in Amsterdam, in what was then known as the United Provinces of the Netherlands, but when and where is unknown. Around 1650, according to the early art historian Houbraken, he became a student of Rembrandt, eventually developing a close working relationship, painting history scenes, biblical compositions, symbolic studies of a solitary figure, as well as portraits. As a student, his 1654 painting titled Bathsheba was inspired by Rembrandt's painting done in the same year on the same subject and given the same title, though their treatments are rather different; both Drost's and Rembrandt's paintings are in the Louvre in Paris. Houbraken described him as a painter of historical allegories and a pupil of Rembrandt. Willem Drost Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken saw a Johannes Predicatie (Sermon of John) by him that was well composed and painted. He spent a long period in Rome where he became friends with Karel Lot and the well-to-do Utrecht painter Joan vander Meer, who had travelled to Italy in the company of the marine painter Lieve Verschuier in 1653 and became friends with him there. Portrait of a Young Man He was in Amsterdam until 1655 and then travelled to Italy.Willem Drost in the RKD He influenced the painter Adolf Boy. Sometime in the mid-1650s, the young artist went to Rome, where, again according to Houbraken, he collaborated with the German artist Johann Carl Loth on a lost series of the Four Evangelists in Venice.Slive, 117 He died in the latter city in 1659. Willem Drost's recognized lifetime output of artwork is very small, while Rembrandt is credited with more than 2,000 paintings and etchings, the majority of which are not signed. In recent years, some paintings attributed to Rembrandt have had their authenticity come under question. The importance of these Rembrandt works is such that the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project was established in Amsterdam to review the attribution of all of his works. Scholars have now reattributed a number of Rembrandt's paintings to his pupils and associates. Legacy Young Woman in a Brocade Gown, Wallace Collection Drost was one of Rembrandt's most talented disciples, so much so that his 1654 painting titled: Portrait of a Young Woman with her Hands Folded on a Book was one of the ones attributed to Rembrandt for more than 300 years. As well, when the portrait of a young man on horseback titled The Polish Rider was discovered in 1897 it too was attributed to Rembrandt. Acquired by New York City's Frick Collection, The Polish Rider is one of the Frick Museum's most valued treasures. For years, the painting's subject matter and purpose was questioned by many scholars, led by the renowned expert Julius S. Held in 1944. Starting in 1984, in a movement led by Dr. Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project, some began to believe this great painting may also be that of Willem Drost as may be several others. The Frick Collection has not changed the attribution, and today it is generally believed that Rembrandt initiated the painting but had others help him finish it. These attributions remain controversial, but a reattribution of a group of \\"Rembrandt\\" drawings to Drost is more widely accepted.

This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. One way of how a paradeigma is meant to guide an audience would be a personal accountant. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. Anaximenes defined paradeigma as \\"actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing.\\" The original Greek term œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ± (paradeigma) was used in Greek texts such as Plato's Timaeus (28 AD) as the model or the pattern that the demiurge used to create the cosmos. The term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar: the 1900 Merriam- Webster dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in rhetoric, as a term for an illustrative parable or fable. In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure used paradigm to refer to a class of elements with similarities. The Merriam-Webster Online dictionary defines this usage as \\"a philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated; broadly: a philosophical or theoretical framework of any kind.\\"paradigm - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy attributes the following description of the term to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions: > Kuhn suggests that certain scientific works, such as Newton's Principia or > John Dalton's New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808), provide an open- > ended resource: a framework of concepts, results, and procedures within > which subsequent work is structured.

Scientific paradigm The Oxford English Dictionary defines a paradigm as \\"a pattern or model, an exemplar; a typical instance of something, an example\\". The historian of science Thomas Kuhn gave it its contemporary meaning when he adopted the word to refer to the set of concepts and practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period of time. In his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (first published in 1962), Kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as: \\"universally recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners,\\"The Structure of Scientific Revolution, Kuhn, Thomas S. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd edition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. page 10 i.e., * what is to be observed and scrutinized * the kind of questions that are supposed to be asked and probed for answers in relation to this subject * how these questions are to be structured * what predictions made by the primary theory within the discipline * how the results of scientific investigations should be interpreted * how an experiment is to be conducted, and what equipment is available to conduct the experiment. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn saw the sciences as going through alternating periods of normal science, when an existing model of reality dominates a protracted period of puzzle-solving, and revolution, when the model of reality itself undergoes sudden drastic change. Paradigms have two aspects. Firstly, within normal science, the term refers to the set of exemplary experiments that are likely to be copied or emulated. Secondly, underpinning this set of exemplars are shared preconceptions, made prior to ‚Äì and conditioning ‚Äì the collection of evidence.Kuhn, T S (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Section V, pages 43-51. . These preconceptions embody both hidden assumptions and elements that he describes as quasi-metaphysical;Kuhn, T S (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Pages 88 and 41, respectively. the interpretations of the paradigm may vary among individual scientists.Kuhn, T S (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Page 44. Kuhn was at pains to point out that the rationale for the choice of exemplars is a specific way of viewing reality: that view and the status of \\"exemplar\\" are mutually reinforcing. For well-integrated members of a particular discipline, its paradigm is so convincing that it normally renders even the possibility of alternatives unconvincing and counter-intuitive. Such a paradigm is opaque, appearing to be a direct view of the bedrock of reality itself, and obscuring the possibility that there might be other, alternative imageries hidden behind it. The conviction that the current paradigm is reality tends to disqualify evidence that might undermine the paradigm itself; this in turn leads to a build-up of unreconciled anomalies. It is the latter that is responsible for the eventual revolutionary overthrow of the incumbent paradigm, and its replacement by a new one. Kuhn used the expression paradigm shift (see below) for this process, and likened it to the perceptual change that occurs when our interpretation of an ambiguous image \\"flips over\\" from one state to another.Kuhn, T S (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. (2nd Edition) University of Chicago Press. Page 85. (The rabbit-duck illusion is an example: it is not possible to see both the rabbit and the duck simultaneously.) This is significant in relation to the issue of incommensurability (see below). An example of a currently accepted paradigm would be the standard model of physics. The scientific method allows for orthodox scientific investigations into phenomena that might contradict or disprove the standard model; however grant funding would be proportionately more difficult to obtain for such experiments, depending on the degree of deviation from the accepted standard model theory the experiment would test for. To illustrate the point, an experiment to test for the mass of neutrinos or the decay of protons (small departures from the model) is more likely to receive money than experiments that look for the violation of the conservation of momentum, or ways to engineer reverse time travel. Mechanisms similar to the original Kuhnian paradigm have been invoked in various disciplines other than the philosophy of science. These include: the idea of major cultural themes, worldviews (and see below), ideologies, and mindsets. They have somewhat similar meanings that apply to smaller and larger scale examples of disciplined thought. In addition, Michel Foucault used the terms episteme and discourse, mathesis and taxinomia, for aspects of a \\"paradigm\\" in Kuhn's original sense. Paradigm shifts In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn wrote that \\"the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science\\" (p. 12). Paradigm shifts tend to appear in response to the accumulation of critical anomalies as well as the proposal of a new theory with the power to encompass both older relevant data and explain relevant anomalies. New paradigms tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, a statement generally attributed to physicist Lord Kelvin famously claimed, \\"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.\\"The attribution of this statement to Lord Kelvin is given in a number of sources, but without citation. It is reputed to be Kelvin's remark made in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900. See the article on Lord Kelvin for additional details and references. Five years later, Albert Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which challenged the set of rules laid down by Newtonian mechanics, which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years. In this case, the new paradigm reduces the old to a special case in the sense that Newtonian mechanics is still a good model for approximation for speeds that are slow compared to the speed of light. Many philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. Kuhn's original model is now generally seen as too limited . Some examples of contemporary paradigm shifts include: * In medicine, the transition from \\"clinical judgment\\" to evidence- based medicine * In social psychology, the transition from p-hacking to replication * In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm * In artificial intelligence, the transition from classical AI to data-driven AI Kuhn's idea was, itself, revolutionary in its time. It caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science; and, so, it may be that it caused (or was part of) a \\"paradigm shift\\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift. Being in the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science. =Paradigm paralysis= Perhaps the greatest barrier to a paradigm shift, in some cases, is the reality of paradigm paralysis: the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking.Do you suffer from paradigm paralysis? This is similar to what psychologists term confirmation bias and the Semmelweis reflex. Examples include rejection of Aristarchus of Samos', Copernicus', and Galileo's theory of a heliocentric solar system, the discovery of electrostatic photography, xerography and the quartz clock. Incommensurability Kuhn pointed out that it could be difficult to assess whether a particular paradigm shift had actually led to progress, in the sense of explaining more facts, explaining more important facts, or providing better explanations, because the understanding of \\"more important\\", \\"better\\", etc. changed with the paradigm. The two versions of reality are thus incommensurable. Kuhn's version of incommensurability has an important psychological dimension; this is apparent from his analogy between a paradigm shift and the flip-over involved in some optical illusions. However, he subsequently diluted his commitment to incommensurability considerably, partly in the light of other studies of scientific development that did not involve revolutionary change.Haack, S (2003) Defending Science ‚Äì within reason: between scientism and cynicism. Prometheus Books. . One of the examples of incommensurability that Kuhn used was the change in the style of chemical investigations that followed the work of Lavoisier on atomic theory in the late 18th Century. In this change, the focus had shifted from the bulk properties of matter (such as hardness, colour, reactivity, etc.) to studies of atomic weights and quantitative studies of reactions. He suggested that it was impossible to make the comparison needed to judge which body of knowledge was better or more advanced. However, this change in research style (and paradigm) eventually (after more than a century) led to a theory of atomic structure that accounts well for the bulk properties of matter; see, for example, Brady's General Chemistry.Brady, J E (1990). General Chemistry: Principles and Structure. (5th Edition.) John Wiley and Sons. According to P J Smith, this ability of science to back off, move sideways, and then advance is characteristic of the natural sciences,Smith, P J (2011) The Reform of Economics. Taw Books. . Page 129. but contrasts with the position in some social sciences, notably economics.Smith, P J (2011) The Reform of Economics. Taw Books. Chapter 7. This apparent ability does not guarantee that the account is veridical at any one time, of course, and most modern philosophers of science are fallibilists. However, members of other disciplines do see the issue of incommensurability as a much greater obstacle to evaluations of \\"progress\\"; see, for example, Martin Slattery's Key Ideas in Sociology. Subsequent developments Opaque Kuhnian paradigms and paradigm shifts do exist. A few years after the discovery of the mirror-neurons that provide a hard-wired basis for the human capacity for empathy, the scientists involved were unable to identify the incidents that had directed their attention to the issue. Over the course of the investigation, their language and metaphors had changed so that they themselves could no longer interpret all of their own earlier laboratory notes and records.Iacoboni, M. (2008), Mirroring People: The New Science of How We Connect with Others. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Page 17. =Imre Lakatos and research programmes= However, many instances exist in which change in a discipline's core model of reality has happened in a more evolutionary manner, with individual scientists exploring the usefulness of alternatives in a way that would not be possible if they were constrained by a paradigm. Imre Lakatos suggested (as an alternative to Kuhn's formulation) that scientists actually work within research programmes.[16] Lakatos, I. (1970), \\"Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes,\\" in Lakatos, I. and Musgrave, A. (eds.) (1990), Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge. Cambridge. In Lakatos' sense, a research programme is a sequence of problems, placed in order of priority. This set of priorities, and the associated set of preferred techniques, is the positive heuristic of a programme. Each programme also has a negative heuristic; this consists of a set of fundamental assumptions that ‚Äì temporarily, at least ‚Äì takes priority over observational evidence when the two appear to conflict. This latter aspect of research programmes is inherited from Kuhn's work on paradigms, and represents an important departure from the elementary account of how science works. According to this, science proceeds through repeated cycles of observation, induction, hypothesis-testing, etc., with the test of consistency with empirical evidence being imposed at each stage. Paradigms and research programmes allow anomalies to be set aside, where there is reason to believe that they arise from incomplete knowledge (about either the substantive topic, or some aspect of the theories implicitly used in making observations. =Larry Laudan: Dormant anomalies, fading credibility, and research traditions= Larry LaudanLaudan, L. (1977), Progress and Its Problems: Towards a Theory of Scientific Growth. University of California Press, Berkeley. has also made two important contributions to the debate. Laudan believed that something akin to paradigms exist in the social sciences (Kuhn had contested this, see below); he referred to these as research traditions. Laudan noted that some anomalies become \\"dormant\\", if they survive a long period during which no competing alternative has shown itself capable of resolving the anomaly. He also presented cases in which a dominant paradigm had withered away because its lost credibility when viewed against changes in the wider intellectual milieu. In social sciences Kuhn himself did not consider the concept of paradigm as appropriate for the social sciences. He explains in his preface to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions that he developed the concept of paradigm precisely to distinguish the social from the natural sciences. While visiting the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1958 and 1959, surrounded by social scientists, he observed that they were never in agreement about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods. He explains that he wrote this book precisely to show that there can never be any paradigms in the social sciences. Mattei Dogan, a French sociologist, in his article \\"Paradigms in the Social Sciences,\\" develops Kuhn's original thesis that there are no paradigms at all in the social sciences since the concepts are polysemic, involving the deliberate mutual ignorance between scholars and the proliferation of schools in these disciplines. Dogan provides many examples of the non-existence of paradigms in the social sciences in his essay, particularly in sociology, political science and political anthropology. However, both Kuhn's original work and Dogan's commentary are directed at disciplines that are defined by conventional labels (such as \\"sociology\\"). While it is true that such broad groupings in the social sciences are usually not based on a Kuhnian paradigm, each of the competing sub-disciplines may still be underpinned by a paradigm, research programme, research tradition, and/ or professional imagery. These structures will be motivating research, providing it with an agenda, defining what is and is not anomalous evidence, and inhibiting debate with other groups that fall under the same broad disciplinary label. (A good example is provided by the contrast between Skinnerian radical behaviourism and personal construct theory (PCT) within psychology. The most significant of the many ways these two sub-disciplines of psychology differ concerns meanings and intentions. In PCT, they are seen as the central concern of psychology; in radical behaviourism, they are not scientific evidence at all, as they cannot be directly observed.) Such considerations explain the conflict between the Kuhn/ Dogan view, and the views of others (including Larry Laudan, see above), who do apply these concepts to social sciences. Handa,Handa, M. L. (1986) \\"Peace Paradigm: Transcending Liberal and Marxian Paradigms\\". Paper presented in \\"International Symposium on Science, Technology and Development, New Delhi, India, March 20‚Äì25, 1987, Mimeographed at O.I.S.E., University of Toronto, Canada (1986) M.L. (1986) introduced the idea of \\"social paradigm\\" in the context of social sciences. He identified the basic components of a social paradigm. Like Kuhn, Handa addressed the issue of changing paradigm; the process popularly known as \\"paradigm shift\\". In this respect, he focused on social circumstances that precipitate such a shift and the effects of the shift on social institutions, including the institution of education. This broad shift in the social arena, in turn, changes the way the individual perceives reality. Another use of the word paradigm is in the sense of \\"worldview\\". For example, in social science, the term is used to describe the set of experiences, beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and responds to that perception. Social scientists have adopted the Kuhnian phrase \\"paradigm shift\\" to denote a change in how a given society goes about organizing and understanding reality. A \\"dominant paradigm\\" refers to the values, or system of thought, in a society that are most standard and widely held at a given time. Dominant paradigms are shaped both by the community's cultural background and by the context of the historical moment. Hutchin Hutchin, Ted (2013) The Right Choice : Using Theory of Constraints for Effective Leadership, Taylor and Francis, Hoboken, p. 124 outlines some conditions that facilitate a system of thought to become an accepted dominant paradigm: * Professional organizations that give legitimacy to the paradigm * Dynamic leaders who introduce and purport the paradigm * Journals and editors who write about the system of thought. They both disseminate the information essential to the paradigm and give the paradigm legitimacy * Government agencies who give credence to the paradigm * Educators who propagate the paradigm's ideas by teaching it to students * Conferences conducted that are devoted to discussing ideas central to the paradigm * Media coverage * Lay groups, or groups based around the concerns of lay persons, that embrace the beliefs central to the paradigm * Sources of funding to further research on the paradigm Other uses The word paradigm is also still used to indicate a pattern or model or an outstandingly clear or typical example or archetype. The term is frequently used in this sense in the design professions. Design Paradigms or archetypes comprise functional precedents for design solutions. The best known references on design paradigms are Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization, by Wake, and Design Paradigms by Petroski. This term is also used in cybernetics. Here it means (in a very wide sense) a (conceptual) protoprogram for reducing the chaotic mass to some form of order. Note the similarities to the concept of entropy in chemistry and physics. A paradigm there would be a sort of prohibition to proceed with any action that would increase the total entropy of the system. To create a paradigm requires a closed system that accepts changes. Thus a paradigm can only apply to a system that is not in its final stage. Beyond its use in the physical and social sciences, Kuhn's paradigm concept has been analysed in relation to its applicability in identifying 'paradigms' with respect to worldviews at specific points in history. One example is Matthew Edward Harris' book The Notion of Papal Monarchy in the Thirteenth Century: The Idea of Paradigm in Church History. Harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms, pointing towards Kuhn's second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Although obedience to popes such as Innocent III and Boniface VIII was widespread, even written testimony from the time showing loyalty to the pope does not demonstrate that the writer had the same worldview as the Church, and therefore pope, at the centre. The difference between paradigms in the physical sciences and in historical organisations such as the Church is that the former, unlike the latter, requires technical expertise rather than repeating statements. In other words, after scientific training through what Kuhn calls 'exemplars', one could not genuinely believe that, to take a trivial example, the earth is flat, whereas thinkers such as Giles of Rome in the thirteenth century wrote in favour of the pope, then could easily write similarly glowing things about the king. A writer such as Giles would have wanted a good job from the pope; he was a papal publicist. However, Harris writes that 'scientific group membership is not concerned with desire, emotions, gain, loss and any idealistic notions concerning the nature and destiny of humankind...but simply to do with aptitude, explanation, [and] cold description of the facts of the world and the universe from within a paradigm'.

In non-electrical applications the bobbin is used for tidy storage without tangles. In electrical applications, a coil of wire carrying a current will create a magnetic field. This effect is used in solenoids.  Textiles  As used in spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, or lacemaking, the bobbin provides temporary or permanent storage for yarn or thread and may be made of plastic, metal, bone, or wood. =Sewing= The lockstitch sewing machine, invented and developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, forms a stitch with two threads: one passed through a needle and another from a bobbin. Each thread stays on the same side of the material being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole thanks to the machine's movement. Tension of the bobbin thread is maintained with a bobbin case, a metal enclosure with a leaf spring which keeps the thread taut. Bobbins vary in shape and size, depending on the style of bobbin driver in the machine for which they are intended to be used. Long, narrow bobbins are used in early transverse shuttle and vibrating shuttle machines. These earlier movements were rendered obsolete by the invention of the rotary hook and the shuttle hook, which run faster and quieter with less air resistance. These shorter, wider bobbins are familiar to modern sewers, as the rotary/shuttle hook remains in use on modern machines essentially unchanged. =Lacemaking= Bobbin lace requires the winding of yarn onto a temporary storage spindle made of wood (or, in earlier times, bone) often turned on a lathe. Exotic woods are extremely popular with contemporary lacemakers. Many lace designs require dozens of bobbins at any one time. Both traditional and contemporary bobbins may be decorated with designs, inscriptions, or pewter or wire inlays. Often, bobbins are 'spangled' to provide additional weight to keep the thread in tension. A hole is drilled near the base to enable glass beads and other ornaments to be attached by a loop of wire. These spangles provide a means of self-expression in the decoration of a tool of the craft. Antique and unique bobbins, sometimes spangled, are highly sought-after by antiques collectors.  Electrical  Electrical transformers, inductors and relay coils use bobbins as permanent containers for the wire to retain shape and rigidity, and to ease assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. The bobbin may be made of thermoplastic or thermosetting (for example, phenolic) materials. This plastic often has to have a T√úV, UL or other regulatory agency flammability rating for safety reasons.

Often used in the production of musical tones or notes, it was developed by Wolfgang Palm of Palm Products GmbH (PPG) in the late 1970s and published in 1979, and has since been used as the primary synthesis method in synthesizers built by PPG and Waldorf Music and as an auxiliary synthesis method by Ensoniq and Access. It is currently used in hardware synthesizers from Waldorf Music and in software-based synthesizers for PCs and tablets, including apps offered by PPG and Waldorf, among others. It was also independently developed in a similar time frame by Michael McNabb, who used it in his 1978 composition Dreamsong.  Principle  Wavetable synthesis is fundamentally based on periodic reproduction of an arbitrary, single-cycle waveform. In wavetable synthesis, some method is employed to vary or modulate the selected waveform in the wavetable. The position in the wavetable selects the single cycle waveform. Digital interpolation between adjacent waveforms allows for dynamic and smooth changes of the timbre of the tone produced. Sweeping the wavetable in either direction can be controlled in a number of ways, for example, by use of an LFO, envelope, pressure or velocity. Many wavetables used in PPG and Ensoniq synthesizers can simulate the methods used by analog synthesizers, such as Pulse Width Modulation by utilising a number of square waves of different duty cycles. In this way, when the wavetable is swept, the duty cycle of the pulse wave will appear to change over time. As the early Ensoniq wavetable synthesizers had non resonant filters (the PPG Wave synthesizers used analogue Curtis resonant filters), some wavetables contained highly resonant waveforms to overcome this limitation of the filters. = Confusion with sample-based synthesis (S&S;) and Digital Wave Synthesis = In 1992, with the introduction of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 the term \\"wavetable\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20120202001938/http://support.creative.com/kb/ShowArticle.aspx?sid=5800 started to be (incorrectly) applied as a marketing term to their sound card. However, these sound cards did not employ any form of wavetable synthesis,https://www.wikiaudio.org/wavetable-synthesis/ but rather PCM samples and FM synthesis. S&S; (Sample and Synthesis) and Digital Wave Synthesis was the main method of sound synthesis utilised by digital synthesizers starting in the mid 80's with synthesizers such as Sequential Circuits Prophet VS, Korg DW6000/8000 (DW standing for Digital Wave), Roland D50 and Korg M1 through to current synthesizers. Ableton clears this up some confusion in this article. https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/new-wave-depth- look-wavetable/ \\"Wait, so isn‚Äôt this just sampled synthesis? Let‚Äôs pause here to address a common confusion. While sampled synthesis involves the use of a static digital sample, wavetable synthesis allows for the (optional) evolution of a waveform; this is to say, while wavetable synths can sound like sampled synthesis, the evolving option (which is enabled by default on most classic wavetable sounds) differentiates it. If you want to go further down this rabbit hole, this article from Sound on Sound is recommended.\\" Often they now have displays showing a real time 3d graphs of the wave table being played back with the current waveform highlighted which is the signature feature common in modern wavetable synths.  User wavetables  The creation of new wavetables was previously a difficult process unless supported by specialized editing facilities and (near) real-time playback of edited wavetables on the synthesizer. Such editors often required the use of extra hardware devices like the PPG Waveterm or were only present in expensive models like the Waldorf WAVE. More commonly, pre-computed wavetables could be added via memory cards or sent to the synthesizer via MIDI. Today, wavetables can be created more easily by software and auditioned directly on a computer. Since all waveforms used in wavetable synthesis are periodic, the time-domain and frequency-domain representation are exact equivalents of each other and both can be used simultaneously to define waveforms and wavetables. = Practical use = During playback, the sound produced can be harmonically changed by moving to another point in the wavetable, usually under the control of an envelope generator or low frequency oscillator but frequently by any number of modulators (matrix modulation). Doing this modifies the harmonic content of the output wave in real time, producing sounds that can imitate acoustic instruments or be totally abstract, which is where this method of sound creation excels. The technique is especially useful for evolving synth pads, where the sound changes slowly over time. It is often necessary to 'audition' each position in a wavetable and to scan through it, forwards and backwards, in order to make good use of it, though selecting random wavetables, start positions, end positions and directions of scan can also produce satisfying musical results. It is worth noting that most wavetable synthesizers also employ other synthesis methods to further shape the output waveform, such as subtractive synthesis (filters), phase modulation, frequency modulation and AM (ring) modulation.  Table-lookup synthesis  Table-lookup synthesis , \\"This chapter outlines the fundamental methods of digital sound production. Following a brief historical overview, we present the theory of table-lookup synthesis--the core of most synthesis algorithms. ...\\" (or Wavetable-lookup synthesis , \\"Pitch-shifting ... variation technique as used in 'wavetable- lookup synthesis described in chapter 3.\\" ) is a class of sound synthesis methods using the waveform tables by table-lookup, called \\"table-lookup oscillator\\" technique. The length of waveforms or samples may be varied by each sound synthesis method, from a single-cycle up to several minutes. = Terminologies = The term \\"waveform table\\" (or \\"wave shape table\\" as equivalent) is often abbreviated to \\"wavetable\\", and its derive term \\"wavetable oscillator\\" seems to be almost same as \\"table-lookup oscillator\\" mentioned above, although the word \\"wave\\" (or \\"waveform\\", \\"wave shape\\") may possibly imply a nuance of single-cycle waveform. However, a derive term \\"wavetable synthesis\\" seems slightly confusing. In a natural usage of words, its original meaning is basically same as \\"table-lookup synthesis\\", Note: on the above quotation, the authors paraphrased the section title \\"table-lookup oscillators\\" as follows: \\"table-lookup method\\", \\"wavetable synthesis\\", and \\"table-lookup synthesis\\". (HTML version available) \\"For example, the wavetable oscillator used in Fig. 1 made its first appearance in Mathews's Music II (two, not eleven) in the late 1950s. Music II was only one in a long sequence of MUSIC N programs, but the idea of wavetable synthesis has had a pervasive influence throughout the computer music discipline.\\" and possibly several actions on waveform(s) may be expected, as seen on a paper about Karplus‚ÄìStrong string synthesis (a simplest class of \\"wavetable-modification algorithm\\" known as digital waveguide synthesis . (See also the Wikipedia article Digital waveguide synthesis: ‚ÄúThe term \\"digital waveguide synthesis\\" was coined by Julius O. Smith III who helped develop it and eventually filed the patent. It represents an extension of the Karplus‚ÄìStrong algorithm. Stanford University owns the patent rights for digital waveguide synthesis and signed an agreement in 1989 to develop the technology with Yamaha.‚Äù) ). Then in the late-1970s, Michael McNabb and Wolfgang Palm independently develop the multiple-wavetable extension on the table-lookup synthesis \\"Multiple wavetable synthesis\\" developed by Michael McNabb and Wolfgang Palm in the late-1970s, is merely one of the efficient implementation techniques to realize dynamically changing waveforms, by using an array of single-cycle waveforms on a table-lookup synthesis. On this synthesis technique, the waveform can be animated in a similar manner as a flip book. which was typically used on PPG Wave and known with wavetable sweeping, , \\"However, in the late '70s, Wolfgang Palm used 'wavetable' digital oscillators in his innovative PPG Wave synths. Instead of having just three or four waveforms, a wavetable oscillator can have many more -- say, 64 -- because they are digitally created and stored in a 'look-up table' ... Now, if the waveforms are sensibly arranged, we can begin to create harmonic movement in the sound. ... you approach something not unlike a traditional filter sweep. ...\\" and it was later referred as \\"multiple wavetable synthesis\\" by . Simultaneously since late-1970s, also the sample-based synthesis using relatively long samples instead of single-cycle waveforms, have become influential by the introductions of the Fairlight CMI and E-mu Emulator. =Background= On the above four terminologies for the classes of sound synthesis methods, i.e., # Wavetable synthesis -- original, generic meaning (i.e. a single-cycle table-lookup synthesis). # Multiple wavetable synthesis -- developed by McNabb and Palm, typically used on PPG Waves. # Wavetable- modification algorithm -- including digital waveguide synthesis. # Sample- based synthesis if these had been appropriately used to distinguish each other, any confusions could be avoided, but it seems failed historically. At latest in the 1990s, several influential sample-based synthesis products were marketed under the trade names similar to \\"wavetable synthesis\\" (including Gravis Ultrasound wavetable card, Creative Wave Blaster wavetable daughterboard, and Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth), and these confusions have further affected on the several industry standards (including MPEG-4 Structured Audio algorithmic and wavetable synthesis, and AC97 optional hw acceleration wavetable synth ). As a rebound of these, at the latest since the mid-2000s, a new confusion seem to begin flourish. Merely a subclass of generic wavetable synthesis, i.e. McNabb and Palm's multiple wavetable synthesis, tends to be erroneously referred as if it was a generic class of whole wavetable synthesis family, exclusively. , \\"Other synths have employed wavetable synthesis in one guise or another since then and there are several software synths available today which incorporate wavetable synthesis capabilities.\\" Note: on the above quotation, a specific wavetable synthesis developed by Wolfgang Palm, known as \\"multiple wavetable synthesis\\", is ambiguously referred as \\"wavetable synthesis\\". As a background of these confusions, the difficulties of maintaining the consistencies between concepts and terminologies during the rapid developments of technology, may be significant. And it is a reason why this slightly classical terminology \\"Table-lookup synthesis\\" is explained on here.

It is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammonia-like smell typical for organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is miscible with water, ethanol, and kerosene. In concentration between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. Symmetrical dimethylhydrazine, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is also known but is not as useful.  Production  UDMH is produced industrially by two routes.

UDMH is a derivative of hydrazine and is sometimes referred to as a hydrazine. As a fuel, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-25604 in the United States. UDMH is stable and can be kept loaded in rocket fuel systems for long periods, which makes it appealing for use in many liquid rocket engines, despite its cost. In some applications, such as the OMS in the Space Shuttle or maneuvering engines, monomethylhydrazine is used instead due to its slightly higher specific impulse. In some kerosene-fueled rockets, UDMH functions as a starter fuel to start combustion and warm the rocket engine prior to switching to kerosene. UDMH has higher stability than hydrazine, especially at elevated temperatures, and can be used as its replacement or together in a mixture. UDMH is used in many European, Russian, Indian, and Chinese rocket designs. The Russian SS-11 Sego (aka 8K84) ICBM, SS-19 Stiletto (aka 15A30) ICBM, Proton, Kosmos-3M, R-29RMU2 Layner, R-36M, Rokot (based on 15A30) and the Chinese Long March 2F are the most notable users of UDMH (which is referred to as \\"heptyl\\" [codename from Soviet era] by Russian engineers). The Titan, GSLV, and Delta rocket families use a mixture of 50% hydrazine and 50% UDMH, called Aerozine 50, in different stages. There is speculation that it is the fuel used in the ballistic missiles that North Korea has developed and tested in 2017.

His story became the inspiration for a play and a film. He died of AIDS-related complications in 2003. Background Hampton was born in Buffalo, New York, and was the eldest son of an attorney. He moved to New York City in 1981 and stumbled upon his now-famous ruse in 1983 when he and another man were attempting to gain entry into Studio 54. Unable to obtain entry, Hampton's partner decided to pose as Gregory Peck's son while Hampton assumed the identity of Sidney Poitier's son. They were ushered in as celebrities. Hampton began employing the persona of \\"David Poitier\\" to cadge free meals in restaurants. He also persuaded at least a dozen people into letting him stay with them and give him money, including Melanie Griffith, Gary Sinise, Calvin Klein, John Jay Iselin, the president of WNET; Osborn Elliott, the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism; Leonard Bernstein, and a Manhattan urologist. He convinced some that he was an acquaintance of their children, some that he had just missed a plane to Los Angeles with his luggage still on it, and some that his belongings had been stolen. In October 1983, Hampton was arrested and convicted for his frauds and was ordered to pay restitution of $4,469 to his various victims. After refusing to comply with these terms, he was sentenced to a term of 18 months to 4 years in prison. Six Degrees of Separation Playwright John Guare became interested in Hampton's story through his friendship with Inger McCabe Elliott and Osborn Elliott, who had been outraged to find \\"David Poitier\\" in bed with another man the morning after they let him into their home. Six Degrees of Separation opened at the Lincoln Center in May 1990 and became a long-running success. Hampton attempted to parlay the play's success to his benefit, giving interviews to the press, gate-crashing a producer's party, and beginning a campaign of harassment against Guare that included phone calls and death threats, prompting Guare to apply for a restraining order in April 1991, which was unsuccessful. In the fall of 1991, Hampton filed a $100 million lawsuit, claiming that the play had infringed on the copyright on his persona and his story. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. Later life After his release, Hampton continued to adopt false identities. After the play and film made his original con well-known, Hampton evolved other false identities and traveled extensively to find new victims. Hampton was in and out of prison in numerous states. He was interviewed during each break from incarceration by a journalist with the TV show The Justice Files, seen in the USA on Discovery Channel. After declaring his rehabilitation, Hampton continued traveling at least as late as 1996, where he found a large number of men who, even if they'd heard of his notoriety from the East Coast, had never seen his picture or the press, allowing him to move about unnoticed and simultaneously con multiple victims. In Spring 1996, Hampton arrived in Seattle, Washington, USA, posing as Antonio de Montilio, the son of a wealthy District of Columbia physician. Due to his light skin color, victims claimed he could easily be believed as the Puerto Rican he claimed to be. Typically, his story was colorful. Hampton claimed to have been mugged upon arriving in Seattle early for a work assignment for Vogue magazine. He was to interview Bill Gates but was suddenly in peril as his wallet was stolen and nothing could be replaced until that weekend was over. Hampton managed to woo two people within blocks of each other without their being aware that he was working them both. It is believed that he was first drawn to one victim, Justin Baird, because Baird had been identified at RPlace as the official taking in fundraising dollars from Bunny Brigade volunteers as they returned from their collection rounds. David Hampton died of AIDS-related complications while being treated for his illness at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.

The incident has since become legendary. The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their daimy≈ç (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform seppuku (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka, whose title was K≈çzuke no suke. After waiting and planning for a year, the r≈çnin avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then obliged to commit seppuku for the crime of murder. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should display in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era, during which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity. Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r≈çnin are known as Ch≈´shingura. The story was popularized in numerous plays, including in the genres of bunraku and kabuki. Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the Genroku era, which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some, the first Ch≈´shingura was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the Ch≈´shingura survive. The bakufu's censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years after the events in question in the late 18th century when Japanologist Isaac Titsingh first recorded the story of the forty-seven r≈çnin as one of the significant events of the Genroku era.Screech, T. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, p. 91. To this day, the story remains popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, Sengakuji Temple, where Asano Naganori and the r≈çnin are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event. Name The event is known in Japan as the , sometimes also referred to as the Ak≈ç vendetta. The participants in the revenge are called the or in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \\"forty-seven r≈çnin\\" or \\"forty-seven leaderless samurai\\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the . Story For many years, the version of events retold by A. B. Mitford in Tales of Old Japan (1871) was generally considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the West. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the forty-seven r≈çnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its details are now questioned.Analysis of Mitford's story by Dr. Henry Smith, Chushinguranew website, Columbia University Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study. Whether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains: Mitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \\"proofs\\" authenticating the factual basis of his story.Mitford, pp. 28‚Äì34. These documents were: # ...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira K≈çtsukƒì no Sukƒì's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.Mitford, p. 30. # ...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men, dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.Mitford, p. 31. # ...a paper which the Forty-seven R≈çnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira K√¥tsuk√© no Suk√©.Mitford, p. 32. (See Tales of Old Japan for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.) =Genesis of a tragedy= Ukiyo-e print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the Matsu no ≈år≈çka of Edo Castle Memorial stone marking the site of the Matsu no ≈år≈çka (Great Corridor of Pines) in Edo Castle, where Asano attacked Kira In 1701, two daimy≈ç, Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori, the young daimy≈ç of the Ak≈ç Domain (a small fiefdom in western Honsh≈´), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the Tsuwano Domain, were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of Emperor Higashiyama at Edo Castle, during their sankin-k≈çtai service to the sh≈çgun.Mitford, A. B. (1871). Tales of Old Japan, p. 7. Asano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke- no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's shogunate. He allegedly became upset at them, either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly moral Confucian. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific bakufu duties,Mitford, p. 7. offence was taken. Initially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.Mitford, pp. 8‚Äì10. However, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the Matsu no ≈år≈çka, the main grand corridor that interconnects the Shiro-shoin (ÁôΩÊõ∏Èô¢) and the ≈åhiroma of the Honmaru Goten (Êú¨‰∏∏Âæ°ÊÆø) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.Mitford, pp. 10‚Äì11. Kira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the sh≈çguns residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a katana, was completely forbidden in Edo Castle.Mitford, pp. 11‚Äì12. The daimy≈ç of Ak≈ç had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by seppuku. Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made r≈çnin (leaderless). This news was carried to ≈åishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with bakufu orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government. =Revenge plot= Two of the r≈çnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an ≈çtsuchi. Of Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader ≈åishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so. Kira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The r≈çnin saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks. ≈åishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers. One day, as ≈åishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A Satsuma man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai--by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour-- that he abused and insulted ≈åishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him. Not too long after, ≈åishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the r≈çnin took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father. ≈åishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly Ichiriki Chaya), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. ≈åishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid ≈åishi of his spies. Kira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \\"retirement\\", he then reluctantly let down his guard. The rest of the faithful r≈çnin now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to ≈åishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence. =Attack= Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack The r≈çnin attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion After two years, when ≈åishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,Mitford, p. 16. and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths. In ,Tsuchihashi conversion early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, ≈åishi and the other r≈çnin attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by ≈åishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, ≈åishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.Mitford, pp. 16‚Äì17. Once Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.Mitford, p. 17 All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which ≈åishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.Mitford, pp. 17‚Äì18. ≈åishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.Mitford, pp. 18‚Äì19. He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the r≈çnin climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge (katakiuchi, ÊïµË®é„Å°). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.Mitford, p. 19. After posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, ≈åishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but ≈åishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.Mitford, pp. 19‚Äì20. Kira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.Mitford, p. 20. Eventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the r≈çnin killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but ≈åishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.Mitford, p. 22. =Death of Kira= A renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.Mitford, p. 23. He refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The r≈çnin gathered, and ≈åishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira‚Äîas a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.Mitford, pp. 23‚Äì24. ≈åishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. ≈åishi indicated he personally would act as a kaishakunin (\\"second\\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.Mitford, p. 24. However, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, ≈åishi ordered the other r≈çnin to pin him down and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger. They then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.Mitford, pp. 24‚Äì25. One of the r≈çnin, the ashigaru Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Ak≈ç and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the r≈çnin turned themselves in.) =Aftermath= The r≈çnin, on their way back to Sengaku-ji, are halted in the street, and invited in for rest and refreshment. Women have their own ritual suicide, in which they slit their own throats. Here, the wife of Onodera Junai, one of the r≈çnin, prepares for her suicide; note the legs tied together, a female feature of seppuku to ensure a \\"decent\\" posture in death As day was breaking, they quickly carried Kira's head from his residence to their lord's grave in Sengaku-ji temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.Mitford, pp. 25‚Äì26. On arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 r≈çnin (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple and gave the abbot of the temple all of the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different daimy≈ç.Mitford, pp. 26‚Äì27. During this time, two of Kira's friends came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed. The shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the sh≈çgun received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the r≈çnin. As expected, the r≈çnin were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the sh≈çgun finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit seppuku instead of having them executed as criminals.Mitford, p. 28. Each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion. ≈åishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed seppuku. Each of the 46 r≈çnin killed himself in . This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \\"forty-six r≈çnin\\"; this refers to the group put to death by the sh≈çgun, while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh r≈çnin, identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the sh≈çgun (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by seppuku were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji, in front of the tomb of their master. The clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any. Graves of the forty-seven r≈çnin at Sengaku-ji The tombs at Sengaku-ji became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era. One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on ≈åishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that ≈åishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the r≈çnin. =Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship= Though the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and find a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven r≈çnin cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the r≈çnin had been sentenced to their honorable end. Asano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original. Part of the Remains of Former Kira Residence, currently Honjo Matsuzaka-cho Park =Members= Below are the names of the 47 r≈çnin in the following form: family name - pseudonym (kemy≈ç) - real name (imina). Alternative readings are listed in italics. Criticism The r≈çnin spent more than 14 months waiting for the \\"right time\\" for their revenge. It was Yamamoto Tsunetomo, author of the Hagakure, who asked the well known question: \\"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\\" His answer was that the forty- seven r≈çnin would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards‚Äîbringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the r≈çnin to do, writes Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The r≈çnin would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time‚Äîbut this was unimportant.Yamamoto, T. (Kodansha, 1979). Hagakure, p. 26. ≈åishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit. In the arts Painting of ≈åishi Yoshio committing seppuku The tragedy of the forty-seven r≈çnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art. Immediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the r≈çnin had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art. =Plays= The incident immediately inspired a succession of kabuki and bunraku plays; the first, The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga, appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in Osaka and Kyoto, farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as Manila, to spread the story to the rest of Asia. The most successful of the adaptations was a bunraku puppet play called Kanadehon Ch≈´shingura (now simply called Ch≈´shingura, or \\"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a kabuki play, which is still one of Japan's most popular. In the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became K≈ç no Moronao and ≈åishi became ≈åboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the r≈çnin were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the r≈çnin dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven). =Opera= The story was turned into an opera, Ch≈´shingura, by Shigeaki Saegusa in 1997. =Cinema and television= The play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,Child, Ben. \\"Keanu Reeves to play Japanese samurai in 47 Ronin\\", The Guardian (London). December 9, 2008. the earliest starring Onoe Matsunosuke. The film's release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying benshi narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director Kenji Mizoguchi, who would later direct Ugetsu, to make Genroku Ch≈´shingura. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar rekishi geki (\\"historical drama\\") of The Loyal 47 Ronin. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source Mayama Ch≈´shingura, a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s. The 1962 film version directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, Ch≈´shingura, is most familiar to Western audiences. In it, Toshir≈ç Mifune appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series Daich≈´shingura as ≈åishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic Swords of Vengeance (Ak≈ç-j≈ç danzetsu). Many Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as Daich≈´shingura and the more recent NHK Taiga drama Genroku Ry≈çran, recount the events. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the Ch≈´shingura, while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, gaiden dramatize events and characters not in the Ch≈´shingura. Kon Ichikawa directed another version in 1994. In 2004, Mitsumasa Sait≈ç directed a nine-episode mini-series starring Ken Matsudaira, who had also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the Ch≈´shingura entitled Genroku Ry≈çran. In Hirokazu Koreeda's 2006 film Hana yori mo nao, the story was used as a backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists. Most recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie titled 47 Ronin, starring Keanu Reeves, and then again into a more stylized 2015 version titled Last Knights. =Woodblock prints= The forty-seven r≈çnin is one of the most popular themes in woodblock prints, or ukiyo-e and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are Utamaro, Toyokuni, Hokusai, Kunisada, Hiroshige, and Yoshitoshi.Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012). Forty-Seven Ronin: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Edition. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00ADQGLB8 However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of Kuniyoshi, who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty triptychs. =Literature= * The earliest known account of the Ak≈ç incident in the West was published in 1822 in Isaac Titsingh's posthumously-published book Illustrations of Japan. *The r≈çnin are the main protagonists in a 2014 comic miniseries by Stan Sakai (art) and Mike Richardson (author).Dark Horse: \\"47 Ronin HC\\".

Judicial summons Summons for Martin Luther to appear at the 1521 Diet of Worms, signed by Charles V. The text on the left was on the reverse side. A judicial summons is served on a person involved in a legal proceeding. Legal action may be in progress against the person, or the person's presence as witness may be required.Application for a witness summons under criminal law of England and Wales In the former case, the summons will typically announce to the person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a case has been initiated in the issuing court. In some jurisdictions, it may be drafted in legal English difficult for the layman to understand, while several U.S. states expressly require summonses to be drafted in plain English and that they must start with this phrase: \\"Notice! You have been sued.\\" The summons announces a date by which the person or persons summoned must either appear in court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing party or parties. The summons is the descendant of the writ of the common law. It replaces the former procedure in common-law countries by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the sheriff to arrest the defendant in order for the court to obtain personal jurisdiction in both criminal and civil actions. Types of summonses =Citation/Claim (legal term)= A citation, traffic violation ticket, or notice to appear is a type of summons prepared and served at the scene of the occurrence by a law enforcement official, compelling the appearance of a defendant before the local magistrate within a certain period of time to answer for a minor traffic infraction, misdemeanor, or other summary offence. Failure to appear within the allotted period of time is a separate crime of failure to appear. In Australia, minor traffic and some summary offences are known as an infringement notice or a fine and can be dealt with by paying a particular monetary amount depending on the offence. The accused person has the right to have the matter heard in a court; if found not guilty the accused person pays nothing other than his legal costs (if any); if found guilty the accused person faces the prospect of a conviction for the offence and/or a substantial increase in the fine up to the maximum. For example, proceeding through a red light could go from A$353 up to A$2,200 if convicted in NSW. For more serious offences, a field court attendance notice is issued. In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, law enforcement officials may deal with certain minor offences, such as littering, by issuing a fixed penalty notice, colloquially called an \\"on-the-spot fine\\", although legally they are not fines. They allow the recipient to avoid going to court by paying a penalty fixed by statute. If such a notice is ignored or disputed, a court summons will be issued as for any other offence. =Civil summons= A civil summons is most often accompanied by a complaint. Depending on the type of summons, there is often an option to endorse a summons so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a summons will often have these options to endorse: # as an individual; # as the person sued under the fictitious name of ; # on behalf of (usually for a company); or # by personal delivery on  =Administrative summons= One example of an administrative summons is found in the tax law of the United States. The Internal Revenue Code authorizes the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a summons for a taxpayer‚Äîor any person having custody of books of account relating to a business of a taxpayer‚Äîto appear before the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (generally, this means the IRS employee who issued the summons) at the time and place named in the summons.The summons is generally executed on IRS Form 2039, Summons. The person summoned may be required to produce books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony under oath before an IRS employee.. The IRS is also empowered to issue the section 7602 summons for the purpose of \\"inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws.\\". The summons may be enforced by a court order,. For background, see Schulz v. Internal Revenue Service, 395 F.3d 463, 2005-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 50,165 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). and the law provides a criminal penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine, or both, for failure to obey the summons,. except that the person summoned may, to the extent applicable, assert a privilege against self incrimination or other evidentiary privileges, if applicable. In the U.S. immigration court system, a \\"Notice to Appear\\" is an administrative summons ordering a respondent to appear before an immigration court for removal proceedings. Summonses by jurisdictions =Australia= In the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) the service of a court attendance notice can be issued in a number of ways, the most common of which is by the NSW Police Force when charging someone after an arrest is made, a bail court attendance notice (with bail conditions) or regular court attendance notice is issued. Other methods the police use include via a paper form called a field court attendance notice (field CAN) which is issued to the accused person on the spot after an offence has been detected. Or by way of a future court attendance notice (future CAN), which replaced the old court issued summons and is served in person by police or sometimes by mail. In all of these cases, the CAN is filed at the court after it has been served. =England and Wales= Historically, in old English law, a summons was called an auxilium curiae, although this term is now obsolete. In England and Wales, the term writ of summons for the originating document in civil proceedings has been replaced with the term claim form by the Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (CPR). This is part of the reforms to simplify legal terminology. However, despite its name, the claim form does not present the details of the claim itself (in other words, it does not replace the complaint). The complaint is now known as the particulars of claim. In criminal matters, either a requisition, summons or warrant is issued to initiate criminal proceedings. A summons issued by the Leicester Magistrates' Court against Russell Finlay for a charge of common assault by beating. Signed by District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) Sally Fudge. This is a summons for a private prosecution. =United States= In most U.S. jurisdictions, the service of a summons is in most cases required for the court to have jurisdiction over the party who is being summoned.See, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, . The process by which a summons is served is called service of process. The form and content of service in the federal courts is governed by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the rules of many state courts are similar. The federal summons is usually issued by the clerk of the court. In many states, the summons may be issued by an attorney, but some states use filing as the means to commence an action and in those states, the attorney must first file the summons in duplicate before it becomes effective. One or more copies are stamped by the court clerk with the court seal and returned to the attorney, who then uses it to actually serve the defendants. Other jurisdictions may only require that the summons be filed after it is served on the defendants. New York is distinguished by its permissive filing system, in which the summons or complaint need not be filed at all.

The municipality comprises the city of Enghien, and the towns of () and Petit- Enghien (). It is situated on the language border in the country, and restricted language rights are granted to the Dutch speaking minority (so- called language facilities). History Enghien gave its name to a French duchy and to the commune of Enghien-les-Bains, a suburb of Paris, due to a complex series of family successions: in 1487, Mary of Luxembourg (d. 1547), the only heir of Peter II of Luxembourg (d. 1482), Count of Saint-Pol-sur- Ternoise and member of one of the branches of the House of Luxembourg, married Fran√ßois de Bourbon-Vend√¥me (d. 1495), the great-grandfather of King Henry IV of France. Mary of Luxembourg brought as her dowry the fief of Cond√©-en-Brie (Aisne d√©partement, France) and the county of Enghien, among others. These fiefs passed to her grandson Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©, uncle of King Henry IV of France, who started the line of the Princes of Cond√©, the famous cadet branch of the French royal family. In 1566, the county of Enghien was elevated to a duchy-peerage. However, the necessary registration process was not completed, so the title became extinct at the death of Louis I de Bourbon in 1569. In 1633, Henry II, Prince of Cond√©, grandson of Louis I de Bourbon, inherited the duchy of Montmorency, near Paris, after the execution of Henri II de Montmorency, brother of his wife Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency. In 1689, King Louis XIV allowed Henry III, Prince of Cond√©, grandson of Henry II, Prince of Cond√©, to rename the duchy of Montmorency as \\"duchy of Enghien\\", in memory of the duchy of Enghien which the Princes of Cond√© had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon. The city of Montmorency, at the heart of the duchy, continued to be known as \\"Montmorency\\", despite the official name change, but the name \\"Enghien\\" stuck to the nearby lake and marshland that developed later as a spa resort and was incorporated as the commune of Enghien-les-Bains in the 19th century.

La Louvi√®re's municipality includes the old communes of Haine-Saint-Paul, Haine-Saint-Pierre, Saint-Vaast, Trivi√®res, Boussoit, Houdeng-Aimeries, Houdeng-G≈ìgnies, Maurage, and Str√©py-Bracquegnies. La Louvi√®re is the capital of the Centre region, a former coal mining area in the sillon industriel, between the Borinage to the West and the Pays Noir to the East. History =Mythical origins= The legend of a mother wolf nursing a child at La Louvi√®re is reminiscent of the mythical birth of Rome. The true origin of the city, however, dates from the 12th century. At that time, the forested, and presumably wolf-infested, territory of today‚Äôs La Louvi√®re was named Menaulu, from the Old French meaning ‚Äúwolf‚Äôs lair‚Äù. This land was part of the larger community of Saint-Vaast, which itself belonged to the Aulne Abbey. By 1284, the name of the territory had been translated into Latin, then back into French to its current name of La Louvi√®re. The lords of Saint-Vaast encouraged prospecting on their land, which led to the first extraction of coal in the year 1390. The abbey‚Äôs refusal to provide necessary infrastructure, however, delayed large-scale development until the 18th century. =Birth of La Louvi√®re= In the 19th century, the construction of roads, canals, and railways finally allowed the local coal production to be exported. Investments also poured into the local industry to take advantage of the abundant source of energy. La Louvi√®re quickly surpassed its overlord Saint-Vaast, both in population and economic wealth. Within fifty years, the territory that was not much more than a place name had become one of the most important cities in Wallonia. La Louvi√®re was recognized as an independent city in 1869. Today, La Louvi√®re is still the fifth largest city in Wallonia, after Charleroi, Li√®ge, Namur, and Mons.

Climate La Louvi√®re has an oceanic climate typical of Belgium with moderated seasons even for its inland position at 50¬∞ latitude, as a result of Gulf Stream influence. Folklore The Carnival of La Louvi√®re is called Laetare, after the Latin verb meaning ‚Äúto enjoy‚Äù (the introit at mass on the fourth Sunday of Lent begins Laetare Jerusalem, Rejoice Jerusalem). It lasts three days, Sunday to Tuesday, and takes place in the middle of Lent. The Gilles are out on all three days, stomping to the rhythm of their music and distributing oranges to the passers-by. Giant puppets and various other groups also take part in the parades and festivities. Typical of La Louvi√®re‚Äôs celebrations is the so-called Br√ªlage des Bosses (‚Äúburning of the humps‚Äù), where a puppet dressed as a Gilles is burnt to symbolize the end of carnival and beginning of a new life.

The municipality is composed of the town of Soignies together with the villages of Casteau, Chauss√©e-Notre-Dame-Louvignies, Horrues, Neufvilles, Naast and Thieusies. Casteau is known worldwide because SHAPE, the military headquarters of NATO, has been based at the village since 1967. The name of Soignies comes from the Latin word suniacum, which means \\"on the Senne\\". The spring of the Senne is near Soignies. After Soignies, the river passes through Brussels. Soignies is also well known for its blue limestone (from the Carri√®res du Hainaut) and its glass industry (Durobor). History St. Vincent's Collegiate church =Saint Vincent= The known history of the region starts in the 7th century. The Frankish merchant Samo, who founded an empire in Central Europe, may have come from Soignies (Latin: pagus Senonagus).Chronicle of Fredegar, 4.48, edited and translated in J.M. Wallace- Hadrill, The Fourth Book of the Chronicle of Fredegar with its continuations (London 1960). Pagus Senonago could also be the district of Sens in modern France. In the 670s, Madelgaire, a wealthy former governor under King Dagobert I, and his wife Waltrude decided to separate and devote themselves to a religious life. Both of them founded an abbey, Madelgaire in Soignies and Waltrude in neighbouring Mons. Madelgaire took the religious name of Vincent. Like his wife, he was canonized after his death and later became the patron saint of the city that would eventually grow around the monastery. At that time, a large forest covered the whole area, the remnants of which near Brussels are still called the Sonian Forest (French: For√™t de Soignes, Dutch: Zoni√´nwoud) today. The existence of the abbey of Soignies is mentioned for the first time in the Treaty of Meersen, dated August 8, 870, as one of King Charles the Bald's possessions. =The age of the canons= At the end of the 9th century, a general decline in religious life led to a chapter of powerful canons - who did not take any vow of poverty - taking the place of the monks. These canons would remain in power for eight centuries, until the French Revolution. By the 10th century, the canons started the construction of the church of Saint Vincent (Madelgaire), which was to be completed during the following century in the prevalent Romanesque style of the period. The first known charter by Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut was granted to Soignies in 1142. The fame of the church of Saint Vincent grew in the 13th century, when the bishop of Cambrai granted a 40-day indulgence to every visitor to the church. The city itself grew to urban proportions at around the same time, coinciding with the development of the textile industry and the building of a defensive wall. The first stone quarries mentioned in the archives date from around 1400, but several clues lead to believe that local stone was already quarried much earlier. The cut-stone industry, however, started only around 1700. =1789‚Äìpresent= On September 1, 1796, the revolutionary council disbanded the local administration by the canons, thereby also dealing a heavy blow to the local economy. In 1812, only 92 people worked in the quarries on a total population of about 4,000 people. The industry, however, rebounded under the Dutch regime, and even more after the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Today, the cut-stone and glass industries are still active. Soignies is also the center of a vibrant service industry, especially in education and health. Sights *The collegiate church of St Vincent is one of the earliest specimens of Romanesque churches in Belgium. The choir dates from the beginning of the 11th century while the Gothic west tower dates from around 1250. The cemetery still has tombs of the 13th and 14th century. *Near the church stands the Cloth Market (in French Halle aux Draps), dating from the 16th century. Festivities *The origins of the Processio of Saint Vincent (Madelgaire) are not well known. It is certain, however, that it already took place as early as the 13th century. Today, every Monday of Pentecost, the reliquary of Saint Vincent is carried in a historic procession along a predetermined 11-km- long circuit around town, known as the Grand Tour Saint Vincent. *The Saturday preceding the third Sunday of October is the date of the local carnival.

On January 1, 2006, Binche had a total population of 32,409. The total area is 60.66 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 534 inhabitants per km¬≤. Since 1977, the municipality of Binche has gathered the town of Binche itself with seven old municipalities : Bray, Buvrinnes, Epinois, Leval-Trahegnies, P√©ronnes-lez-Binche, Ressaix and Waudrez. The motto of the city is \\"Plus Oultre\\" (meaning \\"Further\\" in Old French), which was the motto of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who in 1545 gave the medieval Castle of Binche to his sister, Queen Mary of Hungary. She lavished attention on Binche, which she had rebuilt into Binche Palace under the direction of an architect-sculptor Jacques du Broeucq, remembered today as the first master of Giambologna. The ch√¢teau, intended to rival Fontainebleau, was destroyed by the soldiers of Henry II of France in 1554. In 2003, the Carnival of Binche was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The gilles wearing their hat with ostrich feathers.  History  Binche developed in the Middle Ages close to the Roman Road that connected in Bagacum, the capital of the Nervii, (now Bavay) to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, (now Cologne). The road long influenced trade and communication through Binche. The city was officially founded in the 12th century by Yolande of Gelders, widow of Duke Baldwin III from Hainaut. Their son Baldwin IV fortified the city, which served as a frontier fortress against France. In the 14th century, the city wall was extended to its present size. The city reached its peak in economic and power when Belgium was under Spanish rule. Binche was the residence of Mary of Hungary, governess of the Netherlands for her brother, Emperor Charles V. She had a magnificent palace built, designed by the architect Jacques Du Broeucq and which was to compete with that of Fontainebleau. Charles V visited Binche in 1549 on invitation from his sister and for this occasion she organized magnificent celebrations. In 1554 the period of prosperity came to an end as the palace, the city and the surrounding area were plundered by the troops of King Henry II of France. Until the beginning of the 18th century, Hainaut was the site of repeated military conflicts between the kingdoms of France and Spain. Only with the industrial revolution did prosperity increase again. There were coal mines, whose heaps still shape the landscape today. Added to this were brickyards, tanneries, glaziers, breweries, lime kilns and soap factories. Thousands of people worked at home as top lace makers, cobblers and tailors. The post office and the train station date back to this time.  Notable people  * Gilles Binchois (c. 1400 ‚Äì 1460), composer * Berthe Dubail (1911-1984) painter.

The Thuin municipality includes the old communes of Leers-et-Fosteau, Biesme-sous-Thuin, Ragnies, Bierc√©e, Goz√©e, Donstiennes, and Thuillies. Thuan is the headquarters of the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (International Canine Association). History =Origins= This area was already used as a burial place in Gallo-Roman times, around the 2nd and 3rd century. The earliest name of the settlement, Thudinium Castellum, referring to a Roman fortification, is found on a 9th-century offering in Lobbes Abbey, which lists various neighbouring towns and related tithe duties. The village was a possession of the abbey of Lobbes and, together with the abbey, became part of the Bishopric of Li√®ge in 888. The neighbouring Aulne Abbey, reputedly founded in the 7th century by Landelin, a repentant robber, was also made part of the Bishopric of Li√®ge. A century later, Prince-Bishop Notger had a defensive wall built in Thuin, which then became the westernmost of the 23 bonnes villes (or principal cities) of the bishopric. =The frontiers of the Bishopric of Li√®ge= In the following centuries, several battles took place in this frontier area. In 1048, Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine was killed at the Battle of Thuin by Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Many more battles followed between the County of Hainaut and the Bishopric of Li√®ge, with Thuin caught in between. Despite the stronger defensive walls that were built in the 12th century and in the 15th century, Thuin was besieged several times. The Aulne Abbey, which had been given to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in 1147 fared better and was even expanded several times in the 16th and 18th century. In 1654, the Spanish army under the Prince of Cond√© tried in vain to take Thuin. The good fortunes of the city were attributed to the intercession of Saint Roch, who is still commemorated in the annual St-Roch procession. Several 17th-century buildings, including the belfry, can still be seen today in the upper city. In 1675, the troops of Louis XIV took and occupied Thuin until the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Like its neighbour Charleroi, Thuin went in turn to Spain and Austria. =After the French Revolution= On May 10, 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, General Marceau expelled the Austrians and Thuin became part of France. The Aulne Abbey was burned to the ground. In 1829, on the eve of the Belgian Revolution, William II of the Netherlands was welcomed in Thuin, to no avail. The last major heavy fighting around Thuin occurred on August 23, 1914, at the onset of World War I, when the French army found itself nearly surrounded by the German army.

Festivities *Every third Sunday of May, the town commemorates the help it received from Saint Roch during its fight against the Spanish army in 1654. The parade, as much a military march as a religious procession, was banned in the 18th century, but was reinstated in 1866 after Saint Roch delivered the city again, this time from an epidemic of cholera. The tradition has continued until today, interrupted only by the two world wars.

Some of the most popular categories of autograph subjects are presidents, military soldiers, athletes, movie stars, artists, social and religious leaders, scientists, astronauts, and authors. Some collectors may specialize in specific fields (such as Nobel Prize winners) or general topics (military leaders participating in World War I) or specific documents (i.e., signers of the Charter of the United Nations; signers of the U.S. Constitution; signers of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; signers of the Charter of the European Common Union; signers of the World War II German or Japanese surrender documents). The collection of autographs is in decline with fans preferring selfies instead. Commercialization Some celebrities still enjoy signing autographs for free for fans. Many people who stand outside premieres asking for autographs are actually professional autograph traders, who make their living or supplement their income by selling them for full profit, rather than keeping them as a personal souvenir. This is one of the main reasons for some celebrities only giving their signatures for a fee. Joe DiMaggio was able to earn more money through signing fees than he made in his playing career, though he also gave individual autographs. Bill Russell does not sign at all in public, and only sparingly at private sessions. Michael Jordan reportedly did not sign for most of his career because of safety concerns about frenzied attempts to get his signature, which is worth hundreds of dollars. Jordan has frequently signed at more peaceful events, such as golf tournaments. Pete Rose was paid to sign 30 baseballs with the inscription \\"I'm sorry I bet on baseball.\\" In the 1980s, actor/comedian Steve Martin carried business cards which he handed out to fans requesting an autograph; the cards read \\"This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny.\\" Realizing the potential profit in the sale of pop culture autographs, many dealers also would wait for hours for a celebrity to emerge from a location, present several photos for the celebrity to sign and then sell most of them. Michael Jackson's experience was typical; he often signed just a handful of autographs as he rushed from his hotel to his vehicle. Some collectors take note of which celebrities are the most gracious or the least forthcoming. Some dealers would locate a celebrity's home address and write to them repeatedly asking for autographs. Some celebrities soon grew tired of the practice and limited their responses. Because of the many autographs a celebrity might sign over time, some check requests against a record of past requests. Boxer George Foreman, for instance, records the names and addresses of every person requesting an autograph to limit such abuses. Some famous people flatly refuse to autograph anything for fans, such as the actors Paul Newman and Greta Garbo, and the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. =Glossary= In autograph- auction catalogues the following abbreviations are used to help describe the type of letter or document that is being offered for sale. * AD: Autograph Document (hand-written by the person to be collected, but not signed) * ADS: Autograph Document Signed (written and signed by same individual) * AL: Autograph Letter (hand-written by the person to be collected, but not signed) * ALS: Autograph Letter Signed (hand-written and signed by same individual) * AMs: Autograph Manuscript (hand-written; such as the draft of a play, research paper or music sheet) * AMsS: Autograph Manuscript Signed (hand-written and signed by same individual) * AMusQs: Autograph Musical Quotation Signed (hand- written and signed by same individual) * AN: Autograph Note (no salutation or closing, usually shorter than a letter) * ANS: Autograph Note Signed (hand- written and signed by same individual) * APCS: Autograph Postcard Signed (hand-written and signed by same individual) * AQS: Autograph Quote Signed (hand-written and signed by same individual; poem verse, sentence, or bar-of- music) * DS: Document signed (printed, or while hand-written by another, is signed by individual sought to be collected) * LS: Letter Signed (hand-written by someone else, but signed by the individual sought to be collected, frequently handwritten by secretaries before the advent of the typewriter) * PS: Photograph Signed or Postcard Signed * SP: Signed Photograph * TLS: Typed Letter Signed * TNS: Typed Note Signed * folio: A printer's sheet of paper folded once to make two leaves, double quarto size or larger. * octavo(8vo): A manuscript page about six-by-nine inches.

(Originally determined by folding a printer's sheet of paper twice to form four leaves.) Duplication, forging and authentication Autograph collectors enjoy assembling signed historical documents, letters, or objects as a way of capturing a piece of history. However, forgers seek to profit by selling forged items. Sometimes just the signature has been forged, in other instances the entire document has been fabricated. Differentiating forged from authentic autographs is almost impossible for the amateur collector, but a professional may be consulted. One method commonly seen on eBay is called \\"preprinting\\" by many sellers. The item is only a photocopy of an actual autographed photo, usually printed on glossy home photo paper. Since this is almost always disclosed to the buyer, some may not consider these actual forgeries. In October 2012, Chad Richard Baldwin of Gresham, Oregon, was sentenced to two years in prison for the sale of forged Babe Ruth and Beatles autographs. Baldwin is a highly skilled forger of sports memorabilia. Forgers may go to great lengths to make their forgeries appear authentic. Some use blank end papers from old books upon which to write their fake signatures in an attempt to match the paper of the era in which the personality lived. They have researched ink formulations of the era that they want to replicate. One book that explores the production of impressive fake manuscripts pertaining to Mormons is A Gathering of Saints by Robert Lindsey. Collectors should know the era in which American presidents signed their documents. American presidents signed land grants until President Andrew Jackson (c. 1836) became bored with the time-consuming task. Since then, secretaries of the president have mimicked their employer's signatures on these documents (known as \\"proxy\\" signatures). Many movie stars have their secretaries sign their letters and photographs for them. When Ronald Reagan was an actor during the 1940s, he had his mother sign his name to much of his fan mail. During the American Civil War, Jefferson Davis's wife frequently signed his name to his dictated letters due to his extensive correspondence. As she duplicated his signature so well, she usually placed a period after the signature so that he could discern her signatures from his own. All of the Union and Confederate generals from the American Civil War have had their signatures forged. Many were faked during the 1880s, a period that included the fad of aging soldiers in collecting Civil War autographs. Most deceptions were of mere signatures on a small piece of paper, but extensively written letters were forged as well. Collectors should be cautious of clipped signatures. The bogus autograph is glued onto an authentic steel-engraved portrait of the subject. Some steel engravings may have reprinted the autograph of the portrayed subject; this is known as a facsimile autograph, and it may appear to be real. =Secretarial signatures= Celebrities sometimes authorized secretaries to sign their correspondence. In the early months of World War II, U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall felt obligated to sign every condolence letter sent to the families of slain soldiers. But as the death rate increased, he was forced to assign an assistant to forge his signature to the letters. The surrogate signatures were hard to distinguish from the originals. General Douglas MacArthur rarely signed a WWII condolence letter personally and all of his letters to families were signed by one of two assistants who tried hard to duplicate his signature but the forged signatures were distinguished by an unusually high letter \\"l\\" and a skinny \\"D\\". During the early stage of the Korean War, MacArthur personally signed condolence letters. As the fatalities increased, the General began to use letters with pre-printed signatures. In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, General Dwight D. Eisenhower often had secretaries forge his name to campaign letters and \\"personally inscribed\\" autographed photographs. Player signatures on baseballs and footballs that are actually signed by coaches and ballboys are called clubhouse signatures. =Autopen autographing= Portrait of U.S. President Richard Nixon with autopen signature Since the early 1950s almost all American presidents have had an autopen or robot machine for the automatic signing of a signature as an autograph machine for their letters, photographs, books, official documents, and even memorabilia items such as baseballs and golf balls. Some former presidents even have continued to utilize the autopen after they have left office. The Signa-Signer can even write out in ink an authentically looking handwritten message that has been typed into the machine. One book detailing the use of this machine by President John F. Kennedy (1961‚Äì1963) is The Robot That Helped to Make a President by Charles Hamilton. Since the 1960s, the practice of using an autopen has spread to U.S. Cabinet members, U.S. Senators, some state governors, and many other personalities who have a high volume of correspondence with the public. Astronaut Alan Shepard acknowledged that NASA used the autopen machine to sign the astronauts' voluminous correspondence. Many large corporations also use these machines for signing business letters. Although autopen signatures should constantly match one another, they will eventually change as the signature drum becomes worn, and thereby alters the signature. Due to these professional imitations, buyers are often wary of buying presidential or astronaut signatures from unknown sellers. =Deceptive devices= Some personalities have used a rubber or steel hand-stamp to \\"sign\\" their documents. American President Andrew Johnson (c.1866) did so during his tenure as a senator prior to assuming the presidency, since his right hand was injured in a train accident. This is why his autograph as president differs from previous autographs. President Warren Harding frequently used a rubber stamp while he was a senator. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt used them, along with President Woodrow Wilson (c.1916). England's King Henry VIII and Pennsylvania colony founder William Penn used a deceiving hand stamp. Joseph Stalin had several rubber signature stamps which were used on awards and Communist party cards. Nikita Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria, the KGB Chief, used similar stamps. Quality forgeries have been made for many of Europe's past rulers. The French nobles had their secr√©taires sign their documents. Many forgeries of Napoleon's (c.1800) war orders exist; he was so busy with battle concerns that he barely had enough time to sign promotion orders for generals, so his scribes applied his name to lesser documents. Many famous scientists, astronauts, Arctic explorers, musicians, poets, and literary authors have had forgeries of their epistles and signatures produced. False signatures of Charles Lindbergh were clandestinely signed onto real 1930-era airmail envelopes bought at stamp shops and then re-sold to unwary buyers; the same has occurred with Amelia Earhart and the Wright brothers. \\"Mickey Mouse\\" creator Walt Disney had several of his cartoonists duplicate his artistic signature on replies to children seeking his autograph. (Disney's actual autograph was distinctly different from the way it appears in his cartoons.) Texan paper currency was signed in ink by Sam Houston, though not handwritten by Houston himself. The October 1986 Smithsonian magazine explored The Persistence of Memory, an artwork by the Spanish painter Salvador Dal√≠. It quoted one of his secretaries as claiming that she signed the artist's signature to postcard depictions of his paintings. Another article in the April 2005 Smithsonian noted: \\"In 1965 he began selling signed sheets of otherwise blank lithograph paper for $10 a sheet. He may have signed well over 50,000 in the remaining quarter century of his life, an action that resulted in a flood of Dal√≠ lithograph forgeries.\\" Some deceivers cut pages from books that American President Richard Nixon signed on the blank flyleaf, typed his letter of resignation from the presidency on that signed page, and then sold the doctored item as if Nixon had personally signed a scarce copy of the historical document. This practice has expanded to include quotations from George W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Hillary Clinton, John F. Kennedy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. =Authentication= With the recent enormous growth of autograph sellers on eBay, and the appearance of a multitude of new galleries and retailers offering expensive autographs, casual autograph collectors and one-time buyers have in many instances sought certificates of authenticity issued by the seller at the time of sale.

Vaudeville entertainer Sophie Tucker's autograph in a copy of her 1945 autobiography In many instances, sellers will use a professional authenticator to determine the authenticity of the material they wish to bring to market. The autograph industry is currently contentiously split between two types of authenticators: those who rely upon their professional expertise and experience personally having collected or sold large inventories of autographs over a period of many years, such as the consultants at AutographCOA.com (ACOA), and \\"forensic examiners\\" who rely on academic credentials. Disputes have led to court actions, most notably gallery owner American Royal Arts vs. Beatles autograph dealer Frank Caiazzo, often used by autograph sources such as RR Auction. Potential autograph buyers uncertain of the legitimacy of the seller or authenticator may research both parties, and may check any dealer who claims membership of any association. PADA, the UACC, RACC, and AFTAL include a list of dealers on their websites. This research should not be limited to a seller's or an authenticator's website which could be prejudiced. Some dealers have been known to invent their own association, e.g. \\"The Universal Manuscript Society\\", to enhance their reputations. Mastro Auctions, a major sports autograph auction house which used a professional authenticator, was sued by a dealer in 2006 (Bill Daniels v. Mastro Auctions, Boone County, Indiana, case #06D01-0502 -PL- 0060). Daniels said that he had bought more than 2,000 signed photographs of athletes from Mastro and claimed that the catalog incorrectly described them as all being in color and 8\\" x 10\\" in size. Daniels also claimed that some of the autographs on the photographs may have been fakes. He produced two dealers who he said were autograph experts, but Superior Court Judge Matthew C. Kincaid excluded their testimony saying that neither Steve Koschal nor Richard Simon \\"possess sufficient skill, knowledge or experience in the fields in which they were asked to render opinions.\\" The law for each state is different regarding qualifications to testify. Simon and Koschal have both testified in states where their testimony is accepted in court. =Other authenticity issues= Forgers buy real American Revolutionary War-era documents and surreptitiously pen a famous patriot's name between other real signatures in a manuscript in hope of deceiving an unsuspecting buyer. Others will use tea or tobacco stains to brown or age their modern missives. Many autographed items of famous American sports players being sold over the Internet are fakes. Baseball legend Babe Ruth, for instance, has had his signature forged on old baseballs, then rubbed in dirt to make them appear to be from the 1930s.

Clubs The Autograph Club was first seen in the 1940s, with the hobby growing different clubs began emerging onto the scene. As the autograph clubs advanced, they began developing many new strategies to help the collector. Historically, clubs occurred in many different countries. Once people started buying, selling, and trading, there was need for people with a common interest to be able to associate with one another despite having no ties other than a common hobby. Autograph clubs were created for interest and enjoyment, along with financial rewards. Involvement in autograph clubs can lead to building advanced skills, knowledge, and experience. Education is the aim of most autograph clubs. Autograph collecting during the Coronavirus outbreak The 2019 Coronavirus outbreak has seen normal interactions between people change in many human interacting areas, including autograph collecting. Several Major League Baseball teams, for example, employed a new strategy in which their players would sign team assigned items before their games and then have a team employee handle them to fans present near the stadium,https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2020/03/07/houston-astros-change- how-they-sign-autographs-out-of-caution-for- coronavirus/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/07/nationals- install-new-autograph-policy-response-coronavirus/ to prevent the virus from spreading further on the communities they play at.

Symptoms may include extreme sadness, low energy, anxiety, crying episodes, irritability, and changes in sleeping or eating patterns. Onset is typically between one week and one month following childbirth. PPD can also negatively affect the newborn child. While the exact cause of PPD is unclear, the cause is believed to be a combination of physical, emotional, genetic, and social factors. These may include factors such as hormonal changes and sleep deprivation. Risk factors include prior episodes of postpartum depression, bipolar disorder, a family history of depression, psychological stress, complications of childbirth, lack of support, or a drug use disorder. Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms. While most women experience a brief period of worry or unhappiness after delivery, postpartum depression should be suspected when symptoms are severe and last over two weeks. Among those at risk, providing psychosocial support may be protective in preventing PPD. This may include community support such as food, household chores, mother care, and companionship. Treatment for PPD may include counseling or medications. Types of counseling that have been found to be effective include interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic therapy. Tentative evidence supports the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Postpartum depression affects roughly 15% of women after childbirth. Moreover, this mood disorder is estimated to affect 1% to 26% of new fathers. Postpartum psychosis, a more severe form of postpartum mood disorder, occurs in about 1 to 2 per 1,000 women following childbirth. Postpartum psychosis is one of the leading causes of the murder of children less than one year of age, which occurs in about 8 per 100,000 births in the United States.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of PPD can occur any time in the first year postpartum.The Boston Women's Health Book Collective: Our Bodies Ourselves, pages 489‚Äì491, New York: Touchstone Book, 2005 Typically, a diagnosis of postpartum depression is considered after signs and symptoms persist for at least two weeks. = Emotional = * Persistent sadness, anxiousness or \\"empty\\" mood * Severe mood swingsWebMD: Understanding Post Partum Depression * Frustration, irritability, restlessness, anger * Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness * Guilt, shame, worthlessness * Low self- esteem * Numbness, emptiness * Exhaustion * Inability to be comforted * Trouble bonding with the baby * Feeling inadequate in taking care of the baby * Thoughts of self-harm or suicide = Behavioural = * Lack of interest or pleasure in usual activities * Low libido * Changes in appetite * Fatigue, decreased energy and motivation * Poor self-care * Social withdrawal * Insomnia or excessive sleep = Cognition = * Diminished ability to make decisions and think clearly * Lack of concentration and poor memory * Fear that you can not care for the baby or fear of the baby * Worry about harming self, baby, or partner = Onset and duration= Postpartum depression onset usually begins between two weeks to a month after delivery.Postpartum Depression from Pregnancy Guide, by Peter J. Chen, at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Reviewed last on: 10/22/2008 A study done at an inner-city mental health clinic has shown that 50% of postpartum depressive episodes there began prior to delivery. Therefore, in the DSM-5 postpartum depression is diagnosed under \\"depressive disorder with peripartum onset\\", in which \\"peripartum onset\\" is defined as anytime either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. PPD may last several months or even a year.Canadian Mental Health Association > Post Partum Depression Retrieved on June 13, 2010 Postpartum depression can also occur in women who have suffered a miscarriage. For fathers, several studies show that men experience the highest levels of postpartum depression between 3‚Äì6 months postpartum. =Parent-infant relationship= Postpartum depression can interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect acute and longterm child development. Postpartum depression may lead mothers to be inconsistent with childcare. These childcare inconsistencies may include feeding routines, sleep routines, and health maintenance. In rare cases, or about 1 to 2 per 1,000, the postpartum depression appears as postpartum psychosis. In these, or among women with a history of previous psychiatric hospital admissions, infanticide may occur. In the United States, postpartum depression is one of the leading causes of annual reported infanticide incidence rate of about 8 per 100,000 births. Causes The cause of PPD is unknown. Hormonal and physical changes, personal and family history of depression, and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression. Evidence suggests that hormonal changes may play a role. Hormones which have been studied include estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, testosterone, corticotropin releasing hormone, endorphins, and cortisol. Estrogen and progesterone levels drop back to pre-pregnancy levels within 24 hours of giving birth, and that sudden change may cause it. The use of synthetic oxytocin, a birth-inducing drug, has been linked to increased rates of postpartum depression and anxiety. Fathers, who are not undergoing profound hormonal changes, can also have postpartum depression. The cause may be distinct in males. Profound lifestyle changes that are brought about by caring for the infant are also frequently hypothesized to cause PPD. However, little evidence supports this hypothesis. Mothers who have had several previous children without suffering PPD can nonetheless suffer it with their latest child. Despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period, most women are not diagnosed with PPD. Many mothers are unable to get the rest they need to fully recover from giving birth. Sleep deprivation can lead to physical discomfort and exhaustion, which can contribute to the symptoms of postpartum depression. = Risk factors = While the causes of PPD are not understood, a number of factors have been suggested to increase the risk: * Prenatal depression or anxiety * A personal or family history of depression * Moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms *Stressful life events experienced during pregnancy *Postpartum blues * Birth- related psychological trauma * Birth-related physical trauma *History of sexual abuse *Childhood trauma * Previous stillbirth or miscarriage * Formula- feeding rather than breast-feeding * Cigarette smoking * Low self-esteem * Childcare or life stress * Low social support * Poor marital relationship or single marital status * Low socioeconomic status *A lack of strong emotional support from spouse, partner, family, or friends * Infant temperament problems/colic * Unplanned/unwanted pregnancy * Low vitamin D levels *Breastfeeding difficulties *Administration of labor-inducing medication synthetic oxytocin Of these risk factors a history of depression, and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects. Some studies have found a link with low levels of DHA in the mother. These above factors are known to correlate with PPD. This correlation does not mean these factors are causal. Rather, they might both be caused by some third factor. Contrastingly, some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression, such as lack of social support.The causal role of lack of social support in PPD is strongly suggested by several studies, including O'Hara 1985, Field et al. 1985; and Gotlib et al. 1991. The relationship between breastfeeding and PPD is not clear. Women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources, such as financial. Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases. Women with fewer resources may be more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing risk of PPD. Women with fewer resources may also include single mothers of low income. Single mothers of low income may have more limited access to resources while transitioning into motherhood. Studies have also shown a correlation between a mother's race and postpartum depression. African American mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of PPD at 25%, while Asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5%, after controlling for social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby's health. The PPD rates for First Nations, Caucasian and Hispanic women fell in between. Migration away from a cultural community of support can be a factor in PPD. Traditional cultures around the world prioritize organized support during postpartum care to ensure the mother's mental and physical health, wellbeing, and recovery. One of the strongest predictors of paternal PPD is having a partner who has PPD, with fathers developing PPD 50% of the time when their female partner has PPD. Sexual orientation has also been studied as a risk factor for PPD. In a 2007 study conducted by Ross and colleagues, lesbian and bisexual mothers were tested for PPD and then compared with a heterosexual sample group. It was found that lesbian and bisexual biological mothers had significantly higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores than did the heterosexual women in the sample. These higher rates of PPD in lesbian/bisexual mothers may reflect less social support, particularly from their families of origin and additional stress due to homophobic discrimination in society. A correlation between postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression has been proposed but remains controversial. There may also be a link between postpartum depression and anti-thyroid antibodies. =Violence= A meta-analysis reviewing research on the association of violence and postpartum depression showed that violence against women increases the incidence of postpartum depression. About one-third of women throughout the world will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives. Violence against women occurs in conflict, post-conflict, and non-conflict areas. It is important to note that the research reviewed only looked at violence experienced by women from male perpetrators, but did not consider violence inflicted on men or women by women. Further, violence against women was defined as \\"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women\\". Psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression, stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy, anxiety or depression during pregnancy, and low social support. Violence against women is a chronic stressor, so depression may occur when someone is no longer able to respond to the violence. Diagnosis =Criteria= Postpartum depression in the DSM-5 is known as \\"depressive disorder with peripartum onset\\". Peripartum onset is defined as starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. There is no longer a distinction made between depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or those that occur after delivery. Nevertheless, the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery. The criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non- childbirth related major depression or minor depression. The criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms, within a two-week period: * Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, nearly every day, for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by others * Loss of interest or pleasure in activities * Weight loss or decreased appetite * Changes in sleep patterns * Feelings of restlessness * Loss of energy * Feelings of worthlessness or guilt * Loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness * Recurrent thoughts of death, with or without plans of suicide =Differential diagnosis= Postpartum blues Postpartum blues, commonly known as \\"baby blues,\\" is a transient postpartum mood disorder characterized by milder depressive symptoms than postpartum depression. This type of depression can occur in up to 80% of all mothers following delivery. Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks. Symptoms lasting longer than two weeks are a sign of a more serious type of depression. Women who experience \\"baby blues\\" may have a higher risk of experiencing a more serious episode of depression later on. Psychosis Postpartum psychosis is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a psychiatric emergency that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies, in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts (mania), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery; the symptoms vary and can change quickly. It is different from postpartum depression and from maternity blues. It may be a form of bipolar disorder. It is important not to confuse psychosis with other symptoms that may occur after delivery, such as delirium. Delirium typically includes a loss of awareness or inability to pay attention. About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors; but a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history put some at a higher risk. Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization, where treatment is antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers, and in cases of strong risk for suicide, electroconvulsive therapy. The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year. Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery. Screening In the US, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests healthcare providers consider depression screening for perinatal women. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pediatricians screen mothers for PPD at 1-month, 2-month and 4-month visits. However, many providers do not consistently provide screening and appropriate follow-up. For example, in Canada, Alberta is the only province with universal PPD screening. This screening is carried out by Public Health nurses with the baby's immunization schedule. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, a standardized self- reported questionnaire, may be used to identify women who have postpartum depression. If the new mother scores 13 or more, she likely has PPD and further assessment should follow. Healthcare providers may take a blood sample to test if another disorder is contributing to depression during the screening. Prevention A 2013 Cochrane review found evidence that psychosocial or psychological intervention after childbirth helped reduce the risk of postnatal depression. These interventions included home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Support is an important aspect of prevention, as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by \\"lack of support\\" and \\"feeling isolated.\\" Across different cultures, traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for PPD, but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother. In couples, emotional closeness and global support by the partner protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety. Further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone. In those who are at risk counselling is recommended. In 2018, 24% of areas in the UK have no access to perinatal mental health specialist services. Preventative treatment with antidepressants may be considered for those who have had PPD previously. However, as of 2017, the evidence supporting such use is weak. Treatments Treatment for mild to moderate PPD includes psychological interventions or antidepressants. Women with moderate to severe PPD would likely experience a greater benefit with a combination of psychological and medical interventions. Light aerobic exercise has been found to be useful for mild and moderate cases. =Therapy= Both individual social and psychological interventions appear equally effective in the treatment of PPD. Social interventions include individual counseling and peer support, while psychological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). Other forms of therapy, such as group therapy, home visits, counseling, and ensuring greater sleep for the mother may also have a benefit. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has shown promising results with lower negative parenting behavior scores and lower rates of anxiety, stress, and depression. iCBT may be beneficial for mothers who have limitations in accessing in person CBT. However, the long term benefits have not been determined. =Medication= A 2010 review found few studies of medications for treating PPD noting small sample sizes and generally weak evidence. Some evidence suggests that mothers with PPD will respond similarly to people with major depressive disorder. There is evidence which suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective treatment for PPD. The first-line anti-depressant medication of choice is sertraline, an SSRI, as very little of the it passes into the breast milk and, as a result, to the child. However, a recent study has found that adding sertraline to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit. Therefore, it is not completely clear which antidepressants, if any, are most effective for treatment of PPD, and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy. Some studies show that hormone therapy may be effective in women with PPD, supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contribute to depressive symptoms. However, there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of blood clots, which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery. Additionally, none of the existing studies included women who were breastfeeding. However, there is some evidence that the use of estradiol patches might help with PPD symptoms. In 2019, the FDA approved brexanolone, a synthetic analog of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, for use intravenously in postpartum depression. Allopregnanolone levels drop after giving birth, which may lead to women becoming depressed and anxious. Some trials have demonstrated an effect on PPD within 48 hours from the start of infusion. Other new allopregnanolone analogs under evaluation for use in the treatment of PPD include SAGE-2017 and ganaxolone. Brexanolone has risks that can occur during administration, including excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, and therefore has been approved under the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. The mother is to enrolled prior to receiving the medication. It is only available to those at certified health care facilities with a health care provider who can continually monitor the patient. The infusion itself is a 60-hour, or 2.5 day, process. People's oxygen levels are to be monitored with a pulse oximeter. Side effects of the medication include dry mouth, sleepiness, somnolence, flushing and loss of consciousness. It is also important to monitor for early signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. = Breastfeeding = Antidepressant medications are generally considered safe to use during breastfeeding. Most antidepressants are excreted in breast milk. However, there are limited studies showing the effects and safety of these antidepressants on breastfed babies. Regarding allopregnanolone, very limited data did not indicate a risk for the infant. =Other= Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has shown efficacy in women with severe PPD that have either failed multiple trials of medication-based treatment or cannot tolerate the available antidepressants. Tentative evidence supports the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). As of 2013 it is unclear if acupuncture, massage, bright lights, or taking omega-3 fatty acids are useful. Epidemiology Postpartum depression is found across the globe, with rates varying from 11% to 42%. Around 3% to 6% of women will experience depression during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. About 1 in 750 mothers will have postpartum depression with psychosis and their risk is higher if they have had postpartum episodes in the past.  History  = Prior to the 19th century = Western medical science's understanding and construction of postpartum depression has evolved over the centuries. Ideas surrounding women‚Äôs moods and states have been around for a long time, typically recorded by men. In 460 B.C., Hippocrates wrote about puerperal fever, agitation, delirium, and mania experienced by women after child birth. Hippocrates' ideas still linger in how postpartum depression is seen today. A woman who lived in the 14th century, Margery Kempe, was a Christian mystic. She was a pilgrim known as \\"Madwoman\\" after having a tough labor and delivery. There was a long physical recovery period during which she started descending into \\"madness\\" and became suicidal. Based on her descriptions of visions of demons and conversations she wrote about that she had with religious figures like God and the Virgin Mary, historians have identified what Margery Kempe was suffering from as \\"postnatal psychosis\\" and not postpartum depression. This distinction became important to emphasize the difference between postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. A 16th century physician, Castello Branco, documented a case of postpartum depression without the formal title as a relatively healthy woman who suffered from melancholy after childbirth, remained insane for a month, and recovered with treatment. Although this treatment was not described, experimental treatments began to be implemented for postpartum depression for the centuries that followed. Connections between female reproductive function and mental illness would continue to center around reproductive organs from this time all the way through to modern age, with a slowly evolving discussion around \\"female madness\\". = 19th century and after = With the 19th century came a new attitude about the relationship between female mental illness and pregnancy, childbirth, or menstruation. The famous short story, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\", was published by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in this period. In the story, an unnamed woman journals her life when she is treated by her physician husband, John, for hysterical and depressive tendencies after the birth of their baby. Gilman wrote the story to protest societal oppression of women as the result of her own experience as a patient. Her tale is likely to have resonated with many women because female hysteria was a common medical diagnosis at the time, having arisen many centuries earlier as the first mental disorder attributed to specifically women. Hysterical neurosis was not removed from the DSM until 1980, whereas postpartum depression continues to be excluded as a unique \\"distinct disorder\\" and was only added into the fourth edition as a \\"course modified\\" in 1994. Thus, in the 19th century, the idea of female hysteria was often conflated and confused with symptoms of postpartum depression, all in connection with the prevailing mindset that women were weak and vulnerable to mental illness. Also during the 19th century, gynecologists embraced the idea that female reproductive organs, and the natural processes they were involved in, were at fault for \\"female insanity.\\" Approximately 10% of asylum admissions during this time period are connected to ‚Äúpuerperal insanity,‚Äù the named intersection between pregnancy or childbirth and female mental illness. It wasn't until the onset of the twentieth century that the attitude of the scientific community shifted once again: the consensus amongst gynecologists and other medical experts was to turn away from the idea of diseased reproductive organs and instead towards more \\"scientific theories\\" that encompassed a broadening medical perspective on mental illness. Society and culture Malay culture holds a belief in Hantu Meroyan; a spirit that resides in the placenta and amniotic fluid. When this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment, it causes the mother to experience frequent crying, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, known collectively as \\"sakit meroyan\\". The mother can be cured with the help of a shaman, who performs a s√©ance to force the spirits to leave. Some cultures believe that the symptoms of postpartum depression or similar illnesses can be avoided through protective rituals in the period after birth. These may include offering structures of organized support, hygiene care, diet, rest, infant care, and breastfeeding instruction. The rituals appear to be most effective when the support is welcomed by the mother. Globalization and migration can disconnect women from their traditional communities of maternal support, which can be positive or negative depending on the traditions and on the mother's wishes. Some Chinese women participate in a ritual that is known as \\"doing the month\\" (confinement) in which they spend the first 30 days after giving birth resting in bed, while the mother or mother-in-law takes care of domestic duties and childcare. In addition, the new mother is not allowed to bathe or shower, wash her hair, clean her teeth, leave the house, or be blown by the wind. In the US, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included a section focusing on research into postpartum conditions including postpartum depression. Some argue that more resources in the form of policies, programs, and health objectives need to be directed to the care of those with PPD. The stigma of mental health - with or without support from family members and health professionals - often deters women from seeking help for their PPD. When medical help is achieved, some women find the diagnosis helpful and encourage a higher profile for PPD amongst the health professional community. = Media = Certain cases of postpartum mental health concerns received attention in the media and brought about dialogue on ways to address and understand more on postpartum mental health. Andrea Yates, a former nurse, became pregnant for the first time in 1976. After giving birth to five children in the coming years, she suffered severe depression and had many depressive episodes. This led to her believing that her children needed to be saved, and that by killing them, she could rescue their eternal souls. She drowned her children one by one over the course of an hour, by holding their heads under water in their family bathtub. When called into trial, she felt that she had saved her children rather than harming them and that this action would contribute to defeating Satan. This was one of the first public and notable cases of postpartum psychosis, which helped create dialogue on women's mental health after childbirth. The court found that Yates‚Äô was experiencing mental illness concerns, and the trial started the conversation of mental illness in cases of murder and whether or not it would lessen the sentence or not. It also started a dialogue on women going against ‚Äúmaternal instinct‚Äù after childbirth and what maternal instinct was truly defined by. Yates' case brought wide media attention to the problem of filicide, or the murder of children by their parents. Throughout history, both men and women have perpetrated this act, but study of maternal filicide is more extensive  See also  * Antenatal depression * Psychiatric disorders of childbirth * Sex after pregnancy *Breastfeeding and mental health  References   External links   Postnatal Depression, information from the mental health charity The Royal College of Psychiatrists * NHS Choices Health A-Z: Postnatal depression * Postpartum Depression and the Baby Blues - HelpGuide.org Depression (mood) Pathology of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium Motherhood Psychiatric diagnosis Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Postpartum depression"},{"id":"175358","text":"Mont-de-l'Enclus (Kluisberg in Dutch) is a Walloon municipality of Belgium located in the province of Hainaut.

In the province of Hainaut, Tournai is part of Eurometropolis Lille‚ÄìKortrijk‚ÄìTournai, which had 2,155,161 residents in 2008.List of municipalities Tournai is one of the oldest cities in Belgium and has played an important role in the country's cultural history. It was the first capital of the Frankish Empire, with Clovis I being born here. Geography Tournai is located in the Wallonia Picarde (Picard language) and Romance Flanders region of Belgium, at the southern limit of the Flemish plain, in the basin of the River Scheldt (Escaut in French, Schelde in Dutch). Administratively, the town is part of the Province of Hainaut, itself part of Wallonia. It is also a municipality that is part of the French-speaking Community of Belgium. Tournai has its own arrondissements, both administrative and judicial. Its area of makes it the largest municipality in size in Belgium; it is also the largest in population in Western Hainaut. The municipality of Tournai consists of the former municipalities of Ere, Saint-Maur, Orcq, Esplechin, Froyennes, Froidmont, Willemeau, Ramegnies-Chin, Templeuve, Chercq, Blandain, Hertain, Lamain, Marquain, Gaurain-Ramecroix, Havinnes, Beclers, Thimougies, Barry, Maulde, Vaulx, Vezon, Kain, Melles, Quartes, Rumillies, Mont-Saint-Aubert, Mourcourt and Warchin. = Geology = Rocks from the Tournai area date from the Carboniferous Period and have been used to define the Tournaisian Age, a subdivision of the Carboniferous lasting from 359 to 345 million years ago. Tournai stone is a dark limestone which takes a polish and was used particularly in the Romanesque period for sculpted items such as Tournai fonts. It is also hard enough to have been used locally for pavements and kerb-stones. It is sometimes called Tournai marble, though this is geologically inaccurate.  History  Tournai, known as Tornacum, was a place of minor importance in Roman times, a stopping place where the Roman road from Cologne on the Rhine to Boulogne on the coast crossed the river Scheldt. It was fortified under Maximian in the 3rd century AD,Williams, Stephen. Diocletian and the Roman Recovery. New York: Routledge, 1997:50f. when the Roman limes was withdrawn to the string of outposts along the road. It came into the possession of the Salian Franks in 432. Under king Childeric I, whose tomb was discovered there in 1653, Tournai was the capital of the Frankish empire. In 486, Clovis moved the center of power to Paris. In turn, a native son of Tournai, Eleutherius, became bishop of the newly created bishopric of Tournai, extending over most of the area west of the Scheldt. In 862 Charles the Bald, first king of Western Francia and still to become Holy Roman Emperor, would make Tournai the seat of the County of Flanders. Siege of Tournai, 1581 After the partition of the Frankish empire by the Treaties of Verdun (843) and of Meerssen (870), Tournai remained in the western part of the empire, which in 987 became France. The city participated in 11th-century rise of towns in the Low Countries, with a woollen cloth industry based on English wool, which soon made it attractive to wealthy merchants. An ambitious rebuilding of the cathedral was initiated in 1030. The commune's drive for independence from the local counts succeeded in 1187, and the city was henceforth directly subordinated to the French Crown, as the seigneurie de Tournaisis, as the city's environs are called. The stone over the Scheldt, with defensive towers at either end, was built in 1290, replacing an earlier wooden structure. During the 15th century, the city's textile trade boomed and it became an important supplier of tapestry. The art of painting flourished too: Jacques Daret, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden all came from Tournai. It was captured in 1513 by Henry VIII of England, making it the only Belgian city ever to have been ruled by England. It was also represented in the 1515 Parliament of England.Davies, C. S. L. \\"Tournai and the English crown, 1513-1519.\\" Historical Journal (1998): 1-26. The city was handed back to French rule in 1519, following the Treaty of London (1518). Siege of Tournai, 1709 In 1521, Emperor Charles V added the city to his possessions in the Low Countries, leading to a period of religious strife and economic decline. During the 16th century, Tournai was a bulwark of Calvinism, but eventually it was conquered by the Spanish governor of the Low Countries, the Duke of Parma, following a prolonged siege in 1581. After the fall of the city, its Protestant inhabitants were given one year to sell their possessions and emigrate, a policy that was at the time considered relatively humane, since very often religious opponents were simply massacred. One century later, in 1668, the city briefly returned to France under Louis XIV in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. After the end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1713, under terms of the Treaty of Utrecht the former Spanish Netherlands, including Tournai, came into possession of the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1794, France annexed the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars and Tournai became part of the department of Jemmape. From 1815 on, following the Napoleonic Wars, Tournai formed part of the United Netherlands and after 1830 of newly independent Belgium. Badly damaged in 1940, Tournai has since been carefully restored.  Main sights  \\"Pont des Trous\\" bridge on the Scheldt river with Our Lady's Cathedral of Tournai in the distance Tournai is considered to be one of the most important cultural sites in Belgium. The mixed Romanesque- and Gothic-style cathedral of Notre Dame de Tournai and the belfry, considered the oldest in Belgium, have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Inside the cathedral, the Ch√¢sse de Notre-Dame flamande, a beautifully ornate 12th-century reliquary, gives witness to Tournai's wealth in the Middle Ages. Other places of interest are the 13th-century Scheldt bridge (Pont des Trous) and the main square (Grand Place), as well as several old city gates, historic warehouses, and a variety of museums. On rue Barre- St-Brice are two of the oldest private houses in Europe, dating from between 1175 and 1200 and built in the Romanesque style, while the rue des J√©suites includes a Gothic house from the 13th century. As in many Belgian cities there are a number of caf√©s and pubs in the Grand Place. In the middle of the Grand Place there are a series of water fountains while the circular staircase to the top of the belfry can be climbed. There are several buildings in the art nouveau style. Culture = A French-speaking Walloon town = Grand Place Tournai is a French-speaking town of Belgium. The local language is tournaisien, a Picard dialect similar to that of other communes of Hainaut and Northern France. Tournai belongs to Romance Flanders, like Lille, Douai, Tourcoing, and Mouscron. The city of Tournai was one of the greatest cultural and economic centers of the County of Flanders. Some traces can still be seen today: * The gothic choir of Our Lady's Cathedral is a precursory element of the Scaldian (meaning from the Scheldt area), typically Flemish, Gothic art. * The bishopric of Tournai was the religious capital of Flanders during more than a millennium (from 496 to 1559). * The tapestries and draperies of Tournai belong to the great Flemish school of tapestry and Tournai was part of the Flemish Hansa of London, which also included the draper towns of Flanders. * The Saint-Brice church of Tournai, dedicated to Saint Britius, is one of the first examples of the hallekerk style, so typical of the Flemish countryside. * Some of the great Flemish Primitives are from Tournai: Robert Campin, Rogier van der Weyden, Jacques Daret. Although Tournai is in the Flemish cultural area (of the Scheldt), it also possesses some treasures of the Mosan style. Indeed, the two most beautiful shrines of the Cathedral, commissioned by the Bishop of Tournai, were made in the region of Li√®ge by the artist Nicholas of Verdun: the shrines of Saint-Eleutherius and of Our Lady of Flanders (13th century). Those shrines testify to the opulence of the towns of Tournai and Li√®ge during the Middle-Ages. The shrine of Our Lady of Flanders has been called one of the seven wonders of Belgium. =Festivities= *The \\"Great Procession\\" (in French: Grande Procession) is a procession initiated by the bishop Radbot II during a plague epidemic. It has taken place every year since 1092, with the single exception of the year 1566, when the iconoclasts considerably damaged the religious symbols of the city. This historic procession unfolds in the streets every second Sunday of September. *The first Monday after January 6 is known as \\"Lost Monday\\" (in French: Lundi perdu) or \\"Perjury Monday\\" (Lundi parjur√©). This tradition dates from more than 700 years ago. The wealthier city inhabitants used to prepare fastidious family dinners and elect a king. Today, the family dinners have expanded to wider groups and a rabbit dish is often served.

Charles issued the Declaration on 15 March 1672. It was highly controversial and Sir Orlando Bridgeman, son of a bishop, resigned as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, because he refused to apply the Great Seal to it, regarding it as too generous to Catholics. In 1673 the Cavalier Parliament compelled Charles to withdraw the declaration and implement, in its place, the first of the Test Acts (1673), which required anyone entering public service in England to deny the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and to take Anglican communion. When Charles II's openly Catholic successor James II attempted to issue a similar Declaration of Indulgence, an order for general religious tolerance, it became one of the grievances that led to the Glorious Revolution which ousted him from the throne.

Chastre comprises seven former villages: Chastre, Villeroux, Blanmont, Cortil-Noirmont, Gentinnes and Saint-G√©ry. It is crossed by the old Chauss√©e Brunehaut, a Roman way that connected Bavay to Cologne. Located between Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and Gembloux, 40 km from Brussels, Chastre is well served by road and railway networks. A small river called the Orne passes right through Chastre. With its tributaries, the Orne creates enchanting landscapes, surrounding magnificent farmhouses, often still fully in use. Chastre's highest point has an elevation of 165 metres. The municipality is twinned with Lespignan, H√©rault department, France (since 1998) and Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Canada.  History  In the early 10th century, half of Cortil (Curtils) was owned by Saint Guibert (Wichpertus). He donated it to Gembloux Abbey, which he had just founded, in 936. The donation was confirmed in a charter of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 946. Chastre was a municipality of the Dyle department under the French regime. =Postal history= The Chastre-Villeroux post office opened on 10 May 1876, that of Gentinnes on 28 April 1905, that of Blanmont on 27 November 1908.Catalogue Sp√©cialis√© des Oblit√©rations Belges, 1849-1910, Nationale en Internationale Postzegelmanifestaties Antwerpen (NIPA), Antwerp, 1999.

Geography = Location = Along the N4 road, approximately halfway between Ottignies- Louvain-la-Neuve and Gembloux, Chastre is also reachable by train (SNCB line 161 stops at Blanmont and Chastre), and by the TEC buses (depot). Chastre is surrounded by the municipalities of Walhain-Saint-Paul, Gembloux, Mont-Saint- Guibert, Sombreffe and Villers-la-Ville. = Hydrography = Chastre is crossed by two charming small rivers: the Orne and the Houssi√®re. The former rises in Bertinchamps (Gembloux, province of Namur), and waters the villages of Cortil, Noirmont, Chastre and Blanmont before flowing by Mont-Saint-Guibert and eventually emptying into the Dyle, via the Thyle, in Court-Saint-√âtienne. The latter rises in Sombreffe, near Gentinnes, which it runs through, then crosses Villeroux and eventually empties into the Orne at Mont-Saint-Guibert. It cannot be said that these two small rivers have made much of a dent in this part of the Brabant high plateau, which has an elevation of between 145 and 155 metres. = Natural environment = Despite being very green, the natural environment of Chastre is quite poor. The essentially rural vocation has changed with the population‚Äôs growth and diversification. The number of agricultural enterprises is continuously decreasing. Due to its location between Brussels and Namur and to the high road and railroad connections, Chastre‚Äôs countryside has had to face a strong urbanisation for more than 30 years. = Demography = On 1 November 2019, Chastre had 7,684 inhabitants (3,805 men and 3,879 women), giving a population density of 245.73 inhabitants per square km for a surface of 31.27 square km.

Since the Fusion of the Belgian municipalities in 1977, the entity has brought together three villages: Haut- Ittre, Ittre and Virginal-Samme. Ittre was the geographical center of Belgium until World War I. The geographical center was moved to Walhaim due to the allocation of the East Cantons (Eupen-Malm√©dy) to Belgium (Treaty of Versailles). History Traditions mention the existence of the village of Ittre about the year 640, although the name is first documented in 877. But the site was already occupied in the Roman period and even in the Neolithic era. Ittre owes its name to the Latin \\"Ittrae\\" which means \\"City of water\\". Haut-Ittre (literaly High-Ittre) is the name given to the village overlooking Ittre. Virginal would take its name from \\"Versus Altum\\", name given by the Gallo-Romans because of its culminating situation. Its territory, after having belonged to Nivelles Abbey, was divided into several seigniories, Ittre and Fauquez being the most significant, the lords of which were in constant conflict over their jurisdiction, sovereignty and precedence in the territory and in the church of Ittre. These disputes ended only at the beginning of the 18th century. Among the most significant families in the seigniory of Ittre were those of Ittre, Rifflart and Trazegnies d' Ittre, and in Fauquez, the families of Ittre, Enghien, Fauquez and Herzelles. Fauquez and Ittre both furnished titles to marquisates, in 1689 and 1703 respectively. The commune was connected with a number of notable persons, including Ambroise-Joseph de Herzelles, third marquis de Fauquez, whom the Empress Maria-Theresa appointed Superintendent and General Manager of the Finances and Domains of the Netherlands. Religion The foundation of the church of Ittre occurred around 640, and is principally known as the centre of the veneration of Our Lady of Ittre, which began in 1336, when a terrible plague was raging in the Low Countries. The statue of the Virgin, from the monastery at Bois-Seigneur- Isaac, was carried in procession from village to village and on her arrival in Ittre, the plague stopped. The inhabitants refused to return it to Bois- Seigneur-Isaac, and the Virgin remained in Ittre, despite subsequent litigation, in which the ecclesiastical courts always supported the church of Ittre. An annual procession was established in 1384 and has been held every year without interruption since then on August 15. Our Lady of Ittre was especially invoked against hernias or ruptures. Saint Lutgarde has also been venerated in Ittre since the nuns of Aywiers Abbey, forced out by the French Revolution, found refuge in the Ch√¢teau de Fauquez in either 1796 or 1804. They brought with them the relics of Saint Lutgarde, which they gave permanently to the church of Ittre in 1819. Buildings Ittre contains two ch√¢teaux, the Ch√¢teau d'Ittre and the Ch√¢teau de Baud√©mont. The much grander Ch√¢teau de Fauquez was destroyed in 1827 during the construction of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal.www.ittre.be Churches St Remigius'Church (1896-1899: architect Cl√©ment L√©onard), in Ittre.

On January 1, 2007, La Hulpe had a total population of 7,309. The total area is 15.60 km¬≤, including 3 km¬≤ of the Sonian Forest; this gives a population density of 463 inhabitants per km¬≤. La Hulpe still keeps two hamlets, Gaillemarde in the west and Malaise- Bakenbos in the east. The limits of the latter hamlet and of other parts of La Hulpe were modified when the linguistic border (between French and Dutch) was fixed in 1963. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's (SWIFT) headquarters are located in La Hulpe. History The name of La Hulpe comes from the Celtic word helpe, \\"the silver river\\". The brooks that water La Hulpe form a string of ponds that is called today L'Argentine. The site was already settled 10,000 years BC, as proved by an axe made of smooth flintstone found in Gaillemarde. The village was founded by the Duke of Brabant by clearing a hill separating the valleys of Argentine and Mazerine. La Hulpe was granted municipal rights by a charter signed by Henri I on 3 June 1320. It became a mairie, where lower and higher justice was exercised, and kept its status until 1792. The pillory standing near the church was demolished under the French rule; it was partially restored and can be seen in the town hall. From 1795 to 1814, La Hulpe was the seat of a court with jurisdiction over some ten neighbouring municipalities, in an area spreading from Overijse to Waterloo. After the independence of Belgium, La Hulpe lost its administrative and political functions and was incorporated into the canton of Wavre. The church of La Hulpe was mentioned in a document dated 1226. It is shown on the oldest representation of La Hulpe, a Brussels tapestry from the Hunts of Maximilian suite kept in the Louvre Museum, showing a hunting scene emblematic of a month in Charles V's time. The church, except the tower and the central nave, were dramatically transformed, for the last time in 1906. The King Baudouin's Memorial was built behind the church, close to the oak commemorating the centenary of Belgium. For three centuries, the economy of La Hulpe has been driven by paper-making industry, favoured by the closeness to Brussels and the availability of pure water. The first paper mill was set up on the Grand Etang (Big Pond). In 1664, King of Spain Philip II allowed the foundation of the \\"Imperial and Royal Paper Manufacture\\" in La Hulpe. Paper-making industry was suppressed in 1970. Domaine Solvay The castle of La Hulpe, built in French style in 1842, was purchased by Count Ernest Solvay in 1893 and transferred to the Belgian state by his grandson, Ernest- John Solvay, in 1968. It is surrounded by a 227-ha domain with pastures, woods and ponds, known as Domaine Solvay. The castle and the domain are today managed by the Walloon Region and the Domaine Solvay association. The domain was protected for its aesthetic value by Royal Decree on 10 June 1963, then registered on the Walloon main heritage list in 1993, and eventually listed as a Natura 2000 site. In 1988, the movie Le Ma√Ætre de musique (The Music Teacher) by G√©rard Corbiau, starring Jos√© Van Dam, was made in the castle and park of La Hulpe. The farm of the castle, built in 1833, is the seat of the Folon Foundation, inaugurated on 27 October 2000. Jean-Michel Folon (1934‚Äì2005) is mostly known as one of the most popular illustrators and poster designers of the second half of the 20th century. In the 1990s, Folon decided to create a foundation in the Solvay Domain, a place where he used to play when he was a young boy. He transferred to the foundation more than 300 of his works and organized their scenographic presentation in 15 rooms of the former farm. The foundation welcomed 80,000 visitors during its first year of existence.

In 2008, Lasne had a population of 14,043. The total area is 47.22 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 297 inhabitants per km¬≤. Lasne is the richest municipality in Wallonia, measured by the average taxable income of the inhabitants. It also has the lowest local taxes of any municipality in Belgium. It was formed from the fusion of five municipalities: * Couture-Saint-Germain, * Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert, * Maransart, * Ohain * Plancenoit. While the municipality has taken the name of Lasne, the administrative offices are in the village of Ohain. Ohain contains an example of a Brabant-Wallon village green: almost triangular in shape and sloping gently. The green contains many mature trees and is bordered on 2 sides by old houses and shops. The church in Ohain was built around the year 1200 and the strongly built square tower dates from this time. The village of Couture- Saint-Germain contains the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Aywiers which has been the subject of pilgrimages since the late 19th century in honour of Saint Lutgarde who lived there for 30 years in the first half of the 13th century. Much of the Battle of Waterloo was fought in the village of Plancenoit, notably around the church and the fortified farm of La Papelotte. The cemetery wall is said to still contain holes made by musket balls. It was in Plancenoit that Bl√ºcher's troops engaged Napoleon's army, having marched from Wavre. Bl√ºcher and Wellington met after the battle at the farm 'La Belle Alliance' - now a bar. The current historic area commemorating the battle is jointly administered by the municipalities of Lasne, Waterloo and Braine-l'Alleud. Geography View of Lasne The municipality takes its name from the river Lasne which rises in the village of Plancenoit and flows through several of the villages which make up the municipality. The name Lasne comes from the Celtic word meaning flat or calm, presumably referring to the slow moving river. Lasne is in a region of Belgium known as the Pays Romain or Roman Land. The Grand Chemin is a major road traversing the municipality, linking the large towns of Wavre and Nivelles, and formed a part of a network of Roman roads ultimately linking the ports of the Rhine and Seine with sea ports. The distance between small chapels on this path is equal to one or more leagues, or at a precise fraction of a Gaulish league, where a Gaulish league equals . Economy Lasne is a semi-rural municipality retaining several working farms. 66% of the land area is rural, of which 66% is agricultural land, and the remainder, forest and open areas. In the past, there were a silk factory and sand extraction, although there is no longer any industry within the municipality. In 2007, Lasne was still considered as the richest municipality of Belgium, with an average taxable income of 40,949 euros per year according to the latest report of the INS (Institut National de Statistique). Twin towns The municipality is twinned with Azay-le-Rideau (France) and Abbeville, Louisiana (USA).

The Nivelles municipality includes the old communes of Baulers, Bornival, Thines, and Monstreux. The Nivelles district includes all the municipalities in Walloon Brabant. The Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude has been classified as a heritage site of Wallonia. History =The rise of Nivelles= Starting in 4000 BC, the Nivelles region was gradually turned into agricultural land by the Danubian settlers. Most of their ancestral Rubanean civilization was destroyed by the Roman invaders during the first century AD. In turn, most of the Roman constructions, including villas, were destroyed during the Germanic invasions of the 3rd century. In the 7th century, the territory was part of the Austrasian Frankish kingdom, and the Mayor of the Palace, Pippin of Landen, rebuilt a villa there that covered more than 78 km¬≤. After Pippin's death in 640, the bishop of Maastricht, the future Saint Amand, urged Pippin's widow, Itta, to found an abbey in their villa. Itta's daughter, Gertrude, became the monastery's first abbess and was venerated as a saint upon her death. The growing influx of pilgrims necessitated the construction of ever-bigger churches, which culminated in the huge Romanesque structure that still stands today. The dedication of the church took place in 1046 in the presence of Wazo, Prince- Bishop of Li√®ge, and Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. This was the golden age of the Nivelles monastery, which now owned territories as far as Friesland, the Moselle and the Rhine. The collegiate church of Saint Gertrude =13th century to 1830= In the 13th century, the city that grew around the church became part of the Duchy of Brabant. The population was mainly artisans and guild members, who did not hesitate to fight the abbesses and the dukes to obtain their rights. These rights were finally granted by Joanna, Duchess of Brabant in the 14th century. In 1647, an important uprising by the thread manufacturers resulted in many of the city's entrepreneurs leaving for France, leading to the city's economic decline. The wars of the 17th century between France and the Spanish Netherlands made the situation worse as Nivelles went through successive sieges and military occupations. The Austrian and French regimes of the 18th century brought religious and administrative reforms to the city. =1830 to the present day= In 1830, Nivelles was one of the first cities to send patriotic troops to Brussels to fight in the Belgian Revolution. The following years were marked by the growth of heavy industry, including metallurgy and railway construction. The bombing of the city during World War I brought some damage to buildings, but greater devastation occurred during World War II on 14 May 1940, when almost the entire city centre was destroyed, leaving only the walls of the collegiate church standing. The rebuilding of the church was completed in 1984, but remains can be seen of wall fragments on the south side of the collegiate. Main sights Nave of Saint Gertrude Jean de Nivelles *The collegiate church of Gertrude of Nivelles, patron saint of the city, dates from the 11th to the 13th century and is one of the best examples of Romanesque style in Belgium. It has been classified as one of Europe's major heritage sites. Tombs from the Merovingian (7th century) and Carolingian (9th century) periods have been found under the church. The Romanesque crypt is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. *The two-meter-tall statue that strikes the hours in one of the towers () is affectionately known as \\"Jean de Nivelles\\". Jean dates from around 1400. *The Recollets convent and its church date from the 16th century. *Nivelles also has an archaeological museum, which complements the visit at Saint Gertrude. *The \\"Dodaine\\" park provides a welcome green space on the southern side of the town. Folklore *Like Ath, Nivelles boasts a collection of giant puppets, one of which, Goliath, dates from 1365. The Goliath family (husband, wife and son) is usually accompanied by an odd collection of giant animals, including a lion, a camel, a unicorn, and a dragon. *Originating from the 13th century, the well-attended Saint-Gertrude religious procession is held annually. *Nivelles carnival is more recent (19th century) and takes place on the first weekend of Lent. Like the Binche carnival, that of Nivelles includes the famous Gilles. *The city's gastronomic specialty is the tarte al d'jote, a type of quiche including local cheese, onions, greens, eggs and butter. *Nivelles is also known for its 49-bell carillon and its four named canons.

Wavre is in the Dyle valley. Most inhabitants speak French as their mother tongue and are called \\"Wavriens\\" and \\"Wavriennes\\". The municipality includes the sub-municipalities of Limal and Bierges. Wavre is also called \\"the City of the Maca\\", referring to the statue of the small boy trying to climb the wall of the city hall. Tradition holds that touching the Maca's buttocks brings a year of luck. History =Roman and Medieval times= The foundations of a wealthy Roman villa were found very close to Wavre, complete with a portico and many rooms. This part of Gaul, however, was ravaged by the Germanic invasions in the 3rd and 4th century, and it is only in the year 1050 that Wavre was mentioned for the first time, as a dependency of the County of Leuven, part of the Brabant pagus. The chapel built by the counts near the former Gallo-Roman villa was ceded to the Affligem Abbey a few years later. By the 13th century a market already existed in the budding town built at the crossroads of the Brussels-Namur and Nivelles-Leuven roads. In 1222, Duke Henry I of Brabant granted the town its city charter. At around the same time, the Affligem Abbey expanded its Wavre possessions into a priory, which attracted pilgrims from a wide region around the city. =16th- to 18th-century disasters= The relative peace of the city came to an end on March 8, 1489, when Duke Albert of Saxony took it and pillaged it in retaliation for Wavre's sympathy with Brabant‚Äôs revolt against Austria. From then on until the beginning of the 18th century, the city went through one disaster after another. Between the destruction by Duke Charles of Guelders in 1504 and that brought by Louis XIV‚Äôs wars around 1700, Wavre would know several debilitating crises, either at the hand of foreign armies (e.g., the Spanish in 1604) or because of epidemics (1624‚Äì1625, 1668) or major fires (April 28, 1695 and July 17, 1714). The 18th century was relatively prosperous, but a troubled period started again around 1790, with Wavre's participation in the Brabant Revolution against Austrian interests. After the Battle of Fleurus (1794), the city became French. Like many of its neighbours, the city suffered from mandatory conscription, curtailment of religious freedoms, and the dissolution of the old administrative offices. =From Waterloo until now= On June 18 and 19, 1815, the Battle of Wavre was fought here on the same day as the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon had sent Marshal Grouchy to pursue part of the retreating Prussian army under the command of General Johann von Thielmann. Despite hearing the cannon sound from nearby Waterloo, Grouchy decided to obey his orders and engage the one Prussian Corps in Wavre. By the time Grouchy's battle was over, Napoleon had already lost at Waterloo. The century that followed saw the expansion of local industry, including foundries, a paper mill, and a sugar refinery. Wavre was severely affected by both World Wars, with heavy fighting, bombing and several houses put on fire. In the 21st century, Wavre enjoyed renewed prosperity as the capital of the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant created in 1995.

Ferguson was sympathetic to traditional societies, such as the Highlands, for producing courage and loyalty. He criticized commercial society as making men weak, dishonourable and unconcerned for their community. Ferguson has been called \\"the father of modern sociology\\" for his contributions to the early development of the discipline. His best-known work is his Essay on the History of Civil Society. Life Born at Logierait in Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Rev Adam Ferguson, he received his education at Logierait Parish School, Perth Grammar School, and at the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews (MA 1742). In 1745, owing to his knowledge of Gaelic, he gained appointment as deputy chaplain of the 43rd (afterwards the 42nd) regiment (the Black Watch), the licence to preach being granted him by special dispensation, although he had not completed the required six years of theological study. It remains a matter of debate as to whether, at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745), Ferguson fought in the ranks throughout the day, and refused to leave the field, though ordered to do so by his colonel. Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits. After residing in Leipzig for a time, he returned to Edinburgh where in January 1757 he succeeded David Hume as librarian to the Faculty of Advocates (see Advocates' Library), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the Earl of Bute. In 1759 Ferguson became professor of natural philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, and in 1764 transferred to the chair of \\"pneumatics\\" (mental philosophy) \\"and moral philosophy\\". In 1767, he published his Essay on the History of Civil Society, which was well received and translated into several European languages. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the Continent and met Voltaire. His membership of The Poker Club is recorded in its minute book of 1776. In 1776, appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the American Revolution in opposition to Dr Richard Price's Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, in which he sympathised with the views of the British legislature. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the Carlisle Peace Commission which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies. In 1780, he wrote the article \\"History\\" for the second edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204623/Adam-Ferguson The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph. In 1783 appeared his History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic, it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the history of the Roman Republic during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author's military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of Principles of Moral and Political Science. In his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited Italy and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by learned societies. From 1795 he resided successively at Neidpath Castle near Peebles, at Hallyards on Manor Water, and at St Andrews, where he died on 22 February 1816. He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral, against the east wall. His large mural monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble. Ethics In his ethical system Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the human race, he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. Victor Cousin criticised Ferguson's speculations (see his Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huiti√®me si√®cle, pt. II., 1839‚Äì1840): > We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, > with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of > perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than > benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist > above all his predecessors. By this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems. With Thomas Hobbes and Hume he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. Francis Hutcheson's theory of universal benevolence and Adam Smith's idea of mutual sympathy (now empathy) he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws appear as the means rather than the end of human destiny, they remain subordinate to a supreme end, and the supreme end of perfection. In the political part of his system Ferguson follows Montesquieu, and pleads the cause of well-regulated liberty and free government. His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance (see Sir Leslie Stephen, English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 214). Social thought Ferguson's An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson's theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another's shoes, saying \\"fellow- feeling\\" was so much an \\"appurtenance of human nature\\" as to be a \\"characteristic of the species.\\" Like his friends Adam Smith and David Hume as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals. Ferguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by God; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God's providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval chivalry as ideal masculine characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too feminine, such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner virtue and courtesy toward the 'fairer sex.'Kettler, The Social and Political Thought of Adam Ferguson (1965)Herman, A., The Scottish Enlightenment, Harper Perennial Ferguson was a leading advocate of the Idea of Progress. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome's. Ferguson, a devout Presbyterian, resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.Hill (1997) Ferguson was influenced by classical humanism and such writers as Tacitus, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, and Thomas Hobbes. The fellow members of Edinburgh's Select Society, which included David Hume and Adam Smith, were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. Montesquieu used a similar argument. Smith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men 'dastardly'. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism. Ferguson's critique of commercial society went far beyond that of Smith, and influenced Hegel and Marx. The Essay has been seen as an innovative attempt to reclaim the tradition of civic republican citizenship in modern Britain, and an influence on the ideas of republicanism held by the American Founding Fathers.

In recent years, the Hermitage has expanded to the General Staff Building on the Palace Square facing the Winter Palace, and the Menshikov Palace. The Hermitage Museum complex. From left to right: Hermitage Theatre ‚Äì Old Hermitage ‚Äì Small Hermitage ‚Äì Winter Palace (the \\"New Hermitage\\" is situated behind the Old Hermitage). Collections The Western European Art collection includes European paintings, sculpture, and applied art from the 13th to the 20th centuries. It is displayed, in about 120 rooms, on the first and second floor of the four main buildings. Drawings and prints are displayed in temporary exhibitions. =Egyptian antiquities= Egyptian Hall Since 1940, the Egyptian collection, dating back to 1852 and including the former Castiglione Collection, has occupied a large hall on the ground floor in the eastern part of the Winter Palace. It serves as a passage to the exhibition of Classical Antiquities. A modest collection of the culture of Ancient Mesopotamia, including a number of Assyrian reliefs from Babylon, Dur- Sharrukin and Nimrud, is located in the same part of the building. =Classical antiquities= The collection of classical antiquities occupies most of the ground floor of the Old and New Hermitage buildings. The interiors of the ground floor were designed by German architect Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style in the early 1850s, using painted polished stucco and columns of natural marble and granite. One of the largest and most notable interiors of the first floor is the Hall of Twenty Columns, divided into three parts by two rows of grey monolithic columns of Serdobol granite, intended for the display of Graeco-Etruscan vases. Its floor is made of a modern marble mosaic imitating ancient tradition, while the stucco walls and ceiling are covered in painting. The Room of the Great Vase in the western wing features the high Kolyvan Vase, weighing , made of jasper in 1843 and installed before the walls were erected. While the western wing was designed for exhibitions, the rooms on the ground floor in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage, now also hosting exhibitions, were originally intended for libraries. The floor of the Athena Room in the south-eastern corner of the building, one of the original libraries, is decorated with an authentic 4th-century mosaic excavated in an early Christian basilica in Chersonesos in 1854. The collection of classical antiquities features Greek artifacts from the third millennium ‚Äì fifth century BC, ancient Greek pottery, items from the Greek cities of the North Pontic Greek colonies, Hellenistic sculpture and jewellery, including engraved gems and cameos, such as the famous Gonzaga Cameo, Italic art from the 9th to second century BC, Roman marble and bronze sculpture and applied art from the first century BC - fourth century AD, including copies of Classical and Hellenistic Greek sculptures. One of the highlights of the collection is the Tauride Venus, which, according to latest research, is an original Hellenistic Greek sculpture rather than a Roman copy as it was thought before. There are, however, only a few pieces of authentic Classical Greek sculpture and sepulchral monuments. =Prehistoric art= On the ground floor in the western wing of the Winter Palace the collections of prehistoric artifacts and the culture and art of the Caucasus are located, as well as the second treasure gallery. The prehistoric artifacts date from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age and were excavated all over Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire. Among them is a renowned collection of the art and culture of nomadic tribes of the Altai from Pazyryk and Bashadar sites, including the world's oldest surviving knotted-pile carpet and a well-preserved wooden chariot, both from the 4th‚Äì3rd centuries BC. The Caucasian exhibition includes a collection of Urartu artifacts from Armenia and Western Armenia. Many of them were excavated at Teishebaini under the supervision of Boris Piotrovsky, former director of the Hermitage Museum. =Jewelry and decorative art= Four small rooms on the ground floor, enclosed in the middle of the New Hermitage between the room displaying Classical Antiquities, comprise the first treasure gallery, featuring western jewellery from the 4th millennium BC to the early 20th century AD. The second treasure gallery, located on the ground floor in the southwest corner of the Winter Palace, features jewellery from the Pontic steppes, Caucasus and Asia, in particular Scythian and Sarmatian gold. Visitors may only visit the treasure galleries as part of a guided tour. The Pavilion Hall Pavilion Hall, designed by Andrei Stackenschneider in 1858, occupies the first floor of the Northern Pavilion in the Small Hermitage. It features the 18th-century golden Peacock Clock by James Cox and a collection of mosaics. The floor of the hall is adorned with a 19th-century imitation of an ancient Roman mosaic. Two galleries spanning the west side of the Small Hermitage from the Northern to Southern Pavilion house an exhibition of Western European decorative and applied art from the 12th to 15th century and the fine art of the Low Countries from the 15th and 16th centuries. =Italian Renaissance= The rooms on the first floor of the Old Hermitage were designed by Andrei Stakenschneider in revival styles in between 1851 and 1860, although the design survives only in some of them. They feature works of Italian Renaissance artists, including Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, as well as Benois Madonna and Madonna Litta attributed to Leonardo da Vinci or his school. The Small Italian Skylight Room The Italian Renaissance galleries continues in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage with paintings, sculpture, majolica and tapestry from Italy of the 15th‚Äì16th centuries, including Conestabile Madonna and Madonna with Beardless St. Joseph by Raphael. The gallery known as the Raphael Loggias, designed by Giacomo Quarenghi and painted by Cristopher Unterberger and his workshop in the 1780s as a replication of the loggia in the Apostolic Palace in Rome frescoed by Raphael, runs along the eastern facade. =Italian and Spanish fine art= The first floor of New Hermitage contains three large interior spaces in the center of the museum complex with red walls and lit from above by skylights. These are adorned with 19th-century Russian lapidary works and feature Italian and Spanish canvases of the 16th-18th centuries, including Veronese, Giambattista Pittoni, Tintoretto, Vel√°zquez and Murillo. In the enfilade of smaller rooms alongside the skylight rooms the Italian and Spanish fine art of the 15th-17th centuries, including Michelangelo's Crouching Boy and paintings by El Greco. The museum also houses paintings by Luis Trist√°n, Francisco de Zurbar√°n, Alonso Cano, Jos√© de Ribera and Goya. =Knights' Hall= The Knights' Hall, a large room in the eastern part of the New Hermitage originally designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, now hosts a collection of Western European arms and armour from the 15th-17th centuries, part of the Hermitage Arsenal collection. The Hall of Twelve Columns, in the southeast corner of the New Hermitage, is adorned with columns of grey Serdobol granite and was also designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, is now used for temporary exhibitions. Three Graces, 1813-1816, by Canova The Gallery of the History of Ancient Painting adjoins the Knights' Hall and also flanks the skylight rooms. It was designed by Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style as a prelude to the museum and features neoclassical marble sculptures by Antonio Canova and his followers. In the middle, the gallery opens to the main staircase of the New Hermitage, which served as the entrance to the museum before the October Revolution of 1917, but is now closed. The upper gallery of the staircase is adorned with twenty grey Serdobol granite columns and feature 19th-century European sculpture and Russian lapidary works. =Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque= The Rubens Room The rooms and galleries along the southern facade and in the western wing of the New Hermitage are now entirely devoted to Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque painting of the 17th century, including the large collections of Van Dyck, Rubens and Rembrandt. They also contain several paintings by Jan Brueghel the Elder (Velvet period), Frans Snyders (for example, The Fish Market), Gerard ter Borch, Paulus Potter, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan van Goyen, Ferdinand Bol and Gerard van Honthorst. =German, Swiss, British and French fine art= The first floor rooms on the southern facade of the Winter Palace are occupied by the collections of German fine art of the 16th century and French fine art of the 15th‚Äì18th centuries, including paintings by Poussin, Lorrain, Watteau. The collections of French decorative and applied art from the 17th‚Äì18th centuries and British applied and fine art from the 16th‚Äì19th century, including Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, are on display in nearby rooms facing the courtyard. This area also holds paintings by German artists, including Hans Wertinger, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Barthel Bruyn the Elder, Caspar David Friedrich (Moonrise by the Sea), Anton Mengs, Hans Thoma, Anselm Feuerbach, Franz Stuck (Two Men Fighting Over a Woman) and Heinrich Campendonk as well as paintings by Swiss painters Angelica Kauffman, Alexandre Calame, Arnold B√∂cklin and Ferdinand Hodler. =Russian art= The richly decorated interiors of the first floor of the Winter Palace on its eastern, northern and western sides are part of the Russian culture collection and host the exhibitions of Russian art from the 11th-19th centuries. Temporary exhibitions are usually held in the Nicholas Hall. =French Neoclassical, Impressionist, and post-Impressionist art= Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning, 1884, Claude Monet French Neoclassical, Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, including works by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin, are displayed on the fourth floor of the Eastern Wing of the General Staff Building.

It features Matisse, Derain and other fauvists, Picasso, Malevich, Petrocelli, Kandinsky, Giacomo Manz√π, Giorgio Morandi and Rockwell Kent. A large room is devoted to the German Romantic art of the 19th century, including several paintings by Caspar David Friedrich. The second floor of the Western wing features collections of the Oriental art (from China, India, Mongolia, Tibet, Central Asia, Byzantium and Near East). History =Origins: Catherine's collection= Catherine the Great started her art collection in 1764 by purchasing paintings from Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. He assembled the collection for Frederick II of Prussia, who ultimately refused to purchase it. Thus, Gotzkowsky provided 225 or 317 paintings (conflicting accounts list both numbers), mainly Flemish and Dutch, as well as others, including 90 not precisely identified, to the Russian crown. The collection consisted of Rembrandt (13 paintings), Rubens (11 paintings), Jacob Jordaens (7 paintings), Anthony van Dyck (5 paintings), Paolo Veronese (5 paintings), Frans Hals (3 paintings, including Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove), Raphael (2 paintings), Holbein (2 paintings), Titian (1 painting), Jan Steen (The Idlers), Hendrik Goltzius, Dirck van Baburen, Hendrick van Balen and Gerrit van Honthorst. Perhaps some of the most famous and notable artworks that were a part of Catherine's original purchase from Gotzkowsky were Danae, painted by Rembrandt in 1636; Descent from the Cross, painted by Rembrandt in 1624; and Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove, painted by Frans Hals in 1650. These paintings remain in the Hermitage collection today.‚ÄúHermitage History,‚Äù www.hermitagemuseum.org. Empress Catherine II In 1764, Catherine commissioned Yury Felten to build an extension on the east of the Winter Palace which he completed in 1766. Later it became the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1767‚Äì1769, French architect Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe built the Northern Pavilion on the Neva embankment. Between 1767 and 1775, the extensions were connected by galleries, where Catherine put her collections.Saint Petersburg Encyclopedia - Hermitage Buildings (entry) The entire neoclassical building is now known as the Small Hermitage. During the time of Catherine, the Hermitage was not a public museum and few people were allowed to view its holdings. Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe also rebuilt rooms in the second story of the south-east corner block that was originally built for Elizabeth and later occupied by Peter III. The largest room in this particular apartment was the Audience Chamber (also called the Throne Hall) which consisted of 227 square meters. The Hermitage buildings served as a home and workplace for nearly a thousand people, including the Imperial family. In addition to this, they also served as an extravagant showplace for all kinds of Russian relics and displays of wealth prior to the art collections. Many events were held in these buildings including masquerades for the nobility, grand receptions and ceremonies for state and government officials. The \\"Hermitage complex\\" was a creation of Catherine's that allowed all kinds of festivities to take place in the palace, the theatre and even the museum of the Hermitage. This helped solidify the Hermitage as not only a dwelling place for the Imperial family, but also as an important symbol and memorial to the imperial Russian state. Today, the palace and the museum are one and the same. In Catherine's day, the Winter Palace served as a central part of what was called the Palace Square. The Palace Square served as St. Petersburg's nerve center by linking it to all the city's most important buildings. The presence of the Palace Square was extremely significant to the urban development of St. Petersburg, and while it became less of a nerve center later into the 20th century, its symbolic value was still very much preserved.Piotrovsky, Mikhail, ‚ÄúThe Hermitage in the Context of the City,‚Äù Museum International 55, no. 1, 79-80. Catherine acquired the best collections offered for sale by the heirs of prominent collectors. In 1769, she purchased Br√ºhl's collection, consisting of over 600 paintings and a vast number of prints and drawings, in Saxony. Three years later, she bought Crozat's collection of paintings in France with the assistance of Denis Diderot. Next, in 1779, she acquired the collection of 198 paintings that once belonged to Robert Walpole in London followed by a collection of 119 paintings in Paris from Count Baudouin in 1781. Catherine's favorite items to collect were believed to be engraved gems and cameos. At the inaugural exhibit of the Hermitage, opened by the Prince of Wales in November 2000, there was an entire gallery devoted to representing and displaying Catherine's favorite items. In this gallery her cameos are displayed along with cabinet made by David Roentgen, which holds her engraved gems. As the symbol of Minerva was frequently used and favored by Catherine to represent her patronage of the arts, a cameo of Catherine as Minerva is also displayed here. This particular cameo was created for her by her daughter-in-law, the Grand Duchess Maria Fyodorovna. This is only a small representation of Catherine's vast collection of many antique and contemporary engraved gems and cameos.Mason, Mary Willan, ‚ÄúThe Treasures of Catherine the Great from the State Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg,‚Äù Antiques & Collecting Magazine 106, no. 3, 62. View of the Palace Embankment by Karl Beggrov, 1826. The Old Hermitage is in the middle of the painting. The collection soon overgrew the building. In her lifetime, Catherine acquired 4,000 paintings from the old masters, 38,000 books, 10,000 engraved gems, 10,000 drawings, 16,000 coins and medals and a natural history collection filling two galleries, so in 1771 she commissioned Yury Felten to build another major extension. The neoclassical building was completed in 1787 and has come to be known as the Large Hermitage or Old Hermitage. Catherine also gave the name of the Hermitage to her private theatre, built nearby between 1783 and 1787 by the Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi. In London in 1787, Catherine acquired the collection of sculpture that belonged to Lyde Browne, mostly Ancient Roman marbles. Catherine used them to adorn the Catherine Palace and park in Tsarskoye Selo, but later they became the core of the Classical Antiquities collection of the Hermitage. From 1787 to 1792, Quarenghi designed and built a wing along the Winter Canal with the Raphael Loggias to replicate the loggia in the Apostolic Palace in Rome designed by Donato Bramante and frescoed by Raphael. The loggias in Saint Petersburg were adorned with copies of Vatican frescoes painted by Cristopher Unterberger and his workshop in the 1780s. Catherine's collection of at least 4,000 paintings came to rival the older and more prestigious museums of Western Europe. Catherine took great pride in her collection and actively participated in extensive competitive art gathering and collecting that was prevalent in European royal court culture. Through her art collection she gained European acknowledgment and acceptance and portrayed Russia as an enlightened society. Catherine went on to invest much of her identity in being a patron of the arts. She was particularly fond of the Roman deity Minerva, whose characteristics according to classical tradition are military prowess, wisdom, and patronage of the arts. Using the title Catherine the Minerva, she created new institutions of literature and culture and also participated in many projects of her own, mostly play writing. The representation of Catherine alongside Minerva would come to be a tradition of enlightened patronage in Russia.Dianina, Katia, ‚ÄúArt and Authority: The Hermitage of Catherine the Great,‚Äù Russian Review 63, no. 4, 634-636. =Expansion in the 19th century= Portico with atlantes, historical entrance In 1815, Alexander I of Russia purchased 38 pictures from the heirs of Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, most of which had been looted by the French in Kassel during the war. The Hermitage collection of Rembrandts was then considered the largest in the world. Also among Alexander's purchases from Josephine's estate were the first four sculptures by the neoclassical Italian sculptor Antonio Canova to enter the Hermitage collection. Eventually the imperial collections were enriched by Greek and Scythian artifacts excavated within the Russian Empire. The Raphael Loggias Between 1840 and 1843, Vasily Stasov redesigned the interiors of the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1838, Nicholas I commissioned the neoclassical German architect Leo von Klenze to design a building for the public museum. Space for the museum was made next to the Small Hermitage by the demolition of the Shepelev Palace and royal stables. The construction was overseen by the Russian architects Vasily Stasov and Nikolai Yefimov in 1842‚Äì1851 and incorporated Quarenghi's wing with the Raphael Loggias. In 1851, in Venice the museum acquired the collection of Cristoforo Barbarigo, including five more canvases by Titian. Today, all of the paintings but one (Dana√´) by Titian in the Hermitage Museum came to St. Petersburg from the Barbarigo collection. The New Hermitage was opened to the public on 5 February 1852. In the same year the Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum emerged and was particularly enriched by items given by the Duke of Leuchtenberg, Nicholas I's son-in-law. Meanwhile, in 1851‚Äì1860, the interiors of the Old Hermitage were redesigned by Andrei Stackensneider to accommodate the State Assembly, Cabinet of Ministers and state apartments. Stakenschneider created the Pavilion Hall in the Northern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage in 1851‚Äì1858. Until the 1920s, the museum's entrance was under the portico supported by five-metre high atlantes of grey Serdobol granite from Finland in the middle of the southern facade of the New Hermitage building. In 1861, the Hermitage purchased from the Papal government part of the Giampietro Campana collection, which consisted mostly classical antiquities. These included over 500 vases, 200 bronzes and a number of marble statues. The Hermitage acquired Madonna Litta, which was then attributed to Leonardo, in 1865, and Raphael's Connestabile Madonna in 1870. In 1884 in Paris, Alexander III of Russia acquired the collection of Alexander Basilewski, featuring European medieval and Renaissance artifacts. In 1885, the Arsenal collection of arms and armour, founded by Alexander I of Russia, was transferred from the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo to the Hermitage. In 1914, Leonardo's Benois Madonna was added to the collection. =After the October Revolution= Immediately after the Revolution of 1917 the Imperial Hermitage and the Winter Palace, the former Imperial residence, were proclaimed state museums and eventually merged. A room in the Winter Palace The range of the Hermitage's exhibits was further expanded when private art collections from several palaces of the Russian Tsars and numerous private mansions were nationalized and redistributed among major Soviet state museums. Particularly notable was the influx of old masters from the Catherine Palace, the Alexander Palace, the Stroganov Palace and the Yusupov Palace as well as from other palaces of Saint Petersburg and suburbs. In 1922, an important collection of 19th-century European paintings was transferred to the Hermitage from the Academy of Arts. In turn, in 1927 about 500 important paintings were transferred to the Central Museum of old Western art in Moscow at the insistence of the Soviet authorities. In the early 1930s, 70 more paintings were sent there. After 1932, a number of less significant works of art were transferred to new museums all over the Soviet Union. In 1928, the Soviet government ordered the Hermitage to compile a list of valuable works of art for export. In 1930‚Äì1934, over two thousand works of art from the Hermitage collection were clandestinely sold at auctions abroad or directly to foreign officials and businesspeople. The sold items included Raphael's Alba Madonna, Titian's Venus with a Mirror, and Jan van Eyck's Annunciation, among other world known masterpieces by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and others. In 1931, after a series of negotiations, Andrew W. Mellon acquired 21 works of art from the Hermitage and later donated them to form a nucleus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (see also Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings). Soviet ski troops by the portico during the Siege of Leningrad With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, before the Siege of Leningrad started, two trains with a considerable part of the collections were evacuated to Sverdlovsk. Two bombs and a number of shells hit the museum buildings during the siege. The museum opened an exhibition in November 1944. In October 1945 the evacuated collections were brought back, and in November 1945 the museum reopened. In 1948, 316 works of Impressionist, post-Impressionist, and modern art from the collection of the Museum of New Western Art in Moscow, originating mostly from the nationalized collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov and disestablished before the war, were transferred to the Hermitage, including works by Matisse and Picasso. Beginning in 1967, a number of works by Matisse were donated to the museum by his muse Lydia Delectorskaya. In 1981, the restored Menshikov Palace became a new branch of the Hermitage museum, displaying Russian culture of the early 18th century. On 15 June 1985, a man later judged insane attacked Rembrandt's painting Dana√´, displayed in the museum. He threw sulfuric acid on the canvas and cut it twice with a knife. The restoration of the painting had been accomplished by Hermitage conservationists by 1997, and Dana√´ is now on display behind armoured glass. =The Hermitage since 1991= In 1991, it became known that some paintings looted by the Red Army in Germany in 1945 were held in the Hermitage. But only in October 1994 did the Hermitage officially announce that it had secretly been holding a major trove of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings from German private collections. The exhibition \\"Hidden Treasures Revealed\\", where 74 of the paintings were displayed for the first time, was opened on 30 March 1995 in the Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace and lasted a year. Of the paintings, all but one originated from private rather than state German collections, including 56 paintings from the Otto Krebs collection, as well as the collection of Bernhard Koehler and paintings previously belonging to Otto Gerstenberg and his daughter Margarete Scharf, including the world-famous Place de la Concorde by Degas, In the Garden by Renoir, and White House at Night by Van Gogh. Some of the paintings are now on permanent display in several small rooms in the northeastern corner of the Winter Palace on the first floor. In 1993, the Russian government gave the eastern wing of the nearby General Staff Building across the Palace Square to the Hermitage and the new exhibition rooms in 1999. Since 2003, the Great Courtyard of the Winter Palace has been open to the public providing another entrance to the museum. Also in 2003, the Museum of Porcelain opened as a part of the Hermitage on the grounds of the Imperial Porcelain Factory. In 2003, the Hermitage loaned 142 pieces to the University of Michigan Museum of Art for an exhibition titled The Romanovs Collect: European Art from the Hermitage. In December 2004, the museum discovered another looted work of art: Venus Disarming Mars by Rubens was once in the collection of the Rheinsberg Palace near Berlin, and was apparently looted by Soviet troops from the K√∂nigsberg Castle in East Prussia in 1945. At the time, Mikhail Piotrovsky said the painting would be cleaned and displayed. The museum announced in July 2006 that 221 minor items, including jewelry, Orthodox icons, silverware and richly enameled objects, had been stolen. The value of the stolen items was estimated to be approximately $543,000. By the end of 2006 several of the stolen items had been recovered. Dependencies Deer golden plaque from Krasnodar, beginning of 6th century BC In recent years, the Hermitage launched several dependencies abroad and domestically. =Hermitage Amsterdam= The dependency of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam is known as the Hermitage Amsterdam, and is located in the former Amstelhof building. It opened on 24 February 2004 in a small building on the Nieuwe Herengracht in Amsterdam, awaiting the closing of the retirement home which still occupied the Amstelhof building until 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the Amstelhof was renovated and made suitable for the housing of the Amsterdam Hermitage. The Amsterdam Hermitage was opened on 19 June 2009 by President Dmitry Medvedev and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.Reuters.com - Russia's Hermitage museum opens Amsterdam branch =Hermitage-Kazan Exhibition Center= The Hermitage dependency in Kazan (Tatarstan, Russia), opened in 2005. It was created with support from President of the Republic of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiev and is a subdivision of the Kazan Kremlin State Historical and Architectural Museum-Park. The museum is situated in the Kazan Kremlin in an edifice previously occupied by the Junker School built in the beginning of the 19th century. =Ermitage Italia, Ferrara= Following the prior experiences in London, Las Vegas, Amsterdam and Kazan, the Hermitage foundation decided to create a further branch in Italy with the launch of a national bid. Several northern Italian cities expressed interest such as Verona, Mantua, Ferrara and Turin. In 2007, the honor was awarded to the city of Ferrara which proposed its Castle Estense as the base. Since then, the new institution called Ermitage Italia started a research and scientific collaboration with the Hermitage foundation. =Hermitage-Vyborg Center= Hermitage-Vyborg Center was opened in June 2010 in Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast. =Hermitage Exhibition Center, Vladivostok= A Hermitage branch is due to open in Vladivostok by 2016, and the regional government has allocated more than Rb17.7 million ($558,000) for preliminary reconstruction work on a mansion in Vladivostok's historic downtown district to house the satellite.Sophia Kishkovsky (6 November 2013), Launch (museum) satellites, says Putin The Art Newspaper. =Hermitage-Siberia, Omsk= The Hermitage-Siberia is due to open in Omsk in 2016. =Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, Vilnius= In recent years, there have been proposals to open a Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in the capital city of Lithuania. Like the former Las Vegas dependency, the museum is to combine artworks from the Saint Petersburg Hermitage with works from the New York Guggenheim Museum. =Former dependencies= The Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas opened on 7 October 2001 and closed on 11 May 2008. The Hermitage Rooms in London's Somerset House opened on 25 November 2000. The exhibition was closed permanently in November 2007 due to poor visitor numbers.

The program not only aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities but also serves as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, bringing the specific knowledge of the museum's experts to the community. Volunteers may also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests: communicate a feeling of responsibility to the youth so as to help them understand the value of tradition and the necessity of its preservation. One of the Hermitage cats =Cats= A population of cats lives on the museum grounds and serves as an attraction.

There are a series of programs that have aired entitled ‚ÄòMy Hermitage‚Äô that have been particularly successful. All of these programs are organized by the Director of the Hermitage, Professor Mikhail Piotrovsky, and are quite similar to the broadcasts created by Academician Boris Piotrovsky, who is Mikhail's father. These programs were first broadcast through the Soviet Union's ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô channel, airing at the height of the museum's boom. During this time, this channel recorded more than three million visitors every year, mostly from the Soviet Union. Another program created by the Hermitage was called ‚ÄòThe Treasures of St. Petersburg,‚Äô and was broadcast on the St. Petersburg regional television. This program gave insight into what exhibitions were being displayed at the Hermitage.Matveev, Vladimir, ‚ÄúThe Hermitage and its Links with Regions of Russia,‚Äù Museum International 55, no. 1, 68.

It lies about south of Cambridge. Name The village of Grantchester is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as Grantesete and Grauntsethe. It is also mentioned briefly in book IV, chapter 19 of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. John de Grauntsete, a lawyer who had a successful career as a judge in Ireland, was born in Grantchester, .

The confusion arises from the lower stretches of the Granta having been renamed the Cam after the city. Overview Grantchester is said to have the world's highest concentration of Nobel Prize winners, most of these presumably being current or retired academics from the nearby University of Cambridge. Students and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in the meadows or take tea at The Orchard. In 1897, a group of Cambridge students persuaded the owner of Orchard House to serve them tea in its apple orchard, and this became a regular practice. Lodgers at Orchard House included the Edwardian poet Rupert Brooke, who later moved next door to the Old Vicarage. In 1912, while in Berlin, he wrote a poem of homesickness entitled \\"The Old Vicarage, Grantchester\\". The house is currently the home of the Cambridge scientist Mary Archer and her husband, Jeffrey Archer. Grantchester has been the home since 1969 of the sculptor Helaine Blumenfeld OBE.

The pool is now below a modern weir where the Bourn Brook flows into the River Cam. Byron's Pool is a Local Nature Reserve. In popular culture Grantchester is the subject of \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" (composed and performed by Roger Waters) a song by Pink Floyd, with the village being home to band member David Gilmour. A few years later, David Gilmour also wrote a song about Grantchester Meadows, called Fat Old Sun.

ANDREW AND MARY) CHURCHYARD}} Barrel race Every year on Boxing Day (26 December), Grantchester holds an inter-village barrel race which is around 40 minutes long and ends with a hog roast at the Rupert Brooke pub. This tradition dates back to the 1960s. Legends An underground passage is said to run from the Old Manor house to King's College Chapel two miles away. It was said that a fiddler who offered to follow the passage set off playing his fiddle; the music became fainter and fainter, until it was heard no more and the fiddler was never seen or heard of again. This story is told of many supposed tunnels. On a 17th-century map of Grantchester, one of the fields is called Fiddler's Close.

It is written in unrhymed, alliterative verse divided into sections called passus (Latin for \\"step\\"). Like the Pearl Poet's Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Piers Plowman is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest works of English literature of the Middle Ages, even preceding and influencing Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Piers Plowman contains the first known reference to a literary tradition of Robin Hood tales. There exist three distinct versions of the poem, which scholars refer to as the A-, B-, and C-texts. The B-text is the most widely edited and translated version; it revises and extends the A-text by over four thousand lines. Summary The poem, a mix of theological allegory and social satire, concerns the narrator/dreamer's quest for the true Christian life in the context of medieval Catholicism. This journey takes place within a series of dream-visions; the dreamer seeks, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel (\\"Do-Well\\"), Dobet (\\"Do-Better\\"), and Dobest (\\"Do-Best\\"). The poem is divided into passus ('steps'), the divisions between which vary by version. The following summary is based on the B-version of the poem. =Vision 1= Prologue: The poem begins in the Malvern Hills between Worcestershire and Herefordshire. A man named Will (which can be understood either simply as a personal name or as an allegory for a person's will, in the sense of 'desire, intention') falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress (donjon) in a deep valley; between these symbols of heaven and hell is a 'fair field full of folk', representing the world of mankind. A satirical account of different sections of society follows, along with a dream-like fable representing the King as a cat and his people as rodents who consider whether to bell the cat. Passus 1: Holy Church visits Will and explains the tower of Truth, and discusses Truth more generally. Passus 2: Will sees Lady Mede ('payment') and finds out about her planned marriage to False. Passus 3: Lady Mede travels to the royal court; the King proposes she marry Conscience; but Conscience denounces her. Passus 4: Conscience and Reason convince the King not to marry Mede to False. Will wakes up. =Vision 2= Passus 5: Will falls back to sleep. Reason gives a sermon to the Field of Folk and the people decide to repent. The Seven Deadly Sins make confession and in penance attempt to go on pilgrimage to St Truth. They get lost, and Piers Plowman makes his first appearance: he will help the penitents if they help him plough his half-acre. Passus 6: Piers and the penitents plough the half-acre. Some people refuse to work, and Hunger punishes them until they work. But once Hunger has been sated, the people return to idleness. Passus 7: Eventually, Truth sends Piers a pardon for the penitents' sins; its main content is 'Do well and have well and God shall have your soul' and 'Do evil and have evil, and expect nothing other than that after your death, the Devil shall have your soul'. When challenged on the pardon's validity by a priest, Piers angrily tears it in two. Will is awakened by their arguing and, musing on his dreams, decides to seek ‚ÄòDo-wel‚Äô. =Vision 3= Passus 8: Will's search for Dowel begins. He enters into a disputation with Friars. He then falls asleep once more and meets Thought. Thought instructs Will in 'Do well, do better, do best'. Practical interpretation of what these concepts mean is to be provided by Wit. Passus 9: There is an extended allegory featuring Dowel and the Castle of Flesh, exposing the need for people to be governed by their ‚ÄòInwit‚Äô. The text discusses poverty and marriage. Wit makes further inroads to understanding Dowel, as active virtue. Passus 10: Will meets Wit‚Äôs wife, Dame Study. She complains to Will about his ignorance. Will then proceeds to Clergy and Scripture to learn more about Dowel. He considers what use scholarship might have in helping him achieve salvation. Passus 11: Scripture complains about Will's lack of self-knowledge. Angered, Will (who is already dreaming) goes to sleep and has a dream-within-a-dream in which he meets Fortune. He serves her into old age, but she abandons him. Will learns about the salvation of the Emperor Trajan and power of love. Kynde ('character, natural disposition, nature', here understood as an aspect of God) shows Will the world. Will has an argument with Reason: Reason, Will concludes, does not do enough to keep people from sin; but Reason disagrees. Will awakes from the dream-within-a- dream. He now meets Imaginatif, who advises Will to be patient. Passus 12: Imaginatif teaches Will, bringing together and improving his understanding of earlier discussions in the poem. Imaginatif emphasises the need for humility and the importance of Grace. =Vision 4= Passus 13: Will awakens and then falls back to sleep; he dreams of sharing a feast with Conscience, Scripture, Clergy and Patience; he encounters a greedy Doctor of Divinity (who later shows disdain for love) and as well as eating actual food also dines on spiritual food. Piers the Plowman offers a definition of Do Well, Do Better and Do Best. Then Conscience and Patience meet Haukyn the Active Man, who wears a coat of Christian faith which is, however, soiled with the Seven Deadly Sins. Passus 14: Conscience teaches Haukyn to seek forgiveness and do penance; Patience teaches Haukyn about the merits of embracing poverty. Haukyn cries out for God's mercy, which awakens Will. =Vision 5= Passus 15: Will finds himself alienated from the waking world, but Reason helps him to go back to sleep, whereupon Will meets Anima ('spirit'). Anima tells Will off for his pride in wanting to know too much, but goes on to talk about charity, in particular how the Church should care for its flock, but how its priests and monks do not always fulfil this duty. Talking to Anima, Will starts to conclude that Piers the Plowman is Christ. Will realises that he needs to switch from searching for Dowel to searching for Charity. Passus 16: Will falls into another dream-within-a-dream, this time about the Tree of Charity, whose gardener is Piers the Plowman. Will participates in a re-enactment of the Fall of Man and then has a vision of the life of Christ; when this reaches the point where the Devil is defeated, Will wakes up from the dream-within-a- dream. Will goes looking for Piers and meeting Faith/Abraham, who is himself searching for Christ. Passus 17: Next, Will meets Hope/Moses, characterised by the tablets of law, who is also in search of Christ. Will learns about the Good Samaritan, the prospect of salvation, and the importance of Love. He wakes up. =Vision 6= Passus 18: Will sleeps again, and experiences the climactic section of Piers Plowman. He experiences Love and the intersection of human and divine time. Will witnesses Christ/the Good Samaritan/Piers Plowman riding into Jerusalem and Christ's crucifixion. He then witnesses the Four Daughters of God (Truth, Justice, Mercy, Peace) in debate; the Harrowing of Hell; and Redemption. Will wakes again, and now exhorts his family to hear Mass. =Vision 7= Passus 19: During the mass, Will falls back to sleep and meets Conscience once more. Conscience recounts the life and Passion of Christ and how Piers/Peter was given his power by Grace/Christ. Will finds out about Pentecost; once more sees Piers as a ploughman; and witnesses Pride attacking Unity/Holy Church. He wakes up and records his dream. =Vision 8= Passus 20: While awake, Will meets Need. He falls asleep again and now dreams of the Antichrist. Kynde sends Old Age, Death, and Pestilence, to chastise people: Will is attacked by Old Age. He witnesses Holy Church undermined by a hypocritical Friar. Conscience goes on pilgrimage to seek Piers the Plowman, and calls on Grace for helpwhereupon Will wakes up. Title and authorship It is now commonly accepted that Piers Plowman was written by William Langland, about whom little is known. This attribution rests principally on the evidence of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the C-text (see below) of Piers held at Trinity College, Dublin (MS 212), which ascribes the work to one man, called 'Willielmus de Langlond': ;Translation Other manuscripts also name the author as \\"Robert or William Langland\\", or \\"Wilhelmus W.\\" (which could be shorthand for \\"William of Wychwood\\"). The attribution to William Langland is also based on internal evidence, primarily a seemingly autobiographical section in Passus 5 of the C-text of the poem. The main narrator of the poem in all the versions is named Will, with allegorical resonances clearly intended, and Langland (or Longland) is thought to be indicated as a surname through apparent puns; e.g., at one point the narrator remarks: \\"I have lyved in londe... my name is longe wille\\" (B.XV.152). This could be a coded reference to the poet's name, in the style of much late-medieval literature. New evidence suggests that this reverse cryptogram was read as \\"Will Long Will\\" by contemporary scribes and that the rebels of 1381 used this name as pseudonym alongside the name \\"Piers Plowman\\". Langland's authorship, however, is not entirely beyond dispute, as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated. in their work,\\"The Langland Myth\\", they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that Langland is, in fact, the author, but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of William de la Rokele. In the sixteenth century, when Piers was first printed, authorship was attributed by various antiquarians (such as John Bale) and poets to John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer, amongst others. Some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century persons regarded the poem as anonymous, and/or associated it with texts in the plowman tradition of social complaint, particularly the Chaucerian pseudepigrapha The Ploughman's Tale and Pierce the Ploughman's Crede. (The latter was appended to Owen Rogers' 1560 edition of Piers Plowman, a degraded version of Robert Crowley's 1550 editions.) The character of Piers himself had come to be considered by many readers to be in some sense the author. The first printed editions by Crowley named the author as \\"Robert Langland\\" in a prefatory note. Langland is described as a probable prot√©g√© of Wycliffe. With Crowley's editions, the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem The Vision of Piers [or Pierce] Plowman, which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem. Some medievalists and text critics, beginning with John Matthews Manly, have posited multiple authorship theories for Piers, an idea which continues to have a periodic resurgence in the scholarly literature. One scholar now disputes the single-author hypothesis, supposing that the poem may be the work of between two and five authors, depending upon how authorship is defined. In keeping with contemporary scholarly trends in textual criticism, critical theory, and the history of the book, Charlotte Brewer, among others, suggests that scribes and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi- authorial roles in the production of Piers Plowman and other early modern texts, but this has nothing to do with Manly's argument. The text Image of the opening of Piers Plowman from manuscript Laud misc. 581 in the Bodleian Library Piers Plowman from the early-15th century manuscript in the National Library of Wales Piers Plowman is considered to be one of the most analytically challenging texts in Middle English textual criticism. There are 50‚Äì56 surviving manuscripts, some of which are fragmentary. None of the texts are known to be in the author's own hand, and none of them derive directly from any of the others. All modern discussion of the text revolves around the classifications of W. W. Skeat. Skeat argued that there are as many as ten forms of the poem, but only three are to be considered authoritative--the A, B, and C-texts--although the definition of \\"authoritative\\" in this context is problematic. According to the three-versions hypothesis, each version represents different manuscript traditions deriving from three distinct and successive stages of authorial revision. Although precise dating is debated, the A, B, and C texts are now commonly thought of as the progressive (20‚Äì25 years) work of a single author. According to the three-versions hypothesis, the A-text was written 1367‚Äì70 and is the earliest. It breaks off, apparently unfinished, at Book 11, and Book 12 is written by another author or interpolator. The poem runs to about 2,500 lines. The B-text (Warner's ur-B text) was written 1377‚Äì79; it revises A, adds new material, and is three times the length of A. It runs to about 7,300 lines. The C-text was written in the 1380s as a major revision of B except for the final sections. There is some debate over whether the poem can be regarded as finished or not. It entails additions, omissions, and transpositions; it is not significantly different in size from B. Some scholars see it as a conservative revision of B that aims at disassociating the poem from Lollardy and the religious and political radicalism of John Ball during the Great Rising of 1381. (Ball appropriated Piers and other characters in the poem for his own verses, speeches, and letters during the Rising.) There is little actual evidence for this proposal, and much against it. Skeat believed that the A-text was incomplete and based his editions on a B-text manuscript (Oxford, MS. Laud Misc. 581) that he wrongly thought was probably a holograph. Modern editors following Skeat, such as George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson, have maintained the basic tenets of Skeat's work: there were three final authorial texts, now lost, that can be reconstructed, albeit imperfectly and without certainty, by rooting out the \\"corruption\\" and \\"damage\\" done by scribes. The Kane, Kane- Donaldson, and Russell-Kane editions of the three versions, published by the Athlone Press, have been controversial, but are considered among the most important accomplishments in modern editorial work and theory in Middle English. A. V. C. Schmidt has also published a parallel edition of A, B, C and Z; the second volume containing a full critical apparatus indicating his editorial decisions was finally published in 2008, long after the first volume fell out of print. A. G. Rigg and Charlotte Brewer hypothesized the existence of a Z-text predecessor to A which contains elements of both A and C. The Z-text is based on Oxford MS. Bodley 851, which Rigg and Brewer edited and published. It is the shortest version, and its authenticity is disputed. Ralph Hanna III has disputed the Rigg/Brewer approach based on codicological evidence and internal literary evidence; consequently the Z-text is now more commonly viewed as a scribal corruption of A with C elements. More recently, Lawrence Warner has shown that what was thought of as B in fact incorporates matter produced as part of the C-revision: if B circulated before C, it looked nothing like what previous editors had assumed. Editorial, publication and reception history =14th‚Äì15th centuries= John Ball, a priest involved as a leader in the Great Rising of 1381 (also known as the Peasants' Revolt), included Piers and other characters in his writings. If Piers Plowman already had perceived associations with Lollardy, Ball's appropriations from it (assuming he was not referring to a folk character also appropriated by Langland) enhanced his and its association with the Lollards as well. The real beliefs and sympathies at work in Langland's poem and the revolt remain, for this reason, mysterious and debatable. New evidence suggests that in Norfolk the rebels of 1381 had access to the B version of the text and that they used the author-persona's name - Will Long Will - as a pseudonym. No doubt because of Ball's writings, the Dieulacres Abbey Chronicle account of the revolt refers to Piers, seemingly as a real person who was a leader with Ball in the revolt. Similarly, early in the history of the poem's dissemination in manuscript form, Piers is often treated as the author of the poem. Since it is hard to see how this is credible to those who read the poem, perhaps the idea was that Piers was a mask for the author. Or, as the ideal character of the poem, Piers might be seen as a kind of alter-ego for the poet that was more important to his early readers than the obviously authorial narrator and his apparent self-disclosures as Will. Ironically, Will's name and identity were substantially lost. In some contemporary chronicles of the Rising, Ball and the Lollards were blamed for the revolt, and Piers began to be associated with heresy and rebellion. The earliest literary works comprising the Piers Plowman tradition follow in the wake of these events, although they and their sixteenth-century successors are not anti-monarchical or supportive of rebellion. Like William Langland, who may have written the C-text version of Piers Plowman to disassociate himself from the Rising, they look for the reform of the English church and society by the removal of abuses in what the authors deem a restorative rather than an innovative project. The first recorded owner of a copy of Piers Plowman was the Irish judge Walter de Brugge, who died in 1396. =16th‚Äì18th centuries= The most conspicuous omissions from William Caxton's press were the Bible and Piers Plowman. Robert Crowley's 1550 editions of Piers Plowman present the poem as a proto- Protestant goad to the reformation of religion and society. In the passus summaries in the second and third editions, Crowley emphasizes material in the poem warning of political instability and widespread corruption when the king is a child (as was then the case). Crowley may have made small attempts to remove or soften single references to transubstantiation, the Mass, purgatory, and the Virgin Mary as a mediator and object of devotion (although almost a dozen references to purgatory remain, as well as three significant references to Mary). He actually added a line to his second and third editions that clearly refers to Marian intercession (F1r). After 1550, it was not printed again until 1813 except for Owen Rogers' 1561 edition -- a cheap knock-off of Crowley's text. The few people who mention Piers Plowman before 1700 usually attribute it to someone other than Langland, and often it is unclear whether they are referring to Langland's poem or one of the many other texts circulating in print as part of the Piers Plowman tradition, particularly The Ploughman's Tale. Since Piers was conflated with the author and dreamer- narrator of the poem at an early date, \\"Piers Plowman\\" or a Latin equivalent is often given as the name of the author, which indicates unfamiliarity with, or disbelief of, Crowley's preface. When Langland's poem is mentioned, it is often disparaged for its barbarous language. Similar charges were made against Chaucer, but he had more defenders and was already well established as a historical figure and \\"authority.\\" Despite the work of Bale and Crowley, Langland's name appears to have remained unknown or unaccepted since other authors were suggested after Crowley's editions. Sometimes \\"Piers Plowman\\" was referred to as the author of the poem, and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors, they will often mention \\"Piers Plowman\\" as an author's name or a substitute for one. One gets the overall impression that Langland and Piers Plowman had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of Piers, whose relationship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier. Samuel Pepys owned a copy of Piers Plowman. Milton cites \\"Chaucer's Ploughman\\" in \\"Of Reformation\\" (1641) when he is discussing poems that have described Constantine as a major contributor to the corruption of the church. The end of Piers Plowman, Passus 15, makes this point at length‚Äîbut it is also made briefly in one stanza in The Ploughman's Tale (ll. 693-700). In \\"An Apology for a Pamphlet ...\\" Milton refers to The Vision and Crede of Pierce Ploughman, which might mean one or both of these texts. Perhaps it refers to Rogers' 1561 edition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) appears to have read the poem closely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. John Weever (1631) also names Robert Langland, as does David Buchanan (1652). Buchanan, however, makes Langland a Scot and attributes other works to him aside from Piers Plowman. Thomas Fuller (1662) bases his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Fuller also notes that The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe was \\"first set forth by Tindal, since, exemplified by Mr. Fox.\\" Since the language of this text is similar to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributes it to Langland as well. Thomas Dudley, father of Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612‚Äì72), brought a copy of Crowley's Piers Plowman to America. Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744) owned a copy of Rogers' reprint of Crowley's edition of Piers Plowman with the Crede appended, and Isaac D'Israeli (1766‚Äì1848) wrote in his Amenities of Literature that Pope had \\"very carefully analyzed the whole\\" of the latter text. D'Israeli also mentions Lord Byron's (1788‚Äì1824) praise for Piers Plowman. =19th‚Äì20th-21st centuries= With its old language and alien worldview, Piers Plowman fell into obscurity until the nineteenth century. Barring Rogers, after Crowley, the poem was not published in its entirety until Thomas Whitaker's 1813 edition. It emerged at a time when amateur philologists began the groundwork of what would later become a recognized scholarly discipline. Whitaker's edition was based on a C-text, whereas Crowley used a B-text for his base. With Whitaker a modern editorial tradition began, with each new editor striving to present the \\"authentic\\" Piers Plowman and challenging the accuracy and authenticity of preceding editors and editions. Then, as before in the English Reformation, this project was driven by a need for a national identity and history that addressed present concerns, hence analysis and commentary typically reflected the critic's political views. In the hands of Frederick Furnivall and W. W. Skeat, Piers Plowman could be, respectively, a consciousness-raising text in the Working Man's College or a patriotic text for grammar school pupils. Piers Plowman has often been read primarily as a political document. In an 1894 study, J. J. Jusserand was primarily concerned with what he saw as the poem's psychological and sociopolitical content‚Äîas distinct from the aesthetic or literary‚Äîin a dichotomy common to all modern humanistic studies. In \\"Le temps des laboureurs. Travail, ordre social et croissance en Europe (XIe-XIVe si√®cle)\\" (Albin Michel 2012) historian of medieval labour Mathieu Arnoux devotes particular attention to \\"Piers Plowman\\" in a breakthrough attempt to identify theological causes for the growth of agricultural production from the 11th century to the 14th century. Related texts Many subsequent texts ‚Äì at least 14 ‚Äì use characters from Piers Plowman, most often Piers himself. Many more texts were written with similar themes and characters, though not directly borrowing from Piers Plowman, until around the end of the 16th century. Conversely, Piers Plowman was preceded by and contemporary with a number of similar works in the 14th and 15th centuries. Together, these are referred to as the \\"Piers Plowman tradition\\".

By compiling during execution, the system can tailor the generated code to reflect the program's run-time environment, and potentially produce more efficient code by exploiting information that is not available to a traditional static compiler. Uses Most dynamic recompilers are used to convert machine code between architectures at runtime. This is a task often needed in the emulation of legacy gaming platforms. In other cases, a system may employ dynamic recompilation as part of an adaptive optimization strategy to execute a portable program representation such as Java or .NET Common Language Runtime bytecodes. Full-speed debuggers also utilize dynamic recompilation to reduce the space overhead incurred in most deoptimization techniques, and other features such as dynamic thread migration. Tasks The main tasks a dynamic recompiler has to perform are: * Reading in machine code from the source platform * Emitting machine code for the target platform A dynamic recompiler may also perform some auxiliary tasks: * Managing a cache of recompiled code * Updating of elapsed cycle counts on platforms with cycle count registers * Management of interrupt checking * Providing an interface to virtualized support hardware, for example a GPU * Optimizing higher level code structures to run efficiently on the target hardware (see below) Example Suppose a program is being run in an emulator and needs to copy a null- terminated string. The program is compiled originally for a very simple processor. This processor can only copy a byte at a time, and must do so by first reading it from the source string into a register, then writing it from that register into the destination string. The original program might look something like this: beginning: mov A,[first string pointer] ; Put location of first character of source string ; in register A mov B,[second string pointer] ; Put location of second character of destination string ; in register B loop: mov C,[A] ; Copy byte at address in register A to register C mov [B],C ; Copy byte in register C to the address in register B inc A ; Increment the address in register A to point to ; the next byte inc B ; Increment the address in register B to point to ; the next byte cmp C,#0 ; Compare the data we just copied to 0 (string end marker) jnz loop ; If it wasn't 0 then we have more to copy, so go back ; and copy the next byte end: ; If we didn't loop then we must have finished, ; so carry on with something else. The emulator might be running on a processor which is similar, but extremely good at copying strings, and the emulator knows it can take advantage of this. It might recognize the string copy sequence of instructions and decide to rewrite them more efficiently just before execution, to speed up the emulation. Say there is an instruction on our new processor called movs, specifically designed to copy strings efficiently. Our theoretical movs instruction copies 16 bytes at a time, without having to load them into register C in between, but will stop if it copies a 0 byte (which marks the end of a string) and set the zero flag. It also knows that the addresses of the strings will be in registers A and B, so it increments A and B by 16 every time it executes, ready for the next copy. Our new recompiled code might look something like this: beginning: mov A,[first string pointer] ; Put location of first character of source string ; in register A mov B,[second string pointer] ; Put location of first character of destination string ; in register B loop: movs [B],[A] ; Copy 16 bytes at address in register A to address ; in register B, then increment A and B by 16 jnz loop ; If the zero flag isn't set then we haven't reached ; the end of the string, so go back and copy some more. end: ; If we didn't loop then we must have finished, ; so carry on with something else. There is an immediate speed benefit simply because the processor doesn't have to load so many instructions to do the same task, but also because the movs instruction is likely to be optimized by the processor designer to be more efficient than the sequence used in the first example. For example, it may make better use of parallel execution in the processor to increment A and B while it is still copying bytes.

(Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise). Guillaume Thomas Raynal (12 April 1713 ‚Äì 6 March 1796) was a French writer and man of letters during the Age of Enlightenment. Early life He was born at Lapanouse in Rouergue. He was educated at the Jesuit school of P√©zenas, and received priest's orders, but he was dismissed for unexplained reasons from the parish of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. He became a writer and journalist, leaving the religious order for life. The Abb√© Raynal wrote for the Mercure de France, and compiled a series of popular but superficial works, which he published and sold himself. These‚ÄîL'Histoire du stathoud√©rat (The Hague, 1748), L'Histoire du parlement d'Angleterre (London, 1748), Anecdotes historiques (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753)‚Äîgained for him access to the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Helv√©tius, and the Baron d'Holbach. In May 1754 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Histoire philosophique des deux Indes He had the assistance of various members of the philosophe c√¥teries in his most important work, L'Histoire philosophique et politique des √©tablissements et du commerce des Europ√©ens dans les deux Indes (Philosophical and Political History of the Two Indies Amsterdam, 4 vols., 1770). Diderot is credited with a third of this work, which was characterized by Voltaire as \\"du r√©chauff√© avec de la declamation.\\" The other chief collaborators were Pechm√©ja, Baron d'Holbach, Paulze, the farmer-general of taxes, the Abb√© Martin, and Alexandre Deleyre. To this piecemeal method of composition, in which narrative alternated with tirades on political and social questions, was added the further disadvantage of the lack of exact information, which, owing to the dearth of documents, could only have been gained by personal investigation. He released an expanded edition in 1774 and another in 1780. The \\"philosophic\\" declamations perhaps constituted its chief interest for the general public, and its significance as a contribution to democratic propaganda. The Histoire went through many editions, being revised and augmented from time to time by Raynal; it was translated into the principal European languages, and appeared in various abridgments. Its introduction into France was forbidden in 1779; the book was burned by the public executioner, and an order was given for the arrest of the author, whose name had not appeared in the first edition, but was printed on the title page of the Geneva edition of 1780. Seven new maps for the 1798 English edition were engraved by Thomas Kitchin, Jr. The book examines the East Indies, South America, the West Indies, and North America. The final chapter comprises theory around the future of Europe as a whole. Raynal also examines commerce, religion, slavery, and other popular subjects, all with a perspective from the French Enlightenment. Additional versions of the book included maps of the discussed regions. Later life Histoire philosophique, 1794. Raynal went into exile, to Spa, and then to Berlin, where he was coolly received by Frederick the Great, in spite of his connection with the philosophe party. At St. Petersburg he met with a more cordial reception from Catherine II, and in 1787 he was permitted to return to France, though not to Paris. He showed generosity in assigning a considerable income to be divided annually among the peasant proprietors of upper Guienne. He was elected by Marseilles to the States-general, but refused to sit on the score of age. Raynal now realized the impossibility of a peaceful revolution, and, in terror of the proceedings for which the writings of himself and his friends had prepared the way, he sent to the Constituent Assembly an address, which was read on 31 May 1791, deprecating the violence of its reforms. This address is said by Sainte-Beuve (Nouveaux lundis, xi.) to have been composed chiefly by Clermont Tonnerre and Pierre V. Malouet, and it was regarded, even by moderate men, as ill-timed. The published Lettre de l'abb√© Raynal a l'Assemblee nationale (10 December 1790) was really the work of the comte de Guibert. During the Terror Raynal lived in retirement at Passy and at Montlhery. On the establishment of the Directory in 1795 he became a member of the newly organized Institute of France. Raynal died 6 March 1796 at Chaillot. thumb Bibliography A detailed bibliography of his works and of those falsely attributed to him will be found in Qu√©rard's La France litt√©raire, and the same author's Supercheries d√©voil√©es. The biography by A Jay, prefixed to Peuchet's edition (Paris, 10 vols, 1820‚Äì1821) of the Histoire ... des Indes, is of small value.

He is equally well known for the works of literary criticism and contemporary novels published under his real name and for the crime fiction published under the pseudonym of Michael Innes. Life Stewart was born in Edinburgh, the son of Elizabeth (Eliza) Jane (n√©e Clark) and John Stewart of Nairn. His father was a lawyer and later the Director of Education for the City of Edinburgh. Stewart was educated at Edinburgh Academy from 1913 to 1924 and then studied English literature at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1928. At Oxford he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop Frazer's scholar. Using this, in 1929 he went to Vienna to study psychoanalysis. He was lecturer in English at the University of Leeds from 1930 to 1935 and then became Jury Professor of English in the University of Adelaide, South Australia. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick (d.1979). He returned to the United Kingdom to become Lecturer in English at the Queen's University of Belfast from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 he became a Student (equivalent of Fellow in other Oxford colleges) of Christ Church, Oxford. By the time of his retirement in 1973, he was a professor of the university. In 1990 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died at Coulsdon in south London on 12 November 1994. =Michael Innes= Between 1936 and 1986, Stewart, writing under the pseudonym of Michael Innes, published nearly fifty crime novels and short story collections, which he later described as \\"entertainments\\". These abound in literary allusions and in what critics have variously described as \\"mischievous wit\\", \\"exuberant fancy\\" and a \\"tongue-in-cheek propensity\\" for intriguing turns of phrase. Julian Symons identified Innes as one of the \\"farceurs\\"‚Äîcrime writers for whom the detective story was \\"an over-civilized joke with a frivolity which makes it a literary conversation piece with detection taking place on the side\\"‚Äîand described Innes's writing as being \\"rather in the manner of Peacock strained through or distorted by Aldous Huxley\\". His mysteries have also been described as combining \\"the elliptical introspection ... [of] a Jamesian character's speech, the intellectual precision of a Conradian description, and the amazing coincidences that mark any one of Hardy's plots\\".Rosenbaum, Jane, \\"Michael Innes\\", in The best-known of Innes's detective creations is Sir John Appleby, who is introduced in Death at the President's Lodging, in which he is a Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard. Appleby features in many of the later novels and short stories, in the course of which he rises to become Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Other novels feature portrait painter and Royal Academician, Charles Honeybath, an amateur but nonetheless effective sleuth. The two detectives meet in Appleby and Honeybath. Some of the later stories feature Appleby's son Bobby as sleuth. In 2007, his family transferred all the Innes copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. Literary rights are currently held by John Stewart Literary Management, and published by House of Stratus. Publications Stewart wrote several critical studies, including full-length studies of James Joyce, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Hardy, as well as many novels and short stories.

Topography  It is a former island, now peninsula, crossed by the Canal through Zuid-Beveland on the west and the Scheldt‚ÄìRhine Canal on the east. It consists of four municipalities: *Borsele *Goes *Kapelle *Reimerswaal Goes is Zuid-Beveland's principal urban center. Zuid-Beveland is a former island which was joined (together with Walcheren) to the mainland by a railway embankment in 1903 and to Noord-Beveland by the Delta Works. A shipping canal connecting the Belgian port of Antwerp with the Rhine River traverses Zuid-Beveland.  History  = Third and fourth centuries = This was the period during which most of Zeeland appears to have been submerged. The area was and for several centuries would remain almost unpeopled. = Middle Ages = During the eleventh century the area began to be drained, as little by little polders and channels were developed to protect the fields between them. Once drained, salt levels began to reduce and the soil became very fertile. Agriculture developed and prosperity grew. In the thirteenth century villages and towns began to appear. People lived chiefly from farming and fishing. The commercial centre of Zuid-Beveland was Goes, but Reimerswaal to the east, which later would be destroyed by floods also played an important role at this time. = The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries = As a result of the St. Felix's flood in November 1530, much of the island disappeared under water. Towns and villages were lost to what became known as the drowned land of Zuid-Beveland (Pays inond√© de Zuid-Beveland / Verdronken Land van Zuid-Beveland). The island was again badly impacted forty years later in November 1570 by the All Saints' Day Flood (Allerheiligenvloed / Inondations de la Toussaint). Between 1568 and 1648, during the course of what by its weary end had become the Eighty Years' War, the surviving lands of Zuid-Beveland were frequently in the military theatre of operations. = The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries = During most of this period the economy of the Netherlands slowed or contracted, with the exception of the agricultural sector. However, the region benefited from advances in transportation, connected in 1868 to Roosendaal by railroad with the inauguration of the Zeeland Line (la Zeeuwse Lijn: la ¬´Ligne z√©landaise¬ª), the Roosendaal‚ÄìVlissingen railway. In 1850 work began on the Zuid-Beveland Canal which linked the Western Scheldt and the Eastern Scheldt across a narrow neck of land in the east of the province. The construction in 1871 of the Sloedam, topped off with a roadway and a railway track, across the old Sloe Channel, connected Zuid-Beveland with Walcheren. = World War II = On 16 May 1940, heavy fighting occurred near Kapelle between German and French motorised troops, who came to the rescue of the Dutch. The next day 65 French soldiers were buried by the local people. After World War II every French soldier who was killed in the Netherlands during the war was brought to Kapelle. On 16 May 1950, the military cemetery on the edge of town was officially opened. 217 French soldiers, 20 Moroccan soldiers in French service and 1 Belgian soldier were buried there. The area was liberated by British and Canadians during the Battle of the Scheldt in November 1944. = The Flood of 1953 = In the night of 31 January and the morning of 1 February 1953 a heavy flood occurred in the southwest of the Netherlands, resulting in 1,836 deaths. Because of the relative high altitude, the most part of Zuid-Beveland (mainly the area of Goes) was relatively safe. In particular the eastern part of the peninsula suffered from floods. To prevent future floods, the Delta Works were started in 1950. As a side-effect, the connection with the rest of the country improved too.  Landscape and land-use  The soil primarily consists of (marine) clay. The landscape is dominated by dikes surrounding polders, due to recurring periods of floods and land reclamation. The main land-use is agricultural, of which consists primarily of crop cultivation and fruit orchards. Urban land-use is limited to the towns of Goes and Kapelle and several smaller towns and villages. Industrial activities are concentrated in the west of the peninsula (the Sloe area).  Economic activities  Agriculture, in particular crop cultivation, livestock breeding, aquaculture and fruit orchards are the economic mainstays. South Beveland specializes in the growing of wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and fruits and is also known for its fisheries and oyster culture. Zuid-Beveland is also home to Europe's largest greenhouse, located near Kapelle. The Zak van Zuid-Beveland (a large fruit orchard area) is Zuid-Beveland's main touristic attraction. In spring the blooming trees and the small-scale landscape make for a popular place for outdoor activities. The historic steam train from Goes to Borssele crosses this area. The many waters surrounding Zuid-Beveland are a popular place for water sports, in particular the Veerse Meer.  Transport  The main road in Zuid-Beveland is the motorway A58, connecting Flushing and Eindhoven. The highway A256/N256 connects the peninsula to the north (Noord-Beveland, Zierikzee and Rotterdam). The highway N62 is the connection to the south (Zeelandic Flanders and Belgium), by means of the Western Scheldt Tunnel: a tunnel under the Western Scheldt estuary between Ellewoutsdijk and Terneuzen. It is the longest tunnel for highway traffic in The Netherlands and replaced the former ferry between Kruiningen and Perkpolder 2003. More or less parallel to the motorway, a railroad connects Zuid-Beveland to Roosendaal, the Roosendaal‚ÄìVlissingen railway, with stations in (from west to east) Goes, Kapelle-Biezelinge, Kruiningen-Yerseke, Rilland-Bath and Krabbendijke. A cargo railroad connects the main railway with the industrial area Sloe, near Flushing. A historical steam train connects Goes and Hoedekenskerke, but this railroad nowadays only serves touristic purposes. The Western Scheldt is an important shipping route to the Port of Antwerp. The Canal through Zuid- Beveland connects the Western and Eastern Scheldt. The more eastern Scheldt‚ÄìRhine Canal connects Antwerp and the Volkerak. The Eastern Scheldt and Veerse Meer are popular with pleasure boats.

Gossypol is a phenolic aldehyde that permeates cells and acts as an inhibitor for several dehydrogenase enzymes. It is a yellow pigment. The structure exhibits axial chirality, with the two enantiomers having different biochemical properties. Among other applications, it has been tested as a male oral contraceptive in China. In addition to its putative contraceptive properties, gossypol has also long been known to possess antimalarial properties. Biosynthesis Gossypol is a terpenoid aldehyde which is formed metabolically through acetate via the isoprenoid pathway. The sesquiterpene dimer undergoes a radical coupling reaction to form gossypol. The biosynthesis begins when geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) are combined to make the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The cadinyl cation (1) is oxidized to 2 by (+)-Œ¥-cadinene synthase. The (+)-Œ¥-cadinene (2) is involved in making the basic aromatic sesquiterpene unit, homigossypol, by oxidation, which generates the 3 (8-hydroxy-Œ¥-cadinene) with the help of (+)-Œ¥-cadinene 8-hyroxylase. Compound 3 goes through various oxidative processes to make 4 (deoxyhemigossypol), which is oxidized by one electron into hemigossypol (5, 6, 7) and then undergoes a phenolic oxidative coupling, ortho to the phenol groups, to form gossypol (8). The coupling is catalyzed by a hydrogen peroxide-dependent peroxidase enzyme, which results in the final product. :500 px Research =Contraception= A 1929 investigation in Jiangxi showed correlation between low fertility in males and use of crude cottonseed oil for cooking. The compound causing the contraceptive effect was determined to be gossypol. In the 1970s, the Chinese government began researching the use of gossypol as a contraceptive. Their studies involved over 10,000 subjects, and continued for over a decade. They concluded gossypol provided reliable contraception, could be taken orally as a tablet, and did not upset men's balance of hormones. However, gossypol also had serious flaws. The studies also discovered an abnormally high rate of hypokalemia among subjects. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels) causes symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and at its most extreme, paralysis. In addition, about 7% of subjects reported effects on their digestive systems, and about 12% had increased fatigue. Most subjects recovered after stopping treatment and taking potassium supplements. The same study showed taking potassium supplements during gossypol treatment did not prevent hypokalemia in primates. The potassium deficiency may also be a result of the Chinese diet or genetic predisposition. In the mid-1990s, the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Hebron announced plans to market a low-dose gossypol pill called Nofertil, but the pill never came to market. Its release was indefinitely postponed due to unacceptably high rates of permanent infertility. 5% to 25% of the men remained azoospermic up to a year after stopping treatment. Researchers have suggested gossypol might make a good noninvasive alternative to surgical vasectomy. In 1998, the World Health Organization's Research Group on Methods for the Regulation of Male Fertility recommended the research should be abandoned. In addition to the other side effects, the WHO researchers were concerned about gossypol's toxicity: the in primates is less than 10 times the contraceptive dose, creating a small therapeutic window. This report effectively ended further studies of gossypol as a temporary contraceptive, but research into using it as an alternative to vasectomy continues in Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, and Nigeria. Toxicity  Food and animal agricultural industries must manage cotton-derivative product levels to avoid toxicity. For example, only ruminant microflora can digest gossypol, and then only to a certain level, and cottonseed oil must be refined. Genetically engineered cotton plants that contain little gossypol in the seed may still contain the compound in the stems and leaves.

The modules can be connected together with patch cords, a matrix patching system, or switches by the user to create a patch. The output (voltages) from the modules may function as (audio) signals, control voltages, or logic/timing conditions. Typical modules are oscillators (operate on frequency), filters (spectrum), amplifiers/gates (amplitude) and Envelope generators (dynamic control).  History  A Moog 55 (c. 1972 to c. 1981)The first modular synthesizer was developed by German engineer Harald Bode in the late 1950s. The 1960s saw the introduction of the Moog synthesizer and the Buchla Modular Electronic Music System, created around the same period. The Moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds, such as envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers,Pinch, Trevor; Trocco, Frank (2004). Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer. Harvard University Press. . connected by patch cords. The Japanese company Roland released the Roland System 100 in 1975, followed by the System 700 in 1976 and the System 100m in 1979. By the 1990s, modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper, smaller digital and software synthesizers. German engineer Dieter Doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds, and created the a new, smaller modular system, the Doepfer A-100. This led to a new standard for modular systems, Eurorack; as of 2017, over 100 companies, including Moog and Roland, were developing Eurorack modules.A Doepfer A-100 (1995 to present) EMS Synthi (VCS 3) II Latest F√©nix  Types of modules  The basic modular functions are: signal, control, logic/timing. Typically, inputs and outputs are an electric voltage. The difference between a synthesizer module and an effects unit is that an effects unit will have sockets for input and output of the audio signal and knobs or switches for the musician to control various parameters of the device (for example, the rate of a chorus pedal) while a synthesizer module may have sockets for input and output, but will also have sockets so that the device's parameters can be further controlled by other devices/modules (for example, to connect an external Low Frequency Oscillator to a delay module to get the chorus effect.) There exist many different types of modules. Modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs, outputs and controls, depending on their degree of complexity. Some examples include the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), which may have options for sync (hard or soft), linear or exponential frequency modulation, and variable waveshape; the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) that may have both resonance and bandwidth controls; and the Envelope Follower which may provide outputs at each stage of the process. Examples of more complex modules include the frequency shifter, sequencer, and vocoder. There are some standards which manufacturers followed for their range of physical synthesizers, such as 1V/octave control voltages, and gate / trigger thresholds providing general compatibility; however, connecting synthesizers from different manufacturers may require cables with different kinds of plugs. In the past, modular synthesizers were often bulky and expensive. Due to the continuously variable nature of knobs and sliders, reproducing an exact patch can be difficult or next to impossible. In the late 1970s, modular synthesizers started to be largely supplanted in pop music by highly integrated keyboard synthesizers, racks of MIDI-connected gear, and samplers. However, there continued to be a community who chose the physically patched approach, the flexibility and the sound of traditional modular systems. Since the late 1990s, there has been a resurgence in the popularity of analog synthesizers aided by physical standardization practices, an increase in 'retro' gear and interest, decreased production costs and increased electronic reliability and stability, the rediscovered ability of modules to control things other than sound, and a generally heightened education through the development of virtual synthesis systems such as VCV Rack, MAX/MSP, Pd and Reaktor etc. = Typical modules = Modules can usually be categorized as either sources or processors Austin, Kevin. \\"A Generalized Introduction to Modular Analogue Synthesis Concepts.\\" eContact! 17.4 ¬ã Analogue and Modular Synthesis: Resurgence and evolution (February 2016). Montr√©al: CEC. Some standard modules found on almost any modular synthesizer are: Sources - characterized by an output, but no signal input; it may have control inputs: * VCO ‚Äì Voltage-controlled oscillator, a continuous voltage source, which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings. In its basic form these may be simple waveforms (most usually a square wave or a sawtooth wave, but also includes pulse, triangle and sine waves), however these can be dynamically changed through such controls as sync, frequency modulation, and self-modulation. * Noise source - A source that outputs a random voltage. Common types of noise offered by modular synthesizers include white, pink, and low frequency noise. * LFO - A low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled. It may be operated with a period anywhere from a fortieth of a second to several minutes. It is generally used as a control voltage for another module. For example, modulating a VCO will produce frequency modulation, and may create vibrato, while modulating a VCA will produce amplitude modulation, and may create tremolo, depending on the control frequency. The rectangular wave can be used as a logic / timing / trigger function. * EG - An envelope generator is a transient voltage source. A trigger in the presence of a gate, applied to an envelope generator produces a single, shaped voltage. Often configured as ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) it provides a transient voltage that rises and falls. It can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger in the presence of a gate. Usually it controls the amplitude of a VCA or the cutoff frequency of a VCF, but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the envelope generator to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the VCO. Simpler EGs (AD or AR) or more complex (DADSR‚ÄîDelay, Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) are sometimes available. * Sequencer, also sometimes called an Analog Step Sequencer, is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor, see also below. As a source, depending upon the configuration, it may produce a sequence of voltages, usually set by adjusting values on front panel knobs. The sequencer may also output a trigger, and/or gate, at each step (stage). Sequencers are stepped by a trigger being applied to the trigger input. Designs may allow for stepping forwards or backwards, oscillating patterns, random order, or only using a limited number of stages. An example of an analog sequencer and controller with this level of complexity is the Doepfer A-154, A-155 combination. Processors - characterized by a signal input and an output; it may have control inputs: * VCF - Voltage-controlled filter, which attenuates frequencies below (high-pass), above (low-pass) or both below and above (band- pass) a certain frequency. VCFs can also be configured to provide band-reject (notch), whereby the high and low frequencies remain while the middle frequencies are attenuated. Most VCFs have variable resonance, sometimes voltage-controlled. * VCA - Voltage-controlled amplifier, is usually a unity- gain amplifier which varies the amplitude of a signal in response to an applied control voltage. The response curve may be linear or exponential. Also called a two-quadrant multiplier. * LPG - Low pass gate, is a compound module, similar to a VCA and a VCF, except that the circuit uses a resistive opto- isolator (vactrol) to respond to the control voltage, which also filters the sound as it amplifies, allowing more high frequency information through at higher amplifications. * RM - Ring modulator - Two audio inputs are utilized to create sum and difference frequencies while suppressing the original signals. Also called a four-quadrant multiplier or balanced modulator. * Mixer - A module that adds voltages. * Slew limiter - Is usually a sub-audio lowpass filter. When used in a control voltage path to an oscillator, this can be used to create glide or portamento between frequencies. * S&H; \\\\- Sample and hold, is usually used as a control-voltage processor. Depending upon the design, usually an ascending edge (trigger), captures the value of the voltage at the input, and outputs this voltage until the trigger input reads another voltage and repeats the process. * Sequencer, (see also above), as a processor, may have a signal input into each step, (location or stage), which is output, when stepped to. An example of this type of sequencer is the Doepfer A-155. * Custom control inputs - It is possible to connect any kind of voltage to a modular synthesizer as long as it remains in the usable voltage range of the instrument, usually -15V to +15V. Modern manufacturers of modular hardware synthesizers (alphabetical) Hardware offerings range from complete systems in cases to kits for hobbyist DIY constructors. Many manufacturers augment their range with products based on recent re-designs of classic modules; often both the original and subsequent reworked designs are available free on the internet, the original patents having lapsed. Many hobbyist designers also make available bare PCB boards and front panels for sale to other hobbyists. * Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments (formerly Buchla & Associates) * Doepfer Musikelektronik (A-100) * Monde Synthesizer * Moog Music (formerly Big Briar, formerly Moog) * Synthesis Technology * PAiA Electronics * Analogue Systems * Sound Transform Systems * Studio Electronics * Synthesizers.com * Synton Fenix * Tangible Waves (AE Modular) Technical specifications =Form Factors= Many early synthesizer modules had modules with height in integer inches: 11\\" (e.g., Roland 700), 10\\" (e.g., Wavemakers), 9\\" (e.g., Aries), 8\\" (e.g., ARP 2500), 7\\" (e.g., Polyfusion, Buchla, Serge), 6\\" (e.g., Emu) and width in 1/4\\" inch multiples. More recently it has become more popular to follow the standard 19\\" Rack unit system: 6U (Wiard), 5U (8.75\\" e.g., Moog/Modcan), 4U (e.g., Serge), 3U (Eurorack). Two 3U unit standards in particular are notable: Frac Rack (e.g., Paia), which uses the entire 3U for the front panel, and Eurorack (e.g., Doepfer) which has a 2mm horizontal lip that the front panels are seated between. Further minor variations exist where European or Japanese manufacturers round a U measurement up or down to some closer convenient metric equivalent; for example the common 5U modules are exactly 8.75\\" (222.25mm), but non-American manufacturers may prefer 220mm or 230mm. = Electrical = Other differences are in the plugs used, which can match 1/4-inch or 6.3mm jacks, 3.5mm jacks, banana jacks, or breadboard patch leadshttps://www.tangiblewaves.com/, in the main power supply, which is most often ¬±12 Vhttp://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm or ¬±15 V, but can range from 2.5¬±2.5 Vhttps://www.tangiblewaves.com/diy-info.html to 0¬±18 V for different manufacturers or systems, in the trigger or gate voltages (Moog S-trigger or positive gate), with typical audio signal levels (often ¬±5 V with ¬±5 V headroom), and with control voltages of volts/octave (typically 1 V/octave, but in some cases 1.2 V/octave.) Most analog modular systems use a system in which the frequency is exponentially related to the pitch (such as 1 volt/octave or 1.2 volts/octave), sometimes called \\"linear\\" because the human ear perceives frequencies in a logarithmic fashion, with each octave having the same perceptual size; some synthesizers (such as Korg MS-20, ETI 4600) use a volts/hertz system, where the frequency (but not the perceived pitch) is linear in the voltage. Modular software synthesizers (alphabetical) There are also software synthesizers for personal computers which are organized as interconnectable modules. Many of these are virtual analog synthesizers, where the modules simulate hardware functionality. Some of them are also virtual modular systems, which simulate real historical modular synthesizers. * AudioMulch * Arturia Modular V * Bidule * ChucK * CreamwareAudio Modular III * Csound * Doepfer * MaxMSP * Moog Model 15 * Kyma * Pure Data * Reaktor * SunVox * SuperCollider * SynFactory * VCV Rack * Wren for Windows (open- source) Computers have grown so powerful and inexpensive that software programs can realistically model the signals, sounds, and patchability of modulars very well. While potentially lacking the physical presence of desirable analog sound generation, real voltage manipulation, knobs, sliders, cables, and LEDs, software modular synthesizers offer the infinite variations and visual patching at a more affordable price and in a compact form factor. The popular plugin formats such as VST may be combined in a modular fashion. Semi-modular synthesizers A compact semi-modular synthesiser A modular synthesizer has a case or frame into which arbitrary modules can be fitted; modules are usually connected together using patch cords and a system may include modules from different sources, as long as it fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications. A semi-modular synthesizer on the other hand is a collection of modules from a single manufacturer that makes a cohesive product, an instrument. Modules may not be swapped out and usually a typical configuration has been pre-wired. The ‚Äúmodules‚Äù are typically not separable and may physically be parts of a contiguous circuit board. However, the manufacturer provides mechanisms to allow the user to connect modules in different orders and often to connect external components or modules (chosen and supplied by the user) between those of the instrument. = Matrix Systems = Matrix systems use pin matrices or other crosspoint switches rather than patch cords. The ARP 2500 was the first synthesizer to used a fixed switch matrix. The pin matrix was made popular in the EMS VCS-3 and its descendants like the EMS Synthi 100. Other systems include the ETI International 4600, and the Maplin 5600. In digital times the clean logical layout of these matrices has inspired a number of manufacturers like Arturia to include digitally programmable matrices in their analog or virtual analog synthesizers. Many fully digital synthesizers, like the Alesis Ion, make use of the logic and nomenclature of a \\"modulation matrix\\", even when the graphical layout of a hardware matrix is completely absent. =Patch Override Systems= The different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration, but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords. Some examples are the ARP 2600, Anyware Instruments Semtex, Cwejman S1, EML101, Evenfall Minimodular, Future Retro XS, Korg MS-10, MS-20, MS-50, PS-3100, PS-3200 and PS-3300, Mungo Enterprises State Zero, Roland System 100 and Moog Mother-32 . =Electronically Reconfigurable Systems= Reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders. Examples include the Oberheim Matrix and Rhodes Chroma, and Moog Voyager. Hybrid modular synthesizers Hybrid synthesizers use hardware and software combination.

For example, English speakers traveling in France may be struck by the number of words used in French that look similar to English, but which do not exist in English, such as baby-foot, or baby-parc. This is different from a false friend, which is a word that does exist in English, but with different main meanings in English and in the other language. Definition and terminology There have been a few spellings, and many definitions proposed for pseudo-anglicism. Sometimes it is written as two words, sometimes as a hyphenated word, and sometimes as a single word without the hyphen. The 'A' is sometimes capitalized. Several other terms have been used, such as \\"secondary anglicism,\\" \\"false anglicism,\\" and \\"pseudo-English\\" is heard as well. In discussing lexical borrowing (and also translation), academic works will often refer to source language or donor language, and the receptor language or recipient language and may use SL and RL as abbreviations. In the case of anglicisms and loanwords from English, the source language is English, and the receptor language is the foreign language borrowing the English word or semantic elements. Some German works even refer to these concepts using the English terms, untranslated. Numerous definitions have been proposed. Many researchers quote David Duckworth, who wrote that pseudo-anglicisms are \\"German neologisms derived from English language material.\\" Furiassi's is broader and includes words that may exist in English, though only with a \\"conspicuously different meaning\\". Typology and mechanism Pseudo- anglicisms can be created in various ways, such as by archaism, i.e., words which once had that meaning in English but are since abandoned; semantic slide, where an English word is used incorrectly to mean something else; conversion of existing words from one part of speech to another; or recombinations by reshuffling English units. Onysko speaks of two types: pseudo-anglicisms and hybrid anglicisms. The common factor is that each type represents a neologism in the receptor language resulting from a combination of borrowed lexical items from English. Using German as the receptor language, an example of the first type is Wellfit-Bar, a combination of two English lexical units to form a new term in German, which does not exist in English, and which carries the meaning, \\"a bar that caters to the needs of health- starved people.\\" An example of the second type, is a hybrid based on a German compound word, Weitsprung (long jump), plus the English 'coach', to create the new German word Weitsprung-Coach. According to Filipoviƒá, pseudoanglicisms can be formed through composition, derivation, or ellipsis. Composition in Serbo- Croatian involves creating a new compound from an English word to which is added the word man, as in the example, \\"GOAL\\" + man, giving golman. In derivation, a suffix -er or -ist is added to an anglicism, to create a new word in Serbo-Croatian, such as teniser, or waterpolist. An ellipsis drops something, and starts from a compound and drops a component, or from a derivative and drops -ing, as in boks from \\"boxing\\", or \\"hepiend\\" from \\"happy ending\\". Another process of word formation that can result in a pseudo- anglicism is a blend word, consisting of portions of two words, like brunch or smog. Rey-Debove & Gagnon attest tansad in French in 1919, from English tan[dem] + sad[dle].

Toguri called herself \\"Orphan Ann\\", but she quickly became inaccurately identified with the name \\"Tokyo Rose\\", coined by Allied soldiers and which predated her broadcasts. After the Japanese surrender, Toguri was detained for a year by the United States military before being released for lack of evidence. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were \\"innocuous\\", but when Toguri tried to return to the U.S. a popular uproar ensued, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to renew its investigation of Toguri's wartime activities. She was subsequently charged by the United States Attorney's Office with eight counts of treason. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one count, for which she spent more than six years out of a ten-year sentence in prison. Journalistic and governmental investigators years later pieced together the history of irregularities with the indictment, trial, and conviction, including confessions from key witnesses who had perjured themselves at the various stages of their testimonies. Toguri received a pardon in 1977 from U.S. President Gerald Ford. Early life was born in Los Angeles, a daughter of Japanese immigrants. Her father, Jun Toguri, had come to the U.S. in 1899, and her mother, Fumi, in 1913. Iva was a Girl Scout, and was raised as a Christian. She began grammar schools in Mexico and San Diego before returning with her family to complete her education in Los Angeles, where she also attended high school. Toguri graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1940 with a degree in zoology. In 1940, she registered to vote as a Republican. On July 5, 1941, Toguri sailed for Japan from the San Pedro, Los Angeles area, to visit an ailing relative. The U.S. State Department issued her a Certificate of Identification; she did not have a passport. In August, Toguri applied to the U.S. Vice Consul in Japan for a passport, stating she wished to return to her home in the U.S. Her request was forwarded to the State Department, but following the attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941), the State Department refused to certify her citizenship in 1942. The Zero Hour Toguri in December 1944 at Radio Tokyo Toguri was pressured to renounce her United States citizenship by the Japanese central government with the beginning of American involvement in the Pacific War, like a number of other Americans in Japanese territory. She refused to do so, and was subsequently declared an enemy alien and was refused a war ration card. To support herself, she found work as a typist at a Japanese news agency and eventually worked in a similar capacity for Radio Tokyo. In November 1943, Allied prisoners of war were forced to broadcast propaganda, and they selected her to host portions of the one-hour radio show The Zero Hour. Her producer was Australian Army Major Charles Cousens, who had pre-war broadcast experience and had been captured at the Fall of Singapore. Cousens had been coerced to work on radio broadcasts, and worked with assistants U.S. Army Captain Wallace Ince and Philippine Army Lieutenant Normando Ildefonso \\"Norman\\" Reyes. Toguri had previously risked her life smuggling food into the nearby prisoner of war camp where Cousens and Ince were held, gaining the inmates' trust. Toguri refused to broadcast anti- American propaganda, but she was assured by Major Cousens and Captain Ince that they would not write scripts having her say anything against the United States. True to their word, no such propaganda was found in her broadcasts. In fact, after she went on air in November 1943, she and Cousens tried to make a farce of the broadcasts. The Japanese propaganda officials had little feel for their nuance and double entendres. Film of Iva Toguri D'Aquino and an unidentified announcer recreating propaganda broadcasts Toguri performed in comedy sketches and introduced recorded music, but never participated in any newscasts, with on-air speaking time of generally about 2‚Äì3 minutes. She earned only 150 yen per month, or about $7, but she used some of her earnings to feed POWs, smuggling food in as she did before.Siemaszko, Corky. (2006) \\"Still not Tokyo Rose: Long free, at 90, she's imprisoned by a myth,\\" New York Daily News (July 4), see , accessed 2 November 2015. She aimed most of her comments toward her fellow Americans (\\"my fellow orphans\\"), using American slang and playing American music. At no time did Toguri call herself \\"Tokyo Rose\\" during the war, and there was no evidence that any other broadcaster had done so. The name was a catch-all used by Allied forces for all of the women who were heard on Japanese propaganda radio and was in general use by the summer of 1943, months prior to Toguri's debut as a broadcast host. Toguri hosted about 340 broadcasts of The Zero Hour under the stage names \\"Ann\\" (for \\"Announcer\\") and later \\"Orphan Annie\\", in reference to the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie. In April 1945, Toguri married Felipe D'Aquino, a Portuguese citizen of part-Japanese descent she'd met at the radio station, and became Iva Toguri D'Aquino. Postwar arrest and trial =Arrest= Toguri being interviewed by the press in September 1945 After Japan's surrender (August 15, 1945), reporters Harry T. Brundidge of Cosmopolitan Magazine and Clark Lee of Hearst's International News Service (INS) offered $2,000 (the equivalent of a year's wages in Occupied Japan) for an exclusive interview with \\"Tokyo Rose\\".Clark Lee, One last look around, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1947, p. 84 ff. Toguri was in need of money and was still trying to get home, so she stepped forward to accept the offer, but instead found herself arrested on September 5, 1945, in Yokohama. Brundidge reneged on the interview payment and tried to sell his transcript of the interview as Toguri's \\"confession\\". She was released after a year in prison when neither the FBI nor General Douglas MacArthur's staff found any evidence that she had aided the Japanese Axis forces. The American and Australian prisoners of war who wrote her scripts told her and the Allied headquarters that she had committed no wrongdoing. The case history at the FBI's website states, \\"The FBI's investigation of [D'Aquino's] activities had covered a period of some five years. During the course of that investigation, the FBI had interviewed hundreds of former members of the U.S. Armed Forces who had served in the South Pacific during World War II, unearthed forgotten Japanese documents, and turned up recordings of [D'Aquino's] broadcasts.\\" Investigating with the U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps, they \\"conducted an extensive investigation to determine whether [D'Aquino] had committed crimes against the U.S. By the following October, authorities decided that the evidence then known did not merit prosecution, and she was released\\". She requested to return to the United States to have her child born on American soil, but influential gossip columnist and radio host Walter Winchell lobbied against her. Her baby was born in Japan but died shortly after. Following her child's death, D'Aquino was rearrested by the U.S. military authorities and transported to San Francisco on September 25, 1948, where she was charged by federal prosecutors with the crime of treason for \\"adhering to, and giving aid and comfort to, the Imperial Government of Japan during World War II\\". =Treason trial= FBI synopsis of trial D'Aquino's trial on eight \\"overt acts\\" of treason began on July 5, 1949, at the Federal District Court in San Francisco. It was the costliest and longest trial in American history at the time. D'Aquino was defended by a team of attorneys led by Wayne Mortimer Collins, a prominent advocate of Japanese-American rights. Collins enlisted the help of Theodore Tamba, who became one of D'Aquino's closest friends, a relationship which continued until his death in 1973. One of the defense witnesses was Charles Cousens, who himself had been acquitted of treason by Australian authorities in November 1946. On September 29, 1949, the jury found D'Aquino guilty on a single charge: Count VI, which stated, \\"That on a day during October, 1944, the exact date being to the Grand Jurors unknown, said defendant, at Tokyo, Japan, in a broadcasting studio of The Broadcasting Corporation of Japan, did speak into a microphone concerning the loss of ships.\\" She was fined $10,000 and given a 10-year prison sentence, with Toguri's attorney Collins lambasting the verdict as \\"Guilty without evidence\\". She was sent to the Federal Reformatory for Women at Alderson, West Virginia. She was paroled after serving six years and two months, released January 28, 1956, and moved to Chicago, Illinois. The FBI's case history notes, \\"Neither Brundidge nor the [suborned] witness [Hiromu Yagi] testified at trial because of the taint of perjury. Nor was Brundidge prosecuted for subornation of perjury.\\" Presidential pardon The case against D'Aquino was fraught with historic difficulties. Grand jurors had been skeptical of the government's case. Tom DeWolfe, the Special Assistant Attorney General, was \\"a veteran of radio treason prosecutions\\" who complained that \\"it was necessary for me to practically make a fourth of July speech in order to obtain [an] indictment\\", leading him to urge the Department of Justice to further investigate and so \\"shore up\\" the case in Japan. The further work, however, \\"created new problems for DeWolfe\\", and soon after D'Aquino was indicted, government witness Hiromu Yagi \\"admitted that his grand jury testimony was perjured\\". In 1976, an investigation by Chicago Tribune reporter Ron Yates discovered that Kenkichi Oki and George Mitsushio, who had given the most damaging testimony at D'Aquino's trial, had perjured themselves. They stated that FBI and U.S. occupation police had coached them for over two months about what they were to say on the stand, and had been threatened with treason trials themselves if they didn't cooperate. This was followed up by a Morley Safer report on the television news program 60 Minutes. U.S. President Gerald Ford granted a full and unconditional pardon to Iva Toguri D'Aquino in 1977 based on these and earlier issues with the indictment, trial, and conviction,‚Äîon January 19, his last full day in office. The decision was supported by a unanimous vote in both houses of the California State Legislature, by the national Japanese American Citizens League, and by S. I. Hayakawa, then a United States Senator from California. The pardon restored her U.S. citizenship, which had been abrogated as a result of her conviction. In 1980, she reluctantly divorced Felipe, as a result of him being repeatedly denied admission into the United States. Later life On January 15, 2006, the World War II Veterans Committee awarded Toguri its annual Edward J. Herlihy Citizenship Award, citing \\"her indomitable spirit, love of country, and the example of courage she has given her fellow Americans\\". According to one biographer, Toguri found it the most memorable day of her life. Toguri died of natural causes in a Chicago hospital on September 26, 2006, at the age of 90. In popular culture =Movies and documentaries= Iva Toguri has been the subject of two movies and five documentaries: * 1946: Tokyo Rose, film; directed by Lew Landers. Lotus Long played a heavily fictionalized \\"Tokyo Rose\\", described on the film's posters as a \\"seductive jap traitress\\"; Byron Barr played the G.I. protagonist who kidnaps the Japanese announcer. Blake Edwards appeared in a supporting part. The film espoused the general public's view of \\"Tokyo Rose\\" at the time of Toguri's arrest. The film's character was not referred to by her actual name, but Long was made to look like Toguri. * 1969: The Story of \\"Tokyo Rose\\", CBS-TV and WGN radio documentary written and produced by Bill Kurtis. * 1976: Tokyo Rose, CBS-TV documentary segment on 60 Minutes by Morley Safer. * 1995: U.S.A. vs. \\"Tokyo Rose\\", self-produced documentary by Antonio A.

The investigation of the origins of this recording documents the involvement of self-serving reporter Harry T. Brundidge and his part in the fraudulent case against her.

E. Housman's poems from A Shropshire Lad. Early years Blue plaque commemorating Butterworth's childhood home in Driffield Terrace, York Butterworth was born in Paddington, London.England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes, General Register Office, volume 1a, p. 27 Soon after his birth, his family moved to York so that his father Sir Alexander Kaye Butterworth could take up an appointment as general manager of the North Eastern Railway, which was based there. Their home was at Riseholme, a house on Driffield Terrace, which later became part of the Mount School. In 2016, the centenary year of his death on the Somme, biographer Anthony Murphy unveiled on behalf of the York Civic Trust a blue plaque to his memory at College House, Driffield Terrace, part of the Mount School. George received his first music lessons from his mother, who was a singer, and he began composing at an early age. As a young boy, he played the organ for services in the chapel of his preparatory school, Aysgarth School, before gaining a scholarship to Eton College.Census Returns of England and Wales (1901), RGO13; Piece:1342, Folio 66, p. 47. He showed early musical promise at Eton, a \\"Barcarolle\\" for orchestra being played during his time there (it is long since lost).Barlow, Michael, preface to three volumes of Butterworth's music, Musikproduktion J√ºrgen H√∂flich, Munich 2006 & 2007 Butterworth then went up to Trinity College, Oxford, where he became more focused on music, becoming President of the University Music Club. He also made friends with the folk song collector Cecil Sharp; the composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams; the future Director of the Royal College of Music, Hugh Allen; and a baritone and future conductor, Adrian Boult. Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs (Butterworth collected over 450 himself, many in Sussex in 1907, and sometimes using a phonograph) and the compositions of both were strongly influenced by what they collected. Butterworth was also an expert folk dancer, being particularly keen in the art of morris dancing. He was employed for a while by the English Folk Dance and Song Society (of which he was a founder member in 1906) as a professional morris dancer, and was a member of the Demonstration Team. Upon leaving Oxford, Butterworth began a career in music, writing criticism for The Times, composing, and teaching at Radley College, Oxfordshire. He also briefly studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music, where he worked with Hubert Parry among others, though he stayed less than a year as the academic life was not for him. Vaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends. It was Butterworth who suggested to Vaughan Williams that he turn a symphonic poem he was working on into his London Symphony. Vaughan Williams recalled: > We were talking together one day when he said in his gruff, abrupt manner: > ‚ÄòYou know, you ought to write a symphony‚Äô. I answered...that I‚Äôd never > written a symphony and never intended to...I suppose Butterworth‚Äôs words > stung me and, anyhow, I looked out some sketches I had made for...a > symphonic poem about London and decided to throw it into symphonic > form...From that moment, the idea of a symphony dominated my mind. I showed > the sketches to George bit by bit as they were finished, and it was then > that I realised that he possessed in common with very few composers a > wonderful power of criticism of other men‚Äôs work and insight into their > ideas and motives. I can never feel too grateful to him for all he did for > me over this work and his help did not stop short at criticism.Lloyd, > Stephen, in Ralph Vaughan Williams in Perspective, ed. Lewis Foreman, Albion > Music Ltd, 1998; the quoted text is a portmanteau of two originals, the bulk > being from a letter to Sir Alexander Butterworth, father of the composer When the manuscript for that piece was lost (having been sent to Germany, either to the conductor Fritz Busch or for engraving, just before the outbreak of war), Butterworth, together with Geoffrey Toye and the critic Edward J. Dent, helped Vaughan Williams reconstruct the work.Mann, William, liner notes to EMI CD CDM 7 64017 2, 1987 Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworth's memory after his death. First World War Memorial to George Butterworth at the Pozi√®res Memorial, inscribed: Plaque, Deerhurst Church At the outbreak of the First World War, Butterworth, together with several of his friends, including Geoffrey Toye and R. O. Morris, joined the British Army as a private in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, but he soon accepted a commission as a subaltern (2nd Lieutenant) in the 13th Battalion Durham Light Infantry, and he was later temporarily promoted to lieutenant. He was known as G. S. Kaye-Butterworth in the Army. Butterworth's letters are full of admiration for the ordinary miners of County Durham who served in his platoon. As part of 23rd Division, the 13th DLI was sent into action to capture the western approaches of the village of Contalmaison on The Somme. Butterworth and his men succeeded in capturing a series of trenches near Pozi√®res on 16‚Äì17 July 1916, the traces of which can still be found within a small wood. Butterworth was slightly wounded in the action. For his action Temporary Lt. George Butterworth, aged 31, was awarded the Military Cross, gazetted 25 August 1916, though he did not live to receive it.London Gazette supplement 25 August 1916 \\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. After his captain had been wounded, Butterworth commanded his company with great ability and coolness, and with his energy and utter disregard of danger he set a fine example on the front line. His name had previously been brought to notice for good and gallant work.\\" The Battle of the Somme was now entering its most intense phase. On 4 August, 23rd Division was ordered to attack a communications trench known as Munster Alley that was in German hands. The soldiers dug an assault trench and named it 'Butterworth Trench' in their officer's honour. In desperate fighting during the night of 4‚Äì5 August, and despite friendly fire from Australian artillery, Butterworth and his miners captured and held on to Munster Alley, albeit with heavy losses. At 04:45 on 5 August, amid frantic German attempts to recapture the position, Butterworth was shot through the head by a sniper. His body was hastily buried by his men in the side of the trench, but was never recovered for formal reburial following the fierce bombardments of the final two years of conflict. When his brigade commander, Brigadier General Page Croft, wrote to Butterworth's father to inform him of his death, it transpired that he had not known that his son had been awarded the Military Cross. Similarly, the brigadier was astonished to learn that Butterworth had been one of the most promising English composers of his generation. Brigadier Croft wrote that Butterworth was \\"A brilliant musician in times of peace, and an equally brilliant soldier in times of stress.\\" There is confusion about exactly what award(s) Butterworth received. It is said that he won the MC twice, but this is incorrect. This misunderstanding may have arisen because Butterworth's bravery was regularly in evidence during the Somme campaign. Firstly, he was mentioned in despatches early in July, and was then recommended for the MC \\"for conspicuous gallantry in action\\" on 9 July at Bailiff Wood, then again ‚Äì successfully ‚Äì \\"for commanding his company with great ability and coolness\\" when wounded on 16‚Äì17 July. Brigadier Page-Croft also mentioned to Butterworth's father that he had 'won' the medal again on the night he died. However, the Military Cross was not awarded posthumously at the time, and so he could never have been awarded it twice. Butterworth's body was never recovered (although his unidentified remains may well lie at nearby Pozi√®res Memorial, a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery), and his name appears on the Thiepval Memorial. George Butterworth's The Banks of Green Willow has become synonymous for some with the sacrifice of his generation and has been seen by some as an anthem for all 'Unknown Soldiers'. Sir Alexander Butterworth erected a plaque at St Mary's Priory Church, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire in memory of his son and of his nephew, Hugh, who died at Loos in 1915. (The Rev. George Butterworth, the composer's grandfather, had been vicar of St Mary's in the previous century.) Sir Alexander also arranged the printing in 1918 of a memorial volume in his son's memory. Almost all Butterworth's manuscripts were left to Vaughan Williams, after whose death Ursula Vaughan Williams lodged the original works in the Bodleian, Oxford, and the folk song collection with the EFDSS. A Shropshire Lad, and other compositions Butterworth did not write a great deal of music, and before and during the war he destroyed many works he did not care for, lest he should not return and have the chance to revise them. Of those that survive, his works based on A. E. Housman's collection of poems A Shropshire Lad are among the best known. Many English composers of Butterworth's time set Housman's poetry, including Ralph Vaughan Williams. In 1911 and 1912, Butterworth wrote eleven settings of Housman's poems from A Shropshire Lad. The poems are: # \\"Loveliest of Trees\\" # \\"When I Was One and Twenty\\" # \\"Look Not in My Eyes\\" # \\"Think No More, Lad\\" # \\"The Lads in Their Hundreds\\" # \\"Is My Team Ploughing?\\" # \\"Bredon Hill\\" # \\"Oh Fair Enough Are Sky and Plain\\" # \\"When the Lad for Longing Sighs\\" # \\"On the Idle Hill of Summer\\" # \\"With Rue My Heart Is Laden\\" He used no known folk tunes in the songs, although one (\\"When I Was One and Twenty\\") was said to be based on a folk tune that has defied identification. The songs were dedicated to Victor Annesley Barrington-Kennett, a friend from Eton and Oxford, who was also to die in France in 1916. They were eventually published in two sets, Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad (1‚Äì6 above) and Bredon Hill and Other Songs (7‚Äì11), although the composer never settled on a preferred order. Nine of the songs were first performed at a meeting of the Oxford University Musical Club, organised by Boult. The singer was James Campbell McInnes, with the composer at the piano. Shortly thereafter Boult sang several of the songs at a private function. At this stage, Butterworth still had not completed \\"On the idle hill of summer\\" and did not do so until he was living at Cheyne Gardens in London. It is unusual for the songs to be given publicly in full, although each of the published sets is often performed separately and recorded regularly ‚Äì in fact, they can be said to be among the most frequently performed English art songs.Hall, George, booklet notes to Deutsche Grammophon CD 445946-2 Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad is the more popular set, with \\"Is My Team Ploughing?\\" being the most famous song. Another, \\"Loveliest of Trees\\", is the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody, also called A Shropshire Lad, which quotes two songs from the whole ‚Äì \\"Loveliest of Trees\\" and \\"With Rue My Heart Is Laden\\". The parallel is regularly madeStone, Mark, booklet notes to Stone Records CD 5060192780024 between the often gloomy and death-obsessed subject matter of A Shropshire Lad, written in the shadow of the Second Boer War, and Butterworth's subsequent death during the Great War. In particular, the song \\"The lads in their hundreds\\" tells of young men who leave their homeland to 'die in their glory and never be old'. The Rhapsody, A Shropshire Lad ‚Äì a sort of postlude to the songs ‚Äì employs a normal sized symphony orchestra, and was first performed on 2 October 1913 at the Leeds Festival, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was influential upon Vaughan Williams (A Pastoral Symphony), Gerald Finzi (A Severn Rhapsody) and Ernest Moeran (First Rhapsody). Butterworth's other orchestral works are short and based on folksongs he had collected in Sussex in 1907: Two English Idylls (1911) and The Banks of Green Willow (1913). They are often performed and recorded, Banks particularly so. The latter work was premiered by the 24-year-old Adrian Boult on 27 February 1914, at West Kirby, Wirral, (this was in fact Boult's very first professional concert). Love Blows As the Wind Blows is a setting of poems by W. E. Henley. It exists in three forms: for voice and string quartet, voice and piano and voice and small orchestra. The orchestral version differs from the others quite markedly, not least in having only three songs: \\"In the Year That's Come and Gone\\", \\"Life in Her Creaking Shoes\\", and \\"On the Way to Kew\\" (the other versions include \\"Fill a Glass with Golden Wine\\"). The orchestral version was in fact the last music Butterworth worked on before leaving for France, and shows the composer's familiarity with Vaughan Williams' style, as well as with the music of Wagner, Elgar and Debussy. Butterworth showed real talent that might have flourished but for his early death. The Two English Idylls and The Banks of Green Willow show an ability to handle folk song in a way that eluded many other composers ‚Äì as the true building blocks of larger forms. His original music (especially the Rhapsody: A Shropshire Lad and the orchestral song cycle Love Blows As The Wind Blows) have a delicacy that brings to mind Debussy or Ibert. However, there is reasonable evidence that he had put composition behind him by the time he went to France, and it is by no means certain that he would have resumed it had he returned. It is certainly likely that he would have faced considerable pressure from friends to compose again, since his orchestral works (particularly the Rhapsody: A Shropshire Lad) had made a great impression, but he was a single-minded man who was unlikely to bow easily to such pressure.Banfield, Stephen, Sensibility and English Song, 1985, Cambridge University Press, p. 153 He remains perhaps the most obvious case of \\"what if...?\\" that is left to us from the battlefields of northern France, and he joins the Frenchman Alb√©ric Magnard, the Spaniard Enrique Granados, and the German Rudi Stephan as possibly the greatest losses to music from the First World War. The great conductor Carlos Kleiber saw in Butterworth a special gift. In his 1978 appearance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra he programmed, to the surprise of many, Butterworth's English Idyll No. 1.

The programs were broadcast in the South Pacific and North America to demoralize Allied forces abroad and their families at home by emphasizing troops' wartime difficulties and military losses.Berg, Jerome S. The Early Shortwave Stations: A Broadcasting History Through 1945. Jefferson: McFarland, 2013. CREDO Reference. Web. Retrieved 5 March 2017. p.205. Several female broadcasters operated using different aliases and in different cities throughout the Empire, including Tokyo, Manila, and Shanghai. The name \\"Tokyo Rose\\" was never actually used by any Japanese broadcaster,Kushner, Barak. \\"Tokyo Rose.\\" Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present. Ed. Nicholas John Cull, et al. 2003. Credo Reference. Accessed 05 Mar 2017. but it first appeared in U.S. newspapers in the context of these radio programs during 1943. During the war, Tokyo Rose was not any one individual, but rather a group of largely unassociated women working for the same propagandist effort throughout the Japanese Empire. In the years soon after the war, the character \\"Tokyo Rose\\" ‚Äì whom the FBI now avers to be \\"mythical\\" ‚Äì became an important symbol of Japanese villainy for the United States. American cartoons, movies, and propaganda videos between 1945 and 1960 tend to portray her as sexualized, manipulative, and deadly to American interests in the South Pacific, particularly by revealing intelligence of American losses in radio broadcasts. Similar accusations concern the propaganda broadcasts of Lord Haw-Haw and Axis Sally, and in 1949 the San Francisco Chronicle described Tokyo Rose as the \\"Mata Hari of radio.\\"Stanton Delaplane, 'Tokyo Rose on Trial: \\"Bribery\\" Comes up, but it's Ruled out of Court', San Francisco Chronicle, 16 July 1949, p. 3. Tokyo Rose ceased to be merely a symbol during September 1945 when Iva Toguri D'Aquino, a Japanese-American disc jockey for a propagandist radio program, attempted to return to the United States. Toguri was accused of being the \\"real\\" Tokyo Rose, arrested, tried, and became the seventh person in U.S. history to be convicted of treason. Toguri was eventually paroled from prison in 1956, but it was more than 20 years later that she received an official presidential pardon for her role in the war. Iva Toguri and The Zero Hour Although she broadcast using the name \\"Orphan Ann,\\" Iva Toguri has been known as \\"Tokyo Rose\\" since her return to the United States in 1945. An American citizen and the daughter of Japanese immigrants, Toguri traveled to Japan to tend to a sick aunt just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Unable to leave the country when war began with the United States, unable to stay with her aunt's family as an American citizen, and unable to receive any aid from her parents who were placed in internment camps in Arizona, Toguri eventually accepted a job as a part-time typist at Radio Tokyo (NHK). She was quickly recruited as a broadcaster for the 75-minute propagandist program The Zero Hour, which consisted of skits, news reports, and popular American music. According to studies conducted during 1968, of the 94 men who were interviewed and who recalled listening to The Zero Hour while serving in the Pacific, 89% recognized it as \\"propaganda\\", and less than 10% felt \\"demoralized\\" by it. 84% of the men listened because the program had \\"good entertainment,\\" and one GI remarked, \\"[l]ots of us thought she was on our side all along.\\" After World War II ended in 1945, the U.S. military detained Toguri for a year before releasing her due to lack of evidence. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were \\"innocuous\\". But when Toguri tried to return to the United States, an uproar ensued because Walter Winchell (a powerful broadcasting personality) and the American Legion lobbied relentlessly for a trial, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to renew its investigation of Toguri's wartime activities. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one of eight counts of treason. In 1974, investigative journalists found that important witnesses had asserted that they were forced to lie during testimony. They stated that FBI and U.S. occupation police had coached them for more than two months about what they should say on the stand, and that they had been threatened with treason trials themselves if they didn't cooperate. U.S. President Gerald Ford pardoned Toguri in 1977 based on these revelations and earlier issues with the indictment. Tokyo Mose Walter Kaner (May 5, 1920 ‚Äì June 27, 2005) was a journalist and radio personality who broadcast using the name Tokyo Mose during and after World War II. Kaner broadcast on US Army Radio, at first to offer comic rejoinders to the propaganda broadcasts of Tokyo Rose and then as a parody to entertain U.S. troops abroad. In U.S.-occupied Japan, his \\"Moshi, Moshi Ano-ne\\" jingle was sung to the tune of \\"London Bridge is Falling Down\\" and became so popular with Japanese children and GIs that the army newspaper called it \\"the Japanese occupation theme song.\\" In 1946, Elsa Maxwell referred to Kaner as \\"the breath of home to unknown thousands of our young men when they were lonely.\\" Popular culture Tokyo Rose has been the subject of songs, movies, and documentaries: *1945: Tokyo Woes, propaganda cartoon directed by Bob Clampett featuring Seaman Hook.

It is presently located within the boundaries of the Flat Census Designated Place, which has no residents as of 2010. History The town of Iditarod was named after the Iditarod River. Iditarod comes from the Athabascan word Haidilatna.Allan Curtis, \\"Iditarod's Newspapers: Optimist, Nugget, Pioneer\\" Alaska Journal 6 no.2 (Spring 1976) 78-83. On Christmas Day 1908, prospectors John Beaton and W.A. \\"Bill\\" Dikeman found gold on Otter Creek, a tributary to the Iditarod River. News of the find spread, and in the summer of 1909 miners arrived in the gold fields and built a small camp that was later known as Flat. People and supplies traveled to the gold fields by boat from the Yukon River, up the Innoko River, and up the Iditarod River to the current town site, a short walk from Flat. More gold was discovered, and a massive stampede headed for Flat in 1910. The steamboat Tanana arrived June 1, 1910, and the city of Iditarod was founded as a head of navigation for all the surrounding gold fields, including Flat, Discovery, Otter, Dikeman, and Willow Creek. Iditarod quickly became a bustling boomtown, with hotels, caf√©s, brothels, three newspapers (only one would last the year), a Miners and Merchants Bank, a mercantile store, electricity, telephones, automobiles, and a light railway to Flat. By 1930 the gold was gone and most of the miners had moved to Flat, taking many of the buildings with them. Iditarod is now a ghost town. Only one cabin and a handful of ruins remain, including the concrete bank vault from the Miners and Merchants Bank. There is no remnant of the bank structure. Demographics Iditarod first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an incorporated city of just 50 residents, as the boom had already played out. In 1931, it was disincorporated, leaving just a single resident by 1940. It did not report again on the census after that. However, the area was included in the census designated place of Flat beginning in 2000, but with the departure of their remaining residents, the population is now back to zero.

The dombyra shares certain characteristics with the komuz and dutar, such as its long, thin neck and oblong body shape. It is a popular instrument among Turkic communities in Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia. Varieties The instrument differs slightly in different regions. The Kazakh dombyra has frets and is played by strumming with the hand or plucking each string individually, with an occasional tap on the main surface of the instrument. While the strings are traditionally made of sinew, modern dombras are usually produced using nylon strings. One of the greatest dombra players was the Kazakh folk musician and composer Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, who had a major influence on the development of Kazakh musical culture, including music for the dombra; his musical composition \\"Adai\\" is popular in Kazakhstan and abroad. In 2012, the elektrodombyra was created.–î—É—Ö –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –°—Ç–µ–ø–∏ ‚Äî –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–¥–æ–º–±—Ä–∞ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –∫–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–µ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏—á—å –≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–Ω —Ä–æ–∫- —á–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ –≤ –°–®–ê The Turkestani and Badakhshani are fretless with a body and neck carved from a single block of wood, usually mulberry or apricot. The is played with much banging and scratching on the instrument to help give a percussive sound. The two strings are made of nylon (in modern times) or gut. They cross a short bridge to a pin at the other end of the body. There is a tiny sound hole in the back of the instrument, while the top is thick wood. It is not finished with any varnish, filing/sanding of any kind, and as with all other Turkic instruments there is some decoration. The dumbyra is the equivalent instrument of the Volga Tatars and Bashkirs. A performer strikes all the strings at the same time. The upper string performs the bourdon tone and the lower string performs the melody. A is used as a solo as well as an ensemble instrument.  History  The dombyra first appeared in the Middle Ages. For example, the works of Aby Nasyr Al-Farabi refer to a tambur-like musical instrument similar to the dombyra. An instrument similar to the Dombyra existed in almost every country in Central Asia. Within the last century, there have been many great composers and Dombyra players, such as Kurmangazy, Kazangap, and Tattimbet. The importance of the dombra in the culture of Kazakhstan was marked by initiating the Dombra Day in 2018. The National Dombra Day is celebrated in Kazakhstan every first Sunday of July. Dombra in ensemble and epic performance Playing the dombra The Kazakh poet Abay Qunanbayuli is often shown holding a dombra at rest and many hold it in high regard as a symbol of nationalism among the post-Soviet nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The dombra is played by Erzhan Alimbetov in the Ulytau band. From the 12th to the 18th century, the was used by Bashkir to accompany their poetic legends and . It is mentioned in the epic poem \\"Zayatulyak and Hiuhiliu\\". However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the was forgotten.

This instrument has become a part of an Internet phenomenon after a video clip from SuperStar KZ, the Kazakh equivalent of the Idol series, was posted on YouTube. The video includes two contestants singing and a third one singing and playing the dombra (Ernar Kaldynov), which caused the popularity. The name of the original song is Freestailo by R.Lizer, a Kazakh man. Dombyra as an instrument is being popularized through Dombyra Parties, a flash mob-like movement of Kazakh youth organized via social media.

It offers training from the undergraduate to the doctoral level in all aspects of Western Music including performance, composition, conducting, music theory and history. The RCM also undertakes research, with particular strengths in performance practice and performance science. The college is one of the four conservatories of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music and a member of Conservatoires UK. Its buildings are directly opposite the Royal Albert Hall on Prince Consort Road, next to Imperial College and among the museums and cultural centres of Albertopolis. History =Background= The college was founded in 1883 to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful National Training School for Music (NTSM). The school was the result of an earlier proposal by the Prince Consort to provide free musical training to winners of scholarships under a nationwide scheme. After many years' delay it was established in 1876, with Arthur Sullivan as its principal. Conservatoires to train young students for a musical career had been set up in major European cities, but in London the long-established Royal Academy of Music had not supplied suitable training for professional musicians: in 1870 it was estimated that fewer than ten per cent of instrumentalists in London orchestras had studied at the academy.Wright, David \\"The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century\\", Journal of the Royal Musical Association, Vol. 130, No. 2 (2005), pp. 236‚Äì282 The NTSM's aim, summarised in its founding charter, was: The school was housed in a new building in Kensington Gore, opposite the west side of the Royal Albert Hall. The building was not large, having only 18 practice rooms and no concert hall. In a 2005 study of the NTSM and its replacement by the RCM, David Wright observes that the building is \\"more suggestive of a young ladies' finishing school than a place for the serious training of professional musicians\\". Under Sullivan, a reluctant and ineffectual principal, the NTSM failed to provide a satisfactory alternative to the Royal Academy and, by 1880, a committee of examiners comprising Charles Hall√©, Sir Julius Benedict, Sir Michael Costa, Henry Leslie and Otto Goldschmidt reported that the school lacked \\"executive cohesion\\". The following year Sullivan resigned and was replaced by John Stainer. In his 2005 study of the NTSM, Wright comments: Even before the 1880 report, it had become clear that the NTSM would not fulfil the role of national music conservatoire. As early as 13 July 1878, a meeting was held at Marlborough House, London under the presidency of the Prince of Wales, \\"for the purpose of taking into consideration the advancement of the art of music and establishing a college of music on a permanent and more extended basis than that of any existing institution\\". The original plan was to merge the Royal Academy of Music and the National Training School of Music into a single, enhanced organisation. The NTSM agreed, but after prolonged negotiations, the Royal Academy refused to enter into the proposed scheme.\\"The Proposed College for Music\\", The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, Vol. 23, No. 467 (January 1882), pp. 17‚Äì18 In 1881, with George Grove as a leading instigator and with the support of the Prince of Wales, a draft charter was drawn up for a successor body to the NTSM. The Royal College of Music occupied the premises previously home to the NTSM and opened there on 7 May 1883. Grove was appointed its first director.\\"Royal College of Music\\", The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, Vol. 24, No. 484 (June 1883), pp. 309‚Äì310 There were 50 scholars elected by competition and 42 fee-paying students.Rainbow, Bernarr and Anthony Kemp. \\"London ‚Äì Educational establishments\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 4 January 2012 =Early years= Grove, a close friend of Sullivan, loyally maintained that the new college was a natural evolution from the NTSM. In reality, his aims were radically different from Sullivan's. In his determination that the new institution should succeed as a training ground for orchestral players, Grove had two principal allies: the violinist Henry Holmes and the composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford. They believed that a capable college orchestra would not only benefit instrumental students, but would give students of composition the essential chance to experience the sound of their music. The college's first intake of scholarship students included 28 who studied an orchestral instrument. The potential strength of the college orchestra, including fee-paying instrumental students, was 33 violins, five violas, six cellos, one double bass, one flute, one oboe and two horns. Grove appointed 12 professors of orchestral instruments, in addition to distinguished teachers in other musical disciplines including Jenny Lind (singing), Hubert Parry (composition), Ernst Pauer (piano), Arabella Goddard (piano) and Walter Parratt (organ). Front fa√ßade of the Royal College of Music The old premises proved restrictive and a new building was commissioned in the early 1890s on a new site in Prince Consort Road, South Kensington. The building was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield in Flemish Mannerist style in red brick dressed with buff-coloured Welden stone.\\"State opening of the Royal College of Music\\", Musical Times, 35 (1 June 1894:390); the style was reported as \\"Renaissance, freely treated\\" Construction began in 1892 and the building opened in May 1894.The date 1892 on a tablet in the peak of the central pavilion. The formal opening was in May 1894. The building was largely paid for by two large donations from Samson Fox, a Yorkshire industrialist, whose statue, along with that of the Prince of Wales, stands in the entrance hall. Grove retired at the end of 1894 and was succeeded as director by Hubert Parry.Young, Percy M. \\"Grove, Sir George (1820‚Äì1900)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006 accessed 2 November 2010 =Later history= Parry died in 1918 and was succeeded as director by Sir Hugh Allen (1919‚Äì37), Sir George Dyson (1938‚Äì52), Sir Ernest Bullock (1953‚Äì59), Sir Keith Falkner (1960‚Äì74), Sir David Willcocks (1974‚Äì84), Michael Gough Mathews (1985‚Äì93), Dame Janet Ritterman (1993‚Äì2005) and Colin Lawson (2005‚Äì).\\"Royal College of Music: Director\\", AIM 25, accessed 6 January 2012 In addition to the college's permanent staff, faculty members at 2012 included well-known musicians such as Dmitri Alexeev, Barry Douglas, H√•kan Hardenberger, John Lill, Colin Matthews, Sir Roger Norrington, Mark- Anthony Turnage, Roger Vignoles and principals of the major London orchestras including the London Symphony, BBC Symphony, London Philharmonic, Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestras.\\"Faculties\\", Royal College of Music prospectus 2012, accessed 6 January 2012 Since its founding in 1882, the college has been linked with the British royal family.

The college is a registered charity under English law. Curriculum The college teaches all aspects of Western classical music from undergraduate to doctoral level. There is a junior department, where 300 children aged 8 to 18 are educated on Saturdays. Partnership Since August 2011, RCM has been collaborating with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore, offering a Bachelor of Music (Hons) Degree jointly conferred by both institutions. Performance venues The RCM's main concert venue is the Amaryllis Fleming Concert Hall: a 468-seat barrel-vaulted concert hall designed by Blomfield, built in 1901 and extensively restored in 2008‚Äì09. The Britten Theatre, which seats 400, was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 and is used for opera, ballet, music and theatre. There is also a 150-seat recital hall dating from 1965, as well as several smaller recital rooms, including three organ-equipped Parry Rooms.  The Royal College of Music Museum  Alfred Schnittke by Reginald Gray The Royal College of Music Museum, forming part of the centre for performance history, houses a collection of more than 800 musical instruments and accessories from circa 1480 to the present. Included in the collection is a clavicytherium that is the world's oldest surviving keyboard instrument. The museum's displays include musical instruments, portraits, sculptures, photographs and engravings related to music. Admission is free. Owing partly to the vision of its founders, particularly Grove, the RCM holds significant research collections of material dating from the fifteenth century onwards. These include autographs such as Haydn's String Quartet Op. 64/1, Mozart's Piano Concerto K491 and Elgar's Cello Concerto. More extensive collections feature the music of Herbert Howells, Frank Bridge and Malcolm Arnold and film scores by Stanley Myers. Among more than 300 original portraits are John Cawse's 1826 painting of Weber (the last of the composer), Haydn by Thomas Hardy (1791) and Bartolommeo Nazari's painting of Farinelli at the height of his fame. A recent addition to the collection is a portrait of the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke by Reginald Gray. 10,000 prints and photographs constitute the most substantial archive of images of musicians in the UK. The RCM's 600,000 concert programmes document concert life from 1730 to the present day. Coleridge-Taylor, Holst, Vaughan Williams and Ireland Alumni and faculty Since opening in 1882, the college has had a distinguished list of teachers and alumni, including most of the composers who brought about the \\"English Musical Renaissance\\" of the 19th and 20th centuries.

He is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute. He is also a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute and a supporter of the effective altruism movement, and has received donations from Elon Musk to investigate existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence.The Future of Computers is the Mind of a Toddler, Bloomberg Biography =Early life= Tegmark was born in Sweden to Karin Tegmark and American-born professor of mathematics Harold S. Shapiro, with his father's surname.Sveriges befolkning 1980, CD-ROM, Version 1.02, Sveriges Sl√§ktforskarf√∂rbund (2004). While in high school, Tegmark and a friend created and sold a word processor written in pure machine code for the Swedish eight-bit computer ABC 80, and a 3D Tetris-like game called Frac. Tegmark left Sweden in 1990 after receiving his B.Sc. in Physics from the Royal Institute of Technology. (He had earned a B.A. in Economics the previous year at the Stockholm School of Economics.) His first academic venture beyond Scandinavia brought him to California, where he studied physics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning his M.A. in 1992, and Ph.D. in 1994 under the supervision of Joseph Silk. He worked as an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania receiving tenure in 2003. In 2004, he joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Physics. =Career= His research has focused on cosmology, combining theoretical work with new measurements to place constraints on cosmological models and their free parameters, often in collaboration with experimentalists. He has over 200 publications, of which nine have been cited over 500 times. He has developed data analysis tools based on information theory and applied them to cosmic microwave background experiments such as COBE, QMAP, and WMAP, and to galaxy redshift surveys such as the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, the 2dF Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With Daniel Eisenstein and Wayne Hu, he introduced the idea of using baryon acoustic oscillations as a standard ruler. With Angelica de Oliveira-Costa and Andrew Hamilton, he discovered the anomalous multipole alignment in the WMAP data sometimes referred to as the \\"axis of evil\\". With Anthony Aguirre, he developed the cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics. His 2000 paper on quantum decoherence of neurons concluded that decoherence seems too rapid for Roger Penrose's \\"quantum microtubule\\" model of consciousness to be viable. Tegmark has also formulated the \\"Ultimate Ensemble theory of everything\\", whose only postulate is that \\"all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically\\". This simple theory, with no free parameters at all, suggests that in those structures complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs), these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically \\"real\\" world. This idea is formalized as the mathematical universe hypothesis, a short version of which is available at Shut up and calculate. (in reference to David Mermin's famous quote \\"shut up and calculate\\" described in his book Our Mathematical Universe. Tegmark was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012 for, according to the citation, \\"his contributions to cosmology, including precision measurements from cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering data, tests of inflation and gravitation theories, and the development of a new technology for low-frequency radio interferometry\\".APS Archive (1990-present) He was awarded the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science's Gold Medal in 2019 for, according to the citation, \\"his contributions to our understanding of humanity‚Äôs place in the cosmos and the opportunities and risks associated with artificial intelligence. He has courageously tackled these existential questions in his research and, in a commendable way, succeeded in communicating the issues to a wider public.\\" Tegmark is interviewed in the 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence Do You Trust This Computer? He is also known for his seminal paper on the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, in which he claims that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure with an infinite number of initial random conditions. He points to fractals as proof that the equations used to describe all possible mathematical multiverses would fit on a single T-shirt. =Personal life= He married astrophysicist Angelica de Oliveira-Costa in 1997, and divorced in 2009.

It is jointly coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC. As with its predecessors, the system is primarily designed to allow the president to address the country via all radio and television stations, in the event of a national emergency. Despite this, neither the system nor its predecessors have been used in this manner, due to the ubiquity of news coverage in these situations. In practice, it is more commonly used to distribute information regarding imminent threats to public safety, such as severe weather situations (including flash floods and tornadoes), AMBER Alerts of child abductions, and other civil emergencies. Authorized organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through EAS. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is used as a backend to distribute alert information via EAS and related technologies such as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), using Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). EAS messages are transmitted primarily via terrestrial and satellite radio and television (including broadcast and multichannel television), which are required to participate in the system. Technical concept Messages in the EAS are composed of four parts: a digitally encoded Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) header, an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker. A Sage EAS ENDEC unit The is the most critical part of the EAS design. It contains information about who originated the alert (the president, state or local authorities, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), or the broadcaster), a short, general description of the event (tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 32 counties or states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was issued (in UTC), and an identification of the originating station (see SAME for a complete breakdown of the header). There are 77 radio stations designated as National Primary Stations in the Primary Entry Point (PEP) System to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems. The Emergency Action Notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the United States or their designee will deliver a message over the EAS via the PEP system. The government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes. =Primary Entry Point stations= The National Public Warning System, also known as the Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations, are a network of 77 radio stations that are, in coordination with FEMA, used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, and after incidents and disasters. PEP stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event. Beginning with WJR/Detroit and WLW/Cincinnati in 2016, FEMA began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 PEP stations, which feature broadcasting equipment, emergency provisions, a rest area, and an air filtration system. NPWS project manager Manny Centeno explained that these shelters were designed to \\"[expand] the survival of these stations to include an all hazards platform, which means chemical, biological, radiological air protection and protection from electromagnetic pulse.\\" =Communication links= The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) \\"Provides Primary Entry Point service to the Emergency Alert System\\", and acts as an emergency presidential link into the EAS. The FNARS net control station is located at the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. Once an EAN is received by an EAS participant from a PEP station (or any other participant) the message then \\"daisy chains'\\" through the network of participants. \\"Daisy chains\\" form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations. This process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system. Each EAS participant is required to monitor at least two other participants. =EAS header= Because the header lacks error detection codes, it is repeated three times for redundancy. EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster). The SAME header bursts are followed by an attention tone, which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is on a NOAA Weather Radio station. On commercial broadcast stations, a attention signal of 853 Hz and 960 Hz sine waves is used instead, the same signal used by the older Emergency Broadcast System. These tones have become infamous, and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers; in fact, the two tones, which form approximately the interval of a just major second at an unusually high pitch, were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention, due to their unpleasantness on the human ear. The SAME header is equally known for its shrillness, which many have found to be startling. The \\"two-tone\\" system is no longer required as of 1998, and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages. Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert. The message ends with 3 bursts of the AFSK \\"EOM\\", or End of Message, which is the text \`NNNN\`, preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration. = IPAWS = A Gorman-Redlich rack mounted CAP-to-EAS converter which translates CAP formatted alerts into SAME headers. Under a 2006 executive order issued by George W. Bush, the U.S. government was instructed to create \\"an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive\\" public warning system. This was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned PEP network, and the development of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)‚Äîa national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the XML-based Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) and an internet network. IPAWS can be used to distribute alert information to EAS participants, supported mobile phones (Wireless Emergency Alerts), and other platforms. Under an FCC report and order issued in 2007, EAS participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting CAP within 180 days of the specification's adoption by FEMA. This officially occurred September 30, 2010, but the deadline was later delayed to June 30, 2012 at the request of broadcasters. The FCC has established that IPAWS is not a full substitute for the existing SAME protocol, as it is vulnerable to situations that may make internet connectivity unavailable. Therefore, broadcasters must convert CAP messages to legacy SAME headers to enable backwards compatibility with the existing \\"daisy chain\\" method of EAS distribution, providing a backup distribution path. Station requirements The FCC requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD), hereafter \\"EAS participants\\", to install and maintain FCC-certified EAS decoders and encoders at their control points or headends. These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages. For reliability, at least two source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated local primary. Participants are to retain the latest version of the EAS handbook. EAS participants are required by federal law to relay Emergency Action Notification (EAN) messages immediately (47 CFR Part 11.54). Broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather, and child abduction emergencies (AMBER Alerts) if they so choose (in practice, severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station's local news operation and on-air meteorologists, rather than processed through EAS). EAS participants are required to keep logs of all received messages. Logs may be kept by hand but are usually kept automatically by a small receipt printer in the encoder/decoder unit. Logs may also be kept electronically inside the unit as long as there is access to an external printer or method to transfer them to a computer. In addition to the audio messages transmitted by radio stations, television stations must broadcast a visual display containing the originator, event, location, time period,47 C.F.R. ¬ß 11.51(D) and any extended text that is contained within the associated CAP message. System tests All EAS equipment must be tested on a weekly basis. The required weekly test (RWT) consists, at a minimum, of the header and end-of-message tones. Though an RWT does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test, many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public. In addition, television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests. RWTs are scheduled by the station on random days and times, (though quite often during late night or early afternoon hours), and are generally not relayed. A Required Monthly Test (RMT) transmitted in New Jersey on April 15, 2014 as shown on a television set Required monthly tests (RMTs) are generally originated by the local or state primary station, a state emergency management agency, or by the National Weather Service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels. RMTs must be performed between 8:30 a.m. and local sunset during odd numbered months, and between local sunset and 8:30 a.m. during even numbered months. Received monthly tests must be retransmitted within 60 minutes of receipt. Additionally, an RMT should not be scheduled or conducted during an event of great importance such as a pre-announced presidential speech, coverage of a national/local election, major local or national news coverage outside regularly scheduled newscast hours or a major national sporting event such as the Super Bowl or World Series, with other events such as the Indianapolis 500 and Olympic Games mentioned in individual EAS state plans. An RWT is not required during a calendar week in which an RMT is scheduled. No testing has to be done during a calendar week in which all parts of the EAS (header burst, attention signal, audio message, and end of message burst) have been legitimately activated. In July 2018, in response to the aftermath of the false missile alert in Hawaii earlier in the year (which was caused by operator error during an internal drill protocol), the FCC announced that it would take steps to promote public awareness and improve efficiency of the system, including requiring safeguards to prevent distribution of false alarms, the ability to authorize \\"live code\\" tests‚Äîwhich would simulate the process and response to an actual emergency, and authorizations to use the EAS tones in public service announcements that promote awareness of the system. =National periodic tests= On February 3, 2011, the FCC announced plans and procedures for national EAS tests, which involve all television and radio stations connected to the EAS, as well as all cable and satellite services in the United States. They are not relayed on the NOAA Weather Radio (NOAA/NWS) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the PEP network. The national test would transmit and relay an Emergency Action Notification on November 9, 2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST. The FCC found that only half of participants received the message via IPAWS, and some \\"failed to receive or retransmit alerts due to erroneous equipment configuration, equipment readiness and upkeep issues, and confusion regarding EAS rules and technical requirements\\", and that participation among low-power broadcasters was low. To reduce viewer confusion, the FCC stated that future national tests would be delivered under the new event code \\"National Periodic Test\\" (\\"NPT\\"), and list \\"United States\\" as its location. A second national test, now classified as an NPT, occurred on September 28, 2016 as part of National Preparedness Month. A third national periodic test occurred on September 27, 2017. The fourth NPT occurred on October 3, 2018 (delayed from September 20, 2018 due to Hurricane Florence). It was preceded by the first mandatory wireless emergency alert test. The fifth NPT occurred on August 7, 2019, moved up from past years to prevent it from occurring during the heart of the Atlantic hurricane season. The test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network, in order to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event that the internet cannot be used. The 2020 NPT was postponed to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic \\"out of consideration for the unusual circumstances and working conditions for those in the broadcast and cable industry.\\" Additions and proposals The number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty. At first, all but three of the events (civil emergency message, immediate evacuation, and emergency action notification [national emergency]) were weather-related (such as a tornado warning). Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the AMBER Alert System for child abduction emergencies. In 2016, three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events, including Extreme Wind Warning (EWW), Storm Surge Warning (SSW) and Storm Surge Watch (SSA). In 2004, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on whether EAS in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the American public of an emergency and, if not, on how EAS can be improved, such as mandatory text messages to cellphones, regardless of subscription. As noted above, rules implemented by the FCC on July 12, 2007 provisionally endorse incorporating CAP with the SAME protocol. In 2018, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz proposed the Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act; alongside proposing that FEMA create best practices for EAS usage and false alarms (the latter in response to the Hawaii false missile alert), it would have required that certain types of alerts receive repeat broadcasts in order to ensure that viewers receive the alert. EAS for consumers The EAS is designed to be useful for the entire public, not just those with SAME-capable equipment. However, several consumer-level radios do exist, especially weather radio receivers, which are available to the public through both mail-order and retailers. Other specialty receivers for AM/FM/ACSSB (LM) are available only through mail-order, or in some places from federal, state, or local governments, especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a chemical factory. These radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies, often with a direct link back to the plant's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise. The ability to narrow messages down so that only the actual area in danger is alerted is extremely helpful in preventing false warnings, which was previously a major tune-out factor. Instead of sounding for all warnings within a station's area, SAME-decoder radios now sound only for the counties for which they are programmed. When the alarm sounds, anyone with the radio knows that the danger is nearby and protective action should be taken. For this reason, the goal of the National Weather Service is that each home should have both a smoke detector and a SAME weather radio. Limitations The EAS can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming; as the intent of an Emergency Action Notification is to serve as a \\"last-ditch effort to get a message out if the [p]resident cannot get to the media\\", it can easily be made redundant by the immediate and constant coverage that major weather events and other newsworthy situations‚Äîsuch as, most prominently, the September 11 attacks in 2001‚Äîreceive from television broadcasters and news channels. Following the attacks, then-FCC chairman Michael K. Powell cited \\"the ubiquitous media environment\\" as justification for not using the EAS in their immediate aftermath. Glenn Collins of The New York Times acknowledged these limitations, noting that \\"no president has ever used the current [EAS] system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years, despite the Soviet missile crisis, a presidential assassination, the Oklahoma City bombing, major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings\\", and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets. Following the tornado outbreak of March 3, 2019, Birmingham, Alabama NWS meteorologist Kevin Laws told CNN that he, personally, wished that alerts could be updated in real-time in order to reflect the unpredictable nature of weather events ‚Äìnoting that the storm system's unexpected change in trajectory towards Lee County resulted in only a nine-minute warning (the resulting tornado would kill 23 people). The trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of streaming video services would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information (notwithstanding availability of alerts on mobile phones). Incidents = False alarms = * On February 1, 2005 in Connecticut, an alert was mistakenly issued calling for the immediate evacuation of the entire state. The alert contained no specific detail on why it had been issued. The message was broadcast due to operator error while conducting an unannounced, but scheduled statewide test. A study conducted following the incident reported that at least 11% of residents actually saw the warning live, and that 63% of those surveyed were \\"a little or not at all concerned\\"‚Äîciting a suspicious lack of detail in the message, which a legitimate alert would include. Only 1% of those surveyed actually attempted to leave the state. Connecticut State Police did not receive any calls related to the incident. * On June 26, 2007 at 7:35 a.m. CDT, an Emergency Action Notification was accidentally issued in the state of Illinois, when a new satellite receiver at the state's EOC was accidentally connected to a live system before final internal testing of the new delivery path had been completed. The alert was followed by dead air, and then audio from designated station 720 WGN in Chicago being simulcast across almost every television and radio station in the Chicago area and throughout much of Illinois. A confused Spike O'Dell, host of the station's morning show at the time, was heard on-air wondering \\"what that beeping was all about\\". * On May 19, 2010, NOAA Weather Radio and CSEPP tone alert radios in the Hermiston, Oregon area, near the Umatilla Chemical Depot, were activated with an EAS alert shortly after 5 p.m. The message transmitted was for a severe thunderstorm warning, issued by the National Weather Service in Pendleton, but the transmission broadcast instead was a long period of silence, followed by a few words in Spanish. Umatilla County Emergency Management has stressed there was no emergency at the depot. * On September 3, 2016, in the wake of Tropical Storm Hermine, an alert was displayed on television calling for the immediate evacuation of the entirety of Suffolk County, abruptly ending with the incomplete sentence \\"This is an emergency message from\\". About 15 minutes after the original message was sent, the alert was re-issued with an addendum clarifying that the alert was actually calling for a voluntary evacuation of Fire Island‚Äîa barrier island of Long Island. Officials cited an error in the county's Code Red system; while the correct message was entered into the system, an error processing an abbreviated message for television resulted in the error. * On August 15, 2017 at approximately 12:25 a.m. local time, Guam stations KTWG and KSTO transmitted a civil danger warning for the island; Guam Homeland Security described the message, which interrupted programming on the stations, and was received on television by some viewers, as being an \\"unauthorized test\\" of the EAS. The incident's impact was strengthened, as North Korea had threatened the launch of ballistic missiles towards Guam only a few days beforehand. Numerous calls to 911 operators and the Department of Homeland Security were made following the broadcast. false alarm was issued warning of a missile threat to Hawaii. * On January 13, 2018 at approximately 8:07 a.m. local time, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA) mistakenly issued an emergency alert warning of a ballistic missile inbound threatening the region, which was claimed to be not a drill. 38 minutes later, it was announced by HI-EMA and the Honolulu Police Department that the alert was a false alarm. The incident came amidst heightened concern over the possibility that Hawaii could be targeted by North Korean missiles (in December 2017, Hawaii tested its missile sirens for the first time since the Cold War). HI-EMA administrator Vern Miyagi stated that the incident was a \\"mistake made during a standard procedure at the change over of a shift\\". = Cybersecurity breaches = On several notable occasions, EAS equipment became the subject of hacks by outside entities due to poor security measures, including poor firewalls, and use of insecure or unchanged default passwords on encoder hardware. * In February 2013, several stations in Great Falls, Montana and Marquette, Michigan were breached in such a manner, relaying a hoax message warning that \\"dead bodies\\" were \\"rising from their graves\\". It was determined that the stations' equipment was poorly protected, and that the broadcasters had further neglected to change default factory logins or passwords, opting to use factory presets instead. Because of this, the FCC, FEMA, equipment manufacturers, as well as trade groups, including the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, urged broadcasters to change their passwords and to recheck their security measures. ** In a related incident, WIZM-FM in La Crosse, Wisconsin accidentally triggered the EAS on television station WKBT-DT by airing a recording of the false message during its morning show. The hosts' laughter and their following reactions was heard in the audio relayed, which was followed by regular WIZM programming which was broadcast through the Emergency Alert System until WKBT took their EAS equipment offline. * On February 28, 2017, WZZY in Winchester, Indiana was hacked in a nearly- identical manner, playing the same \\"dead bodies\\" audio from the February 2013 incidents. The incident prompted a public response from the Randolph County Sheriff's Department clarifying that there was no actual emergency. * In January 2020, Security Ledger published an investigation finding that at least 50 EAS decoders by Digital Alert Systems had not been patched for a security vulnerability (use of a shared SSH key) found by IOActive in 2013. * On February 20, 2020, the EAS equipment of Washington-based provider Wave Broadband was hacked, causing approximately 3,000 customers in Jefferson County to receive several false alerts (including a Radiological Hazard Warning\\"), which contained irrelevant messages and alert audio referencing internet memes and websites (including one suggesting that the provider change its passwords). On March 2, 2020, a legitimate Required Monthly Test was displayed with a message (\\"AIGHT IM DONE U CAN REST NOW. MR GERDE WAS HERE\\") that had also appeared in the hack: a company official stated that this was a remnant of the hack that would be addressed. = Tone usage outside of alerts = To protect the integrity of the system, and prevent false activations, the FCC prohibits the use of actual or simulated EAS/WEA tones and attention signals outside of genuine alerts, tests, or authorized public service announcements, especially when they are used \\"to capture audience attention during advertisements; dramatic, entertainment, and educational programs\\". Broadcasters who misuse the tones may be sanctioned (including being required to partake in compliance measures) and fined. * Tones from the EAS were used in the trailer for the 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen; cable providers were fined $1.9 million by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 3, 2014 for misuse of EAS tones. An event similar to this previously occurred in November 2013, when TBS was fined $25,000 for the use of EAS tones in a Conan advertisement. * During the October 24, 2014 episode of Bobby Bones' nationally-syndicated radio show, Bones played audio from the 2011 national test as part of a rant about a genuine test from Nashville's Fox affiliate, WZTV, that interrupted Game 2 of the 2014 World Series on October 22. The errant Emergency Action Notification was relayed to some broadcasters and cable systems‚Äîparticularly those not configured to reject EAN messages that did not match the current date. On May 19, 2015, iHeartMedia (who distributes the show and owns its flagship station, WSIX-FM) was fined $1 million for the incident, and was ordered to implement a three-year compliance plan and remove all EAS tones or similar-sounding noises from its audio production libraries in order to avoid any further incidents. * From August 4 to August 6, 2016, Tegna, Inc.-owned NBC affiliate WTLV in Jacksonville, Florida aired an ad several times during NBC's primetime coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics produced by the marketing department of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars featuring out-of-sequence EAS tones over Jaguars training camp footage and a voiceover noting \\"this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast transmission...seek shelter immediately\\", along with the on-screen text \\"the storm is coming\\". The ad aired four times before station compliance authorities pulled the advertisement after the local news industry blog FTVLive criticized the station for carrying it, especially during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. FTVLive's piece would be noted by the FCC in their decision against WTLV rendered on May 30, 2017, when it was given a $55,000 fine for carrying the offending Jaguars ad. * The FCC issued several fines relating to EAS tone usage in August 2019, including ABC being fined $395,000 for using wireless emergency alert tones multiple times during a Jimmy Kimmel Live sketch, AMC Networks being fined $104,000 for using the tones in The Walking Dead episode \\"Omega\\", Discovery Inc. being fined $68,000 for including footage of an actual WEA activation during a Lone Star Law episode filmed during Hurricane Harvey, and Meruelo Group was fined $61,000 for including an EAS-like tone during a radio advertisement for KDAY and KDEY- FM's morning show. * On September 9, 2019, the FCC proposed a $272,000 fine against CBS for using simulated EAS tones in the Young Sheldon episode, \\"A Mother, A Child, and a Blue Man's Backside\\".https://deadline.com/2019/09/young-sheldon-fcc-proposes-six-figure- fine-for-misuse-of-emergency-alert-tone-1202729605/ CBS defended the statement, saying that the tones' usage was a \\"dramatic portrayal\\", and that it was an \\"integral part of the storyline about a family's visceral reaction to a life-threatening emergency\\". The show's sound editors achieved the effect by downloading EAS tones from YouTube and modifying the volume of the tone. CBS passed the edited tone through three quality rooms equipped with EAS decoders and prescreened the episode to make sure it didn't trigger an actual alert. Also, the show's dialogue was used to obscure some elements of the alert. However, the FCC insisted that the modified tone still sounded like a normal EAS tone, despite the volume being lowered and the tone being cut short in duration. It also said that the prescreening process didn't excuse a unauthorized usage of the EAS tones.http://www.insideradio.com/free/cbs- fined-272-000-after-fcc-concludes-it-misused-eas- tones/article_f61e08c0-d390-11e9-a8d0-3f5292413ba0.html * On April 7, 2020, the FCC proposed a $20,000 fine against New York City radio station WNEW-FM, for using the attention signal during its morning show on October 3, 2018 as part of a skit discussing the National Periodic Test held later that day. = Testing errors = * On October 19, 2008, KWVE-FM in San Clemente, California accidentally initiated a Required Monthly Test when it meant to conduct a Required Weekly Test. Furthermore, an operator aborted the test mid-way through the broadcast (failing to broadcast the end-of-message tone), causing all area outlets to broadcast KWVE-FM's programming until those stations took their equipment offline. On September 15, 2009, the FCC fined the station's owner, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, $5,000. After the fine was levied, various state broadcast associations in the United States submitted joint letters to the FCC, protesting against the fine, saying that the commission could have handled the matter better. On November 13, 2009, the FCC rescinded its fine against KWVE-FM, but had still admonished the station for broadcasting an unauthorized RMT, as well as omitting the code to end the test. * On September 21, 2017, a technical glitch in another scheduled test by KWVE caused the end- of-message tone to be omitted, causing regional participants (particularly Charter and Cox Cable systems in Orange County) to simulcast a portion of Chuck Swindoll's Insight for Living program. Some viewers initially speculated that the system had been hacked, as the portion of the program relayed (where Swindoll was discussing the biblical verse 2 Timothy 3:1, and stated, \\"realize this, extremely violent times will come\\") could be insinuated as being apocalyptic in nature.

It serves to ensure that property is not left in \\"limbo\\" without recognized ownership. It originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by operation of law, so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior feudal lord. Etymology The term \\"escheat\\" derives ultimately from the Latin ex-cadere, to \\"fall-out\\", via mediaeval French escheoir.Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986, p.520 The sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a family into possession by the overlord. Origins in feudalism In feudal England, escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee (or \\"fief\\") died without an heir or committed a felony. In the case of such demise of a tenant- in-chief, the fee reverted to the King's demesne permanently, when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land, but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king's followers. Where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for one year and one day by right of primer seisin after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment. From the time of Henry III, the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue. =Background= At the Norman conquest of England, all the land of England was claimed as the personal possession of William the Conqueror under allodial title. The monarch thus became the sole \\"owner\\" of all the land in the kingdom, a position which persists to the present day. He then granted it out to his favoured followers, who thereby became tenants-in-chief, under various contracts of feudal land tenure. Such tenures, even the highest one of \\"feudal barony\\", never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it, that is to say ownership of an estate in land. Such persons are therefore correctly termed \\"land-holders\\" or \\"tenants\\" (from Latin teneo to hold), not owners. If held freely, that is to say by freehold, such holdings were heritable by the holder's legal heir. On the payment of a premium termed feudal relief to the treasury, such heir was entitled to demand re-enfeoffment by the king with the fee concerned. Where no legal heir existed, the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity, since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land, and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord (where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in- chief to a mesne lord, and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords) as ultimus heres. Logically therefore it was in the occupation of the crown alone, that is to say in the royal demesne. This was the basic operation of an escheat (excadere), a failure of heirs. Escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony, when the King could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal's land for a year and a day, after which the land would revert to the overlord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than mere felony) forfeited all lands to the King. John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing as terrae Normannorum (i.e. \\"lands of the Normans\\") the English lands of those lords with holdings in Normandy who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen, when the victories of Philip II of France forced them to make a proclamation of allegiance to France.) Since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony, lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services. On the other hand, there were also tenants who were merely sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord. Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in Bracton's day, were available, but were considered laborious and were frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance. The commonest mechanism was distraint, also known as distress (districtio), whereby the lord would seize chattels or goods belonging to the tenant, to hold until performance was achieved. This practice had been addressed in the 1267 Statute of Marlborough. Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by overlords at the time of Quia Emptores.Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Vol 1, pp. 355‚Äì366, Cambridge University Press, 1968 Thus, under English common law, there were two main ways an escheat could happen: # A person's lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony (but not treason, in that event the land was forfeited to the Crown). If the person was executed for felony, his heirs were attainted, i.e. were ineligible to inherit. In most common-law jurisdictions, this type of escheat has been abolished outright, for example in the United States under Article 3 ¬ß 3 of the United States Constitution, which states that attainders for treason do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture, or \\"corruption of blood\\". # If a person had no heir to receive his lands under his Will, or under the laws of intestacy, then any land he owned at death would escheat. This rule has been replaced in most common-law jurisdictions by bona vacantia or a similar concept. Procedure From the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed escheators to manage escheats and report to the Exchequer, with one escheator per county established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of diem clausit extremum (\\"he has closed his last day\\", i.e. he is dead) issued by the king's chancery, to empanel a jury to hold an \\"inquisition post mortem\\" to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under military tenure. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king's court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day's revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court. Current operation Jury finding from Kentucky County, Virginia County Court from an inquest of escheat. A twelve-man panel adjudged John Connolly and Alexander McKee to be British citizens within the meaning of the Virginia Assembly Act of 1779 concerning British subjects and their rights under Virginia law. (The Assembly had seized Connolly's claims prior to the inquest.) The jury found that the lands of Connolly and McKee were forfeited as they were British (and not American) citizens. Daniel Boone was listed as member of jury. (July 1780) Most common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property, and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning. In England and Wales, the possibility of escheat of a deceased person's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the Administration of Estates Act 1925; however, the concept of Bona vacantia means that the crown (or Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster) can still receive such property if no one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it. The term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir. For example, a common-law jurisdiction's intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a will, and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents, grandparents, descendants of parents, children or grandchildren of grandparents, or great-grandchildren of grandparents, then the person's estate will escheat to the state. In some jurisdictions, escheat can also occur when an entity, typically a bank, credit union or other financial institution, holds money or property which appears to be unclaimed, for instance due to a lack of activity on the account by way of deposits, withdrawals or any other transactions for a lengthy time in a cash account. In many jurisdictions, if the owner cannot be located, such property can be revocably escheated to the state. In commerce, it is the process of reassigning legal title in unclaimed or abandoned payroll checks, insurance payouts, or stocks and shares whose owners cannot be traced, to a state authority (in the United States). A company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and, in some jurisdictions, to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts. The escheating criteria are set by individual state regulations. =England and Wales= Bankruptcies and liquidations Escheat can still occur in England and Wales, if a person is made bankrupt or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in demesne. This situation affects a few hundred properties each year. Although such escheated property is owned by the Crown, it is not part of the Crown Estate, unless the Crown (through the Crown Estate Commissioners) 'completes' the escheat, by taking steps to exert rights as owner. However, usually, in the example given above, the tenants of the flats, or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the Insolvency Act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them. This is the main difference between escheat and bona vacantia, as in the latter, a grant takes place automatically, with no need to 'complete' the transaction. Registration of Crown land One consequence of the Land Registration Act 1925 was that only estates in land (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Land held directly by the Crown, known as property in the \\"royal demesne\\", is not held under any vestigial feudal tenure (the crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy) and there is therefore no estate to register. This had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of freehold titles in each year. The problem was noted by the Law Commission in their report \\"Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century\\". The Land Registration Act 2002 was passed in response to that report. It provides that land held in demesne by the Crown may be registered. = United States =  Transfer agents and escheatment  Escheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to the government of a State, for safekeeping until the owner(s) is identified. Geographic jurisdiction of the State is determined by the last known address of the original owner. Each of the United States has laws regulating escheatment, with holding periods typically ranging around five years. The legal principle behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner; therefore, if the original owner cannot be found within a specified time, government is presumed to be the owner. Escheats are performed on a revocable basis. Thus, if property has escheated to a State but the original owner subsequently is found, escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner.  Lost shareholders  According to SEC Rule 17 CFR 240.17f-1: Transfer Agents are obligated by the SEC to report to Commission (specifically to its designee; the SEC's Securities Information System) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least 2 days. Transfer Agents must search for the holder's SSN or EIN utilizing an information database system, or if not available, exercise their best effort to match the holder's name and address through these systems. All Transfer Agents must report all lost or missing certificates/shareholders on their own annual filings.

He was nicknamed \\"The Great Agnostic\\". Early life Robert Ingersoll was born in Dresden, Yates County, New York. His father, John Ingersoll, was an abolitionist-sympathizing Congregationalist preacher, whose radical opinions caused him and his family to relocate frequently. For a time, Rev. John Ingersoll substituted as preacher for American revivalist Charles G. Finney while Finney was on a tour of Europe. Upon Finney's return, Rev. Ingersoll remained for a few months as co-pastor/associate pastor with Finney. The elder Ingersoll's later pastoral experiences influenced young Robert negatively, however, as The Elmira Telegram described in 1890: > Though for many years the most noted of American infidels, Colonel Ingersoll > was born and reared in a devoutly Christian household. His father, John > Ingersoll, was a Congregationalist minister and a man of mark in his time, a > deep thinker, a logical and eloquent speaker, broad minded and generously > tolerant of the views of others. The popular impression which credits > Ingersoll's infidelity in the main to his father's severe orthodoxy and the > austere and gloomy surroundings in which his boyhood was spent is wholly > wrong. On the contrary, the elder Ingersoll's liberal views were a source of > constant trouble between him and his parishioners. They caused him to > frequently change his charges, and several times made him the defendant in > church trials. His ministerial career was, in fact, substantially brought to > a close by a church trial which occurred while he was pastor of the > Congregational Church at Madison, Ohio, and at which his third wife appeared > as the prosecutor. Upon this occasion, he was charged with prevarication and > unministerial conduct. The evidence adduced ‚Äì the trial is one of the > abiding traditions of the dull little town of Madison ‚Äì was of the most > trivial and ridiculous character, but the committee which heard it decided > that, though he had done \\"nothing inconsistent with his Christian > character,\\" he was \\"inconsistent with his ministerial character,\\" and > forbade him to preach in the future.

During 1853, \\"Bob\\" Ingersoll taught a term of school in Metropolis, Illinois, where he let one of his students, the future Judge Angus M. L. McBane, do the \\"greater part of the teaching, while Latin and history occupied his own attention\\". At some time prior to his Metropolis position, Ingersoll had also taught school in Mount Vernon, Illinois.1887\\\\. History of Gallatin, Saline, Hamilton, Franklin, and Williamson Counties, Illinois. Goodspeed Publishing Co. 557, 585. As of 1887, Judge McBane still had in his possession Ingersoll's letter of inquiry regarding the school dated May 16, 1853.  Lawyer Later that year, the family settled in Marion, Illinois, where Robert and his brother Ebon Clarke Ingersoll were admitted as lawyers during 1854. A county historian writing 22 years later noted that local residents considered the Ingersolls as a \\"very intellectual family; but, being Abolitionists, and the boys being deists, rendered obnoxious to our people in that respect.\\"Milo Erwin. 1876. History of Williamson County, Illinois. 250. While in Marion, he learned law from Judge Willis Allen and served as deputy clerk for John M. Cunningham, Williamson County's County Clerk and Circuit Clerk. During 1855, after Cunningham was named registrar for the federal land office in southeastern Illinois at Shawneetown, Illinois, Ingersoll followed him to the riverfront city along the Ohio River. After a brief time there, he accepted the deputy clerk position with John E. Hall, the county clerk and circuit clerk of Gallatin County, and also a son-in-law of John Hart Crenshaw.Kittredge, Herman E., A Biographical Appreciation of Robert G. Ingersoll, Ch. 2. On November 11, 1856, Ingersoll caught Hall in his arms when the son of a political opponent assassinated his employer in their office.Eva Ingersoll Wakefield, ed. 1951. The Letters of Robert G. Ingersoll, New York: Hallmark-Hubner Press, Inc. 18‚Äì19. When he relocated to Shawneetown, he continued to practice law with Judge William G. Bowman who had a large library of both law and the classics. In addition to his job as a clerk, he and his brother began their law practice using the name \\"E.C. and R.G. Ingersoll\\".Kittredge, Ch. 2. 1911. During this time they also had an office in Raleigh, Illinois, then the county seat of neighboring Saline County. As attorneys following the court circuit he often practiced alongside Cunningham's soon-to-be son-in-law, John A. Logan, the state's attorney and political ally to Hall. With his earlier mentor Cunningham having relocated back to Marion after the land office's closing during 1856, and Logan's relocation to Benton, Illinois, after his marriage that autumn, Ingersoll and his brother relocated to Peoria, Illinois, where they finally settled during 1857. Ingersoll was married, February 13, 1862, to Eva Amelia Parker (1841-1923). They had two daughters. The elder daughter, Eva Ingersoll-Brown, was a renowned feminist and suffragist.Entry for Eva Ingersoll-Brown in A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists  Civil war  With the beginning of the American Civil War, he raised the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry of the Union Army and assumed command. The regiment fought in the Battle of Shiloh. Ingersoll was later captured in a skirmish with the Confederates near Lexington, Tennessee on December 18, 1862, then paroled - i.e. released on his oath that he would not fight again against the Confederate States of America until formally exchanged for a captured Confederate soldier or officer of like rank (who was often under parole himself, making the practice a matter of honor and formality, which could be extended to individuals or even entire regiments en masse). This was an old practice which was still commonly observed early in the war, until the Dix‚ÄìHill Cartel broke down under political distress. Unable to perform his duties under his officer's commission while paroled, he tendered his resignation as commanding officer on June 30, 1863. Entry into politics After the war, he served as Illinois Attorney General. He was a prominent member of the Republican Party and, though he never had an elected job, he was nonetheless an active participant of politics. According to Robert Nisbet, Ingersoll was a \\"staunch Republican.\\"McCarthy, Daniel (2012-11-21) Outsider Conservatism, The American Conservative His speech nominating James G. Blaine for the 1876 presidential election was unsuccessful, as Rutherford B. Hayes received the Republican nomination, but the speech itself, known as the \\"Plumed Knight\\" speech, was considered a model of political oratory. His opinions on slavery, woman's suffrage, and other issues of the time would sometimes become part of the mainstream, but his atheism/agnosticism effectively prevented him from ever pursuing or having political offices higher than that of state attorney general. Illinois Republicans tried to persuade him to campaign for governor on the condition that Ingersoll conceal his agnosticism during the campaign, which he refused to do. Ingersoll was involved with several major trials as an attorney, notably the Star Route trials, a major political scandal in which his clients were acquitted. He also defended a New Jersey man charged with blasphemy. Although he did not win the acquittal, his vigorous defense is considered to have discredited blasphemy laws and few other prosecutions followed. For a time, Ingersoll represented con artist James Reavis, the \\"Baron of Arizona\\", pronouncing his Peralta Land Grant claim valid.Myers, John Myers, \\"The Prince of Swindlers\\", American Heritage, August 1956 (7:5). Updated link retrieved 05-11-2011. Oratory and free thought The only known image of Ingersoll addressing an audience. A political cartoon depicting crowds seeking entertainment by flocking to hear Ingersoll advocate for agnosticism in a theater which is open on Sunday, when the American Museum of Natural History is \\"Closed Due to Morality\\". Ingersoll was one of the most popular orators of the age, when oratory was public entertainment. He spoke on every subject, from Shakespeare to Reconstruction, but his most popular subjects were agnosticism and the sanctity and refuge of the family. He committed his speeches to memory although they were sometimes more than three hours long. Many of Ingersoll's speeches advocated freethought and humanism, and often ridiculed religious belief. For this the press often attacked him, but neither his opinions nor the negative press could stop his increasing popularity. During Ingersoll's greatest fame, audiences would pay $1 or more to hear him speak, a considerable sum for that time. In a lecture entitled \\"The Great Infidels\\", he attacked the doctrine of Hell: \\"All the meanness, all the revenge, all the selfishness, all the cruelty, all the hatred, all the infamy of which the heart of man is capable, grew blossomed, and bore fruit in this one word ‚Äì Hell.\\" Death Ingersoll died from congestive heart failure at the age of 65. Soon after his death, his brother- in-law, Clinton P. Farrell, collected copies of Ingersoll's speeches for publication. The 12-volume Dresden Editions kept interest in Ingersoll's ideas alive and preserved his speeches for future generations. Ingersoll's ashes are interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Legacy Susan Jacoby credits Ingersoll for the revival of Thomas Paine's reputation in American intellectual history, which had decreased after the publication of The Age of Reason published during 1794‚Äì95. Paine postulated that men, not God, had written the Bible, and Ingersoll included this work in his lectures on freethinking. As the only freethinker of his time with a wide audience outside of the unbelieving circle, he reintroduced Paine's ideas to a new generation. In 2005, a popular edition of Ingersoll's work was published by Steerforth Press. Edited by the Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Tim Page, What's God Got to Do With It: Robert Ingersoll on Free Speech, Honest Talk and the Separation of Church and State brought Ingersoll's thinking to a new audience. Friendship with Walt Whitman Ingersoll enjoyed a friendship with the poet Walt Whitman, who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. \\"It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is 'Leaves of Grass' ... He lives, embodies, the individuality, I preach. I see in Bob [Ingersoll] the noblest specimen‚Äî- American-flavored‚Äî- pure out of the soil, spreading, giving, demanding light.\\"Intimate with Walt: Selections from Whitman's Conversations with Horace Traubel, Gary Schmidgall (Editor), 2001, University of Iowa Press, Page 81. The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's death during 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric.The Book of Eulogies, Phyllis Theroux (Editor), 1977, Simon & Schuster. Page 30. In popular culture Ingersoll statue in Peoria, Illinois. *Colonel Bob Mountain in Washington state was named for Robert Ingersoll. *His birthplace, known as the Robert Ingersoll Birthplace, or Robert Green Ingersoll Birthplace Museum, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. * Ingersoll's type of agnosticism was labelled Ingersollism by his intellectual contemporaries, including Congregationalist Lyman Abbott, Congregationalist minister John P. Sanderson, Illinois scholar and lawyer George Reuben Wendling and others (such as a collection of refutations of Ingersollism published during 1879 by Chicago publishers Rhodes and McClure). * During July 2016 Ingersoll's statue in Peoria, Illinois was restored thanks to a successful fundraising effort by the Freedom From Religion Foundation. * In Lewis Grassic Gibbon's modernist novel Sunset Song (1932), the character of Long Rob \\"[reads] the books of a coarse creature Ingersoll that made watches and didn't believe in God\\" and \\"God knows if the creature's logic was as poor as his watches\\" and \\"fair caution him and his Ingersoll that could neither make watches nor sense\\".

Ingersoll"},{"id":"175534","text":"A techno-thriller or technothriller is a hybrid genre drawing from science fiction, thrillers, spy fiction, action, and war novels. They include a disproportionate amount (relative to other genres) of technical details on their subject matter (typically military technology); only hard science fiction tends towards a comparable level of supporting detail on the technical side. The inner workings of technology and the mechanics of various disciplines (espionage, martial arts, politics) are thoroughly explored, and the plot often turns on the particulars of that exploration. This genre began to exist and establish itself in the early 20th century with further developments and focus on the genre in the mid 20th century.  History  The genre dates back to as early as the 20th century and a lot of techno-thrillers are comparable to science-fiction and many of the subcategories within science-fiction. The popularity of the genre had evolved significantly and it continues to be a growing genre that is still publicly experimented on and thriving today. One of the earliest techno-thrillers is thought to be The Satan Bug (1962) by Alistair MacLean, while lot of what counted for science fiction in the pre-war and early post-war Soviet Union were essentially techno-thrillers, full of technical details and featuring complex spy-rich plots, one of the most enduring example being the Grigory Adamov's The Mystery of the Two Oceans (1939). Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy are considered to be the fathers of the \\"modern techno-thriller\\"; Crichton's book The Andromeda Strain and Clancy's book The Hunt for Red October set out the type example which defined the genre, although many authors had been writing similar material earlier, such as Craig Thomas, whom BBC News also credits as an early innovator.  Style  Techno-thrillers focus strongly on details, especially on the technology, which is frequently of military origin. Techno-thrillers tend to have a broad scope in the narrative, and can often be regarded as contemporary speculative fiction; world wars are a common topic. Techno- thrillers often overlap, as far as the genre goes, with near-future science fiction, military fiction, and espionage fiction. To the extent that technology is now a dominant aspect of modern global culture, most modern thrillers are \\"techno-thrillers\\", and the genre is somewhat diffuse. Techno- thrillers blur smoothly into the category of hard science fiction; the defining characteristics of techno-thriller are an emphasis on real-world or plausible near-future technology. There is often a focus on military or military-political action. Techno-thrillers also overlap with conspiracy fiction and apocalyptic fiction. While techno-thrillers borrow concepts and ideas from other forms and styles of other genres, notably science-fiction and its subcategories, It is a fresh and still developing style with it being more of a hybrid genre, more closely related to thrillers and technology. Since technology is always changing, that brings a fresh take on techno thrillers with advancement always on the scope.  Varieties  Techno-thrillers have at least five varieties within the genre. These are Military Technothrillers, Spy Technothrillers, Crypto-Technothrillers, Disaster Technothrillers, and Sci-Fi Technothrillers. * Military Technothrillers: These technothrillers focus mainly on military issues and problems. They have to do with military centralism in the story and are focused on martial technology. Tom Clancy is credited to have huge success within this category. * Spy Technothrillers: These technothrillers are similar to traditional technothrillers while remaining true to the pace and they borrow from spi-fi as well. The main aim of this category is to write about espionage as well as tradecraft. Has to do with defeating a rival enemy or enemies and stopping them from achieving their goals. *Crypto-Technothrillers: These technothrillers are the kind that has the story and the drama unfold most of the time online. One of the high accomplished writers of this subgenre we have today is Daniel Suarez, who is an author of a New York Times Best Seller. *Disaster Technothrillers: These technothrillers usually have to do with terrible things happening such as an earthquake or any natural disaster, war and nuclear wars, apocalypse, end of the world themes are also prevalent. Most times, the problem is grand and affects worldwide level instead of local. The goal of the protagonist is to survive instead of fixing the crisis. A prominent modern day writer to this subgenre is Boyd Morrison, author of Typhoon Fury, a New York Times Best Seller. *Sci-Fi Technothrillers: Are heavily reliant on science fiction and are often set in the future. Technothrillers borrow concepts from science fiction. An example of this techno thriller would be the science behind Jurassic Park.

Concept  Scott Adams's inspiration for the product was that \\"diet is the number one cause of health-related problems in the world. I figured I could put a dent in that problem and make some money at the same time.\\" His aim was to create a healthy food product that also had mass appeal, a concept he called \\"the blue jeans of food\\".  Promotion  A Flash game titled Dilberito was developed and published by Blam! Video Game Development in 2000 for Scott Adams Foods, Inc. Reception The product failed to catch on in the market, leading Adams \\"several years and several million dollars later\\" to sell off his intellectual property and exit the business. Adams himself noted \\"[t]he mineral fortification was hard to disguise, and because of the veggie and legume content, three bites of the Dilberito made you fart so hard your intestines formed a tail.\\" The New York Times noted the burrito \\"could have been designed only by a food technologist or by someone who eats lunch without much thought to taste.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/07/dining/eating-well- at-last-a-vitamin-pill-wrapped-in-a-tortilla.html References Dilbert Food product brands Flash games ","title":"Dilberito"},{"id":"175544","text":"Medgar Wiley Evers (July 2, 1925June 12, 1963) was an American civil rights activist in Mississippi, the state's field secretary for the NAACP, and a World War II veteran who had served in the United States Army. He worked to overturn segregation at the University of Mississippi, end the segregation of public facilities, and expand opportunities for African Americans, which included the enforcement of voting rights. A college graduate, Evers became active in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s. Following the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers challenged the segregation of the state-supported public University of Mississippi, applying to law school there. He also worked for voting rights, economic opportunity, access to public facilities, and other changes in the segregated society. Evers was awarded the 1963 NAACP Spingarn Medal. Evers was assassinated in 1963 by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens' Council in Jackson, Mississippi. This group was formed in 1954 in Mississippi to resist the integration of schools and civil rights activism. As a veteran, Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His murder and the resulting trials inspired civil rights protests; his life and these events inspired numerous works of art, music, and film. All-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of Beckwith in the 1960s. He was convicted in 1994 in a new state trial based on new evidence. Medgar's widow, Myrlie Evers, became a noted activist in her own right, serving as national chair of the NAACP. His brother Charles Evers was the first African American to be elected as mayor of a city in Mississippi in the post- Reconstruction era; he won the office in 1969 in Fayette. Early life Evers was born on July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of five children (including elder brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage.\\"James Charles Evers\\", Black Past The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers and his siblings walked a day to attend segregated schools; eventually Medgar earned his high school diploma.Sina, ‚ÄúFreedom Hero: Medgar Wiley Evers.‚Äù The My Hero Project, 2005. Retrieved October 25, 2009. Evers served in the United States Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. He was sent to the European Theater where he fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. After the end of the war, Evers was honorably discharged as a sergeant. In 1948, Evers enrolled at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (a historically black college, now Alcorn State University), majoring in business administration. He also competed on the debate, football, and track teams, sang in the choir, and was junior class president. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1952. On December 24, 1951, he married classmate Myrlie Beasley. Together they had three children: Darrell Kenyatta, Reena Denise, and James Van Dyke Evers. Activism The couple moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a town developed by African Americans, where Evers became a salesman for T. R. M. Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Evers was also president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL), which began to organize actions for civil rights; Evers helped organize the RCNL's boycott of gasoline stations that denied blacks the use of the stations' restrooms. Evers and his brother Charles attended the RCNL's annual conferences in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1954, which drew crowds of 10,000 or more. In 1954, following the U.S. Supreme Court decision that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers applied to the state-supported University of Mississippi Law School, but his application was rejected because of his race. He submitted his application as part of a test case by the NAACP. On November 24, 1954, Evers was named as the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He was involved with James Meredith's efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s. Evers also encouraged Dr. Gilbert Mason Sr. in his organizing of the Biloxi wade-ins from 1959 to 1963, protests against segregation of the city's public beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Evers conducted actions to help integrate Jackson's privately owned buses and tried to integrate the public parks. He led voter registration drives, and used boycotts to integrate Leake County schools and the Mississippi State Fair. Evers's civil rights leadership, along with his investigative work, made him a target of white supremacists. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, local whites founded the White Citizens' Council in Mississippi, and numerous local chapters were started, to resist the integration of schools and facilities. In the weeks before Evers was killed, he encountered new levels of hostility. His public investigations into the 1955 lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi, and his vocal support of Clyde Kennard, had made him a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home. On June 7, 1963, Evers was nearly run down by a car after he came out of the NAACP office in Jackson, Mississippi. Assassination Rifle used by De La Beckwith to murder Evers Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large white supremacist population and the Ku Klux Klan were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives.Bates, Karen Grigsby. \\"Trials & Transformation: Myrlie Evers' 30-Year Fight to Convict Medgar's Accused Killer\\", Emerge 02 1994: 35. ProQuest. Web. 27 May 2017 Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. There has been speculation that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan. In the early morning of Wednesday, June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers' family had worried for his safety that day, and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt in greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers' family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet passed through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered before collapsing outside his front door. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. He was only 37 years old.Birnbaum, p. 490. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000.. After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand-off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers. The Evers' house at 2332 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive, where Medgar Evers was fatally shot after getting out of his carMedgar Evers home tour Retrieved December 25, 2013 Trials On June 21, 1963, Byron De La Beckwith, a fertilizer salesman and member of the Citizens' Council (and later of the Ku Klux Klan), was arrested for Evers' murder. District Attorney and future governor Bill Waller prosecuted De La Beckwith. All-white juries in February and April 1964 deadlocked on De La Beckwith's guilt and failed to reach a verdict. At the time, most black people were still disenfranchised by Mississippi's constitution and voter registration practices; this meant they were also excluded from juries, which were drawn from the pool of registered voters. Myrlie Evers did not give up the fight for a conviction of her husband's killer. She waited until a new judge had been assigned in the county to take her case against De La Beckwith back into the courtroom. In 1994, De La Beckwith was prosecuted by the state based on new evidence. Bobby DeLaughter was the prosecutor. During the trial, the body of Evers was exhumed for an autopsy. De La Beckwith was convicted of murder on February 5, 1994, after having lived as a free man for much of the three decades following the killing. (He had been imprisoned from 1977 to 1980 on separate charges: conspiring to murder A. I. Botnick.) In 1997, De La Beckwith appealed his conviction in the Evers case, but the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld it.

In 1963, Evers was posthumously awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP. In 1969, Medgar Evers College was established in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the City University of New York. Evers's widow Myrlie Evers co-wrote the book For Us, the Living with William Peters in 1967. In 1983, a television movie was made based on the book. Celebrating Evers's life and career, it starred Howard Rollins Jr. and Irene Cara as Medgar and Myrlie Evers, airing on PBS. The film won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Adapted Drama. In 1969, a community pool in the Central District neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, was named after Evers, honoring his life. On June 28, 1992, the city of Jackson, Mississippi, erected a statue in honor of Evers. All of Delta Drive (part of U.S. Highway 49) in Jackson was renamed in Evers's honor. In December 2004, the Jackson City Council changed the name of the city's airport to Jackson‚ÄìMedgar Wiley Evers International Airport in his honor. Statue of Evers at the Medgar Evers Boulevard Library in Jackson, Mississippi His widow Myrlie Evers became a noted activist in her own right, eventually serving as national chairperson of the NAACP. Myrlie also founded the Medgar Evers Institute in 1998, with the initial goal of preserving and advancing the legacy of Medgar Evers' life's work. Anticipating the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Medgar Evers and recognizing the international leadership role of Myrlie Evers, the Institute's board of directors changed the organization's name to the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute. Medgar's brother Charles Evers returned to Jackson in July 1963, and served briefly with the NAACP in his slain brother's place. He remained involved in Mississippi civil rights activities for many years, and in 1969, was the first African-American mayor elected in the state. He died on July 22, 2020, aged 97. On the 40th anniversary of Evers's assassination, hundreds of civil rights veterans, government officials, and students from across the country gathered around his grave site at Arlington National Cemetery to celebrate his life and legacy. Barry Bradford and three students‚ÄîSharmistha Dev, Jajah Wu, and Debra Siegel, formerly of Adlai E.

Set in the mid-1980s, it features a Third World War between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact forces, and is unique for depicting the conflict as being fought exclusively with conventional weapons, rather than escalating to the use of weapons of mass destruction or nuclear warfare. It is one of two Clancy novels, including SSN (1996), that are not set in the Ryanverse. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. It eventually lent its name to game development company Red Storm Entertainment, which Clancy co-founded in 1997. Plot summary Militants from Azerbaijan destroy an oil production refinery in Nizhnevartovsk, threatening to cripple the Soviet Union's economy due to oil shortages. After much deliberation, the Soviet Politburo decides to seize the Persian Gulf by military force in order to recoup the country's oil losses. Knowing that the United States had pledged to defend the oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, the Soviets decide that neutralizing NATO is a necessary first step before its military operation can take place. To divert attention from the impending operation, the Politburo embarks upon an elaborate maskirovka to disguise both their predicament and their intentions. The Soviets publicly declare their arms reduction proposal to scrap their obsolete submarines. The KGB then carries out a false flag operation involving a bomb being detonated in a Kremlin building, framing a KGB sleeper agent as a West German BND spy involved in the incident. The Politburo publicly denounces the West German government and calls for retaliation. With Germany neutralized and occupied, the Soviets believe that the United States would not move to rescue the Arab states since it could meet its oil needs from the Western Hemisphere alone. Even though a planned attack on a NATO communications facility in Lammersdorf was compromised when a Spetsnaz officer was arrested, the Soviets push through with their advance operations in Germany. However, they suffer reverses on the first night of the war, when NATO stealth and fighter-bomber aircraft achieve air superiority over Eastern Europe by eliminating Soviet AWACS and fighter aircraft, as well as bombing many key bridges that much of the Soviet Army has yet to cross. Nevertheless, the Soviet Navy achieves an advantage by occupying Iceland, taking control of the NATO airbase in Keflav√≠k and ensuring command of the strategically important GIUK gap. U.S. Air Force lieutenant Mike Edwards escapes the attack and hides behind enemy lines, serving as a scout for NATO forces. The Soviet Navy also attack several resupply convoys from North America as well as a NATO carrier battle group in the North Atlantic, causing severe losses to the other side. Meanwhile, the Soviet Air Force engage in a fierce air battle over Norway and later secure a rocket launch site there, bringing key NATO radar and air stations in nearby Scotland within range of sustained air attack. After much difficulty in occupying West Germany, the Soviet Army, led by General-Colonel Pavel Alekseyev, score a breakthrough in a tank battle over Alfeld, threatening to proceed west of Weser River without heavy resistance from NATO forces. Meanwhile, a naval attack on Soviet bomber bases with cruise missiles launched by NATO submarines paves the way for an amphibious assault on Iceland, retaking the island and effectively closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. While Edwards is first reinforced by a squad of Royal Marines and then rescued by the United States Marines, a Soviet prisoner on the island reveals the true cause of the war, narrowing down bombing priorities to the Soviet Army's forward fuel depots and immobilizing the Soviet formations. In Moscow, the desperate Politburo considers deploying nuclear weapons to stave off defeat. This infuriates Alekseyev, who had been mobilizing for a final counterattack on Germany but faces execution by the Soviet government for its slow timetable. He later takes part in a coup d'etat orchestrated by the KGB in the Kremlin, arresting the government ministers and establishing a troika to temporarily preside over the country. The new Soviet government then negotiates for a ceasefire with NATO and a return to status quo ante bellum, effectively ending the conflict.

Themes Red Storm Rising depicts a future Third World War, chiefly between the United States and the Soviet Union. It follows the \\"future war\\" genre popularized by the 1871 novella The Battle of Dorking by George Tomkyns Chesney as well as the science fiction novel The War in the Air (1908) by H.G. Wells. However, Red Storm Rising is unique in that it presented a war using conventional weapons rather than one with nuclear weaponry which was more typical in fiction dealing with Cold War confrontations. According to a document released by the UK National Archives in December 2015, U.S. President Ronald Reagan had recommended Red Storm Rising to UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher shortly after the Reykjav√≠k Summit in 1986 between him and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev so as to gain an understanding of the Soviet Union's intentions and strategy. Some of the advanced weapons systems described in the novel were deployed four years later in the Gulf War. Development Tom Clancy met Larry Bond in 1982. Clancy had purchased Bond's wargame Harpoon as a primary source for his future novel The Hunt for Red October (1984). They used the board game's second edition miniature rules to test key battle sequences, notably the Soviet operation to seize Iceland and the attack on the carrier battle group in the \\"Dance of the Vampires\\" chapter, with Bond refereeing the game sessions, which typically involved several players on each side (Clancy among them) acting in various roles. The two discussed Convoy-84, a wargame Bond had been working on at the time that featured a new Battle of the North Atlantic. The idea became the basis for Red Storm Rising, although Clancy is later referred as the sole author. \\"I wrote like 1 percent of the book,\\" remarked Bond. For research on the Politburo scenes, Clancy and Bond interviewed Soviet defector Arkady Shevchenko. Release In 1987, the book was published in French as Temp√™te Rouge (Red Storm), translated by France- Marie Watkins, with the collaboration of Jean Sabbagh. Reception Like its predecessor, The Hunt for Red October, the book received critical acclaim for its accurate military narrative. Publishers Weekly praised it as \\"fascinating and totally credible story, told with authenticity and great suspense\\". Kirkus Reviews hailed it as \\"an informative, readable, sometimes dazzling speculation on superpower war\\". Game adaptations In December 1988, MicroProse released a Red Storm Rising computer game, in which the player commanded an American submarine against Soviet forces. The player had the option of choosing between both single missions or campaign and which era to play in; modern missions offered the player more advanced submarines and weapons, but also a more technologically advanced adversary as well. In 1989, TSR, Inc. released the Red Storm Rising board game designed by Douglas Niles, based on the book. The game won the Origins Award for Best Modern-Day Boardgame and Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame in 1989.

The Dilbert principle is inspired by the Peter principle, which holds that employees are promoted based on success in their current position until they reach their \\"level of incompetence\\" and are no longer promoted. Under the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book The Dilbert Principle. Definition In the Dilbert strip of February 5, 1995, Dogbert says that \\"leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow\\". Adams himself explained, > I wrote The Dilbert Principle around the concept that in many cases the > least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they‚Äôre the > ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts > and yelling at people for not doing their assignments‚Äîyou know, the easy > work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers‚Äîyour smart > people‚Äîaren't in management. That principle was literally happening > everywhere. Adams explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article.Adams, Scott. \\"Manager's journal: The Dilbert principle.\\" Wall Street Journal [New York, N.Y.] 22 May 1995, Eastern edition: A12. Wall Street Journal. Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book The Dilbert Principle, which is required or recommended reading at some management and business programs. In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha- squirrel to lead them. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the New York Times bestseller list for 43 weeks. Adams' presentation of the principle is satirical‚Äîfacetious but also addressing a real-world concern. Comparative principles The Dilbert principle is comparable to the Peter principle. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, The Peter Principle, Laurence J. Peter explains \\"percussive sublimation\\", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e., promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees. The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to \\"higher\\" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously held, so placing them in a supervisory position is a way to quietly remove them from the workforce without actually firing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as Putt's Law.

Ferris understood the growing need for structural steel and founded G.W.G. Ferris & Co. in Pittsburgh, a firm that tested and inspected metals for railroads and bridge builders.

Jets of steam were used by workers to thaw dirt and prevent poured concrete from freezing. Piles of timber were driven thirty-two feet into the ground, on top of which was laid a grillage of steel, filled with concrete.The Devil in the White City, Erik Larson, pg. 193. The wheel rotated on a 71-ton, 45.5 foot (13.9 meters) long axle comprising what was at that time the world's largest hollow forging, manufactured in Pittsburgh by the Bethlehem Iron Company and weighing , together with two cast-iron spiders weighing . There were 36 passenger cars, each fitted with 40 revolving chairs and able to accommodate up to 60 people, giving a total capacity of 2,160. On June 9, 1893, the wheel was primed for a test run with great anticipation and a good deal of anxiety. The engine that would activate the wheel was fueled by steam boilers whose underground mains rushed steam to propel the pistons of its thousand-horsepower engines. Upon first seeing the wheel which towered over everything in its vicinity, Julian Hawthorne, son of the author Nathaniel, was amazed that anything of such a size \\"continues to keep itself erect ... it has no visible means of support‚Äînone that appear adequate. The spokes look like cobwebs; they are after the fashion of those on the newest make of bicycles\\".Larson (2003), p. 258 Both Ferris and his associate W. F. Gronau also recognized the engineering marvel the wheel represented, as a giant wheel that would turn slowly and smoothly without structural failure had never before been attempted.Larson (2003), pp. 258-259 For its inaugural run, no cars had yet been attached. The workmen however, climbed the structure and settled themselves on the spokes to the accompaniment of cheers from an audience of fair employees who had gathered to watch the momentous event. After the wheel had completed its first rotation, Gronau deemed the test a success. \\"I could have yelled out loud for joy\\".Larson (2003), p. 260 Ferris himself had not been able to attend the launching of his invention, and that evening received a telegram: \\"The last coupling and final adjustment was made and steam turned on at six o‚Äôclock this evening one complete revolution of the big wheel was made everything working satisfactory twenty minutes time was taken for the revolution‚ÄîI congratulate you upon its complete success midway is wildly enthusiastic\\". Operation The Ferris Wheel took 20 minutes to make two revolutions, the first involving six stops to allow passengers to exit and enter and the second a nine-minute non-stop rotation, for which the ticket holder paid 50 cents. The Ferris Wheel first opened to the public as the centrepiece of the World's Columbian Exposition at Midway Plaisance in Chicago on June 21, 1893, and continued to operate there until after the exposition ended in October 1893. After the Columbian Exposition 'Chicago, Grande Roue' (1896) - Lumi√®re Brothers (Catalog no. 338) The Ferris Wheel in Lincoln Park, Chicago, looking north from Wrightwood Avenue The wheel itself closed in April 1894 and was then dismantled and stored until the following year, when it was rebuilt in the Lincoln Park, Chicago, neighborhood.\\"Paradises Lost\\" by Stan Barker in Chicago History March 1993, p.32 The amusement park was located at 2619 to 2665 N.

Hyde Park Historical Society Ferris Wheel Follow-up The original plan was to include a beer garden and vaudeville show, but the liquor license was not granted. William D. Boyce, then a local resident, filed a Circuit Court action against the owners of the wheel to have it removed, but without success. In 1896, the Lumiere Brothers, inventors of cinema, shot film (catalogue number 338) of the intersection of Wrightwood and Clark which included the Ferris wheel. It is one of the first films of Chicago. The wheel operated there from October 1895 until 1903, when it was bought by the Chicago House Wrecking Company for $8,150.00.The Devil in the White City, Erik Larson, pg. 380 It was then dismantled for a second time and transported by rail to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair, where it earned its owners $215,000.

It is owned and operated by Entercom. It has a transmitter in Hamburg, New York while it has studios located on Corporate Parkway in Amherst, New York. WWKB is a Class A station broadcasting on the clear-channel frequency of 1520 kHz. WWKB shares Class A status with KOKC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The station is an almost straight simulcast of ESPN Radio with local sports play-by-play, complementing sister station WGR. History =Early years= WKBW was founded in 1926 as a religious station, operating at the frequency of 1380 kHz. As the story goes, founder Clinton Churchill applied to the Department of Commerce for a license to operate under the call signs WAY. That call sign, however, was being used for a ship at sea, so instead, Churchill chose the letters \\"WKBW,\\" which were next in the random assignment pool. Churchill proclaimed the call letters to stand for Well Known Bible Witness; later usage referred to the middle letters \\"KB\\" standing for King of Buffalo (alluding to its 50,000-watt broadcast power). WKBW changed frequencies from 1380 to 1480 kHz in the late 1920s as a result of General Order 40 (bumping the station already at that frequency, WKEN, down the dial to 1040 kHz), and raised its power to 5,000 watts‚Äîthe first Buffalo station to raise its power to that level. In March 1941 WKBW inaugurated a new transmitter plant south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg, increased power to 50,000 watts around the clock and shifted to its current dial position at 1520 kHz as a result of NARBA. During the 1930s, WKBW shared a CBS affiliation with then-sister station WGR, and in the 1940s, was affiliated with the NBC Blue network and its corporate successor ABC, running as a conventional full service network affiliated station also offering local news and music programming. The station later broadcast a wide variety of ethnic, country and western and religious programming when not carrying network offerings, including pioneer rock and roll and rhythm and blues shows launched in the 1950s by disk jockey George \\"Hounddog\\" Lorenz, later founder of pioneer FM urban station WBLK. Stan Barron served as the station's sports director in this era. =Top 40 era= On July 4, 1958, a few months before companion station WKBW-TV (channel 7) was launched, WKBW radio abandoned its adult approach and was converted into a personality-driven full service Top 40 music radio station, featuring foreground personalities, a tight playlist of current hits and an aggressive local news department, which it continued to program with great success for over 20 years.Buffalo broadcasters' history of WKBW It was one of the first stations to present traffic reports in cooperation with police and state and local authorities. Churchill sold WKBW-AM-TV to Capital Cities Broadcasting in 1961, earning a handsome return on his original investment of 35 years earlier. On Halloween Night 1968, writer Dan Kriegler and then-program director Jefferson Kaye (later the voice of WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, which would become co-owned with WKBW-TV in 1971) commemorated the then-30th anniversary of Orson Welles' 1938 War Of The Worlds by re-making the infamous broadcast, updating the storyline and changing locations to make it significant to Buffalo listeners. (See The War of the Worlds (radio 1968).) Kaye (best known in much of the U.S. as the voice of NFL Films) did another equally well-received remake of \\"War of the Worlds\\" in 1972 using a revised script and some new cast members from among the staffers on hand at the time, including Jackson Armstrong and newsmen Jim McLaughlin and Joe Downey. Debate continues among radio buffs in the eastern U.S. as to which of Kaye's two versions of \\"War of the Worlds\\" was the best, but both have been recorded and avidly collected by aficionados of classic radio programming. During the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, WKBW became a major force in pop radio over the East Coast. KB had a 50,000 watt transmitter (the maximum power allowed) at their transmitter site in Hamburg. This high power caused WKBW to blanket the entire eastern U.S. with top 40 music every night, and the station actually had a better signal at night in the western Boston suburbs than Boston's own top 40 station, WMEX, located at 1510, right next door to WKBW. Disk jockeys included future Price is Right announcer Rod Roddy, Dick Biondi, Danny Neaverth, Jack Armstrong, Joey Reynolds, Steve Mitchell, Bud Ballou, Norm Marshall, Tom Shannon, and the Amazin' Jim Quinn. Art Wander served as the initial news director from 1956 to 1958, followed by Irv Weinstein from 1958 to 1964; Stan Barron, a holdover from the pre-rock and roll era, handled sports until his departure in 1965. Mike Joseph, later creator of the Hot Hits format, was a major off-air contributor to the station's approach to the \\"futuresonic\\" top-40 format. In 1969, WKBW became the first radio station to air material from The Beatles' unreleased Get Back album. The recordings had been compiled out of material The Beatles recorded in London in January 1969, the same sessions that would be used to create The Beatles' Let It Be album, which was released in May 1970. Although WKBW was the first station to air the \\"Get Back\\" tapes, WBCN in Boston would be better known for playing them, as its broadcast of the tapes was preserved on a high-quality reel, which spawned several widely circulated bootlegs of The Beatles. A recreated example of WKBW as an early 1960s-era pop radio station can be found on Ron Jacobs' \\"Cruisin' 1960\\" (Increase Records INCR 5-2005). This recreation features Dick Biondi and includes several classic rock and pop songs of that era, contemporary commercials, and DJ patter. A tribute site for WKBW's Top 40 years is found at http://wkbwradio.com/ =The 1980s and 1990s= The station continued with the Top 40 format until 1981, when, facing the emergence of FM competition, the station evolved to more of an Adult Contemporary format. By 1983, they leaned toward rock and roll oldies while still playing AC songs. They also added talk radio shows in the evenings by 1984. In 1986, the WKBW stations were broken up as a result of Capital Cities' purchase of the American Broadcasting Company. WKBW radio was sold to Price Communications, who subsequently changed the station's call letters to the current WWKB on January 3, mainly in order to keep the long-standing \\"KB\\" slogan (which was necessitated due to an FCC regulation in effect then that forbade TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters; the former calls remained on now-former sister station WKBW-TV, which Capital Cities/ABC would sell to Queen City Broadcasting). In 1987, the station moved to a full service oldies format and on June 18, 1988, the station dropped live programming and switched to satellite-fed oldies. On March 6, 1989, WWKB flipped to business talk as part of the \\"Business Radio Network\\". It flipped to hot talk in 1993. WWKB aired J. R. Gach from WGR as the afternoon drive show and established syndicated hot talkers The Howard Stern Show (by this time now almost exclusively on the FM dial), G. Gordon Liddy, Laura Schlessinger, The Fabulous Sports Babe, Tom Leykis and (briefly, before Gach's arrival) Don and Mike. John Otto hosted a late night program in this era. Stern's and Gach's presence was not enough to revive KB's ratings in what was then a three way news-talk battle also involving market-leading WBEN and contender WGR, which would itself later switch to its current format of sports talk and play by play. By 1996, the format was flipped again to country music as \\"Real Country 1520 KB\\" (this despite there being three other country stations in Buffalo, WYRK, 107.7 and WXRL). Following that in 1998 was an all sports format utilizing the now- defunct One on One Sports network, which would move to 107.7 after two years. On January 29, 2000, WWKB flipped to a simulcast of sister station WKSE. This lasted until June of that year, when it returned to business talk, a low-cost, albeit unpopular format. Price Communications presided over the collapse of its entire radio portfolio including WWKB and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992. After a major company reorganization, WWKB was sold to Keymarket Communications in 1994. Around the same time, Keymarket acquired one of WWKB's longtime rivals, WBEN, from locally based owners at a premium price. Keymarket then sold both WWKB and WBEN to St. Louis-based River City Broadcasting in 1995. Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired WWKB and WBEN in 1996 through its purchase of River City. A year later, Sinclair bought WGR, bringing three of Buffalo's heritage AM stations under its portfolio. In 1999, Sinclair decided to exit radio station ownership, selling most of its radio stations, including WWKB, WBEN and WGR, to Entercom Communications. =The Legend returns= On January 27, 2003, WWKB returned to music, playing oldies from the station's heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, featuring artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Frankie Lymon, The Four Seasons, The Who, The Four Tops, The Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, Lovin Spoonful, and many others. The oldies format was an attempt to recreate the station's history as a popular music station (and was part of a nationwide fad of \\"real oldies\\" formats on AM radio stations in the early 2000s). While it maintained the official WWKB calls for station identification, it also played the original \\"WKBW Buffalo\\" jingles and featured many of the classic WKBW jocks including Armstrong and Neaverth, who is currently on air at WECK Buffalo. While not performing as well in Arbitron ratings as it had in its golden past, the revived \\"WKBW\\" earned the best ratings for the station since the 1990s, with approximately a 2 share, and was beginning to grow. =Progressive talk era= Personality oldies has been a successful format in many markets, including Chicago (where it has achieved top-5 ratings in the winter 2012 Arbitron survey on WLS-FM). Nevertheless, Entercom found the personality oldies format too expensive to maintain in Buffalo for only a 2 share, and so on February 6, 2006, WWKB ended a three-year run as an oldies station with a format change to predominantly syndicated progressive talk. A syndicated overnight show hosted by former WKBW personality Joey Reynolds survived the format change. The move was a hasty attempt to block brokered station WHLD from successfully adopting a liberal talk format, sap its listeners, and protect right leaning talk format sister station WBEN. Despite an increase in transmission power, WHLD found that Air America with local morning talk unsustainable and dropped the format for the \\"Totally Gospel Radio Network\\" programming in December 2006. WWKB maintained their liberal talk format for another seven years. On April 16, 2008 the station started airing Randi Rhodes of the Nova-M Radio network, who had been fired from Air America. The classic \\"WKBW\\" was honored by XM Satellite Radio on November 30, 2007 in a five-hour \\"Sonic Sound Salute\\" on The 60s on 6. On July 3, 2008, ForgottenBuffalo.com celebrated the 50th anniversary of KB's format switch to Top 40 with a sidewalk sock hop. The event was held in front of the original studios located at 1430 Main Street in Buffalo. KB alumni Danny Neaverth, Stan Roberts and Tom Donahue attended. A limited edition poster commemorating the anniversary was produced. =ESPN 1520= On September 5, 2013, WWKB flipped to sports radio under the brand ESPN 1520AM. The ESPN Radio affiliation had previously been on WGR from the network's launch in 1992 until 2013; WGR's increased emphasis on local programming (and, since The Phil Hendrie Show moved to an earlier time slot, a lack of progressive talk programs to air in the overnight hours) prompted Entercom to move the ESPN affiliation to a full-time signal. The local sports broadcasts and brokered weekend programs that WWKB carried under its previous format continue under the ESPN affiliation; the station launched with a broadcast of the Buffalo Sabres' participation in the Traverse City Prospects Tournament.Pergament, Alan (September 6, 2013). Sabres games in NHL prospect tourney on new ESPN Buffalo. The Buffalo News. Retrieved September 5, 2013. The station is primarily a straight simulcast of the ESPN Radio feed, with the exception of The Jim Rome Show which is part of CBS Sports Radio. Rome had previously aired on WGR for over a decade prior before the station opted to rearrange its local programming and move the somewhat lower-rated (and less locally relevant) Rome to WWKB. Broadcast range WWKB's transmitter is located in Hamburg, New York, with a three-tower array designed for maximum nighttime range. It is one of two 50,000-watt \\"flamethrowers\\" in Western New York, the other being WHAM in Rochester. Transcontinental range has been reported. During the exclusive Monkees \\"Sleepy Jean\\"/\\"Daydream Believer\\" broadcast in 1967, a recording was made in Sidi Yahia, Morocco.I Heard it on the AM Radio-WKBW heard in Morocco-1967audio file of WKBW playing \\"Sleepy Jean\\"/\\"Daydream Believer\\"-1967 WWKB's daytime signal decently covers all of Western New York, including Rochester, as well as the Southern Tier. It also provides secondary coverage to much of southern Ontario, including Toronto, and can be heard as far east as Kingston. At night, it must direct its signal eastward due to sharing a frequency with KOKC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (the former KOMA, another flame-throwing 50,000-watt top 40 powerhouse in the 1960s and 1970s). Thus, while the station can be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night, its signal is spotty at best only 20 miles southwest of Buffalo. Its directional quality is due to the configuration of its transmitter tower array, which has resulted the station being commonly heard very well in parts of Sweden at night during the winter months. A group of Scandinavian radio reception enthusiasts actually traveled to the United States to have a conference at a Camp Road motel, with the purpose of viewing the array for themselves, apparently to photograph and measure it. Residents of the neighborhood remain largely unaware that the antenna array is internationally famous for sending the 1520 signal all the way to the outskirts of Stockholm on a regular basis. There have been ongoing reports for the past several years that allege Entercom has cut back WWKB's signal power to 10,000 watts in an effort to save power. Entercom has not filed with the FCC to do so and such a signal reduction has yet to be confirmed; indications are that the station's signal strength and range has remained normal.Fybush, Scott (2010-03-22).

Entercom uses WWKB as an overflow station for WGR's sports coverage. When two teams to which WGR owns the rights are playing at the same time, the more important event usually airs on WGR and the lesser event airs on WWKB. WWKB's Bills home game coverage is broadcast live without a broadcast delay primarily for the benefit of listeners inside New Era Field. The official Buffalo Bills Radio Network broadcast airs on WGR. The use of WWKB as a de facto co-flagship would also allow, if the situation arose, the Bills' home team broadcast to be heard across the East Coast if they were to ever reach the Super Bowl.

Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.  Conceptual underpinnings  Let m\\\\\\\\! be the plaintext message that Alice wants to secretly transmit to Bob and let E_k\\\\\\\\! be the encryption cipher, where _k\\\\\\\\! is a cryptographic key. Alice must first transform the plaintext into ciphertext, c\\\\\\\\!, in order to securely send the message to Bob, as follows: : c = E_k(m). \\\\\\\\! In a symmetric-key system, Bob knows Alice's encryption key. Once the message is encrypted, Alice can safely transmit it to Bob (assuming no one else knows the key). In order to read Alice's message, Bob must decrypt the ciphertext using {E_k}^{-1}\\\\\\\\! which is known as the decryption cipher, D_k: \\\\\\\\! : D_k(c) = D_k(E_k(m)) = m.\\\\\\\\! Alternatively, in a non-symmetric key system, everyone, not just Alice and Bob, knows the encryption key; but the decryption key cannot be inferred from the encryption key. Only Bob knows the decryption key D_k, and decryption proceeds as :D_k(c)=m.  Types of ciphers  The history of cryptography began thousands of years ago. Cryptography uses a variety of different types of encryption. Earlier algorithms were performed by hand and are substantially different from modern algorithms, which are generally executed by a machine. = Historical ciphers = Historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers. They include: * Substitution cipher: the units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext (e.g., Caesar cipher and one-time pad) ** Polyalphabetic substitution cipher: a substitution cipher using multiple substitution alphabets (e.g., Vigen√®re cipher and Enigma machine) ** Polygraphic substitution cipher: the unit of substitution is a sequence of two or more letters rather than just one (e.g., Playfair cipher) * Transposition cipher: the ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext (e.g., rail fence cipher) Historical ciphers are not generally used as a standalone encryption technique because they are quite easy to crack. Many of the classical ciphers, with the exception of the one-time pad, can be cracked using brute force. = Modern ciphers = Modern ciphers are more secure than classical ciphers and are designed to withstand a wide range of attacks. An attacker should not be able to find the key used in a modern cipher, even if he knows any amount of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext. Modern encryption methods can be divided into the following categories: * Private-key cryptography (symmetric key algorithm): the same key is used for encryption and decryption * Public- key cryptography (asymmetric key algorithm): two different keys are used for encryption and decryption In a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., DES and AES), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption. In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., RSA), there are two separate keys: a public key is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a private key is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption. Symmetric key ciphers can be divided into block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers operate on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation. Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext digits one at a time on a continuous stream of data and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption process.  Cryptanalysis  The Zimmermann Telegram decrypted into plaintext (and translated into English). Cryptanalysis is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information, without access to the secret information that is normally required to do so. Typically, this involves knowing how the system works and finding a secret key. Cryptanalysis is also referred to as codebreaking or cracking the code. Ciphertext is generally the easiest part of a cryptosystem to obtain and therefore is an important part of cryptanalysis. Depending on what information is available and what type of cipher is being analyzed, crypanalysts can follow one or more attack models to crack a cipher. = Attack models = * Ciphertext-only: the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or codetexts * Known-plaintext: the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which he knows the corresponding plaintext * Chosen- plaintext attack: the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts of his own choosing ** Batch chosen-plaintext attack: where the cryptanalyst chooses all plaintexts before any of them are encrypted. This is often the meaning of an unqualified use of \\"chosen- plaintext attack\\". ** Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack: where the cryptanalyst makes a series of interactive queries, choosing subsequent plaintexts based on the information from the previous encryptions. * Chosen-ciphertext attack: the attacker can obtain the plaintexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of ciphertexts of his own choosing ** Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack ** Indifferent chosen-ciphertext attack * Related-key attack: like a chosen- plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit. The ciphertext-only attack model is the weakest because it implies that the cryptanalyst has nothing but ciphertext. Modern ciphers rarely fail under this attack.

Adams makes several \\"predictions\\" throughout the book intended for humorous effect: *\\"There will be two types of people: Superstars and perspiration wipers. Those who are neither will be managers\\" *\\"In the Future, the value of your job will decrease, thanks to the godforsaken hellhole of North Dakota\\". *The book anticipates a fictional food item (which Adam references as the Dilberito) which is explained as a food source containing 100% of a human's daily nutritional requirements (the point being that otherwise an individual needs a supercomputer and a team of scientists to determine dietary needs.) Scott Adams did publish in issue 15 of his Dilbert Newsletter (sent to all members of Dogbert's New Ruling Class) an excerpt from this book with permission for it to be re-published (if kept with the copyright text). Adams introduced the word confusopoly in this book. The word is a portmanteau of confusion and monopoly (or rather oligopoly), defining it as \\"a group of companies with similar products who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price\\". Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, and financial services. Adams also explains his belief that positive affirmations can influence external events, claiming that this has worked for him in the past.

It was originally used in Hinduism, referring to devotion and love for a personal God or a representational God by a devotee.Bhakti, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2009) In ancient texts such as the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the Bhagavad Gita, it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in bhakti marga.John Lochtefeld (2014), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing (New York), , pages 98-100. Also see articles on bhaktimƒÅrga and jnanamƒÅrga. Bhakti in Indian religions is \\"emotional devotionalism\\", particularly to a personal God or to spiritual ideas., Quote: \\"The foundations of emotional devotionalism (bhakti) were laid in south India in the second half of the first millennium of our era (...)\\". Thus, bhakti requires a relationship between the devotee and the deity. The term also refers to a movement, pioneered by Alvars and Nayanars, that developed around the gods Vishnu (Vaishnavism), Brahma (Brahmanism), Shiva (Shaivism) and Devi (Shaktism) in the second half of the 1st millennium CE.Karen Pechelis (2011), \\"Bhakti Traditions\\", in The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies (Editors: Jessica Frazier, Gavin Flood), Bloomsbury, , pages 107-121 It grew rapidly in India after the 12th century in the various Hindu traditions, possibly in response to the arrival of Islam in India.Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre- Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 120. Bhakti ideas have inspired many popular texts and saint-poets in India. The Bhagavata Purana, for example, is a Krishna-related text associated with the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. Bhakti is also found in other religions practiced in India, and it has influenced interactions between Christianity and Hinduism in the modern era.A. Frank Thompson (1993), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Perspectives and Encounters (Editor: Harold Coward), Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, , pages 176-186Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , see Introduction chapter Nirguni bhakti (devotion to the divine without attributes) is found in Sikhism, as well as Hinduism. Outside India, emotional devotion is found in some Southeast Asian and East Asian Buddhist traditions, and it is sometimes referred to as Bhatti.  Terminology  The Sanskrit word bhakti is derived from the verb root bhaj-, which means \\"to divide, to share, to partake, to participate, to belong to\\". The word also means \\"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\\".bhakti Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany The meaning of the term Bhakti is analogous to but different from Kama. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection.Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 19-21 Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement. She adds that, in the concept of bhakti in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion and intellection, \\"emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach\\". One who practices bhakti is called a bhakta.Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 3 The term bhakti, in Vedic Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of \\"mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to\\" such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child. It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher (Guru) as guru-bhakti, or to a personal God, or for spirituality without form (nirguna).Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 21 According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of bhakti in Indian religions. Terms such as \\"devotion, faith, devotional faith\\" represent certain aspects of bhakti, but it means much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because \\"wish is selfish, affection is unselfish\\". Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with saddha (Sanskrit: Sraddha) which means \\"faith, trust or confidence\\". However, bhakti can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom. The term Bhakti refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to moksha (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism, and it is referred to as bhakti marga or bhakti yoga.Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 14-15, 37-38 The other paths are Jnana marga (path of knowledge), Karma marga (path of works), RƒÅja marga (path of contemplation and meditation).John Martin Sahajananda (2014), Fully Human Fully Divine, Partridge India, , page 60KN Tiwari (2009), Comparative Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 31 The term bhakti has been usually translated as \\"devotion\\" in Orientalist literature.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 15-24 The colonial era authors variously described Bhakti as a form of mysticism or \\"primitive\\" religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels.Paul Carus, , pages 514-515DG Mandelbaum (1966), Transcendental and Pragmatic Aspects of Religion, American Anthropologist, 68(5), pages 1174‚Äì1191DC Scott (1980), Hindu and Christian Bhakti: A Common Human Response to the Sacred, Indian Journal of Theology, 29(1), pages 12-32 However, modern scholars state \\"devotion\\" is a misleading and incomplete translation of bhakti. Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term bhakti as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life. Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a God or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality. It involves, among other things, refining one's state of mind, knowing God, participating in God, and internalizing God. Increasingly, instead of \\"devotion\\", the term \\"participation\\" is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term bhakti.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 23-24 David Lorenzen states that bhakti is an important term in Sikhism and Hinduism.David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, , pages 1-2 They both share numerous concepts and core spiritual ideas, but bhakti of nirguni (devotion to divine without attributes) is particularly significant in Sikhism.Hardip Syan (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , page 178A Mandair (2011), Time and religion-making in modern Sikhism, in Time, History and the Religious Imaginary in South Asia (Editor: Anne Murphy), Routledge, , page 188-190 In Hinduism, diverse ideas continue, where both saguni and nirguni bhakti (devotion to divine with or without attributes) or alternate paths to spirituality are among the options left to the choice of a Hindu.  History  = The Upanishads = The last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word Bhakti as follows, This verse is one of the earliest use of the word Bhakti in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as \\"the love of God\\".WN Brown (1970), Man in the Universe: Some Continuities in Indian Thought, University of California Press, , pages 38-39 ScholarsPaul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 301-304Max Muller, The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages xxxii ‚Äì xlii have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms \\"Bhakti\\" and \\"Deva\\" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era. Max Muller states that the word Bhakti appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later Sandilya Sutras.Max Muller, The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages xxxiv and xxxvii Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word Deva Prasada (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶, grace or gift of God), but add that Deva in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to \\"pantheistic Brahman\\" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean \\"gift or grace of his Soul\\". Scholarly consensus sees bhakti as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Epics and Puranas era of Indian history.\\"Scholarly consensus today tends to view bhakti as a post-Vedic development that took place primarily in the watershed years of the epics and Puranas.\\" Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 17 The Bhagavad Gita is the first text to explicitly use the word \\"bhakti\\" to designate a religious path, using it as a term for one of three possible religious approaches.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 5 The Bhagavata Purana develops the idea more elaborately, while the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents evidence of guru-bhakti (devotion to one's spiritual teacher). = Bhakti movement = The Bhakti Movement was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars (\\"those immersed in God\\") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing the praises of Vishnu. They established temple sites (Srirangam is one) and converted many people to Vaishnavism. Meera (1498-1546) was one of the most significant poet-saints in the Vaishnava bhakti movement.SM Pandey (1965), Mƒ´rƒÅbƒÅƒ´ and Her Contributions to the Bhakti Movement, History of Religions, Vol. 5, No. 1, pages 54-73 Like the Alvars the Saiva Nayanar poets were influential. The Tirumurai, a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, Appar (7th century CE), Campantar (7th century) and Sundarar (9th century), were compiled into the Tevaram, the first volumes of the Tirumurai. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva. Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets are quoted the Black Yajurveda.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 17-18 The Alwars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on bhakti, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of India. Scholars state that the bhakti movement focused on the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of Islam in India about 8th century CE,Note: The earliest arrival dates are contested by scholars. They range from 7th to 9th century, with Muslim traders settling in coastal regions of Indian peninsula, to Muslims seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, to raids in northwest India by Muhammad bin Qasim. See: Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Brill Academic, , pages 3-7; Andre Wink (2004), Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Brill Academic Publishers, and subsequent religious violence. This view is contested by other scholars.John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, , pages 39-61 The Bhakti movement swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.Karine Schomer and WH McLeod (1987), The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 1-2 Bhakti poetry and ideas influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society. It extended its influence to Sufism, Christianity, and Jainism. Sikhism was founded by Nanak in the 15th century, during the bhakti movement period, and scholars call it a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy, Routledge, , page 22 The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth caste or gender. Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 10-16 They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 15-16  Types and classifications  = Bhakti Yoga = The Bhagavad Gita, variously dated to have been composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE,JD Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academy Press, , see Foreword introduces bhakti yoga in combination with karma yoga and jnana yoga, while the Bhagavata Purana expands on bhakti yoga, offering nine specific activities for the bhakti yogi.Bryant, p. 117. Bhakti in the Bhagavad Gita offered an alternative to two dominant practices of religion at the time: the isolation of the sannyasin and the practice of religious ritual.Prentiss, p. 19. Bhakti Yoga is described by Swami Vivekananda as \\"the path of systematized devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute\\". In various chapters, including the twelfth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna describes bhakti yoga as one of the paths to the highest spiritual attainments. In the sixth chapter, for example, the Gita states the following about bhakti yogi: Shandilya and Narada produced two important Bhakti texts, the Shandilya Bhakti Sutra and Narada Bhakti Sutra. They define devotion, emphasize its importance and superiority, and classify its forms. According to Ramana Maharishi, states David Frawley, bhakti is a \\"surrender to the divine with one's heart\\". It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways: # Atma-Bhakti: devotion to the one's atma (Supreme Self) # Ishvara-Bhakti: devotion to a formless being (God, Cosmic Lord) # Ishta Devata-Bhakti: devotion to a personal God or goddess # Guru-Bhakti: devotion to Guru = Bhagavata Purana and Navaratnamalika = The Navaratnamalika (garland of nine gems), nine forms of bhakti are listed: (1) ≈õrava·πáa (listening to ancient texts), (2) kƒ´rtana (praying), (3) smara·πáa (remembering teachings in ancient texts), (4) pƒÅda-sevana (service to the feet), (5) archana (worshiping), (6) namaskar or vandana (bowing to the divine), (7) dƒÅsya (service to the divine), (8) sƒÅkhyatva (friendship with the divine), and (9) ƒÅtma-nivedana (self-surrender to the divine).Vijaya Moorthy (2001), Romance of the Raga, Abhinav, , pages 72-73Ellen Koskoff (2013), The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Routledge, , pages 992-993 The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine similar facets of bhakti.Bhagavata Purana, 7.5.23-24 = Bhavas = Traditional Hinduism speaks of five different bhƒÅvas or \\"affective essences\\". In this sense, bhƒÅvas are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form. The different bhƒÅvas are: # ≈õƒÅnta, placid love for God; # dƒÅsya, the attitude of a servant; # sakhya, the attitude of a friend; # vƒÅtsalya, the attitude of a mother towards her child; # madhurya, the attitude of a woman towards her lover. Several saints are known to have practiced these bhavas. The nineteenth century mystic, Ramakrishna is said to have practiced these five bhavas. The attitude of Hanuman towards lord Rama is considered to be of dasya bhava. The attitude of Arjuna and the shepherd boys of Vrindavan towards Krishna is regarded as sakhya bhava. The attitude of Radha towards Krishna is regarded as madhura bhava. The attitude of Yashoda, who looked after Krishna during his childhood is regarded as vatsalya bhava. Caitanya-caritamrta mentions that Mahaprabhu came to distribute the four spiritual sentiments of Vraja loka: dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and sringara. Sringara is the relationship of the intimate love.  Related practices in other religions  In olden days, saints such as Mirabai, Soordas, Narsinh Mehta composed several bhajans that were a path towards Bhakti for many, that are universally sung even today. A modern age saint, Shri Devendra Ghia (Kaka) has composed about 10,000 hymns (a phenomenal task.) These hymns are related to bhakti, knowledge, devotion, faith, introspection and honesty.https://www.kakabhajans.org/ Bhatti Puja (devotional worship) is often a part of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. Devotionalism, similar to Bhakti, states Michael Pasquier, has been a common form of religious activity in world religions throughout human history.Michael Pasquier (2011), The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization, Wiley-Blackwell, , See article on Devotionalism and Devotional Literature, It is found in Christianity,L.

Stevens-Arroyo (1998), The Evolution of Marian Devotionalism within Christianity and the Ibero-Mediterranean Polity, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 37, No. 1, pages 50-73 = Buddhism = Bhakti (called bhatti in Pali language) has been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to images such the images of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas,Donald Swearer (2003), Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition (Editors: Heine and Prebish), Oxford University Press, , pages 9-25Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, , pages 109-112 or to deities such as wrathful deities. Karel Werner notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, \\"there can be no doubt that deep devotion or bhakti / bhatti does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days\\".Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, , pages 45-46 According to Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna, the meaning of bhatti changed throughout Buddhist history, however. In early Buddhism, such as in the text TheragƒÅthƒÅ, bhatti had the meaning of 'faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion', and was accompanied with knowledge. In later text tradition, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion. Examples of the latter include the veneration of Buddha Amitabha and those in the Saddharmapundrarika Sutra. This changed the meaning of Buddhist devotion to a more person-centered sense, similar to a theist sense used in Hindu scriptures. This sense of devotion was no longer connected with a belief in a religious system, and had little place for doubt, contradicting the early Buddhist concept of saddhƒÅ. SaddhƒÅ did not exclude reasonable doubt on the spiritual path, and was a step in reaching the final aim of developing wisdom, not an end in itself. In early Buddhism, states Sanath Nanayakkara, the concept of taking refuge to the Buddha had the meaning of taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender. But already in the Commentary to the Abhidhamma text Puggalapa√±√±atti, it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his saddhƒÅ until it becomes bhaddi, a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of bhakti. There are instances where commentator Buddhaghosa mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning. Similar developments took place with regard to the term puja (honor) and the role of the Buddha image. In MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, the doctrine of the trikƒÅya (three bodies) and the devotion towards Bodhisattvas all indicating a shift of emphasis toward devotion as a central concept in later Buddhism. In later faith-oriented literature, such as the AvadƒÅnas, faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, faith (≈õraddhƒÅ) is discussed in different contexts than devotion (bhakti). Bhakti is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist. Also, bhakti is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas ≈õraddhƒÅ is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth. ≈öraddhƒÅ focuses on ideas such as the working of karma and merit transfer. Nevertheless, affective devotion is an important part of Buddhist practice, not only in MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. According to Winston King, a scholar on TheravƒÅda Buddhism in Myanmar, \\"warm, personalized, emotional\\" bhakti has been a part of the Burmese Buddhist tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals. The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhist, just like Catholics treasure Jesus. The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, \\"a very deeply devotional quality\\" was and remains a part of the actual practice. This is observable, states King, in \\"multitudes of pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images\\" and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else. Another example is the worship of the Bodhisattvas and various deities in Tibetan and other traditions of Buddhism, including the so-called wrathful deities. = Jainism = Bhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (Jina) and human gurus have been venerated with offerings, songs and ƒÄratƒ´ prayers.John Cort, Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 64-68, 86-90, 100-112 Jainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature (stavan) though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition. The Avasyaka sutra of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of \\"hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras\\" as the second Obligatory Action. It explains this bhakti as one of the means to destroy negative karma. According to Paul Dundas, such textual references to devotional activity suggests that bhakti was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period. According to Jeffery Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of bhakti or devotion just like their Hindu neighbors. The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers. Abhisekha, festival prayers, community recitals and Murti puja (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice.

From Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC. He is one of the most prominent of the sixty-three Nayanars of the Saiva bhakti movement. The Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism and later acted as the de facto catalyst to the formation of Sikhism. It originated in eighth- century south India (now Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards. It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE. The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, and some sub-sects were Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism.Lance Nelson (2007), An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies (Editors: Orlando O.

The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta. The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth or gender. The Bhakti movement began with the aim of reforming Hinduism. Postmodern scholars question this traditional view and whether the Bhakti movement ever was a reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of ancient Vedic traditions. Bhakti refers to passionate devotion (to a deity). Scriptures of the Bhakti movement include the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavata Purana and Padma Purana.Catherine Robinson (2005), Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and Images of the Hindu Tradition, Routledge, , pages 28-30 Terminology The Sanskrit word bhakti is derived from the root , which means \\"divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to\\". The word also means \\"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\\".Monier Monier-Williams, Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, page 743bhakti Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany The meaning of the term Bhakti is analogous to but different from Kama. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection. Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement. Bhakti movement in Hinduism refers to ideas and engagement that emerged in the medieval era on love and devotion to religious concepts built around one or more gods and goddesses. Bhakti movement preached against the caste system using the local languages so that the message reached the masses. One who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Textual roots Ancient Indian texts, dated to be from the 1st millennium BCE, such as the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad and the Bhagavad Gita mention Bhakti. =Shvetashvatara Upanishad= A copper alloy sculpture of a Shiva Bhakti practitioner from Tamil Nadu (11th Century or later). The last of three epilogue verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, 6.23, uses the word Bhakti as follows, This verse is notable for the use of the word Bhakti, and has been widely cited as among the earliest mentions of \\"the love of God\\".WN Brown (1970), Man in the Universe: Some Continuities in Indian Thought, University of California Press, , pages 38-39 ScholarsPaul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 301-304Max Muller, The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages xxxii - xlii have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms \\"Bhakti\\" and \\"God\\" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the medieval and modern era Bhakti traditions found in India. Max Muller states that the word Bhakti appears only in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later insertion and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later Sandilya Sutras.Max Muller, The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages xxxiv and xxxvii Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 is also notable for its use of the word Deva Prasada (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶, grace or gift of God), but add that Deva in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to \\"pantheistic Brahman\\" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean \\"gift or grace of his Soul\\". Doris SrinivasanD Srinivasan (1997), Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes, Brill, , pages 96-97 and Chapter 9 states that the Upanishad is a treatise on theism, but it creatively embeds a variety of divine images, an inclusive language that allows \\"three Vedic definitions for personal deity\\". The Upanishad includes verses wherein God can be identified with the Supreme (Brahman-Atman, Self, Soul) in Vedanta monistic theosophy, verses that support dualistic view of Samkhya doctrines, as well as the synthetic novelty of triple Brahman where a triune exists as the divine soul (Deva, theistic God), individual soul (self) and nature (Prakrti, matter). Tsuchida writes that the Upanishad syncretically combines monistic ideas in Upanishad and self-development ideas in Yoga with personification of Shiva-Rudra deity. Hiriyanna interprets the text to be introducing \\"personal theism\\" in the form of Shiva Bhakti, with a shift to monotheism but in henotheistic context where the individual is encouraged to discover his own definition and sense of God.M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 32-36 =Bhagavad Gita= The Bhagavad Gita, a post-Vedic scripture composed in 5th to 2nd century BCE, introduces bhakti marga (the path of faith/devotion) as one of three ways to spiritual freedom and release, the other two being karma marga (the path of works) and jnana marga (the path of knowledge). In verses 6.31 through 6.47 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna as an avatar of deity Vishnu, describes bhakti yoga and loving devotion, as one of the several paths to the highest spiritual attainments.Christopher Key Chapple (Editor) and Winthrop Sargeant (Translator), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth‚ÄìAnniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, , pages 302-303, 318 =Sutras= Shandilya and Narada are credited with two Bhakti texts, the Shandilya Bhakti Sutra and Narada Bhakti Sutra. History Meerabai is considered as one of the most significant sants in the Vaishnava bhakti movement. She was from a 16th- century aristocratic family in Rajasthan. The Bhakti movement originated in South India during the seventh to eighth century CE, spread northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and gained wide acceptance in fifteenth-century Bengal and northern India. The movement started with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars, who lived between 5th and 9th century CE. Their efforts ultimately helped spread bhakti poetry and ideas throughout India by the 12th‚Äì18th century CE. The Alvars, which literally means \\"those immersed in God\\", were Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they travelled from one place to another. They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. r poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on bhakti, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of India. Like the Alvars, the Saiva Nayanar poets were influential. The Tirumurai, a compilation of hymns on Shiva by sixty-three Nayanar poet-saints, developed into an influential scripture in Shaivism. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread spiritual ideas built around Shiva. Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets influenced Hindu texts that came to be revered all over India. Some scholars state that the Bhakti movement's rapid spread in India in the 2nd millennium, was in part a response to the arrival of IslamNote: The earliest arrival dates are contested by scholars. They range from 7th to 9th century, with Muslim traders settling in coastal regions of Indian peninsula, to Muslims seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, to raids in northwest India by Muhammad bin Qasim. See: Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Brill Academic, , pages 3-7; Andre Wink (2004), Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Brill Academic Publishers, and subsequent Islamic rule in India and Hindu- Muslim conflicts.Karen Pechelis (2011), \\"Bhakti Traditions\\", in The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies (Editors: Jessica Frazier, Gavin Flood), Bloomsbury, , pages 107-121 This view is contested by some scholars, with Rekha Pande stating that singing ecstatic bhakti hymns in local language was a tradition in south India before Muhammad was born. According to Pande, the psychological impact of Muslim conquest may have initially contributed to community-style bhakti by Hindus.Rekha Pande (2014), Divine Sounds from the Heart‚ÄîSinging Unfettered in their Own Voices, Cambridge UK, , page 25 Yet other scholars state that Muslim invasions, their conquering of Hindu Bhakti temples in south India and seizure/melting of musical instruments such as cymbals from local people, was in part responsible for the later relocation or demise of singing Bhakti traditions in the 18th century.Vasudha Narayanan (1994), The Vernacular Veda: Revelation, Recitation, and Ritual, The University of South Carolina Press, , page 84 According to Wendy Doniger, the nature of Bhakti movement may have been affected by the \\"surrender to God\\" daily practices of Islam when it arrived in India. In turn it influenced devotional practices in Islam such as Sufism, and other religions in India from 15th century onwards, such as Sikhism, Christianity,Stephen Neill (2002), A history of Christianity in India, 1707-1858, Cambridge University Press, , page 412 and Jainism.Mary Kelting (2001), Singing to the Jinas: Jain laywomen, Ma·πá·∏ça·∏∑ singing, and the negotiations of Jain devotion, Oxford University Press, page 87, Klaus Witz, in contrast, traces the history and nature of Bhakti movement to the Upanishadic and the Vedanta foundations of Hinduism. He writes, that in virtually every Bhakti movement poet, \\"the Upanishadic teachings form an all-pervasive substratum, if not a basis. We have here a state of affairs that has no parallel in the West. Supreme Wisdom, which can be taken as basically non-theistic and as an independent wisdom tradition (not dependent on the Vedas), appears fused with highest level of bhakti and with highest level of God realization.\\"Klaus G Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 10 =Poets, writers and musicians= The Bhakti movement witnessed a surge in Hindu literature in regional languages, particularly in the form of devotional poems and music.Guy Beck (2011), Sonic Liturgy: Ritual and Music in Hindu Tradition, The University of South Carolina Press, , Chapters 3 and 4David Kinsley (1979), The Divine Player: A Study of K·πõ·π£·πáa Lƒ´lƒÅ, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 190-204 This literature includes the writings of the Alvars and Nayanars, poems of Andal, Basava, Bhagat Pipa, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Kabir, Nanak (founder of Sikhism), Tulsidas, Nabha Dass, Gusainji, Ghananand, Ramananda (founder of Ramanandi Sampradaya), Sripadarajaa, Vyasatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanakadasa, Vijaya Dasa, Six Goswamis of Vrindavan,Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, , pages 2‚Äì3, 53-81Raskhan,Rupert Snell (1991), The Hindi Classical Tradition: A Braj BhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ Reader, Routledge, , pages 39-40 Ravidas, Jayadeva Goswami, Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram, Mirabai, Ramprasad Sen,Rachel McDermott (2001), Singing to the Goddess: Poems to KƒÅlƒ´ and UmƒÅ from Bengal, Oxford University Press, , pages 8-9 Sankardev,Maheswar Neog (1995), Early History of the Vai·π£·πáava Faith and Movement in Assam: ≈öa·πÖkaradeva and his times, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 1-4 Vallabha Acharya, Narsinh Mehta, Gangasati and the teachings of saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The earliest writers from the 7th to 10th century CE known to have influenced the poet-saints driven movements include, Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar, Nammalvar, Adi Shankara, Manikkavacakar and Nathamuni. Several 11th and 12th century writers developed different philosophies within the Vedanta school of Hinduism, which were influential to the Bhakti tradition in medieval India. These include Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha and Nimbarka.Richard Kieckhefer and George Bond (1990), Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions, University of California Press, , pages 116-122Axel Michaels (2003), Hinduism: Past and Present, Princeton University Press, , pages 62-65 These writers championed a spectrum of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism, qualified nondualism and absolute monism. Philosophy: Nirguna and Saguna Brahman The Bhakti movement of Hinduism saw two ways of imaging the nature of the divine (Brahman) ‚Äì Nirguna and Saguna. Nirguna Brahman was the concept of the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality. Saguna Brahman, in contrast, was envisioned and developed as with form, attributes and quality. The two had parallels in the ancient pantheistic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from Nirguni knowledge-focus and other from Saguni love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita. Nirguna bhakta's poetry were Jnana-shrayi, or had roots in knowledge. Saguna bhakta's poetry were Prema-shrayi, or with roots in love. In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee. Jeaneane Fowler states that the concepts of Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, at the root of Bhakti movement theosophy, underwent more profound development with the ideas of Vedanta school of Hinduism, particularly those of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, and Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta. Two 12th-century influential treatises on bhakti were Sandilya Bhakti Sutra ‚Äì a treatise resonating with Nirguna-bhakti, and Narada Bhakti Sutra ‚Äì a treatise that leans towards Saguna-bhakti.Jessica Frazier and Gavin Flood (2011), The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, Bloomsbury Academic, , pages 113-115 Nirguna and Saguna Brahman concepts of the Bhakti movement has been a baffling one to scholars, particularly the Nirguni tradition because it offers, states David Lorenzen, \\"heart-felt devotion to a God without attributes, without even any definable personality\\". Yet given the \\"mountains of Nirguni bhakti literature\\", adds Lorenzen, bhakti for Nirguna Brahman has been a part of the reality of the Hindu tradition along with the bhakti for Saguna Brahman.David Lorenzen (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, , page 2 These were two alternate ways of imagining God during the bhakti movement. Social impact The Bhakti movement was a devotional transformation of medieval Hindu society, wherein Vedic rituals or alternatively ascetic monk-like lifestyle for moksha gave way to individualistic loving relationship with a personally defined god. Salvation which was previously considered attainable only by men of Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya castes, became available to everyone. Most scholars state that Bhakti movement provided women and members of the Shudra and untouchable communities an inclusive path to spiritual salvation. Some scholars disagree that the Bhakti movement was premised on such social inequalities. Poet-saints grew in popularity, and literature on devotional songs in regional languages became profuse. These poet-saints championed a wide range of philosophical positions within their society, ranging from the theistic dualism of Dvaita to the absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta. Kabir, a poet-saint for example, wrote in Upanishadic style, the state of knowing truth: The early 15th-century Bhakti poet-sant Pipa stated,Nirmal Dass (2000), Songs of the Saints from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, , pages 181-184 The impact of the Bhakti movement in India was similar to that of the Protestant Reformation of Christianity in Europe. It evoked shared religiosity, direct emotional and intellection of the divine, and the pursuit of spiritual ideas without the overhead of institutional superstructures. Practices emerged bringing new forms of spiritual leadership and social cohesion among the medieval Hindus, such as community singing, chanting together of deity names, festivals, pilgrimages, rituals relating to Saivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, , pages 22-23, 107-118 Many of these regional practices have survived into the modern era. =Seva, daana and community kitchens= The Bhakti movement introduced new forms of voluntary social giving such as seva (service, for example to a temple or guru school or community construction), dƒÅna (charity), and community kitchens with free shared food.Jill Mourdaunt et al, Thoughtful Fundraising: Concepts, Issues and Perspectives, Routledge, , pages 20-21 Of community kitchen concepts, the vegetarian Guru ka Langar introduced by Nanak became a well established institution over time, starting with northwest India, and expanding to everywhere Sikh communities are found.Gene Thursby (1992), The Sikhs, Brill Academic, , page 12 Other saints such as Dadu Dayal championed similar social movement, a community that believed in Ahimsa (non-violence) towards all living beings, social equality, and vegetarian kitchen, as well as mutual social service concepts. Bhakti temples and matha (Hindu monasteries) of India adopted social functions such as relief to victims after natural disaster, helping the poor and marginal farmers, providing community labor, feeding houses for the poor, free hostels for poor children and promoting folk culture.Helmut Anheier and Stefan Toepler (2009), International Encyclopedia of Civil Society, Springer, , page 1169 Sikhism, Shakti and Bhakti movement Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy, Routledge, , page 22 In Sikhism, \\"nirguni Bhakti\\" is emphasised ‚Äì devotion to a divine without Gunas (qualities or form),Hardip Syan (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , page 178A Mandair (2011), \\"Time and religion-making in modern Sikhism\\", in Time, History and the Religious Imaginary in South Asia (Editor: Anne Murphy), Routledge, , page 188-190 but it accepts both nirguni and saguni forms of the divine.Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious and Philosophies: Anthropomorphism and Divinity, Atlantic, , page 305 The Guru Granth Sahib, the scripture of the Sikhs, contains the hymns of the Sikh gurus, fourteen Hindu bhagats, and one Muslim bhagats.E Nesbitt (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , pages 360-369 Some of the Bhagats whose hymns were included in the Guru Granth Sahib, were bhakti poets who taught their ideas before the birth of Guru Nanak ‚Äì the first of Sikh Guru. The fourteen Hindu bhagats whose hymns were entered into the text, were poet saints of the Bhakti movement, and included Kabir Saheb Namdev, Pipa, Ravidas, Beni, Bhikhan, Dhanna, Jayadeva, Parmanand, Sadhana, Sain, Surdas, Trilochan, while the one Muslim bhagats was Sufi saint Farid.Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious and Philosophies: Anthropomorphism and Divinity, Atlantic, , page 302; HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, , page 8 Most of the 5,894 hymns in the Sikh scripture came from the Sikh gurus, and rest from the Bhagats. The three highest contributions in the Sikh scripture of non-Sikh bhagats were from Bhagat Kabir (292 hymns), Bhagat Farid (134 hymns), and Bhagat Namdev (60 hymns). While Sikhism was influenced by Bhakti movement, Quote: \\"Historically, Sikh religion derives from this nirguni current of bhakti religion\\"Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , page 35, Quote: \\"Technically this would place the Sikh community's origins at a much further remove than 1469, perhaps to the dawning of the Sant movement, which possesses clear affinities to Guru Nanak's thought sometime in the tenth century. The predominant ideology of the Sant parampara in turn corresponds in many respects to the much wider devotional Bhakti tradition in northern India.\\"Sikhism, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2014), Quote: \\"In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the Sant tradition of northern India,\\" and incorporated hymns from the Bhakti poet saints, it was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement. Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some of the views of Bhakti saints Kabir and Ravidas.These views include Sikhs believing in achieving blissful mukhti while alive, Sikhs placing emphasis on the path of the householder, Sikhs disbelief in Ahinsa, and the Sikhs afterlife aspect of merging with God rather than a physical heaven. Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism, was a Bhakti saint. He taught, states Jon Mayled, that the most important form of worship is Bhakti. Nam-simran ‚Äì the realisation of God ‚Äì is an important Bhakti practice in Sikhism. Guru Arjan, in his Sukhmani Sahib, recommended the true religion is one of loving devotion to God. The Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib includes suggestions for a Sikh to perform constant Bhakti. The Bhakti themes in Sikhism also incorporate Shakti (power) ideas. Some Sikh sects outside the Punjab-region of India, such as those found in Maharashtra and Bihar, practice Aarti with lamps in a Gurdwara. Arti and devotional prayer ceremonies are also found in Ravidassia religion, previously part of Sikhism. Buddhism, Jainism and Bhakti movement Bhakti has been a prevalent practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (Jina) and human gurus are considered superior beings and venerated with offerings, songs and ƒÄratƒ´ prayers. John Cort suggests that the bhakti movement in later Hinduism and Jainism may share roots in vandan and pujan concepts of the Jaina tradition.John Cort, Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 64-68, 86-90, 100-112 Medieval-era bhakti traditions among non- theistic Indian traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism have been reported by scholars, wherein the devotion and prayer ceremonies were dedicated to an enlightened guru, primarily Buddha and Jina Mahavira respectively, as well as others.Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, , pages 109-112 Karel Werner notes that Bhatti (Bhakti in Pali) has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, \\"there can be no doubt that deep devotion or bhakti / bhatti does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days\\".Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, , pages 45-46 Christianity Bhakti, according to William Dyrness, has been a \\"point of convergence\\" between Christian gospel tradition and the Hindu devotional tradition. It has helped Indian Christians devote themselves to God as distinct from his creation, and as a personal being to love, to expect grace from, through self-giving devotion.William A. Dyrness, Veli-Matti K√§rkk√§inen (editors), Global Dictionary of Theology: A Resource for the Worldwide Church, Inter Varsity Press, Nottingham, 2008, p.422 Songs were composed by poets such as A.J. Appasamy, Sadhu Sundar Singh and other early converts in the early twentieth century that were rich in lyrics and brought out the mysticism, legends and meaning of Christianity. According to Kugler, some of the pioneers of bhakti in Christian sects in India include Murari David.Anna Sarah Kugler, Guntur Mission Hospital, Guntur, India, Women's Missionary Society, The United Lutheran Church in America, 1928, p.39 Controversy and doubts in postmodern scholarship Postmodern scholars question whether the 19th- and early 20th-century theories about Bhakti movement in India, its origin, nature and history is accurate. Pechilis in her book on Bhakti movement, for example, states: Madeleine Biardeau states, as does Jeanine Miller, that Bhakti movement was neither a reform nor a sudden innovation, but the continuation and expression of ideas to be found in Vedas, Bhakti marga teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, the Katha Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad.Madeleine Biardeau (1994), Hinduism: The Anthropology of a Civilization (Original: French), Oxford University Press, (English Translation by Richard Nice), pages 89-91J Miller (1996), Does Bhakti appear in the Rgveda?: An enquiry into the background of the hymns, ; see also J Miller (1995), in Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism (Editor: Karel Werner), Routledge, , pages 5, 8-9, 11-32 John Stratton Hawley describes recent scholarship which questions the old theory of Bhakti movement origin and \\"story of south-moves-north\\", then states that the movement had multiple origins, mentioning Brindavan in north India as another center. Hawley describes the controversy and disagreements between Indian scholars, quotes Hegde's concern that \\"Bhakti movement was a reform\\" theory has been supported by \\"cherry-picking particular songs from a large corpus of Bhakti literature\\" and that if the entirety of the literature by any single author such as Basava is considered along with its historical context, there is neither reform nor a need for reform. Sheldon Pollock writes that the Bhakti movement was neither a rebellion against Brahmins and the upper castes nor a rebellion against the Sanskrit language, because many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins and from upper castes, and because much of the early and later Bhakti poetry and literature was in Sanskrit.Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, , pages 423-431 Further, states Pollock, evidence of Bhakti trends in ancient southeast Asian Hinduism in the 1st millennium CE, such as those in Cambodia and Indonesia where Vedic era is unknown, and where upper caste Tamil Hindu nobility and merchants introduced Bhakti ideas of Hinduism, suggest the roots and the nature of Bhakti movement to be primarily spiritual and political quest instead of rebellion of some form.Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, , pages 529-534Keat Gin Ooi (2004), Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, , page 587 John Guy states that the evidence of Hindu temples and Chinese inscriptions from 8th century CE about Tamil merchants, presents Bhakti motifs in Chinese trading towns, particularly the Kaiyuan Temple (Quanzhou). These show Saivite, Vaishnavite and Hindu Brahmin monasteries revered Bhakti themes in China.John Guy (2001), The Emporium of the World: Maritime Quanzhou, 1000-1400 (Editor: Angela Schottenhammer), Brill Academic, , pages 283-299 Scholars increasingly are dropping, states Karen Pechilis, the old premises and the language of \\"radical otherness, monotheism and reform of orthodoxy\\" for Bhakti movement. Many scholars are now characterising the emergence of Bhakti in medieval India as a revival, reworking and recontextualisation of the central themes of the Vedic traditions.

It ran from 1976 to 1994 in newspapers, though unpublished strips continued to appear in book form until 2000. Altogether there are 27 numbered books (collecting the newspaper strips, with additional material), a further 8 books collecting the Sunday newspaper strips, and 5 smaller 'pocket' books of original material, plus various related publications. There was also a stage musical, an animated feature film called Footrot Flats: the Dog's ~~Tail~~ Tale, and even a theme park in Auckland, New Zealand. The strip reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s, with the books selling millions of copies in Australasia. The comic's protagonist is a border collie sheepdog, called \\"Dog\\", owned by Wal Footrot, who runs a sheep and cattle farm called Footrot Flats near the fictional rural town of Raupo in New Zealand. The comic depicts the trials and tribulations of Wal, the Dog and other characters, human and animal, that come into their lives. The Dog's thoughts are voiced in thought bubbles, though he is clearly \\"just a dog\\", unlike the heavily anthropomorphised creatures of some other comics or animation. The humour draws on the foibles of the characters, which many farmers found easy to recognise around them. There was much \\"humour in adversity\\", making fun of the daily struggle that permeates farming life. The depictions of the animals are quite realistic and detailed, with a dose of comic anthropomorphism superimposed without spoiling the farming realism. History Footrot Flats was initially rejected for syndication by both The New Zealand Herald and The Auckland Star. It was first accepted in 1976 by Mike Robson, editor of Wellington's The Evening Post. The strip appeared in hundreds of newspapers in Australasia and also gained an international following, especially in Denmark. The strip's leading human character, Wal Footrot, is based on Murray Ball's cousin Arthur Waugh, who was a sheep shearer around the time of the strip's inception and went on to own a 2,100-hectare farm situated east of Pahiatua in the southeastern North Island of New Zealand. Ball cited different reasons for quitting the strip, including the death of his own dog, and his displeasure with the direction of New Zealand politics. Among the strip's fans were Peanuts creator Charles Schulz and Garfield creator Jim Davis. Main characters A scene from a 1978 Footrot Flats comic strip - showing Wal and The Dog A graffiti tribute to Murray Ball's comic strip Footrot Flats, on Big King Reserve in Auckland ; \\"The Dog\\" : The main character of the series, a Border Collie, he considers himself tough and brave, but is quite soft and sometimes cowardly. His real name, chosen by Wal's Aunt Dolly, has never been revealed. He despises this \\"refined, aristocratic name\\" and goes to great lengths to censor it. Wal always calls him \\"Dog\\", gaining his loyal devotion. The Dog was born on October 13 at Aunt Dolly's holiday home for cats and raised by a Persian cat named Ninky Poo before being given to Wal. He is a competent sheepdog and is often put to work to guard things or get rid of rats or pigs, but Border Collies have an independent streak and the Dog's is a mile wide. He is fond of rabbits, afraid of hares and dislikes seeing trees being cut down. He has several alter egos: \\"The Scarlet Manuka\\" who attempts to 'liberate' cricket balls, \\"Mitey Iron Paw\\", and \\"the Grey Ghost of The Forest\\". The Dog has claimed to have the following commendations: V.C. (Very Cute), D.S.O. (Doesn't Steal Offal), and B.A.R (What Sheep Do), along with the alias of '00Dog' (Licensed to be kind but fair). He usually attempts to act as a 'chaperone' on Wal's dates with \\"Cheeky\\" Hobson, leading to disaster for Wal. ; Wallace Cadwallader \\"Wal\\" Footrot : Wallace Footrot was born on 26 January in Northern Manawatu. He was educated at Apiti Primary School and later Foxton Agricultural High, where he excelled at tractor reversing and rooster imitations. Wallace established an outstanding relationship with muscovy ducks, but unfortunately failed completely with geese. Indeed, he seemed to have an uncanny knack of irritating them. Wallace took a full part in all school activities. He displayed a promising right cross during his time in the front row of the 2nd XV, but was unable to transfer this ability to the boxing ring. He rather let the side down during the inter-school championships by throwing in the sponge, which knocked the referee's glasses crooked. He was disqualified. On leaving school, he acquired of swamp between the Ureweras and the sea. He is unmarried, although he has an interest in Darlene \\"Cheeky\\" Hobson, who works as a hairdresser in Raupo. Wal plays rugby union for Raupo, where he is a hooker and dreams of representing New Zealand's national team, the All Blacks. The Raupo XV often play against the Mill team, whose star player is Wal's sleazy neighbour, 'Spit' Murphy, who also competes for Cheeky's affections. ; Socrates \\"Cooch\\" Windgrass : Wal's neighbour and best friend. Cooch has compassion for all living creatures and nature, and thus has a natural affinity with animals. But he is no vegetarian. His family owns 1,000 acres of swamp, tussock, scrub, forest and mudflat. A cabbage tree grows through his verandah floor, while a puriri tree has pushed his house crooked. Cooch owns the Dog's girlfriend Jess and a pet magpie called Pew. Cooch never drives a tractor, preferring to plod along on his Clydesdales. He helps Wal with fencing, shearing and other farm jobs. He is unmarried but has a crush on his cousin Kathy. Murray Ball describes Cooch as 'eccentric, NOT an idiot!', having based the character on two people he knows. ; Dolores Monrovia Godwit \\"Aunt Dolly\\" Footrot: Wal's aunt (by marriage). She was born in Cambridge, Waikato, and was the second daughter of Englishman Edward George Bogg and New Zealander Fiona Godwit Symington. She was educated at Lady Hinema Sacks- Grenville School for Young Ladies and was a prefect, captain of hockey, lacrosse, and boxing. She married beneath her station to Arch' \\"Toey\\" Footrot, a barber and unlicensed bookie, who was Wal's father's older brother. Unfortunately, Toey ran off to Australia with \\"a dumb but decorative darts stall owner with masses of black hair\\". Aunt Dolly's first cat was Archibald II. She owns a cat home (where Dog was born) on Prince Phillip Drive in Tauranga. She is conservative, reveres the British monarchy, always addresses people by their proper names, and she disapproves of Wal's relationship with Cheeky Hobson. Beneath her strictness she has a kind heart and takes to mothering abandoned lambs in the winter. Dog despises her for giving him his name. ; Darlene \\"Cheeky\\" Hobson : Wal's girlfriend. She is the proprietor of La Parisienne Hairdressing Salon in Raupo. Cheeky is despised by the Dog, who is always looking for ways to come between her and Wal. She has two younger sisters, Belinda (Book 10) and Avril (Books 14 and 24), also both disliked by the Dog. Near the end of the strip's run, Cheeky and Wal become engaged, much to the dismay of the Dog and Aunt Dolly, but at the last minute Cheeky dumps Wal to move to Los Angeles with a male stripper. She is first mentioned in Wal's mini-biography at the start of Book 1 (September 1978), but does not appear until Book 3 (July 1980). ; Horse: A large, fierce and practically invulnerable tomcat, based on a cat that lived on Murray Ball's farm. He is a menace to the Dog and the other characters, resisting attempts to be tamed. He has a girlfriend (Fred, first mentioned in Book 9, first appears in Book 11) who has tattooed ears, lives with a biker gang and loves leather. He occasionally fathers kittens. Horse \\"spoke\\" infrequently in the earlier comics, but subsequently communicated via actions and yowls. Horse has saved the Dog and Jess from the local rat population at the Murphy farm. Book 7 is dedicated to the real Horse and begins with an elegy, followed by a eulogy penned by Murray Ball to commemorate the irascible cat's passing. First appearance: Book 2 (August 1979). ; Janice \\"Pongo\\" Footrot : Wal's niece, daughter of Rex Footrot. She ages during the books. She starts off as a stereotypical little girl, dressing up the Dog, putting him in a pram and playing dolls; however, she slowly turns into a strong feminist. Despite being a \\"town\\" girl and attending boarding school, she is unafraid of wildlife and assists with mustering and other farm work. She insists her nickname Pongo derives from her ping pong skills, not because she ponged as a baby. First appearance: Book 3 (July 1980). ; Prince Charles: A very spoiled Welsh Corgi owned by Aunt Dolly. Has a higher view on life from listening to Aunt Dolly and living indoors. Often there are \\"class\\" clashes between him and Dog. He sometimes lusts after Jess but is even more fond of fine canine cuisine. In Book 12, he is asked to \\"service\\" a female corgi named Penelope Penrose IV, but fails to rise to the occasion, leaving Major to do the job at night. The Dog usually has to explain to Prince Charles the rougher aspects of farm life, like livestock mating and maggots eating mutton without gravy. Prince Charles is territorial when on his own turf. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981). ; Rangi Wiremu Waka Jones : A local boy who often appears on the farm to give Wal a hand, he also plays with Pongo when she visits during holidays. Despite his short stature, he is a skilled rugby player, often getting the better of Wal. Rangi's father is an abattoir slaughterman and his mother teaches at Raupo School. In his first appearance, Rangi considers skinning the Dog to make a fur coat. As a testimony to Murray Ball's skill as an artist, the character of Rangi grew up over the years, appearing slightly older in each book from being a little kid to a teenager. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981). The characters are invariably known by their nicknames, such as Cooch, Pongo, Rangi, and Aunt Dolly. However, Aunt Dolly never uses the nicknames and always addresses them by their proper names. Minor characters ; Jess : Cooch's dog. She is the Dog's girlfriend and co-parent. Despite frequently being confined to the \\"Bitch's Box\\" when \\"on heat\\", she has had several litters of puppies with the Dog. The Dog's ~~Tail~~ Tale contains the story of their meeting as puppies, although Jess's letter at the start of Book 5 gives a different account of the first time they saw each other. First appearance: Book 1 (September 1978). ; Major: Wal's first dog. A pig-hunting dog, he is stern and tough. He has some fondness for Dog, saving him from the Murphys' dogs. First appearance: Book 1. ; Cecil the Ram : An aged stud ram, who lacks zest for the task of servicing Wal's ewes. He soon rediscovers his libido when Wal sharpens the butchery knife. As the books progress, Cecil's appearance becomes increasingly decrepit. First appearance: Book 2 (August 1979). ; Rex \\"Chicken\\" Footrot : Wal's younger brother and Pongo's father, he lives in town and is a potter. He has a young son named Mad Mick, who rarely visits the farm. Rex is better than Wal at just about every sport, much to Wal's annoyance. He owns Boobsie, the Dog's mum, and also owned Flash, the Dog's father, whose death was announced in Book 14. First appearance: Book 3 (July 1980). ; Pew : Cooch's pet magpie. Orphaned when Wal cut down his parents' macrocarpa tree; socially confused and always seeking revenge on Wal. Wal gave Pew to Cooch as a birthday present - the first time Wal ever remembered it - to get rid of him, but Pew's revenge continues. Cooch became a surrogate mother for Pew, coaching him in the way of birds as best he can. In Book 14, Pew falls in love with and abducts Cheeky Hobson's pet budgerigar, Little Twinkle, which is then eaten by Horse. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981). ; Puti Puti : Rangi's cousin. A city slicker from Porirua, she often carries a boombox on her shoulder and invariably suffers culture shock when visiting the farm. In Book 25, she brings her pit bull terrier, Terror, to the farm. First appearance: Book 10 (September 1985). ; Kathy : A beautiful, occasional visitor to Cooch's farm. Her face remains a mystery, as she is almost always drawn facing away from the reader. The exception is in Book 27, when her visage is only partially obscured by Spit Murphy's arm. Kathy is loved by everyone, including the Dog, and especially Cooch; much to his heartbreak, as they are first cousins. In the final book of the series, Kathy tells Cooch that she loves him and gives him a passionate kiss. First appearance: Book 8 (September 1983). ; Stewart \\"Irish\\" Murphy : Wal's other neighbour; a brutish man who does not welcome visitors and shoots any dog that strays onto his property, Blackwater Station, or mercifully hangs them by their hind legs on a fence. Once he did this to Prince Charles and lived to regret it when Aunt Dolly found out. Always filthy (\\"health warning: do not approach this man downwind\\"), probably due to farming numerous pigs, which cause Wal plenty of grief. He has two loutish sons, Spit and Hunk. He is first mentioned in Cooch's introduction to Book 3, his pigs first appear in the same book, but he and his sons do not appear until Book 9 (October 1984). ; Elvis \\"Spit\\" Murphy : The brighter of Irish Murphy's two sons, Spit is described by the Dog as \\"a sort of rural John Travolta with smaller lips and bigger jeans\\". He is Wal's rival in rugby and romance. He is also interested in Cooch's cousin Kathy. ; Ronald \\"Hunk\\" Murphy : Irish Murphy's large, slow-witted and aggressive son. He is described by the Dog as \\"fat, pink and smelly\\". His nephew Lex Murphy (first appearance: Book 11) sometimes fights with Rangi. ; \\"Irish\\" Murphy's pigs : A fearsome gang of three to six enormous beasts. Often lurking in the nearby river, causing consternation to unsuspecting fishermen and dogs. Always ravenous, they once defeated and ate some large sharks that swam up the estuary. ; Tiger, Wolf and Creampuff, \\"Irish\\" Murphy's pig-dogs : They often terrorize the Dog, who seeks help from Wal, Horse or Major. Now and then, the Dog tries to take on all three of them at once. Creampuff is a bull terrier. ; Hermit Ram \\"The Buffalo\\" : This long unshorn ram has left the mob and lives in the farm's wild scrub. He sometimes shows interest in the ewes, and Dog is sent to pursue him, but without success. First appearance: Book 11. ; The Goat: One of the toughest animals on the farm, the Goat is usually tethered to a chain in Wal's garden. Wal bought him to keep the grass down, but the Goat prefers eating fruit trees and footy socks, and chasing the Dog and Wal. At one point, Wal tries in vain to sell the Goat and then decides to kill it, but cannot, exclaiming \\"Dammit, I know this goat!\\". First appearance: Book 1. ; The Goose : Another character introduced in the first Footrot Flats book, the goose occasionally stalks Wal and pecks his posterior whenever possible. In the film \\"The Dog's Tale\\", the goose attempts to peck Wal and finally gets his chance when Wal rescues Irish Murphy from a river. ; Cooch's goats : A cunning pack of goats that uses gang tactics to annoy Wal. For example, if Wal plants trees behind a fence, Cooch's goats will stand on each other to get over and eat them. The Dog hates mustering Cooch's goats. ; Other hostile animals : In the early books, the Dog's main tormentors were the turkey, goat and pigs (Boris and Dolores). In one strip in Book 4, the goose is chasing Wal and the turkey is chasing the Dog, but Wal kicks the turkey and the Dog jumps on the goose's neck, then Wal and the Dog celebrate their partnership.  Sport  Sport plays a major part in Footrot Flats. Wal plays all sorts of sports including cricket, golf, fishing, rugby union, tennis and snooker. The Dog often plays with Wal, sometimes helping him, sometimes embarrassing him and sometimes being exploited. Wal can never beat his younger brother Rex in any sport. Wal plays for the Raupo rugby club as a hooker and is often seen playing and training in the strip. At one point Wal was replaced by a younger man as he was getting too old, but the younger player wasn't as good. The final few strips ever drawn involve an unlikely chain of events which culminate in Wal somehow scoring a try against a touring international rugby side. Wal also coaches the Raupo School rugby team, with Rangi being one of its more prominent members and the Dog serving as mascot (a duty he takes seriously, often blaming himself if the team loses). In the cricket season, Wal plays for an unnamed team as an all-rounder, although he is sometimes pictured as the wicket keeper. Cooch often plays cricket with Wal and so does the Dog, usually fielding in the slips or in the covers (wherein the Dog's alias of 'The Scarlet Manuka' sometimes comes into play, stealing cricket balls to 'rescue' them from persecution). Cooch also plays golf with Wal, who has a homemade course on his farm. Cooch is better than Wal at golf, even though the course is very hard (the first hole is a par 14). When they do play on a real course, Cooch usually wins. Wal claims the trees are on Cooch's side. Wal and Cooch also play snooker on a small table in Cooch's house, where a tree hampers play. Wal also occasionally plays tennis with Cheeky Hobson and fights for her affections with Nigel Erskine, another member of the tennis club. The Dog is usually the ball boy. Wal and Cooch frequently fish in various ways: whitebaiting, long line fishing, and most often floundering. Other sports seen in Footrot Flats are boxing, polo, soccer, squash, badminton and shooting.

It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk. On July 12, 2015, Breathed started drawing Bloom County again. The first revived strip was published via Facebook on July 13, 2015.Mazza, Ed. (July 13, 2015) Bloom County' Comic Strip Is Coming Back\\". The Huffington Post. Publication history and production Bloom County originated from a comic strip known as The Academia Waltz, which Breathed produced for The Daily Texan, the student newspaper of the University of Texas. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of The Washington Post, who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, Bloom County, syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group, made its debut and featured some of the characters from Academia Waltz, including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam war veteran Cutter John. Breathed set Bloom County in a small town. Breathed said he made the choice because he had followed a girlfriend to Iowa City, Iowa; Breathed commented, \\"You draw‚Äîliterally‚Äîfrom your life if you‚Äôre going to write anything with some juice to it. I did just that.\\"\\"ICv2 Interview: Berkeley Breathed.\\" ICv2. September 17, 2009. Retrieved September 27, 2009. Breathed's hand-printed signature on his strips was usually presented in mirror image, i.e. right to left.My Statement on IE6, www.globalnerdy.com Breathed was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning in 1987 for Bloom County.Berkeley Breathed Sets the Record Straight, Sam Thielman (May 4, 2010) Because the cartoon appeared on the comics page, and not on the editorial page, the win was disapproved of by many members of Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. Breathed cited the controversy over the release of Go Set a Watchman as the factor that lead him to resume Bloom County. Characters =Core characters= Major characters (from left to right): Oliver, Opus, Binkley, Steve Dallas, Portnoy, Milo, Bill, Hodge-Podge, and Milquetoast At the very beginning of the strip (December 1980), the central setting was the Bloom boarding house run by the grandparents of Milo Bloom. As the strip continued, various boarders (and/or pets) moved into the boarding house. In the order the characters debuted: *Milo Bloom is a 10-year-old newspaper reporter and probably the most worldly-wise of the bunch. Milo was the original protagonist of Bloom County, and much of the action takes place at the boarding house owned by his family. In the very earliest strips, Milo's grandfather (\\"The Major\\") was a central character; after the first year or so, The Major's role diminished and the character soon vanished. *Cutter John is a wheelchair-using Vietnam veteran, noted for indulging in Star Trek fantasies with the meadow animals (Hodge-Podge, Portnoy and Opus), as well as anti-war protests. He is not a womanizer like Steve Dallas (below), but he is more popular with the ladies. His visage is nearly identical to that of Breathed himself. The character had previously appeared in Breathed's previous comic strip, The Academia Waltz, where he had been known as 'Saigon John'. *Steve Dallas, introduced in May 1981, was (like Cutter John) originally a featured character in The Academia Waltz. Steve is Bloom County's sole defense attorney. A chain smoker and former \\"frat boy,\\" Dallas spends most of his free time either trying to seduce women or concocting get-rich-quick schemes, including forming and managing a heavy metal band, Billy and the Boingers (previously known as Deatht√∂ngue). *Michael Binkley was also introduced in May 1981. Binkley was a schoolmate of Milo's who lived with his father, Tom Binkley, rather than in the boarding house. Binkley is wishy-washy and overly reflective (in the mold of Charlie Brown), when not contemplating the lives of famous figures in pop culture, often at his father's bedside in the middle of the night. His \\"anxiety closet\\" has been a staple of many storylines. *Opus is a large-nosed penguin (occasionally mistaken for a puffin) with a herring addiction who lost track of his mother during the Falklands War. (They were later reunited in a closing storyline at the end of the strip's first series.) He was originally introduced as the pet penguin of Michael Binkley (\\"A boy and his penguin!\\" \\"A penguin and his boy!\\") in June 1981, although he was only seen in a few strips that month. He was re-introduced as a full-time cast member in January 1982; by this point, Opus was no longer Binkley's pet, and he eventually became a boarder at the Bloom house. Opus' hopeless na√Øvet√© and optimism made him a fan favorite, and he quickly became the center of the strip, as well as the subject of two \\"sequel\\" strips (Outland and Opus), three children's books, and a television special entitled A Wish for Wings That Work. *Bill the Cat is a filthy, scraggly, flea-bitten, orange tabby cat, introduced in the summer of 1982 as a parody of the comic character Garfield. The humor of the character was the antithesis of Garfield: Whereas the famous fat-cat was a marketing bonanza, Bloom County tried desperately to present Bill in the same manner, despite his disgusting and unappealing appearance. He said little beyond his trademark responses, \\"Ack\\" and \\"Pbthhh.\\" He has since become something of a blank slate around which various plots revolved. Numerous strips indicated that his persistent near-catatonic state was the result of drug use or brain damage resulting from once being legally dead and then revived after too long a period. In the Christmas special A Wish for Wings That Work, Opus recounts having rescued Bill from a University Science Lab where they had replaced his brains with Tater Tots. He has been a cult member (\\"Bhagwan Bill\\"), televangelist (\\"Fundamentally Oral Bill\\"), perennial Presidential candidate (for the National Radical Meadow Party), heavy metal rock star (\\"Wild Bill Catt\\"), nuclear power plant operator at Chernobyl, and, in the last months of the series, had his brain surgically replaced with Donald Trump's. He has been known to speak on occasion, most notably during the Communist witch-hunt trials of which he has been a subject, when he remarked, \\"Say, you don't suppose the 'Jury Box' is anything like a litter box, do you?\\" Bill has apparently had affairs with Jeane Kirkpatrick, Princess Diana and Socks the cat. *' is a rabbit who is best friends with Portnoy and Cutter John. He is politically conservative and fanatical about various issues, despite the fact that he is extremely ignorant about those same issues. Both Hodge-Podge and Portnoy (below) started off circa 1982 as unnamed minor characters, and their roles gradually increased as the strip continued. *Portnoy is a groundhog, although his species was a mystery for most of the strip's run. Before the revelation that he was a groundhog, he was portrayed as a squirrel, gopher, and possum. Portnoy was the grouchiest and most bigoted character by far and (in a few strips) was a bully to Opus. *Oliver Wendell Jones is a schoolmate of Milo and Binkley, introduced in 1983. He is a young computer hacker and gifted scientist. He once tried to bring an end to the Cold War by introducing onto the front page of Pravda the headline, \\"Gorbachev Urges Disarmament: Total! Unilateral!\\", but faulty translation caused the headline to read, \\"Gorbachev Sings Tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!\\"\\"Scan of actual strip\\" Retrieved March 26, 2012. He has a fairly extensive criminal record as a result of his numerous computer pranks. Oliver is African-American. His mother has dressed her son to resemble Michael Jackson, much to Oliver's chagrin. =Other characters= *Bobbi Harlow is the feminist schoolteacher of Milo and Binkley and the love interest of both Steve and Cutter. She was a major character until 1983, when she disappeared. She appears only once in the strip's later years, when Opus learns she has joined the crew of The Phil Donahue Show. In August 1981, her parents visited, and met Steve, whom they disliked.https://www.gocomics.com/bloomcounty/1981/08/07 *Quiche Lorraine, cousin of Bobbi Harlow and one-time girlfriend of Steve Dallas. She was only dating Steve because of his body and dumped him after an accident left him in a full-body cast. *Cozy Fillerup, single mother and love interest to Cutter John. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip when Cutter John and crew ran over her with his wheelchair, the \\"Aluminium Falcon.\\" *Abby Fillerup, Cozy's sole daughter. She was introduced in the 2015 revival of the strip. She practices yoga, acupuncture, and other New Age beliefs. As her introduction is quite recent, her importance and involvement with the future of the strip is unknown. She has been seen to participate in the gang's pop culture fantasies, and is often seen engaging in antics with the main cast. *Tom Binkley, Binkley's father, usually distraught over his son's behavior, his own divorce or mid-life crisis. *Frank Jones, Oliver's father, who funds his son's scientific endeavors, particularly his cure for baldness made from cat-sweat nicknamed \\"Scalp Tonic.\\" *Eleanor Jones, Oliver's mother, distrustful of technology and science, usually with good reason. *Lola Granola, a free- spirited and gentle hippie who experiments with green politics and vegetarianism. She and Opus had a long engagement, but were married only seconds before Opus fainted at the altar and had a nightmare of his future which caused him to divorce her the instant he woke up. *Milquetoast the Cockroach: an eloquent yet disgusting cockroach living in the boarding house, he secretly uses subliminal messaging (usually in the form of whispering in the tenants' ears as they sleep) to convince them to spare his life and bring him food. *Rosebud the Basselope, a basset hound with antlers (in a play on jackalope). As the last basselope on Earth (the second-to-last having been hunted and killed for sport by Donald Trump), Rosebud is somewhat gullible, naive, and easily shocked. Long after her introduction, it was determined that Rosebud was actually female, in a parody of the use of female dogs to portray the ostensibly male canine beer mascot Spuds McKenzie. The rebooted Bloom County gave her the ability to fly when her antlers were inflated with \\"dandelion gas.\\" *Ronald-Ann Smith is a young, innocent African-American girl from \\"the wrong side of the tracks\\" who lives in poverty. Her frequent efforts to make the best of the little she has often make the rest of the cast feel selfish and uncomfortable. Her best friend is Reynalda, a headless doll. At the end of the first series of Bloom County, she shows Opus the way to Outland, presented as a magical imaginary world she created to escape her harsh reality. * The Banana Jr. 6000 Computer (a blatant parody of the Apple Macintosh) is presented as an almost robot-like companion of Oliver, though he is quick to dispose of it if a newer model has even the slightest superficial upgrade. Notable storylines For detailed summaries of all storylines, see the entries for the individual books. * Opus was originally intended to have a run of just two weeks, but his status was cemented with a memorable Sunday strip involving a Hare Krishna asking for money. Opus continued to misunderstand the Krishna's request for money before finally misinterpreting \\"Prayer temples for Hare Krishnas\\" as \\"Pear pimples for hairy fishnuts!\\" Breathed wrote in one of the Bloom County books that the reaction was so overwhelmingly strong he made Opus a permanent member of the cast. *In 1984 the American Meadow Party ran Bill the Cat as its presidential candidate opposing Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, with Opus as the vice presidential candidate. Their campaign slogan was, \\"This Time, Why Not The Worst?\\" The sequence parodied the entire campaign season and the lengths some parties would go to, with Opus becoming near suicidal when told he is running behind pickled prunes in popularity polls. It did lead to the slogan of disaffected voters everywhere, \\"Don't blame me. I voted for Bill and Opus.\\" * Steve forms a heavy metal band with Opus, Hodge Podge, and Bill, initially called \\"Deatht√∂ngue\\". Steve is forced to rename the band \\"Billy and the Boingers\\" after he is brought before a congressional hearing investigating the effect of heavy metal music on youth, similar to the Parents Music Resource Center. * Opus decides to reunite with his long-lost mother for Christmas in Antarctica, only to discover that his mother supposedly died saving soldiers in the Falklands war. Her gravestone reads, 'The Falklands Martyr: She Loved her Boy'. She is later revealed to be alive. * The cast of Bloom County goes on strike. W. A. Thornhump refuses to concede to any of their demands and attempts to have his office staff fill in. Things get ugly when Steve Dallas crosses the picket line and Thornhump hires strike-breakers to play Opus, Bill, and Oliver. In the end, the strikers are defeated, although Opus still throws eggs at Steve, saying \\"Here comes breakfast from Aunt Opus!!\\" *Oliver invents Dr. Oliver's Scalp Tonic using Bill the Cat's perspiration motivated from the thought of Dan Quayle becoming US President. The tonic miraculously will restore hair on anyone, but has the side effect of users producing \\"ack\\" noises. The US government bans it, but the gang decide to continue producing it illegally after discovering that desperate customers are willing to buy it at exorbitant prices. In a parody of the war on drugs, the gang is extremely successful while thwarting the ineffectual government attempts to stop the illegal trade. As violent crime arises from the trade, the tonic operation is fatally undermined when the government legalizes it. The effects are later to be shown as temporary, leaving Oliver's father totally bald. *Oliver learns of the Apartheid system in South Africa. He invents a \\"pigmentizer\\", which will temporarily turn a white person black. Cutter John and Opus are dispatched to Washington to zap the South African ambassador, but their balloon-powered wheelchair crashes into the Atlantic Ocean and they disappear. Though officially listed as \\"Eaten By Squid\\", Opus reappears some time later, suffering from such strong amnesia that he initially has no idea he is even a penguin. Eventually the fake news of a secret wedding between Eddie Murphy and Diane Sawyer, Opus' longtime crush, shocks him into recalling what happened. After drifting for a while between lost islands, using the wheelchair as a raft, Cutter John and Opus were rescued by a Soviet submarine and arrested as spies. In order to rescue him, Steve Dallas meets with Russian envoys to trade Cutter John in for the one thing they want from Bloom County: Bill the Cat. *Donald Trump is accidentally and fatally injured by the anchor of his own yacht. Incredibly, surgeons turn to Bill the Cat as a donor body in which to insert Trump's still-living brain. Trapped in Bill's body, Trump finds himself disinherited from his financial empire and estranged from his wife Ivana. With nowhere else to turn, he takes Bill's place in the Bloom County boarding house, making unsuccessful attempts to start from scratch and occasionally being given equally unsuccessful lessons on the value of life by Opus. This eventually culminates in Trump regaining power and using it to buy out Bloom County, firing the entire staff of characters in the process. End and spinoff strips Breathed decided to end the strip in 1989. In keeping with the continuity of the Bill the Cat/Donald Trump storyline, Trump \\"buys out\\" the comic strip and fires all of the cast. In the strip's final weeks the cast found new \\"jobs\\" with other comic strips. A \\"goodbye party\\" was held over the course of the week where characters talked about joining new strips. Portnoy and Hodge Podge get jobs as janitors behind the scenes at Marmaduke; Steve Dallas joins the cast of Cathy and attempts to pitch himself as a new superhero, but is quickly fired from both jobs; Michael Binkley becomes a wild boar skinner for Prince Valiant. Lola Granola says that she has been invited to pose for Playboy, which Opus dislikes. Milo Bloom is seen with a snake swallowing him head first and informing Opus he would be appearing Tuesdays in The Far Side. Oliver Wendell Jones is seen with the distinct features of Family Circus characters. He informs Opus he is being \\"bussed in\\" to the strip as part of a court order. Once Bloom County characters are scattered, only Opus is left as part of a plot to transition to Breathed's next strip in Bloom Countys final week. Shortly after Bloom County ended, Breathed started a Sunday-only strip called Outland with original characters and situations introduced in Bloom Countys final days. However, Opus, Bill and other characters eventually reappeared and slowly took over the strip. Outland ran from September 3, 1989, to March 26, 1995. Another Sunday-only spinoff strip called Opus ran from November 23, 2003, to November 2, 2008. Return On July 12, 2015, Breathed posted to his Facebook page a photo with the caption \\"A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.\\" The photo showed him drawing a comic strip with the title Bloom County 2015 with Opus pictured in the first frame.Facebook posting A fan asked in the comments on the picture if this was in response to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and Mr. Breathed responded to the comment that \\"This creator can't precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it.\\" The next day, July 13, 2015, the first comic of the revived strip was officially posted online, also to Breathed's Facebook page.Facebook posting The strip was relaunched under the Bloom County 2015 title, only to be renamed simply as Bloom County at the start of 2016. On the return of the strips Breathed stated: Breathed originally had no plans of publishing the new strips outside of his Facebook page, commenting that ‚ÄúNewspapers need deadlines, alas. Like my departed friend Douglas Adams used to say, the only part of deadlines I enjoyed was the whooshing sound as they sped by.‚Äù An archive of the new strips has started at GoComics since then. A new book was announced in June 2016; Bloom County Episode XI: A New Hope was a compilation of strips from 2015 and 2016. Influence Bloom County has had an influence on other cartoonists, particularly cartoonists who have an irreverent bent or tackle political topics in their work. For example, Scott Kurtz, creator of the webcomic PvP, acknowledged Breathed's contributions at one point with a strip expressing the opinion that \\"so many webcomics. ..are nothing but Bloom County ripoffs\\", then lampooning itself by mimicking Breathed's art and dialogue style in the final panel.PvPonline ¬ª Archive ¬ª Fri Oct 01 Aaron McGruder, creator of the comic and later animated series The Boondocks, has paid tribute to Breathed's work as well, with a few aspects of the strip bearing more than a passing resemblance to important Bloom County features (including at least a couple of artistic similarities), and an episode of the animated series wherein the character Uncle Ruckus calls Breathed \\"Master Penguin Draw'er\\". The series was adapted into the 1991 animated Christmas special entitled A Wish for Wings That Work, which is now available on DVD. Bloom County The fictional setting of Bloom County served as a recurring backdrop for the comic and its sequels, although the nature of the setting was frequently altered. In the comics, the county is presented as a stereotypical American midwestern small town. The small town setting was frequently contrasted with the increasing globalization taking place in the rest of the world; though Bloom County contained the likes of farmers and wilderness creatures by default, it was frequented by Hare Krishnas, feminists, and rock stars. While the location of Bloom County is never explicitly mentioned, there have been some clues in the strip. When Oliver Jones identified Bloom County as the place where Halley's Comet would crash into Earth, a sign was seen saying that it was at 35.05 N 146.55 E. This would place it in the Pacific Ocean, about 300 miles off the coast of Japan. Oliver's previous calculation was 39.43 N 105.01 W, which would place it just south of Denver, Colorado. In an early strip, Milo gives his address as \\"Box 163, Bloom County, N.I., 12460\\", the zip code for which would place it about 30 miles southwest of Albany, New York. Another strip has Opus trying to make airline reservations to Des Moines, Iowa. He balks at the outrageously high quoted price for a ticket stating that \\"Des Moines is just 94 miles from Bloom County\\". Geographically, this would place Bloom County in either Iowa or the far north-central tier of counties of Missouri, but likely referring to the distance from Iowa City, where the strip was produced, to Des Moines. (See Real World References below). Also, in a Sunday strip with L.H. Puttgrass, he is holding a King Soopers bag, which would place the comic in Colorado. On January 29, 2016, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that \\"The Bloom County boarding house still sits in beautiful hayseedless Iowa City, home for this cartoonist for four years.\\" The county was home to the Bloom Boarding House, Steve Dallas' law offices, the Bloom Beacon and Bloom Picayune newspapers, at least one pond, and Milo's Meadow. In the comic's later years, the county contained what appeared to be a big-city ghetto (\\"the wrong side of the tracks\\", as it was known). The geographical profile of the county was fluid as the artistic style of the strip evolved. During most of Bloom Countys run, the rural meadow setting was presented realistically, while in its later years it became increasingly more abstract. The Outland setting of the strip was originally set apart from the county by way of a magical doorway. By Outland's end, the Outland appeared to be a part of Bloom County itself. The final Outland strip listed the characters as living at \\"555 Hairybutt St. Bloom County, Outland\\". Opus also takes place in Bloom County. =Real-world references= Linsay House, Iowa City, model for the Bloom County boarding house. Breathed lived in Iowa City, Iowa during the early years of the strip, and the setting of Bloom County resembles Iowa City in several ways. The Bloom Boarding House, which appeared as a high contrast photo within the strip, is modeled after the Linsay House located at 935 East College Street. Another Iowa City landmark, The Prairie Lights Bookstore, was referred to in the strip as the \\"Prairie Lights Newsstand\\"; original Bloom County artwork from Breathed now hangs in the bookstore. Another original Bloom County strip hangs in the Iowa City Public Library. Breathed used the call letters KRNA to refer to Bloom Countys rock radio station featuring \\"Rockin' Charmin' Harmin\\". The call letters belong to an actual Iowa City rock station which featured a disc jockey named \\"Charmin'\\" Jeff Harmon in the 1980s.94.1 KRNA ‚Äì Eastern Iowa‚Äôs Real Rock Several Iowa City local news items also directly inspired Bloom County storylines. For example, a fictional Ronald Reagan sexist gaffe, referring to women as \\"little dumplin's\\", was lifted from University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry's comment, infuriating feminists at the university. Bloom County books Like many other popular comic strips, Bloom County has been republished in various collections. By 2004, the comic strip was reprinted in 11 books, the first having been published in 1983 and the last in that year. None of the reprints contained complete runs of the strip, although Bloom County Babylon contained many of the strips that preceded Loose Tails. All of the daily strips have been reprinted in Comics Revue magazine. IDW Publishing published The Bloom County Library, a five volume hardback collection of all Bloom County strips, beginning in October 2009. This series is part of their Library of American Comics series.IDW Press Release It is a complete reprint of the strip, including side notes about cultural and political references made in the strip, \\"Headlines\\" breaks to identify the top stories of the day, and commentary from Breathed. Each volume has three separate releases: a standard edition, a signed edition, and a signed, remarked edition. Breathed said that the reason why the strips printed in The Bloom County Library were not published in previous collections was that the publisher would not let Breathed publish 400 pages each year, so Breathed had to reduce the content in each book. Breathed also said that he believes that, \\"I just closed my eyes and dropped a dart on the ones to be included.\\" He felt relieved the publishers did not \\"have to ask [‚Ä¶] to do this again.\\" On October 25, 2017 IDW published Bloom County: Real, Classy, & Compleat: 1980-1989, collecting the complete run of Bloom County in two volumes. An \\"Ultimate Collectors Set\\" was also released, including the original art from a daily strip featuring Opus, a page from Breathed's sketchbooks, and a personalized sketch of Opus on the slipcover. =Collections= *Loose Tails (1983) *Toons For Our Times (1984) *Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things (1985) *Bloom County Babylon: Five Years of Basic Naughtiness (1986) - An omnibus featuring strips from the previous three collections *Billy and the Boingers Bootleg (1987) *Tales Too Ticklish to Tell (1988) *The Night of the Mary Kay Commandos (1989) *Happy Trails!

God's Debris espouses a philosophy based on the idea that the simplest explanation tends to be the best. It proposes a form of pandeism and monism, postulating that an omnipotent god annihilated himself in the Big Bang, because an omniscient entity would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and exists now as the smallest units of matter and the law of probability, or \\"God's debris\\". The introduction disclaims any personal views held by the author, \\"The opinions and philosophies expressed by the characters are not my own, except by coincidence in a few spots not worth mentioning\\".God's Debris, page X Description The central character, according to the introduction, knows \\"everything. Literally everything.\\" Adams, whose knowledge is as incomplete as the next person, got around this by using the aforementioned \\"simplest explanation\\" for each concept raised in the book because, while \\"in this complicated world the simplest explanation is usually dead wrong\\", a more simple explanation often sounds more right and more convincing than anything complex. This character, the Avatar, defines God as primordial matter (like quarks and leptons) and the law of probability. He offers recommendations on everything from an alternative theory for planetary motion to successful recipes for relationships under his system. He proposes that God is currently reassembling himself through the continuing formation of a collective intelligence in the form of the human race, modern examples of which include the development of the internet; this is related to the idea of the Omega Point. However, in the introduction, Adams describes God's Debris as a thought experiment, challenging readers to differentiate its scientifically accepted theories from \\"creative baloney designed to sound true,\\" and to \\"Try to figure out what's wrong with the simplest explanation.\\"God's Debris, page XI = Levels of consciousness = The chapter \\"Fifth Level\\" (p. 124) describes five levels of human awareness, or consciousness. * Level 1: Consciousness at birth: pure innocence, self-awareness. * Level 2: Awareness of others, and acceptance of authority (a belief system). * Level 3: Awareness that some beliefs may be wrong, but not sure which ones. * Level 4: Skepticism and adoption of the scientific method. * Level 5: Avatar level, understanding that the human mind is a delusion-generating machine, and that science is another belief system, albeit a useful one.  Philosophical roots  The book subscribes to the Lakoffian point of view, in that the mind is viewed as a \\"delusion generator\\" rather than a window to true understanding. As George Lakoff said: \\"Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.\\" The particular philosophy espoused has been identified as a form of pandeism, the concept that a god created the universe by becoming the universe.Knujon Mapson, Pandeism: An Anthology (2017), p. 31-32.  Publication  Given Adams' fame as the author of the Dilbert comics, publishers were wary of publishing any book by Adams without Dilbert content. The book was therefore released initially as an e-book (with comparatively small \\"publishing\\" costs). Based on its rapid success, however, it was also quickly released in hard-cover format.

Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1987. Early life Born in Encino, California,Encyclopedia of World Biography and raised in Houston, Texas, Breathed attended Westchester High SchoolBerkowitz, Lana, \\"His latest opus: Bloom County creator finds a more constructive path writing children's books \\", Houston Chronicle, April 4, 2007 in Houston. Cartooning career Breathed was first published when he was hired part-time by the Austin American-Statesman to draw editorial cartoons for the newspaper. This job was short-lived; he was dismissed shortly after one of his cartoons caused outrage. His first comic strip published regularly was The Academia Waltz, which appeared in the Daily Texan, in 1978 while he was a student at the University of Texas. During his time at the University of Texas, Breathed self-published two collections of The Academia Waltz, using the profits to pay his tuition. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of The Washington Post, who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, Bloom County made its debut. It featured some of the characters from Academia Waltz, including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam war veteran Cutter John. At its start, the strip's style was so similar to that of another popular strip, Doonesbury, that Doonesbury's creator Garry Trudeau wrote to Breathed several times to indicate their similarities.Ellen, Mary, \\"Berkeley Breathed, drawn back to 'Bloom County' but looking forward\\", Los Angeles Times \\"Hero Complex\\" blog. Retrieved 2010-06-27. Breathed has acknowledged that he borrowed liberally from Doonesbury during his early career. In the Outland collection, One Last Little Peek, Breathed even put an early Bloom County side-by-side with the Doonesbury comic strip from which it obviously took its idea. Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning during 1987.Pulitzer Prize Awards List 1987 The strip eventually appeared in over 1,200 newspapers around the world until Breathed retired the daily strip in 1989, stating that he wanted to terminate the strip while it was still popular. At that time, he said, \\"A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators\\".The Official Berkeley Breathed Website Breathed replaced the strip with the surreal Sunday-only cartoon Outland in 1989, which reused some of the Bloom County characters, including Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. He ended Outland in 1995. In 2003, Breathed began the comic strip Opus, a Sunday-only strip featuring Opus the Penguin, who was one of the main characters of Bloom County. Several newspapers chose not to run the August 26, 2007, Opus cartoon because it might offend Muslims.Donaldson-Evans, Catherine, \\"Washington Post, Other Newspapers Won't Run 'Opus' Cartoon Mocking Radical Islam\\", Fox News, August 28, 2007 On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced plans to discontinue all work on comic strips with the final Opus strip to run on November 2, 2008.Stern, Sherry, \\"Berkeley Breathed says goodbye to Opus: 'I'm destroying the village to save it'\\", Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2008 Breathed planned to focus on writing children's books. Breathed explained that he felt that the United States was going to face \\"tough times\\", and that he wanted to end the saga of his most memorable character \\"on a lighter note\\". The last Opus comic strip appeared on schedule, but in what may be a comic first, the final panel required an online link. The final panel of the strip showed Opus sleeping peacefully in the bed depicted in the classic children's book, Goodnight Moon. This panel was available only online, and the Humane Society of the United States page that displayed it was later removed. Breathed said that he had no regrets in leaving political cartooning, as he believed the atmosphere became too bitter for him to make quality cartoons.\\"Vick dog inspired 'Bloom County,' 'Opus' creator.\\" CNN. October 13, 2009. Retrieved on October 13, 2009. In July 2015 Breathed hinted at a return to the strip when he posted a photo to Facebook of him at his computer, starting a cartoon entitled \\"Bloom County 2015\\". He added: \\"A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.\\" The strip was later posted to Facebook. He has subsequently been posting new Bloom County strips via Facebook on an almost-daily basis, as of January 2018. (In 2016, \\"2015\\" was dropped from the new strip's name.) Other works Breathed's syndicated and Facebook cartoon work has produced at least thirteen cartoon anthology books, as of January 2018. Starting in 1992, he designed a greeting card and gift ensemble collection for American Greetings, featuring the \\"Bloom County\\" characters Opus, Bill the Cat, and Milquetoast the Cockroach. As of January 2018, Breathed has produced ten children's picture books. Two were made into the animated films: A Wish for Wings That Work (Amblin Television/Universal Cartoon Studios, 1991) and Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big (Nickelodeon Movies, 2000); one was made into the motion-capture film Mars Needs Moms (Disney, 2011). Breathed's writing has also been featured in numerous publications, including Life, Boating, and Travel and Leisure. He produced the cartoon art for the closing credits of the Texas-based 2003 film, Secondhand Lions, which featured a strip called Walter and Jasmine. The panels that Breathed drew for Secondhand Lions appear in his cartoon anthology book Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best, in which Breathed terms them \\"the comic strip that never was\\". Breathed has been a supporter of the animal rights group PETA and illustrated the cover of earlier printings of PETA's cookbook - The Compassionate Cook, or, \\"Please Don't Eat the Animals!\\" -, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Breathed cameos as himself in the 2004 short film Tim Warner: A Life in the Clouds, a fictional tale about an unhappy cartoonist and his unfunny strip, The Silver Lining. Personal life Breathed is a fan of outdoor activities such as powerboating and motorcycling. In 1986, he broke his back in an ultralight-plane crash, later incorporated into a Bloom County storyline in which Steve Dallas breaks his back after being attacked by an angry Sean Penn. Breathed also nearly lost his right arm to a boating accident. Breathed has said that he is an atheist.Whitney, William, \\"Berkeley Breathed Pokes Fun\\", Psychology Today, January/February 2004 On May 18, 2008, in his comic strip Opus, Breathed announced he was suffering from a condition known as spasmodic torticollis.Breathed, Berkeley, Opus: \\"Anyone got a remedy for pain?\\" Salon.com, May 18, 2008 Bibliography ;Cartoon compilations *The Academia Waltz, Sterling Swift, 1979, *The Academia Waltz: Bowing Out, Bantan Hall, 1980 *Loose Tails, Little, Brown & Co., 1983, *Toons for Our Times, Little, Brown & Co., 1984 *Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things, Little, Brown & Co., 1985, *Bloom County Babylon: Five Years of Basic Naughtiness, Little, Brown & Co., 1986, *Billy and the Boingers Bootleg, Little, Brown & Co., 1987, .

For example, when a corporation is insured, it may take on higher risk knowing that its insurance will pay the associated costs. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of the risk-taking party change to the detriment of the cost-bearing party after a financial transaction has taken place. Moral hazard can occur under a type of information asymmetry where the risk-taking party to a transaction knows more about its intentions than the party paying the consequences of the risk and has a tendency or incentive to take on too much risk from the perspective of the party with less information. One example is a principal-agent problem, where one party, called an agent, acts on behalf of another party, called the principal. If the agent has more information about his or her actions or intentions than the principal then the agent may have an incentive to act too riskily (from the viewpoint of the principal) if the interests of the agent and the principal are not aligned.

(2000). \\"Moral Hazard: A Question of Morality?\\" New Solutions 2000 10(3). 257‚Äì79 the term dates back to the 17th century and was widely used by English insurance companies by the late 19th century. Early usage of the term carried negative connotations, implying fraud or immoral behavior (usually on the part of an insured party). Dembe and Boden point out, however, that prominent mathematicians who studied decision-making in the 18th century used \\"moral\\" to mean \\"subjective,\\" which may cloud the true ethical significance in the term. The concept of moral hazard was the subject of renewed study by economists in the 1960s, beginning with economist Ken Arrow, and did not imply immoral behavior or fraud. Economists use this term to describe inefficiencies that can occur when risks are displaced or cannot be fully evaluated, rather than a description of the ethics or morals of the involved parties. Rowell and Connelly offer a detailed description of the genesis of the term moral hazard,D Rowell, LB Connelly (2012) ‚ÄúA history of the term ‚Äúmoral hazard‚Äù‚Äù Journal of Risk and Insurance 79 (4), 1051‚Äì75 by identifying salient changes in economic thought, which are identified within the medieval theological and probability literature. Their paper compares and contrasts the predominantly normative conception of moral hazard found within the insurance-industry literature with the largely positive interpretations found within the economic literature. Often what is described as \\"moral hazard[s]\\" in the insurance literature is upon closer reading, a description of the closely related concept, adverse selection. Finance In 1998, William J. McDonough, head of the New York Federal Reserve, helped the counter-parties of Long Term Capital Management avoid losses by taking over the firm. This move was criticized by former Fed Chair, Paul Volcker and others as increasing moral hazard.GAO/GGD-00-67R Questions Concerning LTCM and Our Responses General Accounting Office, February 23, 2000 Tyler Cowen concludes that \\"creditors came to believe that their loans to unsound financial institutions would be made good by the Fed ‚Äî as long as the collapse of those institutions would threaten the global credit system.\\" Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, while conceding the risk of moral hazard, defended the policy to orderly unwind Long Term Capital by saying the world economy is at stake. Economist Paul Krugman described moral hazard as \\"any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly.\\" Financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments, central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses. Lending institutions need to take risks by making loans, and the riskiest loans usually have the potential for making the highest return. Taxpayers, depositors, and other creditors often have to shoulder at least part of the burden of risky financial decisions made by lending institutions. Many have argued that certain types of mortgage securitization contribute to moral hazard. Mortgage securitization enables mortgage originators to pass on the risk that the mortgages they originate might default and not hold the mortgages on their balance sheets and assume the risk. In one kind of mortgage securitization, known as \\"agency securitizations,\\" default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators. These agencies thus have an incentive to monitor originators and check loan quality. \\"Agency securitizations\\" refer to securitizations by either Ginnie Mae, a government agency, or by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both for-profit government-sponsored enterprises. They are similar to the \\"covered bonds\\" that are commonly used in Western Europe in that the securitizing agency retains default risk. Under both models, investors take on only interest-rate risk, not default risk. In another type of securitization, known as \\"private label\\" securitization, default risk is generally not retained by the securitizing entity. Instead, the securitizing entity passes on default risk to investors. The securitizing entity, therefore, has relatively little incentive to monitor originators and maintain loan quality. \\"Private label\\" securitization refers to securitizations structured by financial institutions such as investment banks, commercial banks, and non-bank mortgage lenders. During the years leading up to the subprime mortgage crisis, private label securitizations grew as a share of overall mortgage securitization by purchasing and securitizing low-quality, high-risk mortgages. Agency Securitizations appear to have somewhat lowered their standards, but Agency mortgages remained considerably safer than mortgages in private-label securitizations and performed far better in terms of default rates. Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics described moral hazard as a root cause of the subprime mortgage crisis. He wrote that \\"the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan. As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined.\\" He also wrote, \\"Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards.\\" Moral hazard can also occur with borrowers. Borrowers may not act prudently (in the view of the lender) when they invest or spend funds recklessly. For example, credit card companies often limit the amount borrowers can spend with their cards because without such limits, borrowers may spend borrowed funds recklessly, leading to default. Securitization of mortgages in America started in 1983 at Salomon Brothers and where the risk of each mortgage passed to the next purchaser instead of remaining with the original mortgaging institution. These mortgages and other debt instruments were put into a large pool of debt, and then shares in the pool were sold to many creditors. Thus, there is no one person responsible for verifying that any one particular loan is sound, that the assets securing that one particular loan are worth what they are supposed to be worth, that the borrower responsible for making payments on the loan can read and write the language in which the papers that he/she signed were written, or even that the paperwork exists and is in good order. It has been suggested that this may have caused the subprime mortgage crisis. Brokers, who were not lending their own money, pushed risk onto the lenders. Lenders, who sold mortgages soon after underwriting them, pushed risk onto investors. Investment banks bought mortgages and chopped up mortgage-backed securities into slices, some riskier than others. Investors bought securities and hedged against the risk of default and prepayment, pushing those risks further along. In a purely capitalist scenario, the last one holding the risk (like a game of musical chairs) is the one who faces the potential losses. In the sub-prime crisis, however, national credit authorities (the Federal Reserve in the US) assumed the ultimate risk on behalf of the citizenry at large. Others believe that financial bailouts of lending institutions do not encourage risky lending behavior since there is no guarantee to lending institutions that a bailout will occur. Decreased valuation of a corporation before any bailout would prevent risky, speculative business decisions by executives who fail to conduct proper due diligence in their business transactions. The risk and the burdens of loss became apparent to Lehman Brothers, which who did not benefit from a bailout, and other financial institutions and mortgage companies such as Citibank and Countrywide Financial Corporation, whose valuation plunged during the subprime mortgage crisis. = Connection to financial crisis of 2007‚àí08 = Many scholars and journalists have argued that moral hazard played a role in the 2008 financial crisis, since numerous actors in the financial market may have had an incentive to increase their exposure to risk. In general, there are three ways in which moral hazard may have manifested itself in the lead up to the financial crisis. * Asset managers may have had an incentive to take on more risk when managing other people's money, particularly if they were paid as a percentage of the fund's profits. If they took on more risk, they could expect higher payoff for themselves and were somewhat shielded from losses because they were spending other people's money. Therefore, asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard, where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they didn't bear the cost of failure. * Mortgage loan originators, such as Washington Mutual, may have had an incentive to understate the risk of loans they originated because the loans were often sold to mortgage pools (see mortgage-backed securities). Because loan originators were paid on a per- mortgage basis, they had an incentive to produce as many mortgages as possible, even if they were risky. Because these institutions didn't expect to hold on to the loans until maturity, they could pass on the risk to the buyer of the loans. Therefore, mortgage loan originators may have been in a situation of moral hazard, because they didn't bear the costs of the risky mortgages they were underwriting. * Third, large banks may have believed they were \\"too big to fail.\\" That is, because these banks were so ingrained in the US economy, the federal government would not have allowed them to fail in order to prevent a full-scale economic crash. This belief may have been shaped by the 1998 bailout of Long Term Capital Management. \\"Too big to fail\\" banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure, thus putting them in a position of moral hazard: they could take on big risks - thus increasing their expected payoff - thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure. Therefore, large banks may have been in a situation of moral hazard, because they didn't bear the costs of a catastrophic collapse. Notably, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), tasked by Congress with investigating the causes of the financial crisis, cited moral hazard as a component of the crisis, arguing that many factors, including deregulation in the derivatives market in 2000, reduced federal oversight, and the potential for government bailout of \\"too big to fail\\" institutions all played a role in increasing moral hazard in the years leading up to the collapse. Others have argued that moral hazard could not have played a role in the financial crisis for three main reasons. First, in the event of a catastrophic failure, a government bailout would only come after major losses for the company. So even if a bailout was expected it wouldn't prevent the firm from taking losses. Second, there is some evidence that big banks were not expecting the crisis and thus were not expecting government bailouts, though the FCIC tried hard to contest this idea. Third, some have argued that negative externalities from corporate governance were a more important cause, since some risky investments may have had positive expected payoff for the firm but negative expected payoff to society. Insurance industry Moral hazard has been studied by insurers Crosby was one of the founders of the National Fire Protection Association, NFPA.org and academics; such as in the work of Kenneth Arrow, Tom Baker, and John Nyman. The name comes originally from the insurance industry. Insurance companies worried that protecting their clients from risks (like fire, or car accidents) might encourage those clients to behave in riskier ways (like smoking in bed or not wearing seatbelts). This problem may inefficiently discourage those companies from protecting their clients as much as the clients would like to be protected. Economists argue that the inefficiency results from information asymmetry. If insurance companies could perfectly observe the actions of their clients, they could deny coverage to clients choosing risky actions (like smoking in bed or not wearing seat belts), allowing them to provide thorough protection against risk (fire or accidents) without encouraging risky behavior. However, since insurance companies cannot perfectly observe their clients' actions, they are discouraged from providing the amount of protection that would be provided in a world with perfect information. Economists distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection, another problem that arises in the insurance industry, which is caused by hidden information, rather than hidden actions. The same underlying problem of non-observable actions also affects other contexts besides the insurance industry. It also arises in banking and finance: if a financial institution knows it is protected by a lender of last resort, it may make riskier investments than it would in the absence of the protection. In insurance markets, moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior. Because individuals no longer bear the cost of medical services, they have an added incentive to ask for pricier and more elaborate medical service, which would otherwise not be necessary. In those instances, individuals have an incentive to over consume, simply because they no longer bear the full cost of medical services. Two types of behavior can change. One type is the risky behavior itself, resulting in a before the event moral hazard. Insured parties then behave in a more risky manner, resulting in more negative consequences that the insurer must pay for. For example, after purchasing automobile insurance, some may tend to be less careful about locking the automobile or choose to drive more, thereby increasing the risk of theft or an accident for the insurer. After purchasing fire insurance, some may tend to be less careful about preventing fires (say, by smoking in bed or neglecting to replace the batteries in fire alarms). A further example has been identified in flood risk management in which it is proposed that the possession of insurance undermines efforts to encourage people to integrate flood protection and resilience measures in properties exposed to flooding. A second type of behavior that may change is the reaction to the negative consequences of risk once they have occurred and insurance is provided to cover their costs. That may be called ex post (after the event) moral hazard. Insured parties then do not behave in a more risky manner that results in more negative consequences, but they ask an insurer to pay for more of the negative consequences from risk as insurance coverage increases. For example, without medical insurance, some may forgo medical treatment due to its costs and simply deal with substandard health. However, after medical insurance becomes available, some may ask an insurance provider to pay for the cost of medical treatment that would not have occurred otherwise. Sometimes moral hazard is so severe that it makes insurance policies impossible. Coinsurance, co-payments, and deductibles reduce the risk of moral hazard by increasing the out-of- pocket spending of consumers, which decreases their incentive to consume. Thus, the insured have a financial incentive to avoid making a claim.  Numerical example  marginal benefit curve. The orange line represents the constant $10 marginal cost curve without insurance. The green star is the market equilibrium. When the individual is insured, the marginal cost curve shifts down to 0, leading to a new equilibrium at the yellow star. Consider a potential case of moral hazard in the health care market caused by the purchase of health insurance. Assume health care has constant marginal cost of $10 per unit and the individual's demand is given by Q=20-P. Assuming a perfectly competitive market, at equilibrium, the price will be $10 per unit and the individual will consume 10 units of health care. Now, consider the same individual with health insurance. Assume this health insurance makes health care free for the individual. In this case, the individual will have a price of $0 for the health care and thus will consume 20 units. The price will still be $10, but the insurance company would be the one bearing the costs. This example shows numerically how moral hazard could occur with health insurance. The individual consumes more health care than the equilibrium quantity because they don't bear the cost of the additional care. Economic theory In economic theory, moral hazard is a situation in which the behavior of one party may change to the detriment of another after the transaction has taken place. For example, a person with insurance against automobile theft may be less cautious about locking their car because the negative consequences of vehicle theft are now (partially) the responsibility of the insurance company. A party makes a decision about how much risk to take, while another party bears the costs if things go badly, and the party insulated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk. According to contract theory, moral hazard results from a situation in which a hidden action occurs.A. Mas-Colell, M. Whinston, and J. Green (1995), Microeconomic Theory. Chapter 14, 'The Principal-Agent Problem', p. 477. Bengt Holmstr√∂m said this: Moral hazard can be divided into two types when it involves asymmetric information (or lack of verifiability) of the outcome of a random event. An ex ante moral hazard is a change in behavior prior to the outcome of the random event, whereas ex post involves behavior after the outcome. For example, in the case of a health insurance company insuring an individual during a specific time period, the final health of the individual can be thought of as the outcome. The individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard. A second example is the case of a bank making a loan to an entrepreneur for a risky business venture. The entrepreneur becoming overly risky would be ex ante moral hazard, but willful default (wrongly claiming the venture failed when it was profitable) is ex post moral hazard. According to Hart and Holmstr√∂m (1987), moral hazard models can be subdivided in models with hidden action and models with hidden information. In the former case, after the contract has been signed the agent chooses an action (such as an effort level) that cannot be observed by the principal. In the latter case, after the contract has been signed there is a random draw by nature that determines the agent's type (such as his valuation for a good or his costs of effort). In the literature, two reasons have been discussed why moral hazard may imply that the first-best solution (the solution that would be attained under complete information) is not achieved. Firstly, the agent may be risk-averse, so there is a trade-off between providing the agent with incentives and insuring the agent. Secondly, the agent may be risk-neutral but wealth-constrained and so the agent cannot make a payment to the principal and there is a trade-off between providing incentives and minimizing the agent's limited-liability rent. Among the early contributors to the contract-theoretic literature on moral hazard were Oliver Hart and Sanford J. Grossman. In the meantime, the moral hazard model has been extended to the cases of multiple periods and multiple tasks, both with risk-averse and risk-neutral agents. There are also models that combine hidden action and hidden information. Since there is no data on unobservable variables, the contract-theoretic moral hazard model is difficult to test directly, but there have been some successful indirect tests with field data. Direct tests of moral hazard theory are feasible in laboratory settings, using the tools of experimental economics. In such a setup, Hoppe and Schmitz (2018) have corroborated central insights of moral hazard theory.

This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries. It is estimated that the annual use of vertebrate animals‚Äîfrom zebrafish to non- human primates‚Äîranges from tens to more than 100 million.Meredith Cohn (26 August 2010). \\"Alternatives to Animal Testing Gaining Ground,\\" The Baltimore Sun. In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011.

What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy. Mice, rats, fish, amphibians and reptiles together account for over 85% of research animals.

Definitions The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, in vivo testing, and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations. Literally, \\"vivisection\\" means \\"live sectioning\\" of an animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica defines \\"vivisection\\" as: \\"Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals\\",Croce, Pietro (1999). Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health.

The word \\"vivisection\\" is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term \\"animal experimentation\\".Yarri, Donna (2005). The Ethics of Animal Experimentation, Oxford University Press U.S., . History An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump, from 1768, by Joseph Wright The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BC. Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals.Cohen and Loew 1984. Galen, a 2nd-century Roman physician, dissected pigs and goats; he is known as the \\"father of vivisection\\". Avenzoar, a 12th-century Arabic physician in Moorish Spain also practiced dissection; he introduced animal testing as an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients. Animals have repeatedly been used through the history of biomedical research. In 1831, the founders of the Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession who were interested in studying animals while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On 3 November 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the US, the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the US Congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold. =Historical debate= Claude Bernard, regarded as the \\"prince of vivisectors\\", argued that experiments on animals are \\"entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man\\".Bernard, Claude An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine, 1865. First English translation by Henry Copley Greene, published by Macmillan & Co., Ltd., 1927; reprinted in 1949, p. 125. As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O'Meara said that \\"the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state\\".Ryder, Richard D. (2000). Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism. Berg Publishers, p. 54 .\\"Animal Experimentation: A Student Guide to Balancing the Issues\\", Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART), accessed 12 December 2007, cites original reference in Maehle, A-H. and Tr6hler, U. Animal experimentation from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century: attitudes and arguments. In N. A. Rupke (ed.) Vivisection in Historical Perspective. Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22. O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an ethical basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals. Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle‚Äîmany people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans. On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. Claude Bernard‚Äîwho is sometimes known as the \\"prince of vivisectors\\"Croce, Pietro. Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health. Zed Books, 1999, p. 11. and the father of physiology, and whose wife, Marie Fran√ßoise Martin, founded the first anti- vivisection society in France in 1883Rudacille, Deborah (2000).

In 1896, the physiologist and physician Dr. Walter B. Cannon said \\"The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, 'Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden of crime. These divisions between pro- and anti-animal testing groups first came to public attention during the Brown Dog affair in the early 1900s, when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog.Mason, Peter. The Brown Dog Affair. Two Sevens Publishing, 1997. Pavlov's dogs with a saliva-catch container and tube surgically implanted in his muzzle, Pavlov Museum, 2005 In 1822, the first animal protection law was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: \\"You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night.\\"Bowlby, John (1991). Charles Darwin: A New Life, W. W. Norton & Company, p. 420 . In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists \\"mutual benefit and protection\\", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 \\"to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them\\". Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.Buettinger, Craig (1 January 1993) Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century. The Historian. Care and use of animals =Regulations and laws= The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.Carbone, pp. 68‚Äì69. The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act do not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs.Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. nih.govTitle 9 ‚Äì Animals and Animal Products. Code of Federal Regulations. Vol. 1 (1 January 2008). The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates, rabbits, mice, and other animals, while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research. Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC. According to the 2014 U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report‚Äîwhich looked at the oversight of animal use during a three-year period‚Äî\\"some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ...did not adequately approve, monitor, or report on experimental procedures on animals\\". The OIG found that \\"as a result, animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and, in some cases, pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures\\". According to the report, within a three-year period, nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight. The USDA OIG made similar findings in a 2005 report. With only a broad number of 120 inspectors, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees more than 12,000 facilities involved in research, exhibition, breeding, or dealing of animals. Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs, asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a \\"red flag of special concern\\".Carbone, p. 94. A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies. Scientists in India are protesting a recent guideline issued by the University Grants Commission to ban the use of live animals in universities and laboratories. =Numbers= Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain; it has been estimated that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10‚Äì11 million of them in the EU. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals. None of the figures include invertebrates such as shrimp and fruit flies. The USDA/APHIS has published the 2016 animal research statistics. Overall, the number of animals (covered by the Animal Welfare Act) used in research in the US rose 6.9% from 767,622 (2015) to 820,812 (2016). This includes both public and private institutions. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies. In 1995, researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14‚Äì21 million animals were used in American laboratories in 1992, a reduction from a high of 50 million used in 1970.Rowan, A., Loew, F., and Weer, J. (1995) \\"The Animal Research Controversy. Protest, Process and Public Policy: An Analysis of Strategic Issues.\\" Tufts University, North Grafton. cited in Carbone 2004, p. 26. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million.Alternatives to Animal Use in Research, Testing and Education, U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, D.C.:Government Printing Office, 1986, p. 64. In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.) In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively. In GB, Home Office figures show that 3.79 million procedures were carried out in 2017. 2,960 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988. A \\"procedure\\" refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures. The procedures conducted on animals in GB in 2017 were categorised as ‚Äì *43% (1.61 million) were assessed as sub-threshold *4% (0.14 million) were assessed as non-recovery *36% (1.35 million) were assessed as mild *15% (0.55 million) were assessed as moderate *4% (0.14 million) were assessed as severe A ‚Äòsevere‚Äô procedure would be, for instance, any test where death is the end- point or fatalities are expected, whereas a ‚Äòmild‚Äô procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan. =The Three Rs= The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959. The 3Rs state: #Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling. #Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. #Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include non-invasive techniques. The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided. These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations. Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3Rs, many countries‚Äîincluding Canada, Australia, Israel, South Korea, and Germany‚Äîhave reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use. =Invertebrates= Fruit flies are an invertebrate commonly used in animal testing. Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds. Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput. =Vertebrates= Enos the space chimp before insertion into the Mercury-Atlas 5 capsule in 1961 single platform (\\"flower pot\\") technique. The water is within 1 cm of the small flower pot bottom platform where the rat sits. At the onset of sleep, the rat would either fall into the water only to clamber back to the pot to avoid drowning, or its nose would become submerged into the water shocking it back to an awakened state. In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 95% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 9,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades. In 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK,Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 1996 - UK Home Office, Table 13 and in 2017 this number was just 63. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Cats Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. 18,898 cats were used in the U.S. in 2016, around a third of which were used in experiments which have the potential to cause \\"pain and/or distress\\" though only 0.1% of cat experiments involved potential pain which was not relieved by anesthetics/analgesics. In the UK, just 198 procedures were carried out on cats in 2017. The number has been around 200 for most of the last decade. Dogs Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education‚Äîparticularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States.Dog profile, The Humane Society of the United States The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, in accordance with the regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. One of the most significant advancements in medical science involves the use of dogs in developing the answers to insulin production in the body for diabetics and the role of the pancreas in this process. They found that the pancreas was responsible for producing insulin in the body and that removal of the pancreas, resulted in the development of diabetes in the dog. After re- injecting the pancreatic extract, (insulin), the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered. The advancements made in this research involving the use of dogs has resulted in a definite improvement in the quality of life for both humans and animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report shows that 60,979 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in 2016. In the UK, according to the UK Home Office, there were 3,847 procedures on dogs in 2017. Of the other large EU users of dogs, Germany conducted 3,976 procedures on dogs in 2016 and France conducted 4,204 procedures in 2016. In both cases this represents under 0.2% of the total number of procedures conducted on animals in the respective countries. Non-human primates thumb Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They are caught in the wild or purpose- bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose- bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred.International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources, Proceedings of the Workshop Held 17‚Äì19 April, pp. 36‚Äì45, 46‚Äì48, 63‚Äì69, 197‚Äì200. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the US. , there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories. In a survey in 2003, it was found that 89% of singly-housed primates exhibited self-injurious or abnormal stereotypyical behaviors including pacing, rocking, hair pulling, and biting among others. The first transgenic primate was produced in 2001, with the development of a method that could introduce new genes into a rhesus macaque. This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington's disease. Notable studies on non-human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV.Kathleen M. Conlee, Erika H. Hoffeld and Martin L. Stephens (2004) Demographic Analysis of Primate Research in the United States, ATLA 32, Supplement 1, 315‚Äì22 In 2008 a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate. =Sources= Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers.Invertebrate Animal Resources . National Center for Research Resources. ncrr.nih.gov For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome. A laboratory mouse cage. Mice are either bred commercially, or raised in the laboratory. In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from \\"random sources\\" such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as bunching.Class B dealers , Humane Society of the United States.\\"Who's Who of Federal Oversight of Animal Issues\\" , Aesop Project.Salinger, Lawrence and Teddlie, Patricia. \\"Stealing Pets for Research and Profit: The Enforcement (?) of the Animal Welfare Act\\" , paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology, Royal York, Toronto, 15 October 2006Reitman, Judith (1995) Stolen for Profit, Zebra, .Moran, Julio (12 September 1991) \\"Three Sentenced to Prison for Stealing Pets for Research,\\" L.A. Times. It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in‚Äîthe Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools.Francione, Gary. Animals, Property, and the Law. Temple University Press, 1995, p. 192; Magnuson, Warren G., Chairman. \\"Opening remarks in hearings prior to enactment of Pub. L. 89-544, the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act,\\" U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, 25 March 1966. The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in 2003.Notorious Animal Dealer Loses License and Pays Record Fine, The Humane Society of the United States Four states in the U.S.‚ÄîMinnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa‚Äîrequire their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.Animal Testing: Where Do the Animals Come From?. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. According to the ASPCA, the following states prohibit shelters from providing animals for research: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia. In the European Union, animal sources are governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established.Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.U.S. Primate Imports Spike International Primate Protection League April 2007 =Pain and suffering= Prior to dissection for educational purposes, chloroform was administered to this common sand frog to induce anesthesia and death. The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate. According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved. Since 2014, in the UK, every research procedure was retrospectively assessed for severity. The five categories are \\"sub- threshold\\", \\"mild\\", \\"moderate\\", \\"severe\\" and \\"non-recovery\\", the latter being procedures in which an animal is anesthetized and subsequently killed without recovering consciousness. In 2017, 43% (1.61 million) were assessed as sub- threshold, 4% (0.14 million) were assessed as non-recovery, 36% (1.35 million) were assessed as mild, 15% (0.55 million) were assessed as moderate and 4% (0.14 million) were assessed as severe. The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, Ren√© Descartes, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness.Carbone, p. 149. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals,Rollin drafted the 1985 Health Research Extension Act and an animal welfare amendment to the 1985 Food Security Act: see Rollin, Bernard. \\"Animal research: a moral science. Talking Point on the use of animals in scientific research\\", EMBO Reports 8, 6, 2007, pp. 521‚Äì25 writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.Rollin, Bernard. The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117‚Äì18, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \\"prove\\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \\"scientifically acceptable\\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. However, some canine experts are stating that, while intelligence does differ animal to animal, dogs have the intelligence of a two to two-and-a-half year old. This does support the idea that dogs, at the very least, have some form of consciousness.American Psychological Association. \\"Dogs' Intelligence On Par With Two-year-old Human, Canine Researcher Says.\\" ScienceDaily, 10 August 2009. The ability of invertebrates to experience pain and suffering is less clear, however, legislation in several countries (e.g. U.K., New Zealand, Norway) protects some invertebrate species if they are being used in animal testing. In the U.S., the defining text on animal welfare regulation in animal testing is the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\\"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\\", ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 64, . This defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the U.S. It states \\"The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.\\" The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states \\"The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol\\". Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval. In 2019, Katrien Devolder and Matthias Eggel proposed gene editing research animals to remove the ability to feel pain. This would be an intermediate step towards eventually stopping all experimentation on animals and adopting alternatives. Additionally, this would not stop research animals from experiencing psychological harm. =Euthanasia= Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7 Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself.Carbone, Larry. \\"Euthanasia,\\" in Bekoff, M. and Meaney, C. Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Welfare. Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 164‚Äì66, cited in Carbone 2004, pp. 189‚Äì90. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason. Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.\\"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\\", ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 65, . The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1-day-old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness. Research classification =Pure research= Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research‚Äîresearch that has a specific practical aim‚Äîunclear.\\"Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report\\", House of Lords, 16 July 2002. See chapter 3: \\"The purpose and nature of animal experiments.\\" Retrieved 6 July 2010. Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos. Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include: *Studies on embryogenesis and developmental biology. Mutants are created by adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man. * Experiments into behavior, to understand how organisms detect and interact with each other and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds.Marler P., Slabbekoorn H, Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong, Academic Press, 2004. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.For example \\"in addition to providing the chimpanzees with enrichment, the termite mound is also the focal point of a tool-use study being conducted\\", from the web page of the Lincoln Park Zoo. Retrieved 25 April 2007. * Breeding experiments to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics.Festing, M., \\"Inbred Strains of Mice and their Characteristics\\", The Jackson Laboratory . Retrieved 30 January 2008. These provide animals of a known genetic background, an important tool for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species. =Applied research= Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. These may involve the use of animal models of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the drug discovery process. Examples include: *Genetic modification of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians. *Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog suffer from narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of bacilli used in leprosy vaccines. *Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology.Langley, Gill (2006) next of kin...A report on the use of primates in experiments , BUAV. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.The History of Deep Brain Stimulation . parkinsonsappeal.com *Animal testing has also included the use of placebo testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound. Xenotransplantation Xenotransplantation research involves transplanting tissues or organs from one species to another, as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin. Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences, to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered serious and sometimes fatal injuries. A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation.Townsend, Mark (20 April 2003). \\"Exposed: secrets of the animal organ lab\\" , The Guardian.Curtis, Polly (11 July 2003). \\"Home Office under renewed fire in animal rights row\\", The Guardian. =Toxicology testing= Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, on behalf of a wide variety of customers.Household Product Tests BUAV According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union, Commission of the European Communities, published November 2007 According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results. Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label. The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal. There are several different types of acute toxicity tests. The (\\"Lethal Dose 50%\\") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test, The Humane Society of the United States (2003-02-05) Abbott writes that, as of 2005, \\"the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide\\". Irritancy can be measured using the Draize test, where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows \\"continuing signs of severe pain or distress\\". The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.Species Used in Research: Rabbit, Humane Society of the United States This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world. Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009.Draize rabbit eye test replacement milestone welcomed. Dr Hadwen Trust (2009-09-21) However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants. The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete. These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, \\"critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential\\".Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents\\" National Academies Press, (2006), p. 21. Animal tests may overestimate risk, with false positive results being a particular problem, but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common. Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans. Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another. Scientists face growing pressure to move away from using traditional animal toxicity tests to determine whether manufactured chemicals are safe. Among variety of approaches to toxicity evaluation the ones which have attracted increasing interests are in vitro cell-based sensing methods applying fluorescence. Cosmetics testing The \\"Leaping Bunny\\" logo: Some products in Europe that are not tested on animals carry this symbol. Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light) and mutagenicity.Stephens, Martin & Rowan, Andrew. An overview of Animal Testing Issues, Humane Society of the United States Cosmetics testing on animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while legislation in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy.Osborn, Andrew & Gentleman, Amelia.\\"Secret French move to block animal-testing ban\\", The Guardian (19 August 2003). Retrieved 27 February 2008. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals. =Drug testing= Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve: *metabolic tests, investigating pharmacokinetics‚Äîhow drugs are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by the body when introduced orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or transdermally. *toxicology tests, which gauge acute, sub-acute, and chronic toxicity. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that \\"acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species\\" covering \\"at least two different routes of administration\\". Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic drug metabolites build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent. *efficacy studies, which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a double-blind controlled trial, which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the dose-response curve. *Specific tests on reproductive function, embryonic toxicity, or carcinogenic potential can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested. =Education= It is estimated that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, dissections and live-animal surgeries. Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections. Alternatives to the use of animals in classroom dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect. Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned dissections in 2014. The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts an annual Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference to discuss the use of invertebrates in education. There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education. The NORINA database, maintained by Norecopa, lists products that may be used as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education, and in the training of personnel who work with animals. These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system. In November 2013, the U.S.-based company Backyard Brains released for sale to the public what they call the \\"Roboroach\\", an \\"electronic backpack\\" that can be attached to cockroaches. The operator is required to amputate a cockroach's antennae, use sandpaper to wear down the shell, insert a wire into the thorax, and then glue the electrodes and circuit board onto the insect's back. A mobile phone app can then be used to control it via Bluetooth. It has been suggested that the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science. The makers of the \\"Roboroach\\" have been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in neuroscience. =Defense= Animals are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing. For example, in 2008 the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency used live pigs to study the effects of improvised explosive device explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.Brook, Tom Vanden, \\"Brain Study, Animal Rights Collide\\", USA Today (7 April 2009), p. 1. In the US military, goats are commonly used to train combat medics. (Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.) While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, some trainees feel that \\"the goat exercise provide[s] a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide\\". Nevertheless, in 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it would reduce the number of animals it uses in its training exercises by half after PETA released video showing Guard members cutting off the limbs of unconscious goats with tree trimmers and inflicting other injuries with a shotgun, pistol, ax and a scalpel. That same year, citing the availability of human simulators and other alternatives, the Department of Defense announced it would begin reducing the number of animals it uses in various training programs. In 2013, several Navy medical centers stopped using ferrets in intubation exercises after complaints from PETA. Besides the United States, six out of 28 NATO countries, including Poland and Denmark, use live animals for combat medic training. Ethics =Viewpoints= Monument for animals used in testing at Keio UniversityThe moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species. A 2015 Gallup poll found that 67% of Americans were \\"very concerned\\" or \\"somewhat concerned\\" about animals used in research. A Pew poll taken the same year found 50% of American adults opposed the use of animals in research. Still, a wide range of viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the \\"subjects of a life\\" with moral value and therefore moral rights.Singer, Peter (ed.). \\"A Companion to Ethics\\". Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a \\"moral dilemma\\" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues, p . 244 in: The ethics of research involving animals at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 May 2005 In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Donald Watson has stated that vivisection and animal experimentation \\"is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation.\\" Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations.Rollin, Bernard E. (1998) \\"The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects,\\" in Kuhse, Helga and Singer, Peter (eds.). \\"A Companion to Bioethics\\". Blackwell Publishing, . Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit. Governments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the public's concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees. The British government has required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge. Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals.ÈüìÂõΩ„ÉªÈ£üËñ¨Â∫Å„Åß„ÄåÂÆüÈ®ìÂãïÁâ©ÊÖ∞ÈúäÁ•≠„ÄçÊåôË°å In Japan there are also annual memorial services (Ireisai ÊÖ∞ÈúäÁ•≠) for animals sacrificed at medical school. Dolly the sheep: the first clone produced from the somatic cells of an adult mammal Various specific cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including both instances of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs are still the preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro and the possibility of isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy).Liber, R. L. (2002). Skeletal Muscle Structure, Function, and Plasticity: The Physiological Basis of Rehabilitation, 2nd ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, . In February 1997 a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of Britches, a macaque monkey at the University of California, Riverside, gained public attention. He had his eyelids sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head as part of an experiment to test sensory substitution devices for blind people. The laboratory was raided by Animal Liberation Front in 1985, removing Britches and 466 other animals.Franklin, Ben A. (30 August 1987) \\"Going to Extremes for 'Animal Rights'\\", The New York Times. The National Institutes of Health conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded, however, that no corrective action was necessary. During the 2000s other cases have made headlines, including experiments at the University of CambridgeLaville, Sandra (8 February 2005). \\"Lab monkeys 'scream with fear' in tests\\", The Guardian. and Columbia University in 2002.\\"Columbia in animal cruelty dispute\\", CNN (2003-10-12) In 2004 and 2005, undercover footage of staff of Covance's, a contract research organization that provides animal testing services, Virginia lab was shot by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Following release of the footage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Covance $8,720 for 16 citations, three of which involved lab monkeys; the other citations involved administrative issues and equipment.Benz, Kathy and McManus, Michael (17 May 2005). PETA accuses lab of animal cruelty, CNN.Scott, Luci (1 April 2006). \\"Probe leads to Covance fine\\", The Arizona Republic. =Threats to researchers= Threats of violence to animal researchers are not uncommon. In 2006, a primate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized. The researcher's name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack.Epstein, David (22 August 2006). Throwing in the Towel, Inside Higher Education As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating \\"you win\\", and \\"please don't bother my family anymore\\".Predators Unleashed, Investor's Business Daily (2006-08-24) In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.McDonald, Patrick Range (8 August 2007).

The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign used tactics ranging from non-violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS's clients and investors. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors US domestic extremism, has described SHAC's modus operandi as \\"frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists,\\" and in 2005 an official with the FBI's counter-terrorism division referred to SHAC's activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats.\\"From push to shove\\", Southern Poverty Law Group Intelligence Report, Fall 2002Lewis, John E. \\"Statement of John Lewis\\", US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 26 October 2005, accessed 17 January 2011. 13 members of SHAC were jailed for between 15 months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers.Evers, Marco. \\"Resisting the Animal Avengers\\", Part 1, Part 2, Der Spiegel, 19 November 2007.Weaver, Matthew. \\"Animal rights activists jailed for terrorising suppliers to Huntingdon Life Sciences\\", The Guardian, 25 October 2010. These attacks‚Äîas well as similar incidents that caused the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had \\"clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme\\"‚Äîprompted the US government to pass the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the UK government to add the offense of \\"Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation\\" to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Such legislation and the arrest and imprisonment of activists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.Herbert, Ian (27 January 2007). \\"Collapse in support for animal rights extremist attacks\\", The Independent. = Scientific criticism = Systematic reviews have pointed out that animal testing often fails to accurately mirror outcomes in humans. For instance, a 2013 review noted that some 100 vaccines have been shown to prevent HIV in animals, yet none of them have worked on humans. Effects seen in animals may not be replicated in humans, and vice versa. Many corticosteroids cause birth defects in animals, but not in humans. Conversely, thalidomide causes serious birth defects in humans, but not in animals. A 2004 paper concluded that much animal research is wasted because systemic reviews are not used, and due to poor methodology. A 2006 review found multiple studies where there were promising results for new drugs in animals, but human clinical studies did not show the same results. The researchers suggested that this might be due to researcher bias, or simply because animal models do not accurately reflect human biology. Lack of meta-reviews may be partially to blame. Poor methodology is an issue in many studies. A 2009 review noted that many animal experiments did not use blinded experiments, a key element of many scientific studies in which researchers are not told about the part of the study they are working on to reduce bias. Alternatives to animal testing Most scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. The \\"Three Rs\\" are guiding principles for the use of animals in research in most countries. Whilst replacement of animals, i.e. alternatives to animal testing, is one of the principles, their scope is much broader. Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups, they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research, and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare. The scientists and engineers at Harvard's Wyss Institute have created \\"organs-on- a-chip\\", including the \\"lung-on-a-chip\\" and \\"gut-on-a-chip\\". Researchers at cellasys in Germany developed a \\"skin-on-a-chip\\". These tiny devices contain human cells in a 3-dimensional system that mimics human organs. The chips can be used instead of animals in in vitro disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing. Researchers have also begun using 3-D bioprinters to create human tissues for in vitro testing. Another non-animal research method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling which seeks to investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with the ultimate goal of creating treatments unique to each patient. Microdosing is another alternative to the use of animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing. Additional alternative methods include positron emission tomography (PET), which allows scanning of the human brain in vivo, and comparative epidemiological studies of disease risk factors among human populations. Simulators and computer programs have also replaced the use of animals in dissection, teaching and training exercises.

Cartographic experiments during the Enlightenment era preceded European panorama painting and contributedas argued in Oettermann, Stephan, The Panorama: History of a Mass Medium. trans. Deborah Lucas Schneider (New York: Zone Books, 1997) to a formative impulse toward panoramic vision and depiction. This novel perspective was quickly conveyed to America by Benjamin Franklin who was present for the first manned balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783, and by the American-born physician, John Jeffries who had joined French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard on flights over England and the first aerial crossing of the English Channel in 1785.John Jeffries.

As popular spectacle  In the mid-19th century, panoramic paintings and models became a very popular way to represent landscapes, topographic viewsThe USA Library of Congress holds 1,172 images of panoramic maps of American towns and cities and the British Library has panoramas of UK cities and towns, and of many in its colonies and historical events. Audiences of Europe in this period were thrilled by the aspect of illusion, immersed in a winding 360 degree panorama and given the impression of standing in a new environment. The panorama was a 360-degree visual medium patented under the title Apparatus for Exhibiting Pictures by the artist Robert Barker in 1787. The earliest that the word \\"panorama\\" appeared in print was on June 11, 1791 in the British newspaper The Morning Chronicle, referring to this visual spectacle.This reference, the earliest found so far, is suggested by Scott Wilcox in 'Erfindung und Entwicklung des Panoramas in Grossbritannien', Sehsucht. Das Panorama als Massenunterhaltung des 19 Jahrhunderts, edited by Marie-Louise von Plessen, Ulrich Giersch. Basel and Frankfurt am Main: Stroemfeld/Roter Stern, 1993, p. 35 (note 11) Barker created a painting, shown on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside, giving viewers a vantage point encompassing the entire circle of the horizon, rendering the original scene with high fidelity. The inaugural exhibition, a \\"View of Edinburgh\\" (specifically the view from the summit of Calton Hill), was first shown in that city in 1788, then transported to London in 1789. By 1793, Barker had built \\"The Panorama\\" rotunda at the center of London's entertainment district in Leicester Square, where it remained attracting visitors for 70 years, then closing in 1863, before being converted into the church of Notre Dame de France. Inventor Sir Francis Ronalds developed a machine to remove errors in perspective that were created when a sequence of planar sketches was combined into a cylinder. It also projected the cylindrical drawing onto the wall of the rotunda at much larger scale to enable its accurate painting. The apparatus was exhibited at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s. Large scale installations enhance the illusion for an audience of being surrounded with a real landscape. The Bourbaki Panorama in Lucerne, Switzerland was created by Edouard Castres in 1881.The Bourbaki Panorama, which shows the plight of the French Troops of General Bourbaki in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War, is the subject of Jeff Wall's 1993 photograph Restoration. Wall constructed a fictitious scene in which actual conservators were posed as if they were in the process of restoring the painting which was not in fact undergoing restoration at the time. ( p.91) The painting measures about 10 metres in height with a circumference of 112 meters.Bernard Comment (2004),Panorama, Reaktion Books, page 214 In the same year of 1881, the Dutch marine painter Hendrik Willem Mesdag created and established the Panorama Mesdag of The Hague, Netherlands, a cylindrical painting more than 14 metres high and roughly 40 meters in diameter (120 meters in circumference). In the United States of America is the Atlanta Cyclorama, depicting the Civil War Battle of Atlanta. It was first displayed in 1887, and is 42 feet high by 358 feet circumference (13 x 109 metres).Marty Olmstead (2002), Hidden Georgia, Ulysses Press, page 204 Also on a gigantic scale, and still extant, is the Rac≈Çawice Panorama (1893) located in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, which measures 15 x 120 metres.Jan Stanis≈Çaw Kopczewski (1976), Kosciuszko and Pulaski, Interpress, page 220 In addition to these historical examples, there have been panoramas painted and installed in modern times; prominent among these is the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles, California (2004).  Photographs  Panoramic photography soon came to displace painting as the most common method for creating wide views. Not long after the introduction of the Daguerreotype in 1839, photographers began assembling multiple images of a view into a single wide image.for example, the Cincinnati Panorama (1848), a daguerreotype by Charles Fontayne and William S. Porter. 6¬Ω x 68 inches (15.24 by 21.59 cm). Held at the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/ref/collection/p267401coll36/id/4168 In the late 19th century, flexible film enabled the construction of panoramic cameras using curved film holders and clockwork drives to rotate the lens in an arc and thus scan an image encompassing almost 180 degrees. Pinhole cameras of a variety of constructions can be used to make panoramic images. A popular design is the \\"oatmeal box\\", a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite, and extending almost right to the edge of, the pinhole. This generates an egg-shaped image with more than 180¬∞ view.Eric Renner (2008). Pinhole photography from historic technique to digital application (4th ed). Amsterdam Focal Press pps. 129-140 Popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but now superseded by digital presentation software, Multi-image (also known as multi-image slide presentations, slide shows or diaporamas) 35mm slide projections onto one or more screens characteristically lent themselves to the wide screen panorama. They could run autonomously with silent synchronization pulses to control projector advance and fades, recorded beside an audio voice-over or music track. Precisely overlapping slides placed in slide mounts with soft-edge density masks would merge seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama. Cutting and dissolving between sequential images generated animation effects in the panorama format. = VR photographs = Digital photography of the late twentieth century greatly simplified this assembly process, which is now known as image stitching. Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of virtual reality movies, using technologies such as Apple Inc.'s QuickTime VR, Flash, Java, or even JavaScript. A rotating line camera such as the Panoscan allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for image stitching, but immersive \\"spherical\\" panorama movies (that incorporate a full 180¬∞ vertical viewing angle as well as 360¬∞ around) must be made by stitching multiple images. Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution gigapixel panoramic images.  Motion picture  On rare occasions, 360¬∞ panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces‚Äîtypically at theme parks, world's fairs, and museums. Starting in 1955, Disney has created 360¬∞ theaters for its parksJoshua C. Shaffer (2010), Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide, AuthorHouse, page 200 and the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne, Switzerland, features a theatre that is a large cylindrical space with an arrangement of screens whose bottom is several metres above the floor. Panoramic systems that are less than 360¬∞ around also exist. For example, Cinerama used a very wide curved screen, with three synchronized projectors, and IMAX Dome / OMNIMAX movies are projected on a dome above the spectators.  Non-photographic representations  Panoramic representation can be generated from digital elevation models such as SRTM. In these diagrams, a panorama from any given pointMcAdoo, B.

The molecular bond energy of the monopropellant is released usually through use of a catalyst. This can be contrasted with bipropellants that release energy through the chemical reaction between an oxidizer and a fuel. While stable under defined storage conditions, monopropellants decompose very rapidly under certain other conditions to produce a large volume of energetic (hot) gases for the performance of mechanical work. Although solid deflagrants such as nitrocellulose, the most commonly used propellant in firearms, could be thought of as monopropellants, the term is usually reserved for liquids in engineering literature. Uses The most common use of monopropellants is in low-impulse monopropellant rocket motors, such as reaction control thrusters, the usual propellant being hydrazine , p. 230 which is generally decomposed by exposure to an iridium, pp. 307‚Äî309 catalyst bed (the hydrazine is pre-heated to keep the reactant liquid). This decomposition produces the desired jet of hot gas and thus thrust. Hydrogen peroxide has been used as a power source for propellant tank pumps in rockets like the German WWII V-2 and the American Redstone., ch. 7. The hydrogen peroxide is passed through a platinum catalyst mesh, or comes in contact with manganese dioxide impregnated ceramic beads, or Z-Stoff permanganate solution is co-injected, which causes hydrogen peroxide to decompose into hot steam and oxygen. Monopropellants are also used in some air-independent propulsion systems (AIP) to \\"fuel\\" reciprocating or turbine engines in environments where free oxygen is unavailable. Weapons intended primarily for combat between nuclear-powered submarines generally fall into this category. The most commonly used propellant in this case is stabilized propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), often referred to as \\"Otto fuel\\". A potential future use for monopropellants not directly related to propulsion is in compact, high-intensity powerplants for aquatic or exoatmospheric environments. Research in brief  Much work was done in the US in the 1950s and 1960s to attempt to find better and more energetic monopropellants. For the most part, researchers came to the conclusion that any single substance that contained enough energy to compete with bipropellants would be too unstable to handle safely under practical conditions. With new materials, control systems and requirements for high-performance thrusters, engineers are currently re-examining this assumption. Many partially nitrated alcohol esters are suitable for use as monopropellants. \\"Trimethylene glycol dinitrate\\" or 1,3-propanediol dinitrate is isomeric with PGDN, and produced as a fractional byproduct in all but the most exacting laboratory conditions; the marginally lower specific gravity (and thus energy density) of this compound argues against its use, but the minor differences in chemistry may prove useful in the future. The related \\"dinitrodiglycol\\", more properly termed diethylene glycol dinitrate in modern notation, was widely used in World War 2 Germany, both alone as a liquid monopropellant and colloidal with nitrocellulose as a solid propellant. The otherwise desirable characteristics of this compound; it is quite stable, easy to manufacture, and has a very high energy density; are marred by a high freeze point (-11.5 deg. C) and pronounced thermal expansion, both being problematic in spacecraft. \\"Dinitrochlorohydrin\\" and \\"tetranitrodiglycerin\\" are also likely candidates, though no current use is known. The polynitrates of long chain and aromatic hydrocarbons are invariably room temperature solids, but many are soluble in simple alcohols or ethers in high proportion, and may be useful in this state. Hydrazine, ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide (especially in its German World War II form as T-Stoff), and nitromethane are common rocket monopropellants. As noted the specific impulse of monopropellants is lower, p. 36 than bipropellants and can be found with the Air Force Chemical Equilibrium Specific Impulse Code tool. One newer monopropellant under development is nitrous oxide, both neat and in the form of nitrous oxide fuel blends. Nitrous oxide offers the advantages of being self-pressurizing and of being relatively non-toxic, with a specific impulse intermediate between hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine. Nitrous oxide generates oxygen upon decomposition, and it is possible to blend it with fuels to form a monopropellant mixture with a specific impulse up to 325 s, comparable to hypergolic bipropellants. Direct comparison of physical properties, performance, cost, storability, toxicity, storage requirements and accidental release measures for hydrogen peroxide, hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), hydrazine and various cold gas monopropellants shows that hydrazine is the highest performing in terms of specific impulse. However, hydrazine is also the most expensive and toxic. In addition HAN and hydrogen peroxide have the highest density impulse (total impulse per given unit volume).

Critical Mass is a form of direct action in which people meet at a set location and time and travel as a group through their neighbourhoods on bikes. The idea is for people to group together to make it safe for each other to ride bicycles through their streets, based on the old mantra: there's safety in numbers. A Critical Mass is a traffic jam on bikes ‚Äì though often cheerier. Where usually motor vehicles have right of way, taking space away from those who want to walk or cycle, during a Critical Mass bikes take the priority and the space back from the motor traffic. Critical Mass events highlight the numbers of people who want to use their bike on the streets, but are usually unable to do so without risking their safety. They are a call to action to councils, governments and road planners to properly and thoughtfully design in the safety of all road users, including those who would prefer to walk and cycle, instead of prioritising motor traffic above all else. The event originated in 1992 in San Francisco (typically held on the last Friday of every month); by the end of 2003, the event was being held in over 300 cities around the world. Critical Mass has been described as \\"monthly political-protest rides\\", and characterized as being part of a social movement. It has been described as a \\"monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets.\\" Participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as \\"celebrations\\" and spontaneous gatherings, and not as protests or organized demonstrations. This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police. Though they are sometimes described as political, they are not necessarily.  History  Broadway Tunnel (San Francisco) September 29, 2006 Critical Mass-like bike tours with hundreds of participants took place in Stockholm, Sweden in the early 1970s. But the first ride within the present wave took place on Friday, September 25, 1992, at 6 pm in San Francisco. At that time, the event was known as Commute Clot and was composed of a couple of dozen cyclists who had received flyers on Market Street. Shortly after this, some participants in that ride went to a local bicycle shop for a screening of Ted White's documentary Return of the Scorcher, about bike culture in the Netherlands and China in comparison with that of the United States. In that film, American human-powered vehicle and pedicab designer George Bliss noted that, in China, both motorists and bicyclists had an \\"understood\\" method of negotiating intersections without signals. Traffic would queue up at these intersections until the backlog reached a \\"critical mass\\", at which point that mass would move through the intersection. This term from the footage of the movie, was applied to the name of the ride, and the name caught on, replacing \\"Commute Clot\\" by the time of the second event.  Organization and tactics  = Structure = Full path of Critical Mass in Lisbon in April 2012 Critical Mass has a decentralized (rather than hierarchical) structure. Critical Mass is sometimes called an \\"organized coincidence\\", with no leadership or membership. The routes of some rides are decided spontaneously by whomever is currently at the front of the ride, while others are decided prior to the ride by a popular vote of suggested routes often drawn up on photocopied fliers. The term xerocracy was coined to describe a process by which the route for a Critical Mass can be decided: anyone who has an opinion makes their own map and distributes it to the cyclists participating in the Mass. Still other rides decide the route by consensus. The disorganized nature of the event allows it to largely escape clampdown by authorities who may view the rides as forms of parades or organized protest. Additionally, the movement is free from the structural costs associated with a centralized, hierarchical organization. In order for the event to function, the only requirement is a sufficient turn-out to create a \\"critical mass\\" of riders dense enough to occupy a piece of road to the exclusion of drivers of motorized vehicles. Authorities in New York, California and Oregon have expressed concern with the difficulty of coordinating with the riders, due to the lack of leadership. = Scale = Bike lift in Budapest, September 22, 2007 Critical Mass rides vary greatly in many respects, including frequency and number of participants. For example, many small cities have monthly Critical Mass rides with fewer than twenty riders which offer safety in numbers to cyclists in those locales, while on the opposite extreme, in what have been the largest events using the name Critical Mass, cyclists in Budapest, Hungary hold only two rides each year on April 22 (Earth Day) and September 22 (International Car Free Day). The \\"Budapest style\\" attracts tens of thousands of riders. The April 20, 2008, Budapest ride participation was estimated at 80,000 riders. In Vienna, close to Budapest, a Critical Mass Ride has been held every month since 2006 and attracts up to 1,000 or more riders. = Corking = Detail from the November 20, 1992 flyer by Joel Pomerantz which introduced the concept of corking Because Critical Mass takes place without an official route or sanction, participants in some cities have sometimes practiced a tactic known as \\"corking\\" in order to maintain the cohesion of the group. This tactic consists of a few riders blocking traffic from side roads so that the mass can freely proceed through red lights without interruption. Corking allows the mass to engage in a variety of activities, such as forming a cyclone, lifting their bikes in a tradition known as a \\"Bike Lift\\" (in Chicago this is referred to as a Chicago hold-up), or to perform a \\"die-in\\" where riders lie on the ground with their bikes to symbolise cyclist deaths and injuries caused by automobiles, very popular in Montreal. The \\"Corks\\" sometimes take advantage of their time corking to distribute fliers. The practice of corking roads in order to pass through red lights as a group is in contravention of traffic laws in some jurisdictions and is sometimes criticized to be contrary to Critical Mass' claim that \\"we are traffic\\", since ordinary traffic does not have the right to go through intersections once the traffic signal has changed to red. Joel Pomerantz, the writer, rider and co-founder of Critical Mass who popularized corking in San Francisco, explained in his 1992 instructional flyer that he sees the ride as a single vehicle for safety purposes, similar to a longer, articulated bus. He argued that it enhances both traffic flow overall and safety to keep the ride together as in a funeral procession, which he viewed Critical as, metaphorically, for the death of car culture and crash victims. Frustrated car drivers inhibited by the ride have sometimes reacted in hostile ways toward riders, even erupting into violence and arrests of motorists and cyclists alike during Critical Mass rides. Pomerantz's flyers have also proposed that drivers should only be as mad as they are at any traffic jam, most of which they accept as normal. Timelapse video of a Critical Mass in Chicago in 2009  Other bicycling groups  = Similar organizations and movements = The Critical Mass rides have inspired a number of other bicycle movements, that range from political movements to the \\"Critical Tits\\" ride during the yearly Burning Man festival. In Chicago, a movement has grown out of the Critical Mass community to promote winter cycling via the bikewinter campaign. The extensive news coverage of San Francisco's July 1997 ride spawned an international celebration of bicycling, called Bike Summer. Kidical Mass originated in Oregon, and encourages bicycle riding for children and families. The movement gained momentum in North America and Europe and set a record in September 2019, when 1100 riders took part in Dortmund, Germany. Critical Sass was an all-female version of the ride in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that took place the second Friday of every month. The Tweed Run (along with various other vintage bike rides) is a well dressed mass which takes place annually in a number of cities across the world. Examples of Critical Mass rides for political movements includes the Free Tibet Rides (May 2008): Free Tibet Critical Mass in Columbia, Missouri, \\"Tibetan Freedom Bike Rally\\" in San Francisco (Aug 2008), and in \\"Bike Ride for Tibet\\" in London (Aug 2008). San Jose is the home to San Jose Bike Party. Bike Party rides on the third Friday of the month with a different starting point and route each time. Rides are typically 15‚Äì25 miles in length and usually 1000-2000 riders in Summer. The ride aims to build a community of cyclists and prove that bikes can co-exist with cars. It is different than Critical Mass in that it rides after rush hour and obeys all traffic laws and has a pre-determined route. San Luis Obispo, California, is the home of the \\"Bikes are happening...\\" meetup. Bikes are happening... starts at Mission Plaza at 9:30 pm on the first Thursday of the month. The ride consists of a continuous half mile loop through downtown San Luis Obispo. Since there is no permit for the ride, riders are asked to follow three rules: have fun, respect the community, and obey all traffic laws. In Portland, Oregon a tactic called a ‚Äúbike swarm‚Äù has been used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to separate marching protesters from police. A huge bicycle demonstration is the \\"Fahrrad- Sternfahrt\\" in Berlin, Germany, since 1976. Each year in June and usually have 150.000‚Äì250.000 riders. Together the 19 rides are more than 600 miles long including two sections of motorway. = Critical Manners = Critical Mass riders in Atlanta In San Francisco, an event known as \\"Critical Manners\\" was created as a response to Critical Mass. Critical Manners rides through the city on the second Friday of the month, with riders encouraged to obey all traffic laws such as stopping at red lights and signaling. Tucson, Arizona holds the Tuesday Night Community Bike Ride as their alternative to Critical Mass. The weekly ride encourages bicycle commuting and motor vehicle awareness in a peaceful and friendly way. In 2007 there were conversations about starting Critical Manners in Portland, Oregon. According to the Critical Mass book, a similar project known as Courteous Mass is described as \\"an alternative to Critical Mass.\\" An alternative ride named RideCivil formed in Seattle in late 2007. Rides are on the second Friday of every month, and focus on encouraging civility between motorists, pedestrians and cyclists. On June 12, 2009, an Indianapolis Critical Manners ride called \\"Courteous Mass\\" was launched but is no longer active as of 2016. On August 14, 2009 there was a Critical Manners ride in Vancouver, British Columbia. The ride consisted of between 70‚Äì100 cyclists riding through the downtown core, making all attempts to follow the rules of the road (stopping at red lights / stop signs, using hand signals to turn, using the right-most lane or bike lane when applicable). The event generated some coverage in the local media and was generally deemed a success by the participants, although there were some criticisms. The ride only survived one outing. In Kathmandu, Nepal, it has been organised since April 2013. In general cyclists gather at Kathmandu Durbar Square, Basantapur and ride round the city before grouping together again. Sometimes there are people organizing awareness programmes in this gathering. People who really love cycling and feel awareness about own health, environment they doing Critical Mass Gathering even after the heavy Nepal Earthquake 2015 with slogan \\"Quake or Shake, Sunny or Rainy, we have to flow with time for next smile...\\" Critical Mass (Kathmandu, Nepal)  Conflicts involving Critical Mass  Critical Mass rides have generated controversy and public opposition. The group has often protested in high-profile events, ranging from major political events to the Olympics. Some critics claim that Critical Mass is a deliberate attempt to obstruct traffic and disrupt normal city functions, asserting that individuals taking part refuse to obey traffic laws. Some bicycling advocacy groups have expressed concern that the nature of Critical Mass and altercations with motorists could weaken public support for cyclists. Though it does not condone incidents of violence and rudeness, the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition credits Critical Mass with spotlighting bicycle issues and aiding their efforts in advocating for cyclists.

Rays from the light source (like photons) and rays from the camera are traced independently until some termination criterion is met, then they are connected in a second step to produce a radiance value. The algorithm is used to realistically simulate the interaction of light with different types of objects (similar to other photorealistic rendering techniques). Specifically, it is capable of simulating the refraction of light through a transparent substance such as glass or water (including caustics), diffuse interreflection between illuminated objects, the subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials, and some of the effects caused by particulate matter such as smoke or water vapor. Photon mapping can also be extended to more accurate simulations of light, such as spectral rendering. Progressive photon mapping (PPM) starts with ray tracing and then adds more and more photon mapping passes to provide a progressively more accurate render. Unlike path tracing, bidirectional path tracing, volumetric path tracing, and Metropolis light transport, photon mapping is a \\"biased\\" rendering algorithm, which means that averaging infinitely many renders of the same scene using this method does not converge to a correct solution to the rendering equation. However, it is a consistent method, and the accuracy of a render can be increased by increasing the number of photons. As the number of photons approaches infinity, a render will get closer and closer to the solution of the rendering equation. Effects =Caustics= ray-traced with photon mapping to show caustics Light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics, usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces. For example, as light rays pass through a wine glass sitting on a table, they are refracted and patterns of light are visible on the table. Photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear. =Diffuse interreflection= Diffuse interreflection is apparent when light from one diffuse object is reflected onto another. Photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another based on that surface's bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method. Diffuse interreflection was first modeled using radiosity solutions. Photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene. Color bleed is an example of diffuse interreflection. =Subsurface scattering= Subsurface scattering is the effect evident when light enters a material and is scattered before being absorbed or reflected in a different direction. Subsurface scattering can accurately be modeled using photon mapping. This was the original way Jensen implemented it; however, the method becomes slow for highly scattering materials, and bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution functions (BSSRDFs) are more efficient in these situations. Usage =Construction of the photon map (1st pass)= With photon mapping, light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources. Whenever a photon intersects with a surface, the intersection point and incoming direction are stored in a cache called the photon map. Typically, two photon maps are created for a scene: one especially for caustics and a global one for other light. After intersecting the surface, a probability for either reflecting, absorbing, or transmitting/refracting is given by the material. A Monte Carlo method called Russian roulette is used to choose one of these actions. If the photon is absorbed, no new direction is given, and tracing for that photon ends. If the photon reflects, the surface's bidirectional reflectance distribution function is used to determine the ratio of reflected radiance. Finally, if the photon is transmitting, a function for its direction is given depending upon the nature of the transmission. Once the photon map is constructed (or during construction), it is typically arranged in a manner that is optimal for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, as photon look-up time depends on the spatial distribution of the photons. Jensen advocates the usage of kd-trees. The photon map is then stored on disk or in memory for later usage. =Rendering (2nd pass)= In this step of the algorithm, the photon map created in the first pass is used to estimate the radiance of every pixel of the output image. For each pixel, the scene is ray traced until the closest surface of intersection is found. At this point, the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it. To facilitate efficiency, the equation is decomposed into four separate factors: direct illumination, specular reflection, caustics, and soft indirect illumination. For an accurate estimate of direct illumination, a ray is traced from the point of intersection to each light source. As long as a ray does not intersect another object, the light source is used to calculate the direct illumination. For an approximate estimate of indirect illumination, the photon map is used to calculate the radiance contribution. Specular reflection can be, in most cases, calculated using ray tracing procedures (as it handles reflections well). The contribution to the surface radiance from caustics is calculated using the caustics photon map directly. The number of photons in this map must be sufficiently large, as the map is the only source for caustics information in the scene. For soft indirect illumination, radiance is calculated using the photon map directly. This contribution, however, does not need to be as accurate as the caustics contribution and thus uses the global photon map. Calculating radiance using the photon map In order to calculate surface radiance at an intersection point, one of the cached photon maps is used. The steps are: # Gather the N nearest photons using the nearest neighbor search function on the photon map. # Let S be the sphere that contains these N photons. # For each photon, divide the amount of flux (real photons) that the photon represents by the area of S and multiply by the BRDF applied to that photon. # The sum of those results for each photon represents total surface radiance returned by the surface intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it. =Optimizations= * To avoid emitting unneeded photons, the initial direction of the outgoing photons is often constrained. Instead of simply sending out photons in random directions, they are sent in the direction of a known object that is a desired photon manipulator to either focus or diffuse the light. There are many other refinements that can be made to the algorithm: for example, choosing the number of photons to send, and where and in what pattern to send them. It would seem that emitting more photons in a specific direction would cause a higher density of photons to be stored in the photon map around the position where the photons hit, and thus measuring this density would give an inaccurate value for irradiance. This is true; however, the algorithm used to compute radiance does not depend on irradiance estimates. * For soft indirect illumination, if the surface is Lambertian, then a technique known as irradiance caching may be used to interpolate values from previous calculations. * To avoid unnecessary collision testing in direct illumination, shadow photons can be used. During the photon mapping process, when a photon strikes a surface, in addition to the usual operations performed, a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object. The next object it collides with causes a shadow photon to be stored in the photon map. Then during the direct illumination calculation, instead of sending out a ray from the surface to the light that tests collisions with objects, the photon map is queried for shadow photons. If none are present, then the object has a clear line of sight to the light source and additional calculations can be avoided. * To optimize image quality, particularly of caustics, Jensen recommends use of a cone filter. Essentially, the filter gives weight to photons' contributions to radiance depending on how far they are from ray-surface intersections. This can produce sharper images. * Image space photon mapping achieves real-time performance by computing the first and last scattering using a GPU rasterizer. =Variations= * Although photon mapping was designed to work primarily with ray tracers, it can also be extended for use with scanline renderers.

The algebras produced by this process are known as Cayley‚ÄìDickson algebras, for example complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions. These examples are useful composition algebras frequently applied in mathematical physics. The Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction defines a new algebra similar to the direct sum of an algebra with itself, with multiplication defined in a specific way (different from the multiplication provided by the genuine direct sum) and an involution known as conjugation. The product of an element and its conjugate (or sometimes the square root of this product) is called the norm. The symmetries of the real field disappear as the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction is repeatedly applied: first losing order, then commutativity of multiplication, associativity of multiplication, and next alternativity. More generally, the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction takes any algebra with involution to another algebra with involution of twice the dimension. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" + Cayley‚ÄìDickson algebras properties - ! rowspan=2Algebra ! rowspan=2Dimen‚Äê sion !! rowspan=2Ordered !! colspan=4Multiplication properties !! rowspan=2Nontriv. zero divisors - !

Complex numbers as ordered pairs  The complex numbers can be written as ordered pairs (a, b) of real numbers a and b, with the addition operator being component-by-component and with multiplication defined by : (a, b) (c, d) = (a c - b d, a d + b c).\\\\, A complex number whose second component is zero is associated with a real number: the complex number (a, 0) is the real number a. The complex conjugate (a, b)* of (a, b) is given by : (a, b)^* = (a^*, -b) = (a, -b) since a is a real number and its conjugate is just a. The conjugate has the property that : (a, b)^* (a, b) = (a a + b b, a b - b a) = (a^2 + b^2, 0),\\\\, which is a non-negative real number. In this way, conjugation defines a norm, making the complex numbers a normed vector space over the real numbers: the norm of a complex number z is : z = (z^* z)^{1/2}.\\\\, Furthermore, for any non-zero complex number z, conjugation gives a multiplicative inverse, : z^{-1} = {z^* / z^2}.\\\\, As a complex number consists of two independent real numbers, they form a 2-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. Besides being of higher dimension, the complex numbers can be said to lack one algebraic property of the real numbers: a real number is its own conjugate.  Quaternions  The next step in the construction is to generalize the multiplication and conjugation operations. Form ordered pairs (a, b) of complex numbers a and b, with multiplication defined by : (a, b) (c, d) = (a c - d^* b, d a + b c^*).\\\\, Slight variations on this formula are possible; the resulting constructions will yield structures identical up to the signs of bases. The order of the factors seems odd now, but will be important in the next step. Define the conjugate (a, b)^*\\\\, of (a, b) by : (a, b)^* = (a^*, -b).\\\\, These operators are direct extensions of their complex analogs: if a and b are taken from the real subset of complex numbers, the appearance of the conjugate in the formulas has no effect, so the operators are the same as those for the complex numbers. The product of a nonzero element with its conjugate is a non-negative real number: : (a, b)^* (a, b) = (a^*, -b) (a, b) = (a^* a + b^* b, b a^* - b a^*) = (a^2 + b^2, 0 ).\\\\, As before, the conjugate thus yields a norm and an inverse for any such ordered pair. So in the sense we explained above, these pairs constitute an algebra something like the real numbers. They are the quaternions, named by Hamilton in 1843. As a quaternion consists of two independent complex numbers, they form a 4-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. The multiplication of quaternions is not quite like the multiplication of real numbers, though. It is not commutative, that is, if p and q are quaternions, it is not always true that p q = q p.  Octonions  All the steps to create further algebras are the same from octonions on. This time, form ordered pairs (p, q) of quaternions p and q, with multiplication and conjugation defined exactly as for the quaternions: : (p, q) (r, s) = (p r - s^* q, s p + q r^*).\\\\, Note, however, that because the quaternions are not commutative, the order of the factors in the multiplication formula becomes important‚Äîif the last factor in the multiplication formula were r^*q rather than qr^*, the formula for multiplication of an element by its conjugate would not yield a real number. For exactly the same reasons as before, the conjugation operator yields a norm and a multiplicative inverse of any nonzero element. This algebra was discovered by John T. Graves in 1843, and is called the octonions or the \\"Cayley numbers\\". As an octonion consists of two independent quaternions, they form an 8-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. The multiplication of octonions is even stranger than that of quaternions. Besides being non-commutative, it is not associative: that is, if p, q, and r are octonions, it is not always true that :(p q) r = p (q r).\\\\ For the reason of this non-associativity, octonions have no matrix representation.  Further algebras  The algebra immediately following the octonions is called the sedenions. It retains an algebraic property called power associativity, meaning that if s is a sedenion, s^n s^m = s^{n + m}, but loses the property of being an alternative algebra and hence cannot be a composition algebra. The Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction can be carried on ad infinitum, at each step producing a power-associative algebra whose dimension is double that of the algebra of the preceding step. All the algebras generated in this way over a field are quadratic: that is, each element satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients from the field. In 1954 R. D. Schafer examined the algebras generated by the Cayley-Dickson process over a field F and showed they satisfy the flexible identity.Richard D. Schafer (1954) \\"On the algebras formed by the Cayley-Dickson process\\", American Journal of Mathematics 76: 435‚Äì46 He also proved that any derivation algebra of a Cayley-Dickson algebra is isomorphic to the derivation algebra of Cayley numbers, a 14-dimensional Lie algebra over F.  Modified Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction  The Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction, starting from the real numbers ‚Ñù, generates division composition algebras. There are also composition algebras with isotropic quadratic forms that are obtained through a slight modification, by replacing the minus sign in the definition of the product of ordered pairs with a plus sign, as follows: : (a, b) (c, d) = (a c + d^* b, d a + b c^*).\\\\, When this modified construction is applied to ‚Ñù, one obtains the split-complex numbers, which are ring-isomorphic to the direct sum ‚Ñù ‚äï ‚Ñù (also written 2‚Ñù); following that, one obtains the split-quaternions, isomorphic to M2(‚Ñù); and the split-octonions, which are isomorphic to Zorn(‚Ñù). Applying the original Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction to the split-complexes also results in the split-quaternions and then the split-octonions.Kevin McCrimmon (2004) A Taste of Jordan Algebras, pp 64, Universitext, Springer  General Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction  gave a slight generalization, defining the product and involution on B=A‚äïA for A an algebra with involution (with (xy)* = y*x*) to be : (p, q) (r, s) = (p r - \\\\gamma s^* q, s p + q r^*)\\\\, :(p, q)^* = (p^*, -q)\\\\ for Œ≥ an additive map that commutes with * and left and right multiplication by any element. (Over the reals all choices of Œ≥ are equivalent to ‚àí1, 0 or 1.) In this construction, A is an algebra with involution, meaning: *A is an abelian group under + *A has a product that is left and right distributive over + *A has an involution *, with x** = x, (x + y)* = x* + y*, (xy)* = y*x*. The algebra B=A‚äïA produced by the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction is also an algebra with involution. B inherits properties from A unchanged as follows. *If A has an identity 1A, then B has an identity (1A, 0). *If A has the property that x + x*, xx* associate and commute with all elements, then so does B. This property implies that any element generates a commutative associative *-algebra, so in particular the algebra is power associative. Other properties of A only induce weaker properties of B: *If A is commutative and has trivial involution, then B is commutative. *If A is commutative and associative then B is associative. *If A is associative and x + x*, xx* associate and commute with everything, then B is an alternative algebra.

He invented clustered high-altitude balloons, and with his wife Jeannette, the plastic balloon. Piccard's inventions and co-inventions are used in balloon flight, aircraft and spacecraft. Family Piccard and Jeannette Ridlon met at the University of Chicago where he taught and she received her master's degree. They married and had three sons, John, Paul and Donald, and also had foster children. Stratosphere flight Piccard signing autographs at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair Piccard was the co-pilot for his wife Jeannette on the third and final voyage of the Century of Progress. The largest balloon in the world was conceived for him to fly at the World's Fair in 1933 but was flown there by US Navy pilots who were licensed. After this flight he created the liquid oxygen converter when the liquid failed to vaporize on descent after the cabin doors were open. Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled actuating devices in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later his student Robert R. Gilruth, who became the director of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, approved and used them in spacecraft. The July 21st, 1952 issue of The Canberra Times newspaper printed an incorrect front-page article in which Dr. Piccard claimed it would be possible for humans to fly to Mars with balloons as early as 1954, if anyone was willing to invest $250,000. Dr. Piccard had actually claimed he would study the light from Mars through a spectroscope to try to find evidence of oxygen and water at a high altitude to ensure his measurements were as precise as possible. Plastic balloons Auguste (right) during World War IGruppenbild der Montagemannschaft, 1914.01.01-1918.12.31, Archives f√©d√©rales suisses In 1935 and 1936, to reduce weight and thus enabling a balloon to reach higher altitudes, plastic balloon construction began independently by Max Cosyns in Belgium, Erich Regener in Germany, and Thomas H. Johnson and Jean Piccard, then at the Franklin Institute's Bartol Research Foundation in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Johnson suggested cellophane to Jean Piccard. Piccard with his wife co- invented the plastic balloon and he designed and on 24 June 1936University of Minnesota Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics: Professor Jean F. Piccard's Contribution to Balloon Flight flew a cellophane balloon built by his students. The balloon was unmanned, 25 feet (7.6 meters) wide, and made of tapered 33-foot (10-meter) gores and one-inch (2.54-cm) 3M Scotch transparent tape. Jean Barnhill, Harold Larson and Lloyd Schumacher cut the gores that fit together like an \\"orange peel.\\" Harold Hatlestad built the radio equipment and Robert Silliman built the telemeter that sent temperature and pressure data back. Robert Hatch and Silliman maintained radio contact from a station on the roof of the university armory until the radio's battery froze from insufficient insulation. The balloon floated at 50,000 feet, and in ten hours traveled over 600 miles to near Huntsville, Arkansas. Cluster balloons Developed with John Akerman of the University of Minnesota and piloted by Jean Piccard in 1937 in Rochester, Minnesota, the first multi-celled balloon was called The Pleiades and was made of 98 latex rubber balloons. In a letter to Robert Gray of the Dewey and Almy Chemical Co. later published in Time magazine, Piccard describes how he broke balloons with a hunting knife and revolver to control his descent. A TNT charge released the cluster as he expected but sent burning excelsior down that destroyed the first Pleiades. He suggested to Gray that rock wool in place of excelsior would prevent similar accidents in the future. Balloon research stopped for the most part during World War II. In February 1946 with Otto C. Winzen, Jean Piccard proposed manned flight to the US Navy using clustered balloons made of thin plastic. In June the Office of Naval Research approved Project Helios and that year General Mills and the University of Minnesota contracted to build a cluster of 100 polyethylene balloons for atmospheric research. Helios was designed to reach 100,000 feet for ten hours with a payload of instruments. Jean Piccard helped Winzen design the Skyhook polyethylene balloons that replaced Project Helios in 1947. Skyhook balloons were used unmanned for atmospheric research by the Navy and for manned flights by the US Air Force. Later Jean Piccard developed electronics for emptying ballast bags. Piccard died on January 28, 1963 (his 79th birthday) in Minneapolis.

The label collapsed in 1992 and was bought by London Records. The label featured several important acts on its roster, including Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio, the Durutti Column, Happy Mondays, Northside, and (briefly) Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and James. Factory also ran The Ha√ßienda nightclub, in partnership with New Order. Like the 4AD label, Factory Records used a creative team (most notably record producer Martin Hannett and graphic designer Peter Saville) which gave the label and the artists recording for it a particular sound and image. The label employed a unique cataloguing system that gave a number not just to its musical releases, but also to various other related miscellany, including artwork, films, living beings, and even Wilson's own casket. History ='The Factory'= The Factory name was first used for a club in May of 1978; the first Factory night was on the 26 May 1978. The club became a Manchester legend in its own right, being known variously as the Russell Club, Caribbean Club, PSV (Public Service Vehicles) Club (so titled as it was originally a social club for bus drivers who worked from the nearby depot) and 'The Factory'. The ‚ÄòFactory‚Äô night at The Russell Club was launched by Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson, and helped by promoter Alan Wise. The name 'Factory' was chosen in homage to the New York club of the same name. As well as attracting numerous touring bands to the area and many upcoming post punk bands, it featured local bands including the Durutti Column (managed at the time by Erasmus and Wilson), Cabaret Voltaire from Sheffield and Joy Division. The club was demolished in 2001. The club was located on the NE corner of the now demolished Hulme Crescents development, on the corner of Royce Rd and Clayburn St (). Peter Saville designed advertising for the club, and in September Factory released an EP of music by acts who had played at the club (the Durutti Column, Joy Division, Cabaret Voltaire, and comedian John Dowie) called A Factory Sample. =1978 and 1979= As a follow-on from the successful 'Factory Nights' held at the Russell Club, Factory Records made their first release, \\"A Factory Sample\\", in January 1979. At that time there was a punk label in Manchester called Rabid Records, run by Tosh Ryan and Martin Hannett. It had several successful acts, including Slaughter & the Dogs (whose tour manager was Rob Gretton), John Cooper Clarke, and Jilted John. After his seminal TV series So It Goes, Tony Wilson was interested in the way Rabid Records ran, and was convinced that the real money and power were in album sales. With a lot of discussion, Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton and Alan Erasmus set up Factory Records, with Martin Hannett from Rabid. In 1978, Wilson compered the new wave afternoon at Deeply Vale Festival. This was actually the fourth live appearance by the fledgling Durutti Column and that afternoon Wilson also introduced an appearance (very early in their career) by the Fall, featuring Mark E. Smith and Marc \\"Lard\\" Riley on bass guitar. The first Factory Records office, 86 Palatine Road in West Didsbury, Manchester. The Factory label set up an office in Erasmus' home on the first floor of 86 Palatine Road (), and the Factory Sample EP was released in early 1979. Singles followed by A Certain Ratio (who would stay with the label) and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (who left for Virgin Records shortly afterwards). The first Factory LP, Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, was released in June. =1980s= In January 1980, The Return of the Durutti Column was released, the first in a long series of releases by guitarist Vini Reilly. In May, Joy Division singer Ian Curtis committed suicide shortly before a planned tour of the USA. The following month saw Joy Division's single \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" reach the UK top twenty, and their second album Closer was released the following month. In late 1980, the remaining members of Joy Division decided to continue as New Order. Factory branched out, with Factory Benelux being run as an independent label in conjunction with Les Disques du Crepuscule, and Factory US organising distribution for the UK label's releases in America. In 1981, Factory and New Order opened a nightclub and preparations were made to convert a Victorian textile factory near the centre of Manchester, which had lately seen service as a motor boat showroom. Hannett left the label, as he had wanted to open a recording studio instead, and subsequently sued for unpaid royalties (the case was settled out of court in 1984). Saville also quit as a partner due to problems with payments, although he continued to work for Factory. Wilson, Erasmus and Gretton formed Factory Communications Ltd. The Ha√ßienda's interior before opening The Ha√ßienda (FAC 51) opened in May 1982. Although successful in terms of attendance, and attracting a lot of praise for Ben Kelly's interior design, the club lost large amounts of money in its first few years due largely to the low prices charged for entrance and at the bar, which was markedly cheaper than nearby pubs. Adjusting bar prices failed to help matters as by the mid-1980s crowds were increasingly preferring ecstasy to alcohol. Therefore the Ha√ßienda ended up costing tens of thousands of pounds every month. In 1983 New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" (FAC 73) became an international chart hit. However, the label did not make any money from it since the original sleeve, die-cut and designed to look like a floppy disk, was so costly to make that the label lost 5 pence on every copy they sold. Saville noted that nobody at Factory expected Blue Monday to be a commercially successful record at all, so nobody expected the cost to be an issue. 1985 saw the first release by Happy Mondays. New Order and Happy Mondays became the most successful bands on the label, bankrolling a host of other projects. Factory, and the Ha√ßienda, became a cultural hub of the emerging techno and acid house genres and their amalgamation with post-punk guitar music (the \\"Madchester\\" scene). 1986 saw Mick Middles' book Joy Division to New Order published by Virgin Books (later being reprinted under the title Factory). In 1989 the label extended its reach to fringe punk folk outfit To Hell With Burgundy. Factory also opened a bar (The Dry Bar, FAC 201) and a shop (The Area, FAC 281) in the Northern Quarter of Manchester. =1990s= Factory's headquarters (FAC 251) on Charles Street, near the Oxford Road BBC building, were opened in September 1990 (prior to which the company was still registered at Alan Erasmus' flat in Didsbury). In 1991, Factory suffered two tragedies: the deaths of Martin Hannett and Dave Rowbotham. Hannett had recently re-established a relationship with the label, working with Happy Mondays, and tributes including a compilation album and a festival were organised. Rowbotham was one of the first musicians signed by the label; he was an original member of the Durutti Column and shared the guitar role with Vini Reilly; he was murdered and his body was found in his flat in Burnage. Saville's association with Factory was now reduced to simply designing for New Order and their solo projects (the band itself was in suspension, with various members recording as Electronic, Revenge and the Other Two). By 1992, the label's two most successful bands caused the label serious financial trouble. The Happy Mondays were recording their troubled fourth album Yes Please! in Barbados, and New Order reportedly spent ¬£400,000 on recording their comeback album Republic. London Records were interested in taking over Factory but the deal fell through when it emerged that, due to Factory's early practice of eschewing contracts, New Order rather than the label owned New Order's back catalogue. Factory Communications Ltd, the company formed in 1981, declared bankruptcy in November 1992. Many former Factory acts, including New Order, found a new home at London Records. The new Ha√ßienda apartments in 2007The Ha√ßienda closed in 1997 and the building was demolished shortly afterwards. It was replaced by a modern luxury apartment block in 2003, also called The Ha√ßienda. In October 2009, Peter Hook published his book on his time as co-owner of the Ha√ßienda, How Not to Run a Club, and in 2010 he had six bass guitars made using wood from the Ha√ßienda's dancefloor. =2000s= The 2002 film 24 Hour Party People is centred on Factory Records, the Ha√ßienda, and the infamous, often unsubstantiated anecdotes and stories surrounding them. Many of the people associated with Factory, including Tony Wilson, have minor parts; the central character, based on Wilson, is played by actor and comedian Steve Coogan. Anthony Wilson, Factory Records' founder, died on 10 August 2007 at age 57, from complications arising from renal cancer. Colin Sharp, the Durutti Column singer during 1978 who took part in the A Factory Sample EP, died on 7 September 2009, after suffering a brain haemorrhage. Although his involvement with Factory was brief, Sharp was an associate for a short while of Martin Hannett and wrote a book called Who Killed Martin Hannett, which upset Martin's surviving relatives, who stated the book included numerous untruths and fiction. Only months after Sharp's death, Larry Cassidy, Section 25's bassist and singer, died of unknown causes, on 27 February 2010. In early 2010, Peter Hook, in collaboration with the Ha√ßienda's original interior designer Ben Kelly and British audio specialists Funktion-One, renovated and reopened FAC 251 (the former Factory Records headquarters on Charles Street) as a nightclub. The club still holds its original name, FAC 251, but people refer to it as \\"The Factory\\". Despite Ben Kelly's design influences, Peter Hook insists, \\"It's not the Ha√ßienda for fucks sake\\". The club has a weekly agenda, featuring DJs and live bands of various genres. In May 2010, James Nice, owner of LTM Recordings, published the book Shadowplayers. The book charts the rise and fall of Factory and offers detailed accounts and information about many key figures involved with the label. =FAC numbers= Musical releases, and essentially anything closely associated with the label, were given a catalogue number in the form of either FAC, or FACT, followed by a number. FACT was reserved for full-length albums, while FAC was used for both single song releases and many other Factory \\"productions\\", including: posters (FAC 1 advertised a club night), The Ha√ßienda (FAC 51), a lawsuit filed against Factory Records by Martin Hannett (FAC 61),BBC Film: Factory: From Joy Division to Happy Mondays a hairdressing salon (FAC 98), a broadcast of Channel 4's The Tube TV series (FAC 104), customised packing tape (FAC 136), a bucket on a restored watermill (FAC 148), the Ha√ßienda cat (FAC 191), a bet between Wilson and Gretton (FAC 253), a radio advertisement (FAC 294), and a website (FAC 421). Similar numbering was used for compact disc media releases (FACD), CD Video releases (FACDV), Factory Benelux releases (FAC BN or FBN), Factory US releases (FACTUS), and Gap Records Australia releases (FACOZ), with many available numbers restricted to record releases and other directly artist-related content. Numbers were not allocated in strict chronological order; numbers for Joy Division and New Order releases generally ended in 3, 5, or 0 (with most Joy Division and New Order albums featuring multiples of 25), A Certain Ratio and Happy Mondays in 2, and the Durutti Column in 4. Factory Classical releases were 226, 236 and so on. Despite the demise of Factory Records in 1992, the catalogue was still active. Additions included the 24 Hour Party People film (FAC 401), its website (FAC 433) and DVD release (FACDVD 424), and a book, Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album (FAC 461). Even Tony Wilson's coffin received a Factory catalogue number; FAC 501. =Factory Classical= In 1989, Factory Classical was launched with five albums by composer Steve Martland, the Kreisler String Orchestra, the Duke String Quartet (which included Durutti Column viola player John Metcalfe), oboe player Robin Williams and pianist Rolf Hind. Composers included Martland, Benjamin Britten, Paul Hindemith, Francis Poulenc, Dmitri Shostakovich, Michael Tippett, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Elliott Carter. Releases continued until 1992, including albums by Graham Fitkin, vocal duo Red Byrd, a recording of Erik Satie's Socrate, Piers Adams playing Handel's Recorder Sonatas, Walter Hus and further recordings both of Martland's compositions and of the composer playing Mozart. Successor labels In 1994, Wilson attempted to revive Factory Records, in collaboration with London Records, as \\"Factory Too\\". The first release was by Factory stalwarts the Durutti Column; the other main acts on the label were Hopper and Space Monkeys, and the label gave a UK release to the first album by Stephin Merritt's side project the 6ths, Wasps' Nests. A further release ensued: a compilation EP featuring previously unsigned Manchester acts East West Coast, the Orch, Italian Love Party, and K-Track. This collection of 8 tracks (2 per band) was simply entitled A Factory Sample Too (FACD2.02). The label was active until the late 1990s, latterly independent of London Records, as was \\"Factory Once\\", which organised reissues of Factory material. Wilson founded a short-lived fourth incarnation, F4 Records, in the early 2000s. In 2012, Peter Saville and James Nice formed a new company called Factory Records Ltd., in association with Alan Erasmus and Oliver Wilson (son of Tony). This released only a vinyl reissue of From the Hip by Section 25. Nice subsequently revived the Factory Benelux imprint for Factory reissues, and for new recordings by Factory-associated bands. In 2019 Warner Music Group marked the 40th anniversary of Factory as a record label with a website, exhibition, and select vinyl editions including Unknown Pleasures and box set compilation Communications 1978-1992.

He did pioneering research on the hydrides of boron and silicon, coordination chemistry, mercury, and mercury poisoning. The German Chemical Society's Alfred-Stock Memorial Prize is named after him. Life Stock was born in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and educated at the Friedrich-Werder grammar school in Berlin. In 1894 he began studies in chemistry at the Friedrich Wilhelm-University in Berlin. After finishing his dissertation about the quantitative separation of arsenic and antimonyA. Piloty, A. Stock: √úber eine quantitative Trennung des Arsens vom Antimon. Band 30, 1649, 1897 in the works of Emil Fischer he got his doctoral degree. In 1899 he worked with the French chemist and toxicologist Henri Moissan in Paris for one year. He was given the task of synthesizing still unknown compounds of boron and silicon. Five years later he became professor at the University of Breslau. In 1916 he succeeded Richard Willst√§tter as director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin. After a severe mercury poisoning he became the director of the Chemistry Department at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe from 1926 to 1936. In 1932 he was a visiting professors at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York for four months. A member of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party) since 1933, Stock was anti-Semitic.Alfred Neubauer: Alfred Stock und die Judenfrage. In: Nachrichten aus der Chemie. Band 53, Nr. 6, 2005, , S. 633‚Äì637. From February 6, 1936, to May 7, 1938 Stock was the president of the German Chemical Society. Bombs in the Second World War damaged the house of Stock. In September 1943 he and his wife moved to Bad Warmbrunn in Silesia, but the flow of refugees forced them to move again towards west in February 1945. They found accommodation in Aken (near Dessau). After the war in 1946, Stock endeavoured to revitalize the German chemistry by lectures and memoirs. He was renowned for his pioneering research on boron hydrides. Research on the hydrides of boron and silicon In 1909 Stock began studying the boron hydrides‚Äîthe boron hydrogen chemical compounds with general formula BxHy‚Äîat Breslau. Due to their extreme reactivity and flammability in air, boron hydrides could not be purified until his development of methods for separation using high-vacuum manifolds around 1912. He performed similar work on the hydrides of silicon. The hydrides of boron and silicon represented the first family of binary compounds to approach the richness of hydrocarbons in terms of structural diversity. Not only did the boron hydrides exhibit challenging properties, their structures were also unusual. Elucidation of the structures and the associated bonding models dramatically expanded the scope of inorganic chemistry. Boron hydrides such as diborane later developed into a range of reagents for organic synthesis as well as a source of diverse ligands and building blocks for researchers. With Henri Moissan, Stock discovered silicon boride. Research in other areas of inorganic chemistry In 1921, Stock first prepared metallic beryllium by electrolyzing a fused mixture of sodium and beryllium fluorides. This method made beryllium available for industrial use, such as in special alloys and glasses and for making windows in X-ray tubes. He was also influential in coordination chemistry. The term \\"ligand\\" (from ligare Latin, to bind) was first used by Stock in 1916. H. Irving and R.J.P. Williams adopted the term in a paper published in 1948. Monodentate, bidentate, tridentate characterized the number of ligands attached to a metal. Given the introduction of ligand concept, he was also able to further derive the idea of bite angle and other aspects of chelation. The \\"Stock system,\\" first published in 1919, was a system of nomenclature on binary compounds. In his own words, he considered the system to be \\"simple, clear, immediately intelligible, capable of the most general application.\\" In 1924, a German commission recommended Stock system to be adopted with some accommodations. FeCl2, which would have been named iron(2)-chloride according to Stock's original idea, became iron(II) chloride in the revised proposal. In 1934 Stock agreed to the use of Roman numerals but preferred keeping the hyphen and dropping the parentheses. Although this suggestion has not been followed, the Stock system remains in use worldwide. Interests in mercury and mercury poisoning Stock published over 50 papers on different aspects of mercury and mercury poisoning. He also introduced sensitive tests and devised improved laboratory techniques for dealing with mercury which minimized poisoning risk, possibly initiated by his chronic mercury poisoning in 1923, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented. He became more vocal on protesting the mercury usage after realizing the toxicity of its organic derivatives. German dentists abandoned his warning in 1928 against copper amalgam usage. Nevertheless, a paper from Fleischmann, in which removal of mercury in amalgam-related illness had led to complete recovery, supported his idea. (Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift 1928, No. 8). A committee was founded in Berlin to investigate cases of possible mercury intoxication and hence the term micromercurialism was first used.. Translated by Birgit Calhoun. Retirement and death After retirement in 1936, Stock moved from Karlsruhe to Berlin. He died in Aken, a small town near Dessau, in August 1946 at the age of 70. Posthumous recognition In recognition of his contributions to the field of inorganic chemistry, the German Chemical Society (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker) created in 1950 the Alfred Stock Memorial Prize. The prize, consisting of a gold medal and money, is awarded every other year for \\"an outstanding independent scientific experimental investigation in the field of inorganic chemistry.\\" Publications * Praktikum der quantitativen anorganischen Analyse.

After the acquisition, Nullsoft headquarters were moved to San Francisco, California. Their later developments included the Nullsoft Streaming Video (NSV) format, which was intended to stream media that used any audio or video codec. In 2002, the press reported a technology called Ultravox being developed by Nullsoft. Nullsoft created the peer-to-peer networks Gnutella and WASTE. Although AOL tried to limit the distribution of Gnutella and WASTE, the Ultravox technology was reportedly used for some AOL radio services in 2003. A service called Nullsoft Television was announced in 2003 using NSV. Nullsoft released several new versions of the Winamp player and grew its monthly unique subscriber base from 33 million users to over 52 million users by 2005. Nullsoft's San Francisco offices were closed in December 2003, with a near-concurrent departure of Frankel and the original Winamp development team. Nullsoft then became a division of AOL Music. In 2013, some AOL Music sites were shut down and others sold to Townsquare Media. In November 2013, an unofficial report surfaced that Microsoft was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft.

Passivation involves creation of an outer layer of shield material that is applied as a microcoating, created by chemical reaction with the base material, or allowed to build from spontaneous oxidation in the air. As a technique, passivation is the use of a light coat of a protective material, such as metal oxide, to create a shell against corrosion.\\"Passivation vs Electropolishing - What are the differences?\\". https://www.electro- glo.com/passivation-vs-electropolishing-what-are-the-differences/ Passivation can occur only in certain conditions, and is used in microelectronics to enhance silicon.IUPAC Goldbook The technique of passivation strengthens and preserves the appearance of metallics. In electrochemical treatment of water, passivation reduces the effectiveness of the treatment by increasing the circuit resistance, and active measures are typically used to overcome this effect, the most common being polarity reversal, which results in limited rejection of the fouling layer. Other proprietary systems to avoid electrode passivation, several discussed below, are the subject of ongoing research and development. When exposed to air, many metals naturally form a hard, relatively inert surface, as in the tarnish of silver. In the case of other metals, such as iron, a somewhat rough porous coating is formed from loosely adherent corrosion products. In this case, a substantial amount of metal is removed, which is either deposited or dissolved in the environment. Corrosion coating reduces the rate of corrosion by varying degrees, depending on the kind of base metal and its environment, and is notably slower in room- temperature air for aluminium, chromium, zinc, titanium, and silicon (a metalloid). The shell of corrosion product inhibits deeper corrosion, and operates as one form of passivation. The inert surface layer, termed the \\"native oxide layer\\", is usually an oxide or a nitride, with a thickness of a monolayer of 0.1-0.3 nm (1-3 √Ö) for a noble metal such as platinum, about 1.5 nm (15 √Ö) for silicon, and nearer to 5 nm (50 √Ö) for aluminium after several years.http://www.semi1source.com/glossary/default.asp?searchterm=native+oxideFehlner, Francis P, Low-Temperature Oxidation:The Role of Vitreous Oxides, A Wiley- Interscience Publication, John Wiley & Sons, New York , 1986 Surface passivation refers to a common semiconductor device fabrication process critical to modern electronics. It is the process by which a semiconductor surface is rendered inert, and does not change semiconductor properties as a result of interaction with air or other materials in contact with the surface or edge of the crystal. This is typically achieved using a form of thermal oxidation. In a silicon semiconductor, this process allows electricity to reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below the surface, and to overcome the surface states that prevent electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. Surface passivation by thermal oxidation is one of the key features of silicon technology, and is dominant in microelectronics. The surface passivation process was developed by Mohamed M. Atalla at Bell Labs in the late 1950s. It is commonly used to manufacture MOSFETs (metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistors) and silicon integrated circuit chips (with the planar process), and is critical to the semiconductor industry. Surface passivation is also critical to solar cell and carbon quantum dot technologies. Mechanisms Pourbaix diagram of iron.University of Bath & Western Oregon University There has been much interest in determining the mechanisms that govern the increase of thickness of the oxide layer over time. Some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal, the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal, and the relative chemical potential of the oxide. Boundaries between micro grains, if the oxide layer is crystalline, form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below. For this reason, vitreous oxide coatings ‚Äì which lack grain boundaries ‚Äì can retard oxidation.Fehlner, Francis P, ref.3. The conditions necessary, but not sufficient for passivation are recorded in Pourbaix diagrams. Some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied. Some compounds, dissolving in solutions (chromates, molybdates) form non-reactive and low solubility films on metal surfaces. History =Discovery= In the mid 1800s, Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein discovered that when a piece of iron is placed in dilute nitric acid, it will dissolve and produce hydrogen, but if the iron is placed in concentrated nitric acid and then returned to the dilute nitric acid, little or no reaction will take place. Sch√∂nbein named the first state the active condition and the second the passive condition. If passive iron is touched by active iron, it becomes active again. In 1920, Ralph S. Lillie measured the effect of an active piece of iron touching a passive iron wire and found that \\"a wave of activation sweeps rapidly (at some hundred centimeters a second) over its whole length\\". =Surface passivation= The surface passivation process, also known as the Atalla passivation technique, was developed by Mohamed M. Atalla at Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) in the late 1950s. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick at Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide (SiO2) could be grown on silicon. They showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer, while allowing for others, thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface. In the late 1950s, Atalla further discovered that the formation of a thermally grown SiO2 layer greatly reduced the concentration of electronic states at the silicon surface, and discovered the important quality of SiO2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of p‚Äìn junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment. He found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces. J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer, who studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, managed to fabricate a high quality Si/SiO2 stack, with Atalla and Kahng making use of their findings. Atalla developed the surface passivation process, a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below. By growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer, Atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. For the surface passivation process, he developed the method of thermal oxidation, which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology. Before the development of integrated circuit chips, discrete diodes and transistors exhibited relatively high reverse-bias junction leakages and low breakdown voltage, caused by the large density of traps at the surface of single crystal silicon. Atalla's surface passivation process became the solution to this problem. He discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a p‚Äìn junction intercepts the surface, the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100. This showed that the oxide reduces and stabilizes many of the interface and oxide traps. Oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics, while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off. This became one of the fundamental isolation capabilities necessary for planar technology and integrated circuit chips. Atalla first published his findings in BTL memos during 1957, before presenting his work at an Electrochemical Society meeting in 1958. The same year, he made further refinements to the process with his colleagues E. Tannenbaum and E.J. Scheibner, before they published their results in May 1959. According to Fairchild Semiconductor engineer Chih-Tang Sah, the surface passivation process developed by Atalla's team \\"blazed the trail\\" that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit. Atalla's surface passivation method was the basis for several important inventions in 1959: the MOSFET (MOS transistor) by Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs, the planar process by Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor, and the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild in 1959. By the mid-1960s, Atalla's process for oxidized silicon surfaces was used to fabricate virtually all integrated circuits and silicon devices. In solar cell technology, surface passivation is critical to solar cell efficiency. In carbon quantum dot (CQD) technology, CQDs are small carbon nanoparticles (less than 10 nm in size) with some form of surface passivation. Specific materials =Silicon= In the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide. The effect of passivation on the efficiency of solar cells ranges from 3-7%. Passivation is effected by thermal oxidation at 1000 ¬∞C. The surface resistivity is high, >100 Œ©cm. =Aluminium= Aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments. Some aluminium alloys, however, do not form the oxide layer well, and thus are not protected against corrosion. There are methods to enhance the formation of the oxide layer for certain alloys. For example, prior to storing hydrogen peroxide in an aluminium container, the container can be passivated by rinsing it with a dilute solution of nitric acid and peroxide alternating with deionized water. The nitric acid and peroxide mixture oxidizes and dissolves any impurities on the inner surface of the container, and the deionized water rinses away the acid and oxidized impurities.Aluminum Passivation Generally, there are two main ways to passivate aluminium alloys (not counting plating, painting, and other barrier coatings): chromate conversion coating and anodizing. Alclading, which metallurgically bonds thin layers of pure aluminium or alloy to different base aluminium alloy, is not strictly passivation of the base alloy. However, the aluminium layer clad on is designed to spontaneously develop the oxide layer and thus protect the base alloy. Chromate conversion coating converts the surface aluminium to an aluminium chromate coating in the range of in thickness. Aluminium chromate conversion coatings are amorphous in structure with a gel-like composition hydrated with water.Chemical Conversion Coating on Aluminum Chromate conversion is a common way of passivating not only aluminium, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. Anodizing is an electrolytic process that forms a thicker oxide layer. The anodic coating consists of hydrated aluminium oxide and is considered resistant to corrosion and abrasion.Aluminum Anodizing Process This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides electrical insulation, which the other two processes may not. =Ferrous materials= Ferrous materials, including steel, may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation (\\"rust\\") and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating. As the uncoated surface is water-soluble, a preferred method is to form manganese or zinc compounds by a process commonly known as parkerizing or phosphate conversion. Older, less-effective but chemically-similar electrochemical conversion coatings included black oxidizing, historically known as bluing or browning. Ordinary steel forms a passivating layer in alkali environments, as reinforcing bar does in concrete. Stainless steel The fitting on the left has not been passivated, the fitting on the right has been passivated. Stainless steels are corrosion-resistant, but they are not completely impervious to rusting. One common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant steels is when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter (such as grinding swarf) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the iron in those spots despite the alloying chromium. This is called rouging. Some grades of stainless steel are especially resistant to rouging; parts made from them may therefore forgo any passivation step, depending on engineering decisions. Common among all of the different specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test to prove that the surface is 'clean.' The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and chemical requirements of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. (Temperatures can range from ambient to 60 degrees C, or 140 degrees F, while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes). The parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The passive surface is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. However, proprietary passivation processes existhttp://www.rpabrasives.com/services/passivation/passivation-process/ for martensitic stainless steel, which is difficult to passivate, as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath.http://www.cartech.com/techarticles.aspx?id=1566 The passivation process removes exogenous iron,http://www.delstar.com/stainless-steel-passivation creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides). Passivation processes are generally controlled by industry standards, the most prevalent among them today being ASTM A 967 and AMS 2700. These industry standards generally list several passivation processes that can be used, with the choice of specific method left to the customer and vendor. The \\"method\\" is either a nitric acid-based passivating bath, or a citric acid-based bath, these acids remove surface iron and rust, while sparing the chromium. The various 'types' listed under each method refer to differences in acid bath temperature and concentration. Sodium dichromate is often required as an additive to oxidise the chromium in certain 'types' of nitric-based acid baths, however this chemical is highly toxic. With citric acid, simply rinsing and drying the part and allowing the air to oxidise it, or in some cases the application of other chemicals, is used to perform the passivation of the surface. It is not uncommon for some aerospace manufacturers to have additional guidelines and regulations when passivating their products that exceed the national standard. Often, these requirements will be cascaded down using Nadcap or some other accreditation system. Various testing methods are available to determine the passivation (or passive state) of stainless steel. The most common methods for validating the passivity of a part is some combination of high humidity and heat for a period of time, intended to induce rusting. Electro-chemical testers can also be utilized to commercially verify passivation. =Nickel= Nickel can be used for handling elemental fluorine, owing to the formation of a passivation layer of nickel fluoride. This fact is useful in water treatment and sewage treatment applications.

The company Konan (that developed the Konan-16 subminiature camera) claims in its history page to have developed the Single-8 system in 1959. Although never as popular internationally as Super 8, the format continued to live in parallel. As of early 2007, Fuji still manufactures two versions of Single-8 film. Fujichrome R25N is Daylight Balanced Filmstock, while Fujichrome RT200N is Tungsten Balanced(3400K) for indoor filming. Details Although the film is thinner, the other dimensions of Single-8 such as the sprocket holes and sound track, are the same as Super 8. Single-8 can be projected in Super 8 projectors and vice versa. Single-8 comes pre-loaded in B-shaped cartridges, with two separate spools unlike the coaxial system of Super 8. As a result, Single-8 film offered unlimited rewind, whereas Super 8 rewind was limited to several seconds and relied on there being sufficient empty space within the cartridge for the rewound film to pile up inside. The Single 8 cartridge was designed to use the camera's film gate to hold the film in place during exposure. This contrasted with the Kodak system which had a plastic pressure plate built into the cartridge. It was widely believed by Single 8 enthusiasts that this would offer superior film positioning, but the reality was that Super 8's plastic pressure plate could be moulded with far smaller tolerance than Single 8's metal version could be machined. It has a polyester base that is thinner than the Kodak films, so splicing the two formats together in a finished film may require adjustment of the projector's focus at the join. Although never as popular internationally as Super 8, the format continued to live in parallel. As of early 2007, Fuji still manufactures two versions of Single-8 film. Fujichrome R25N is Daylight Balanced Filmstock, while Fujichrome RT200N is Tungsten Balanced(3400K) for indoor filming. The Sound Film brand is no longer made, although a magnetic sound stripe can be added to the film after processing. This option is chosen whenever sending the exposed film to Fuji in Japan. In addition to Fuji's own film, black and white film is available from Japanese company Retro Enterprises. This Single-8 black & white reversal film, named Retro X, is of ASA/ISO 200 and is manufactured in Germany. Although Fujifilm has stopped exportation of Single-8 Film to other countries, individual companies in the United States and Europe import the filmstock independently. Single-8 is readily available in its home country of Japan where even used cameras can reach high prices in online auctions on Yahoo! Japan. A used Fujica ZC1000, the top of the line Single-8 camera, can fetch prices upwards to 250,000 Japanese yen (approx $2900). Daicon Film of Japan (now Gainax) produced a series of well-known tokusatsu films in the 1980s using Single-8 film, some now available on DVD.  Processing Single-8 Film  Fuji's Single-8 developing process is not the same as Process EM-26, but close. There is more involved in the removal of the remjet antihalation backing than the now long discontinued Kodak Ektachrome Process EM-26 films. The color chemistry while close, is a bit different, particularly the Color Developer. It is often recommended sending Fuji Single-8 film to Fujifilm in Japan for processing.

The republic emerged during the French Revolutionary Wars after King Ferdinand IV fled before advancing French troops. The republic existed from 21 January to 13 June 1799, collapsing when Ferdinand returned to restore monarchial authority and forcibly subdued republican activities. Origins of the Republic On the outbreak of the French Revolution King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Queen Maria Carolina did not at first actively oppose reform; but after the fall of the French monarchy they became violently opposed to it, and in 1793 joined the first coalition against France, instituting severe persecutions against all who were remotely suspected of French sympathies. Republicanism, however, gained ground, especially among the aristocracy. In 1796, peace with France was concluded, but in 1798, during Napoleon's absence in Egypt and after Nelson's victory at the Battle of the Nile, Maria Carolina induced Ferdinand to go to war with France once more. Nelson himself arrived at Naples in September 1798, where he was enthusiastically received. The Neapolitan army had 70,000 men hastily summoned under the command of the Austrian general Karl Mack. On 29 November, this army entered Rome, which had been evacuated by the French, to restore Papal authority. However, after a sudden French counter- attack, his troops were forced to retreat and eventually routed. A contemporary satirist said of the king's conquest of Rome: \\"He came, he saw, he fled\\".Between Salt Water And Holy Water: A History Of Southern Italy, Tommaso Astarita, p. 250 The king hurried back to Naples. Although the lazzaroni (the lowest class of the people) were devoted to the Bourbon dynasty and ready to defend it, he embarked on Nelson's Vanguard and fled with his court to Palermo in a panic. The prince Francesco Pignatelli Strongoli took over the city and the fleet was burned. The wildest confusion prevailed, and the lazzaroni massacred numbers of persons suspected of republican sympathies, while the nobility and the educated classes, finding themselves abandoned by their king, began to contemplate a republic under French auspices to avoid anarchy. On 12 January 1799, Pignatelli signed in Sparanise the surrender to the French general Jean √âtienne Championnet. Pignatelli also fled to Palermo on 16 January 1799. When the news of the treaty with the French reached Naples and the provinces, the lazzaroni rebelled. Though ill-armed and ill- disciplined, they resisted the enemy with desperate courage. In the meantime, the Jacobin and Republican parties of Naples surged, and civil war broke out. On 20 January 1799, the Republicans under General Championnet conquered the fortress of Castel Sant'Elmo, and the French entered the city the next day. The casualties were 8,000 Neapolitans and 1,000 French. The Republic On 21 or 23 January 1799, the Parthenopean Republic was proclaimed. The name referred to an ancient Greek colony Parthenope on the site of the future city of Naples. The Republic had no real domestic constituency and existed solely due to the power of the French Army. The Republic's leaders were men of culture, high character and birth, such as Gennaro Serra, Prince of Cassano Irpino but they were doctrinaire and impractical, and they knew very little of the lower classes of their own country. The new government soon found itself in financial difficulties, owing to Championnet's demands for money (he was later relieved for graft); it failed to organise an army (and was therefore dependent on French protection) and met with little success in its attempts to \\"democratise\\" the provinces. Meanwhile, the court at Palermo sent Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, a wealthy and influential prelate, to Calabria to organize a counter-revolution. He succeeded beyond expectation with his \\"Christian army of the Holy Faith\\" (Esercito Cristiano della Santa Fede). An English squadron approached Naples and occupied the island of Procida, but after a few engagements with the Republican fleet commanded by Francesco Caracciolo, an ex-officer in the Bourbon navy, it was recalled to Palermo, as the Franco‚ÄìSpanish fleet was expected. Ruffo, supported by Russian and Turkish ships under the command of Admiral Ushakov, now marched on the capital, whence the French, except for a small force under M√©jean, withdrew. The scattered Republican detachments were defeated, only Naples and Pescara holding out. On 13 June 1799. Ruffo and his troops reached Naples, and after a desperate battle at the Ponte della Maddalena, entered the city. For weeks the Calabresi and lazzaroni continued to pillage and massacre, and Ruffo was unable, even if willing, to restrain them. However, the Royalists were not masters of the city, for the French in Castel Sant'Elmo and the Republicans in Castel Nuovo and Castel dell'Ovo still held out and bombarded the streets, while the Franco-Spanish fleet might arrive at any moment. Consequently, Ruffo was desperately anxious to come to terms with the Republicans for the evacuation of the castles, in spite of the queen's orders to make no terms with the rebels. After some negotiation, the parties concluded an armistice and agreed on capitulation (onorevole capitolazione), whereby the castles were to be evacuated, the hostages liberated and the garrisons free to remain in Naples unmolested or to sail for Toulon. The capitulation was signed by Ruffo, and British, Russian and Turkish officers, as well as, for the Republicans, the French commander. While the vessels were being prepared for the voyage to Toulon all the hostages in the castles were liberated save four; but on 24 June 1799 Nelson arrived with his fleet, and on hearing of the capitulation he refused to recognise it except insofar as it concerned the French. Ruffo indignantly declared that once the treaty was signed, not only by himself but by the Russian and Turkish commandants and by the British captain Edward Foote, it must be respected, and on Nelson's refusal, he said that he would not help him to capture the castles. On 26 June 1799, Nelson changed his attitude and authorised Sir William Hamilton, the British minister, to inform the cardinal that he (Nelson) would do nothing to break the armistice; while Captains Bell and Troubridge wrote that they had Nelson's authority to state that the latter would not oppose the embarcation of the Republicans. Although these expressions were equivocal, the Republicans were satisfied and embarked on the vessels prepared for them. However, on 28 June, Nelson received despatches from the court (in reply to his own), in consequence of which he had the vessels brought under the guns of his ships, and many of the Republicans were arrested. Caracciolo, who had been caught whilst attempting to escape from Naples, was tried by a court-martial of Royalist officers under Nelson's auspices on board the admiral's flagship, condemned to death and hanged at the yard arm. Aftermath On 10 July 1799, King Ferdinand entered the bay of Naples on a Neapolitan frigate, the Sirena. At four o'clock that afternoon, he went aboard the British Foudroyant, which was to be his headquarters for the next four weeks. Of some 8,000 political prisoners, 99 were executed, including Prince Gennaro Serra, who was publicly beheaded, and others, such as the intellectual Mario Pagano, who had written the republican constitution; the scientist, Domenico Cirillo; Luisa Sanfelice; Gabriele Manthon√©, the minister of war under the republic; Massa, the defender of Castel dell'Ovo; Ettore Carafa, the defender of Pescara, who had been captured by treachery; and Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, court-poet turned revolutionary and editor of il Monitore Napoletano, the newspaper of the republican government. More than 500 other people were imprisoned (222 for life), 288 were deported and 67 exiled. The subsequent censorship and oppression of all political movement was far more debilitating for Naples. After these events were reported in Britain, Charles James Fox denounced Nelson in the House of Commons for the admiral's part in \\"the atrocities at the Bay of Naples\\".

He held the WBC light flyweight and WBA flyweight titles, and challenged once for the WBC super flyweight title. Professional career Zapata began his professional boxing career in 1977, beating Victor Lopez by a knockout in the second round. He had 2 wins in '77. He had a fast ascent to the top, starting in 1978. By his fifth bout, on July 1, he was meeting former world Flyweight champion Juan Guzm√°n in Panama City, beating Guzman by a decision in ten. His next fight, against Yong-Hwang Kim, in South Korea, was his first fight abroad; he gave himself a twentieth birthday present by beating Kim by a 10-round decision on August 19. Then, he met future world Flyweight champion Alfonso Lopez, for the vacant Latin American Jr. Flyweight belt. Zapata suffered his first loss in the fight against Lopez, when he was beaten by a decision in 12. He started 1979 with a fight against Ramon Perez in Puerto Rico, winning by a knockout in nine. He had three more wins in 1979, including one over the two time world Flyweight champion Freddie Castillo, and by the end of that year he was ranked number one in the world among Jr. Flyweight challengers by the WBC. Zapata went to Japan in March 1980, and on the 24th day of that month he beat defending world champion Shigeo Nakajima to become world Jr. Flyweight champion. He defended his title against Chi-Bok Kim, winning a 15-round unanimous decision in South Korea, against Hector Rey Melendez in Venezuela, winning also by a 15-round decision, against Nakajima in a Tokyo rematch, winning by knockout in 11, and against Reynaldo Becerra in Venezuela. He closed out 1980 win a 15-round decision win over Becerra. In 1981, he and future world Flyweight champion Joey Olivo fought what was the only Jr. Flyweight title bout ever broadcast on American national TV live until Michael Carbajal came along nine years later. Zapata beat Olivo by a knockout in round 13 to retain his belt, and then, he went to San Francisco to retain the crown once again, with a 15-round decision over Rudy Crawford. On August 15, and back home in Panama City, he beat Mexican German Torres by a decision in 15 to retain his belt, and then he faced former world Jr. Flyweight champion Netrnoi Sor Vorasingh, retaining the belt by a knockout in 10. In his next fight, on February 6, 1982, Zapata lost the world title by knockout in two at the hands of Amado Panterita Ursua, but Ursua in turn would lose it to Tadashi Tomori. On July 20, Zapata regained the world title by beating Tomori on a 15-round decision in Japan. Then, he beat future world champion and Zapata-conqueror Jung-Koo Chang by a decision in 15 in Chonju, and he closed out the year with a rematch against Tomori in Tokyo, knocking Tomori out in eight rounds. On March 26, 1983, Zapata and Chang met again in South Korea, and this time, Chang became world champion by knocking Zapata out in the third round. Then, on November 10 at Las Vegas, on the Marvin Hagler- Roberto Dur√°n undercard, Zapata was beaten by a knockout in 10 by Harold Petty. His career seemingly over, he quickly recovered from those back to back losses and began winning again, but this time as a Flyweight. By the end of 1984, he was ranked number one by the WBA among Flyweights, and on December 8 of that year, he challenged world Flyweight champion Santos Laciar of Argentina at Buenos Aires' legendary Luna Park. Zapata lost a 15-round decision that night, but in 1986, after Laciar had vacated the crown, the WBA gave him a second chance, and he beat Alonzo Gonzalez to win the WBA world Flyweight championship. He then beat Javier Lucas to retain the belt. He retained the title also against Shuichi Hozumi, Dodie Penalosa, Alberto Castro and Claudemir Calvalho, all by decision, before losing it to Fidel Bassa of Colombia, also by a decision. In 1993, he tried to become a world champion once again, but was knocked out in the first round by the WBC world Jr. Bantamweight champion Sung-Kil Moon. A win against Moon would have made Zapata a member of the exclusive group of world boxing champions in three different weight categories or more. It can also be added that Zapata's first pair of boxing gloves, when he was 12, came as a present from Duran himself. Panamanian newspaper El Panama America declared on one of their editorials that Zapata, according to their opinion, should be inducted to the International Boxing Hall Of Fame soon. Zapata eventually was voted into the Hall of Fame, in December 2015, and was inducted during June 2016.http://www.oneidadispatch.com/sports/20151216/hector-macho-camacho- highlights-international-boxing-hall-of-fames-class-of-2016 Zapata had a record of 43 wins and 10 losses, with 1 draw, and 15 wins by knockout.

(commonly known as Columbia Pictures) is an American film studio and production and distribution company that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment's Sony Pictures Entertainment, itself a subsidiary of the Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony. What would eventually become Columbia Pictures was founded as the Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation on June 19, 1918 by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and their business partner, Joe Brandt.\\"Sony Pictures Museum\\" Sony Pictures History sonypicturesmuseum.com, Retrieved on November 19, 2012 It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image of Columbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo. In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio. It is one of the leading film studios in the world and is a member of the \\"Big Five\\" major American film studios. Columbia was one of the so-called \\"Little Three\\" among the eight major film studios of Hollywood's Golden Age.Grady, Frank. \\"THE STUDIO ERA\\". umsl.edu. Retrieved March 14, 2011. Today, it has become the world's fourth largest major film studio. The company was primarily responsible for distributing Disney Animation's Silly Symphony film series as well as the Mickey Mouse cartoon series from 1929 to 1932. The studio is headquartered at the Irving Thalberg Building on the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (later renamed as Lorimar Studios now the Sony Pictures Studios) lot in Culver City, California since 1990. History =Early years as CBC= The original CBC Film Sales logo used from 1919 through 1924 The studio was founded on June 19, 1918 as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and Jack's best friend Joe Brandt, and released its first feature film in August 1922. Brandt was president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. The studio's early productions were low-budget short subjects: \\"Screen Snapshots\\", the \\"Hall Room Boys\\" (the vaudeville duo of Edward Flanagan and Neely Edwards), and the Chaplin imitator Billy West.The Hollywood Story, by Joel Waldo Finler, page 81 The start-up CBC leased space in a Poverty Row studio on Hollywood's famously low-rent Gower Street. Among Hollywood's elite, the studio's small-time reputation led some to joke that \\"CBC\\" stood for \\"Corned Beef and Cabbage\\". Brandt eventually tired of dealing with the Cohn brothers, and in 1932 sold his one-third stake to Harry Cohn, who took over as president. =Reorganization and new name= The first print logo used by Columbia Pictures, featuring its Columbia personification In an effort to improve its image, the Cohn brothers renamed the company Columbia Pictures Corporation on January 10, 1924. Cohn remained head of production as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He would run Columbia for the next 34 years, one of the longest tenures of any studio chief (Warner Bros.' Jack L. Warner was head of production or CEO longer but did not become CEO until 1956). Even in an industry rife with nepotism, Columbia was particularly notorious for having a number of Harry and Jack's relatives in high positions. Humorist Robert Benchley called it the Pine Tree Studio, \\"because it has so many Cohns\\".Thomas, Bob (1967). King Cohn: The Life and Times of Harry Cohn. London: Barrie and Rockliff. p. 40. Columbia's product line consisted mostly of moderately budgeted features and short subjects including comedies, sports films, various serials, and cartoons. Columbia gradually moved into the production of higher-budget fare, eventually joining the second tier of Hollywood studios along with United Artists and Universal. Like United Artists and Universal, Columbia was a horizontally integrated company. It controlled production and distribution; it did not own any theaters. Helping Columbia's climb was the arrival of an ambitious director, Frank Capra. Between 1927 and 1939, Capra constantly pushed Cohn for better material and bigger budgets. A string of hits he directed in the early and mid 1930s solidified Columbia's status as a major studio. In particular, It Happened One Night, which nearly swept the 1934 Oscars, put Columbia on the map. Until then, Columbia's existence had depended on theater owners willing to take its films, since it didn't have a theater network of its own. Other Capra-directed hits followed, including the original version of Lost Horizon (1937), with Ronald Colman, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), which made James Stewart a major star. In 1933, Columbia hired Robert Kalloch to be their chief fashion and women's costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer hired by the studio, and he established the studio's wardrobe department. Kalloch's employment, in turn, convinced leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers. In 1938, the addition of B. B. Kahane as Vice President would produce Charles Vidor's Those High Gray Walls (1939), and The Lady in Question (1940), the first joint film of Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. Kahane would later become the President of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1959, until his death a year later. Columbia could not afford to keep a huge roster of contract stars, so Cohn usually borrowed them from other studios. At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the industry's most prestigious studio, Columbia was nicknamed \\"Siberia\\", as Louis B. Mayer would use the loan-out to Columbia as a way to punish his less- obedient signings. In the 1930s, Columbia signed Jean Arthur to a long-term contract, and after The Whole Town's Talking (1935), Arthur became a major comedy star. Ann Sothern's career was launched when Columbia signed her to a contract in 1936. Cary Grant signed a contract in 1937 and soon after it was altered to a non-exclusive contract shared with RKO. Many theaters relied on westerns to attract big weekend audiences, and Columbia always recognized this market. Its first cowboy star was Buck Jones, who signed with Columbia in 1930 for a fraction of his former big-studio salary. Over the next two decades Columbia released scores of outdoor adventures with Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Jack Luden, Bob Allen (Robert (Tex) Allen), Russell Hayden, Tex Ritter, Ken Curtis, and Gene Autry. Columbia's most popular cowboy was Charles Starrett, who signed with Columbia in 1935 and starred in 131 western features over 17 years. =Short subjects= At Harry Cohn's insistence the studio signed The Three Stooges in 1934. Rejected by MGM (which kept straight-man Ted Healy but let the Stooges go),Okuda, Ted; Watz, Edward (1986). The Columbia Comedy Shorts. p. 60. McFarland & Company, Inc. . the Stooges made 190 shorts for Columbia between 1934 and 1957. Columbia's short-subject department employed many famous comedians, including Buster Keaton, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Andy Clyde, and Hugh Herbert. Almost 400 of Columbia's 529 two-reel comedies were released to television between 1958 and 1961; to date, all of the Stooges, Keaton, Charley Chase, Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita subjects have been released to home video. Columbia incorporated animation into its studio in 1929, distributing Walt Disney's famous Mickey Mouse cartoons as well as the Silly Symphonies cartoons until 1932. Also in 1929, Columbia took over distribution of the Krazy Kat series from Paramount Pictures by Charles Mintz. In 1933, The Mintz studio was re-established under the Screen Gems brand; Columbia's leading cartoon series were Krazy Kat, Scrappy, The Fox and the Crow, and (very briefly) Li'l Abner.\\"Los Angeles Times\\" History of Gems articles.latimes.com June 12, 1999, Retrieved on 4 April 2016 Screen Gems was the last major cartoon studio to produce black-and- white cartoons, producing them until 1946. That same year, Screen Gems shut down, but had completed enough cartoons for the studio to release until 1949. In 1948, Columbia agreed to release animated shorts from United Productions of America; these new shorts were more sophisticated than Columbia's older cartoons, and many won critical praise and industry awards. In 1957, two years before the UPA deal was terminated, Columbia distributed the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, including Loopy De Loop from 1959 to 1965, which was Columbia's final theatrical cartoon series. In 1967, the Hanna-Barbera deal expired and was not renewed. According to Bob Thomas' book King Cohn, studio chief Harry Cohn always placed a high priority on serials. Beginning in 1937, Columbia entered the lucrative serial market, and kept making these weekly episodic adventures until 1956, after other studios had discontinued them. The most famous Columbia serials are based on comic-strip or radio characters: Mandrake the Magician, The Shadow, Terry and the Pirates, Captain Midnight, The Phantom, Batman, and the especially successful Superman, among many others. Columbia also produced musical shorts, sports reels (usually narrated by sportscaster Bill Stern), and travelogues. Its \\"Screen Snapshots\\" series, showing behind-the-scenes footage of Hollywood stars, was a Columbia perennial that the studio had been releasing since the silent-movie days; producer- director Ralph Staub kept this series going through 1958. =1940s= The logo that Columbia used starting in 1936 and ending in 1976; this version was used on the Color Rhapsody cartoons. In the 1940s, propelled in part by the surge in audiences for their films during the war, the studio also benefited from the popularity of its biggest star, Rita Hayworth. Columbia maintained a long list of contractees well into the 1950s: Glenn Ford, Penny Singleton, William Holden, Judy Holliday, The Three Stooges, Ann Miller, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Doran, Jack Lemmon, Cleo Moore, Barbara Hale, Adele Jergens, Larry Parks, Arthur Lake, Lucille Ball, Kerwin Mathews, and Kim Novak. Harry Cohn monitored the budgets of his films, and the studio got the maximum use out of costly sets, costumes, and props by reusing them in other films. Many of Columbia's low- budget \\"B\\" pictures and short subjects have an expensive look, thanks to Columbia's efficient recycling policy. Cohn was reluctant to spend lavish sums on even his most important pictures, and it was not until 1943 that he agreed to use three-strip Technicolor in a live-action feature. (Columbia was the last major studio to employ the expensive color process.) Columbia's first Technicolor feature was the western The Desperadoes, starring Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford. Cohn quickly used Technicolor again for Cover Girl, a Hayworth vehicle that instantly was a smash hit, released in 1944, and for the fanciful biography of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, A Song to Remember, with Cornel Wilde, released in 1945. Another biopic, 1946's The Jolson Story with Larry Parks and Evelyn Keyes, was started in black-and-white, but when Cohn saw how well the project was proceeding, he scrapped the footage and insisted on filming in Technicolor. In 1948, the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. anti-trust decision forced Hollywood motion picture companies to divest themselves of the theatre chains that they owned. Since Columbia did not own any theaters, it was now on equal terms with the largest studios, and soon replaced RKO on the list of the \\"Big Five\\" studios. Screen Gems Screen Gems' logo of the 1960s In 1946, Columbia dropped the Screen Gems brand from its cartoon line, but retained the Screen Gems name for various ancillary activities, including a 16 mm film-rental agency and a TV-commercial production company. On November 8, 1948, Columbia adopted the Screen Gems name for its television production subsidiary when the studio acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded by Harry Cohn's nephew, Ralph Cohn. Pioneer had been founded in 1947, and was later reorganized as Screen Gems. The studio opened its doors for business in New York on April 15, 1949. By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio and became a major producer of situation comedies for TV, beginning with Father Knows Best and followed by The Donna Reed Show, The Partridge Family, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, and The Monkees. On July 1, 1956, studio veteran Irving Briskin stepped down as manager of Columbia Pictures and form his production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions. On December 10, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. Serials Inc.) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers. In 1957, two years before its parent company Columbia dropped UPA, Screen Gems entered a distribution deal with Hanna-Barbera Productions, which produced classic TV cartoon shows such as The Flintstones, Ruff and Reddy, The Huckleberry Hound Show, Yogi Bear, Jonny Quest, The Jetsons and others. Screen Gems would distribute until 1967, when Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting. In 1960, the cartoon studio became a publicly traded company under the name Screen Gems, Inc., when Columbia spun off an 18% stake. =1950s= By 1950, Columbia had discontinued most of its popular series films (Boston Blackie, Blondie, The Lone Wolf, The Crime Doctor, Rusty, etc.) Only Jungle Jim, launched by producer Sam Katzman in 1949, kept going through 1955. Katzman contributed greatly to Columbia's success by producing dozens of topical feature films, including crime dramas, science-fiction stories, and rock-'n'-roll musicals. Columbia kept making serials until 1956 and two-reel comedies until 1957, after other studios had abandoned them. As the larger studios declined in the 1950s, Columbia's position improved. This was largely because it did not suffer from the massive loss of income that the other major studios suffered from the loss of their theaters (well over 90 percent, in some cases). Columbia continued to produce 40-plus pictures a year, offering productions that often broke ground and kept audiences coming to theaters such as its adaptation of the controversial James Jones novel From Here to Eternity (1953), On the Waterfront (1954), and The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) with William Holden and Alec Guinness, all of which won the Best Picture Oscar, as well as the free adaptation of George Orwell's Dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1956). Columbia also released the made-in-England Warwick Films by producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli as well as many films by producer Carl Foreman who resided in England. Columbia also distributed some films made by Hammer. In 1958, Columbia established its own record label, Colpix Records, initially run by Jonie Taps, who headed Columbia's music department, and later Paul Wexler and Lester Sill. Colpix was active until 1966 when Columbia entered into a joint agreement with RCA Victor and discontinued Colpix in favor of its new label, Colgems Records. =After Harry Cohn's death= Shortly after closing their short subjects department, Columbia president Harry Cohn died of a heart attack in February 1958. His nephew Ralph Cohn died in 1959, ending almost four decades of family management. The new management was headed by Abe Schneider, who had joined the company as an office boy out of high school and become a director in 1929, rising through the financial side of the business.Suzan Ayscough, Variety, \\"Ex-Col titan Schneider dies\\", April 23, 1993 By the late 1960s, Columbia had an ambiguous identity, offering old- fashioned fare like A Man for All Seasons and Oliver! along with the more contemporary Easy Rider and The Monkees. After turning down releasing Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions James Bond films, Columbia hired Broccoli's former partner Irving Allen to produce the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin. Columbia also produced a James Bond spoof, Casino Royale (1967), in conjunction with Charles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights for that novel. By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations.Dick, pp. 18-20 On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million. Schneider was chairman of the holding company and Leo Jaffe president. Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchased Bell Records for $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retaining Larry Uttal as label president. =1970s= Stock certificate in 1965 Nearly bankrupt by the early 1970s, the studio was saved via a radical overhaul: the Gower Street Studios (now called \\"Sunset Gower Studios\\") were sold and a new management team was brought in. In 1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios, in which both companies shared the Warner studio lot in Burbank.

Stanley Schneider, son of Abe Schneider (who became honorary chairman before leaving the board in 1975) was replaced as head of the Columbia Pictures studio by David Begelman, who reported to Hirschfield. Some years later Begelman was involved in a check- forging scandal that badly hurt the studio's image. On May 6, 1974, Columbia retired the Screen Gems name from television, renaming its television division Columbia Pictures Television. The name was suggested by David Gerber, who was then-president of Columbia's television division. The same year, Columbia Pictures acquired Rastar Pictures, which included Rastar Productions, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, the reincarnation of Rastar Pictures and it was acquired by Columbia Pictures in February 1980.Dick, p. 29. Columbia Pictures also reorganized its music and record divisions. Clive Davis who was hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures in 1974 and later became temporary president of Bell Records. Davis's real goal was to revitalize Columbia Pictures's music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures's new record division, Arista Records, in November 1974 with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Columbia maintained control of the label until 1979, when it was sold to Ariola Records. In addition, Columbia sold its music publishing business (Columbia- Screen Gems) to EMI in August 1976 for $15 million. In December 1976, Columbia Pictures acquired the arcade game company D. Gottlieb & Co. for $50 million. In 1978, Begelman was suspended for having embezzled money from Columbia. Hirschfield was forced out for his refusal to reinstate him. Begelman later resigned and was replaced by Daniel Melnick in June 1978. Fay Vincent was hired to replace Hirschfield. Frank Price became president of production in 1978. In March 1979, he would become president of Columbia Pictures, succeeding Melnick. During Price's tenure he was responsible for turning out 9 of the top 10 grossing films in Columbia's history. In fall 1978, Kirk Kerkorian, a Vegas casino mogul who also controlled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, acquired a 5.5% stake in Columbia Pictures. He then announced on November 20, to launch a tender offer to acquire another 20% for the studio. On December 14, a standstill agreement was reached with Columbia by promising not to go beyond 25% or seeking control for at least three years. On January 15, 1979, the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Kerkorian, to block him from holding stake in Columbia, while controlling MGM. On February 19, 1979, Columbia Pictures Television acquired TOY Productions; the production company founded by Bud Yorkin and writers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein in 1976. In May, Kerkorian acquired an additional 214,000 shares in Columbia, raising his stake to 25%. On August 2, the suit trial opened at the Justice Department, however, on August 14, the court ruled in favor for Kerkorian. =1980s: Coca-Cola, Tri-Star, and other acquisitions and ventures= On September 30, 1980, Kerkorian sued Columbia for ignoring shareholders' interest and violating an agreement with him. Columbia later accused him on October 2, for scheming with Nelson Bunker Hunt to gain control of Columbia. In 1981, Kerkorian sold his 25% stake in Columbia back to CPI. Columbia Pictures later acquired 81% of The Walter Reade Organization, which owned 11 theaters; it purchased the remaining 19% in 1985. Around this time, the studio put Steven Spielberg's proposed follow up to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Night Skies, into turnaround. The project eventually became the highest- grossing film of all-time, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Columbia received a share of the profits for its involvement in the development.

The logo changed in 1928 with a new woman (Columbia, the female representative of America) wearing a draped flag and torch. The woman wore the stola and carried the palla of ancient Rome, and above her were the words \\"A Columbia Production\\" (\\"A Columbia Picture\\" or \\"Columbia Pictures Corporation\\") written in an arch. The illustration was based upon the actress Evelyn Venable, known for providing the voice of The Blue Fairy in Walt Disney's Pinocchio. In 1936, the logo was changed: the Torch Lady now stood on a pedestal, wore no headdress, and the text \\"Columbia\\" appeared in chiseled letters behind her (Pittsburgh native Jane Chester Bartholomew, whom Harry Cohn discovered, portrayed the Torch Lady in the logo). There were several variations to the logo over the years‚Äîsignificantly, a color version was done in 1943 for The Desperadoes. Two years earlier, the flag became just a drape with no markings. The latter change came after a federal law was passed making it illegal to wear an American flag as clothing. 1976's Taxi Driver was one of the last films to use the \\"Torch Lady\\" in her classic appearance until 2019's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which used the classic appearance of the \\"Torch Lady\\" (with a minor alteration to add a Sony byline to the logo) to match the year (1969) the film takes place in. From 1976 to 1993, Columbia Pictures used two logos. The first, from 1976 to 1981 (1976 to 1982 for international territories) used just a sunburst representing the beams from the torch. The score accompanying the first logo was composed by Suzanne Ciani. The studio hired visual effects pioneer Robert Abel to animate the first logo. The woman returned in 1981, but in a much smoother form described as resembling a Coke bottle. The current logo was created in 1992 (same time as the television version‚Äôs debut), and started its use in films the year after, when Scott Mednick and The Mednick Group was hired by Peter Guber to create logos for all the entertainment properties then owned by Sony Pictures.

Once coded in, this page would update on the user's screen as and when appropriate. There were many pages to choose from. History =Early electro-mechanical system= During the late 1960s, engineers Geoff Larkby and Barry Pyatt, at the Designs Department (Television Group) of the BBC, worked on an experimental analogue text transmission system. Its object was to transmit a printable page of text during the nocturnal \\"close-down\\" period of normal television transmission. Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, then Director General of the BBC, was interested in making farming and stock-market prices available as hard copy via the dormant TV transmitters. The remit received by BBC Designs Department was \\"the equivalent of one page of The Times newspaper to be transmitted during shut-down\\". Their system employed a modified, Alexander Muirhead designed, rotating drum, facsimile transmitter, and Larkby & Pyatt's own, unique, design of hard-copy printer. This printer used pressure-sensitive \\"till-roll\\" paper passing over a drum with a raised helix of steel wire. The drum was synchronised with the transmission drum by means of the \\"Start of Page\\", and \\"Start of Line\\" information inherent in the Muirhead system. Printing was effected by a hardened steel blade driven by, initially, a loudspeaker-type moving coil, then by a printed-circuit coil, and finally by a special ceramic piezo element manufactured by Brush-Clevite. The combination of rotating helix and oscillating moving blade, with the till-roll paper moving linearly between them, enabled a raster to be drawn on the paper. =Fully-electronic version= a pangram and numbers The idea was later taken up again, this time in digital and on-screen form, under the new name of CEEFAX, and the new system was announced in October 1972, and following test transmissions in 1972‚Äì74, the Ceefax system went live on 23 September 1974 with thirty pages of information. Created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by the Philips Lead Designer for VDUs John Adams, his design was given to the BBC so they could start transmission. BBC were working on ways of providing televisual subtitles for deaf people, it was the first teletext system in the world. James Redmond, the BBC's Director of Engineering at the time, was a particular enthusiast. Other broadcasters soon took up the idea, including the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), who had developed the incompatible ORACLE teletext system, at around the same time. Before the Internet and the World Wide Web become popular, Ceefax pages were often the first location to report a breaking story or headline. After technical negotiations, the two broadcasters settled in 1974 on a single standard, different from both Ceefax and ORACLE, which ultimately developed into World System Teletext (1976), and which remained in use for analogue broadcasts until 2012. The display format of 24 rows by 40 columns of characters was also adopted for the Prestel system. The technology became the standard European teletext system and replaced other standards, including the Antiope system formerly used in France. In 1983, Ceefax started to broadcast computer programs, known as telesoftware, for the BBC Micro (a home computer available in the United Kingdom). The telesoftware broadcasts stopped in 1989. A similar idea was the French C Plus Direct satellite channel which used different, higher speed technology to broadcast PC software. The basic technology of Ceefax remained compatible with the 1976 unified rollout; system elaborations in later years were made such that earlier receivers were still able to do a basic decode of pages, but would simply ignore enhanced information rather than showing corrupted data. =Closure= A BBC Ceefax page from 5 October 2008 The final second of live broadcast, before the final switch off Until 2012, the BBC's Ceefax service was still providing information on topics covering News, Sport, Weather, TV Listings and Businesses. The pages were kept up to date until the UK digital switchover was completed on Tuesday 23 October 2012. In 2002, the BBC stopped broadcasting Ceefax on the digital satellite Sky Digital service, but later brought back a limited service including a TV schedule for BBC One and BBC Two; and subtitles. The BBC has tried to reuse the old Ceefax page numbers where possible on the Freeview and digital satellite BBC Red Button Ceefax-replacement services.How we assign our page numbers BBC Blogs It was announced that Ceefax would not be replaced when the analogue signal was switched off in October 2012. The BBC Red Button service is seen as an alternative to Ceefax and since 2007 the number of regions with a Ceefax supported analogue signal had declined as digital switchover progressed across the UK. As of the end of 2011, three-quarters of the UK TV regions had completed or were in the process of being switched over. Ceefax was the last remaining text service available via analogue TV transmissions in the UK, as ITV and Channel 4's Teletext service closed in December 2009. Channel 5's \\"Five Text\\" ancillary service closed in 2011. A limited analogue teletext service through ITV and Channel 4 was still available through terrestrial until the digital switchover was completed on 23 October 2012. At 23:32:19 BST on 23 October 2012, Ceefax was switched off after 38 years of providing news, weather and sport information when the Olympic Games champion Dame Mary Peters turned off the last analogue TV signal in Northern Ireland. A series of graphics on Ceefax's front page marked its 38 years on the BBC. BBC News' website also has memories of Ceefax. In a tongue-in-cheek article on the 2017 general election, The Guardian gave political satirist Lord Buckethead a \\"Best Policy\\" award for the latter's manifesto pledge to bring back Ceefax. BBC Red Button service The analogue switch-off in the UK saw the closure of Ceefax in October 2012. Its replacement, BBC Red Button, is available on most digital services including Freeview, Virgin Media, Sky and Freesat. BBC Red Button is accessed by pressing the red button or the text button on any BBC channel. As well as being able to display plain text, BBC Red Button offers richer graphics than Ceefax and a number of interactive video streams. Pages can be navigated to by scrolling with the remote or entering the correct page number; most of the page numbers previously used on Ceefax are the same on BBC Red Button, such as sports being on page number 301 with football on 302 and football results on 316. The new BBC Red Button Service is used as much as Ceefax and is especially popular among football fans. In September 2019, the BBC announced that the Red Button service would be discontinued in 2020, ending 45 years of text content delivery via TV broadcast. However, on 29 January 2020, one day before the scheduled date of shutdown, the BBC suspended its decision pending a review into it after there were some protests concerning certain demographs of people, for example, the elderly, with regards to what impact the removal of the service would have on them. Technology The Ceefax/ORACLE standard was internationalised in the 1980s as World System Teletext, which was adopted into the international standard CCIR 653 (now ITU-R BT.653) of 1986 as CCIR Teletext System B. As with other teletext systems, text and simple graphics are transmitted in-band with the picture signal, and decoded by controller circuitry. Pages and content Pages were retrieved using a three-digit number. From the 1996 relaunch onwards, the main sections were organised as follows: *100s ‚Äì News *200s ‚Äì Business News *300s ‚Äì Sport *400s ‚Äì Weather and Travel *500s ‚Äì Entertainment (including 555 ‚Äì National Lottery results and 570 ‚Äì Newsround) *600s ‚Äì TV and Radio Listings *888 ‚Äì Subtitles Pages from Ceefax Pages from Ceefax was a selection of content from the Ceefax service and normally only shown in the absence of any other programming. It consisted of selected Ceefax pages which were transmitted as an ordinary TV picture which was viewable on any receiver. Audio accompaniment typically consisted of stock music or sometimes a discontinuous tone. The limited set of rolling pages shown on Pages from Ceefax had been accessible at any time of day on teletext-equipped televisions on page 198 (BBC1) and 298 (BBC2), moving to page 196 in 1992 and to page 152 in November 1996. =Content= Initially the in-vision broadcasts featured a variety of different topics - news, sport, weather and BBC TV listings. Also other topics would be included from time to time, such as financial news, travel news, a recipe and information about the BBC. In late 1989 the Ceefax service was relaunched as a news-focused service and the in-vision sequence became a news only service plus a weather forecast. A headline page for business, sport and travel reappeared in 1992. =In-vision history= In- vision Ceefax was first shown in March 1980, originally in 30-minute slots and by 1983 it was a common filler during daytime downtime. Transmissions were originally billed on-air as Ceefax in Vision but from 7 January 1984, the Radio Times began to list daytime Ceefax transmissions under the title of Pages from Ceefax.BBC Genome Project ‚Äì BBC2 listings 7 January 1984 From March 1983, BBC1 started to air a selection of Ceefax pages every weekday morning at 6.00am called Ceefax AM which would lead into the start of Breakfast Time at 6.30am. From May 1983, BBC1 would transmit Ceefax pages during their weekday daytime hours, as BBC1 did not have a codified daytime schedule at that time. This situation continued until Monday 27 October 1986, when BBC1 launched a full daytime schedule, resulting in the only Ceefax transmission on BBC1 being the weekday 6.00am Ceefax AM broadcast.BBC Genome Blog 27 October 2016 On BBC2 from 19 September 1983, a selection of Ceefax pages would air for a large part of their broadcast day, especially when schools programmes were not on the air, and on many occasions until September 1986, Pages from Ceefax would air continuously from 9.00am until the start of regular programming at around 5.30pm. From the late 1980s onwards, Pages from Ceefax was increasingly marginalised by the BBC's move towards a near-continuous service and by the start of the 1990s they were shown for short periods, usually for around 15 minutes, before the first programme of the day. However, when the BBC launched The Learning Zone in 1995, it was shown during overnight downtime on BBC Two although latterly BBC News filled many of the late night/early morning gaps in the schedules. The last Pages from Ceefax broadcast on BBC1 was on 9 November 1997 but they continued to be broadcast on BBC2 until the Ceefax service was closed down. The final transmission was in the early hours of Monday 22 October 2012 and featured special continuity announcements and a specially created end caption featuring various Ceefax graphics from over the years. The music chosen for the final minutes was \\"BART\\" by Ruby, which had been frequently used for Pages from Ceefax and for other continuity. Since then, overnight downtime has been filled with a rolling loop of previews of forthcoming BBC Two programmes. =Similar services on other channels= Channel 4 showed pages from Oracle from 1983 until 1989 and 4-Tel On View from 1983 until 1997, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s some ITV companies broadcast Jobfinder which consisted of teletext pages showing job vacancies and related information. ITV Nightscreen also used teletext pages in its first few years on air. Also, in its early days, Sky One showed in-vision pages from the Skytext service during its overnight downtime. Teefax Teefax is a revamped version of Ceefax for the Raspberry Pi computer introduced in August 2016 by Peter Kwan. To view Teefax, enthusiasts connect a Raspberry Pi running appropriate software to the signal input of a Teletext-capable TV. Kwan said: \\"It's like the modern-day equivalent of restoring steam engines. It's completely useless but it keeps us occupied.\\" The service has 12 pages of up- to-date news and Kwan hopes to create an online archive of old teletext pages from Britain, Germany and France.A few pages of Teefax can be seen on this ITV news report.

Variations available, some of them limited editions, include Caramilk made with dark chocolate, maple flavoured, chocolate flavoured, or cappuccino. Thicker versions called Caramilk Thick and cylindrical versions called Caramilk Rolls (similar to Rolo) have also been introduced. Advertising campaigns One of the advertising campaigns for Caramilk bars revolved around the question of how the centre of the confection was put into the chocolate flavoured exterior. This theme led to the production of over fifteen separate television advertisements since the candy was introduced, making the series one of the most productive advertising efforts in Canadian history. The \\"Caramilk Secret\\" ad campaign was conceived by Gary Prouk when he was at Doyle Dane Bernbach. When Prouk left DDB to join Scali McCabe Sloves, the Cadbury account went with him. One notable advertisement involved two cone head aliens who were complimenting each other on successfully concealing the secret from humans, and also creating some of earth's other long standing works of wonder (e.g. the pyramids).

The essence of mainstream hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone. Often the Roland Alpha Juno or the kick from a Roland TR-909 was used to create this sound. Mainstream hardcore tracks typically include samples and synthesized melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 165 to 180 bpm. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in mainstream hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, pitch shifted, or distorted. History Angerfist, one of the most famous DJs of mainstream hardcore. The mainstream hardcore sound derives from early hardcore (still called gabber at the time). In the late 1990s, early hardcore became less popular than Hardstyle. After surviving underground for a number of years, in 2002 Gabber regained some popularity in the Netherlands, although the sound is more mature, darker, and industrial. Some producers started embracing a slower style characterized by a deeper, harder bass drum that typically had a longer envelope than was possible in the traditional, faster style. In this aspect, this new form of gabber obviously cannot be considered less powerful than its precursor. This newer sound was referred to as \\"New Style\\" or \\"Mainstream\\" and as the tempo got slower and slower it began to become similar to Chicago hard house. Many hardcore enthusiasts hated Chicago hard house and the club scene it typified, and frequently DJs would be booed by one group of fans and cheered for by another at the same party, depending on the tempo and style of music they were playing. This is similar to the rivalry and mutual dislike that surfaced earlier between fans of \\"regular\\" hardcore and happy hardcore. Eventually the two styles met in the middle, and most gabber today is produced in a range of 160-180 bpm. This style is typically a bit slower than the Rotterdam style of the mid-1990s. Style Mainstream hardcore is characterized by its bass drum sound. Essentially, it comes from taking a normal synthesized bass drum and over-driving it heavily. The approximately sinusoidal sample starts to clip into a square wave with a falling pitch. This results in a number of effects: the frequency spectrum spreads out, thus achieving a louder, more aggressive sound. It also changes the amplitude envelope of the sound by increasing the sustain. Due to the distortion, the drum also develops a melodic tone. It is not uncommon for the bass drum pattern to change pitch throughout the song to follow the bass line. Many tracks rely on a clean, detuned supersaw lead, similar to uplifting trance and can therefore sound \\"happy\\".

H. Lawrence, first published privately in 1928 in Italy and in 1929 in France. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960, when it was the subject of a watershed obscenity trial against the publisher Penguin Books. Penguin won the case and quickly sold three million copies. The book was also banned for obscenity in the United States, Canada, Australia, India, and Japan. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex, and its use of then-unprintable four-letter words. The story is said to have originated from certain events in Lawrence's own unhappy domestic life, and he took inspiration for the settings of the book from Nottinghamshire, where he grew up. According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with \\"Tiger\\", a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story.. Lawrence, who at one time considered calling the novel John Thomas and Lady Jane (in reference to the male and female sex organs), made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition. Lawrence read the manuscript of Maurice by E. M. Forster, which was published posthumously in 1971. That novel, which also involves a gamekeeper becoming the lover of a member of the upper classes, although the relationship is homosexual, was an influence on Lady Chatterley's Lover.King, Dixie (1982) \\"The Influence of Forster's Maurice on Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" Contemporary Literature Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1982), pp. 65-82Delaveny, Emile (1971) D. H. Lawrence and Edward Carpenter: A Study in Edwardian Transition. New York: Taplinger Publishing Company.  Plot introduction  The story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper class husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, is paralysed from the waist down due to a Great War injury. In addition to Clifford's physical limitations, his emotional neglect of Constance forces distance between the couple. Her emotional frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class. The novel is about Constance's realization that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. This realization stems from a heightened sexual experience Constance has only felt with Mellors, suggesting that love can only happen with the element of the body, not just the mind.  Themes  In Lady Chatterley's Lover, Lawrence comes full circle to argue once again for individual regeneration, which can be found only through the relationship between man and woman (and, he asserts sometimes, man and man). Love and personal relationships are the threads that bind this novel together. Lawrence explores a wide range of different types of relationships. The reader sees the brutal, bullying relationship between Mellors and his wife Bertha, who punishes him by preventing his pleasure. There is Tommy Dukes, who has no relationship because he cannot find a woman whom he respects intellectually and, at the same time, finds desirable. There is also the perverse, maternal relationship that ultimately develops between Clifford and Mrs. Bolton, his caring nurse, after Constance has left. = Mind and body = Richard Hoggart argues that the main subject of Lady Chatterley's Lover is not the sexual passages that were the subject of such debate, but the search for integrity and wholeness.. Key to this integrity is cohesion between the mind and the body for \\"body without mind is brutish; mind without body ... is a running away from our double being.\\" Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the incoherence of living a life that is \\"all mind\\", which Lawrence saw as particularly true among the young members of the aristocratic classes, as in his description of Constance's and her sister Hilda's \\"tentative love-affairs\\" in their youth: The contrast between mind and body can be seen in the dissatisfaction each has with their previous relationships: Constance's lack of intimacy with her husband who is \\"all mind\\" and Mellors's choice to live apart from his wife because of her \\"brutish\\" sexual nature. These dissatisfactions lead them into a relationship that builds very slowly and is based upon tenderness, physical passion and mutual respect. As the relationship between Lady Chatterley and Mellors develops, they learn more about the interrelation of the mind and the body; she learns that sex is more than a shameful and disappointing act, and he learns about the spiritual challenges that come from physical love. Jenny Turner maintained in The Sexual Imagination from Acker to Zola: A Feminist Companion (1993) that the publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover broke \\"the taboo on explicit representations of sexual acts in British and North American literature\\". She described the novel as \\"a book of great libertarian energy and heteroerotic beauty\\". = Class = Lady Chatterley's Lover also presents some views on the British social context of the early 20th century. This is most evidently seen in the plot: the affair of an aristocratic woman (Connie) with a working class man (Mellors). This is heightened when Mellors adopts the local broad Derbyshire dialect, something he can slip in and out of. Critic and writer Mark Schorer writes of the forbidden love of a woman of relatively superior social situation who is drawn to an \\"outsider\\" (a man of lower social rank or a foreigner). He considers this a familiar construction in D.H. Lawrence's works, in which the woman either resists her impulse or yields to it.. Schorer believes the two possibilities were embodied, respectively, in the situation into which Lawrence was born, and that into which Lawrence married, therefore becoming a favourite topic in his work. There is a clear class divide between the inhabitants of Wragby and Tevershall, bridged by the nurse Mrs Bolton. Clifford is more self assured in his position, whereas Connie is often thrown when the villagers treat her as a Lady (for instance when she has tea in the village). This is often made explicit in the narration, for instance: There are also signs of dissatisfaction and resentment from the Tevershall coal pit colliers, whose fortunes are in decline, against Clifford who owns the mines. Involved with hard, dangerous and health-threatening employment, the unionised and self-supporting pit-village communities in Britain have been home to more pervasive class barriers than has been the case in other industries (for an example, see chapter two of The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell.) They were also centres of widespread Nonconformism (Non-Anglican Protestantism), which hold proscriptive views on sexual sins such as adultery. References to the concepts of anarchism, socialism, communism and capitalism permeate the book. Union strikes were also a constant preoccupation in Wragby Hall. Coal mining is a recurrent and familiar theme in Lawrence's life and writing due to his background, and is also prominent in Sons and Lovers and Women in Love, as well as short stories such as Odour of Chrysanthemums. = Industrialisation and nature = As in much of Lawrence's fiction, a key theme is the contrast between the vitality of nature and the mechanised monotony of mining and industrialism. Clifford wants to reinvigorate the mines with new technology and is out of touch with the natural world. In contrast, Connie often appreciates the beauty of nature and sees the ugliness of the mines in Uthwaite. Her heightened sensual appreciation applies to both nature and her sexual relationship with Mellors.  Controversy  An edition of the novel was published in Britain in 1932 by Martin Secker; reviewing it in The Observer, the journalist Gerald Gould noted that \\"passages are necessarily omitted to which the author undoubtedly attached supreme psychological importance ‚Äì importance so great, that he was willing to face obloquy and misunderstanding and censorship because of them\\".\\"New Novels\\", The Observer, 28 February 1932, p. 6. An authorised and heavily censored abridgment was published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1928. This edition was subsequently reissued in paperback in the United States by Signet Books in 1946. = British obscenity trial = When the full unexpurgated edition was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 was a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 Act (introduced by Roy Jenkins) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word \\"fuck\\" and its derivatives. Another objection related to the use of the word \\"cunt\\". Various academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including E. M. Forster, Helen Gardner, Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and Norman St John- Stevas, were called as witnesses, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was \\"not guilty\\". This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the United Kingdom. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, asked if it were the kind of book \\"you would wish your wife or servants to read\\". The Penguin second edition, published in 1961, contains a publisher's dedication, which reads: \\"For having published this book, Penguin Books was prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of 'not guilty' and thus made D. H. Lawrence's last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom\\". In 2006, the trial was dramatized by BBC Wales as The Chatterley Affair. = Australia = Not only was the book banned in Australia, but a book describing the British trial, The Trial of Lady Chatterley, was also banned. A copy was smuggled into the country and then published widely. The fallout from this event eventually led to the easing of censorship of books in the country, although the country still retains the Australian Classification Board. = Canada = In 1962, McGill University Professor of Law and Canadian modernist poet F. R. Scott appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada to defend Lady Chatterley's Lover from censorship. Scott represented the appellants, booksellers who had been offering the book for sale. The case arose when the police had seized their copies of the book and deposited them with a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, who issued a notice to the booksellers to show cause why the books should not be confiscated as obscene, contrary to s 150A of the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, SC 1953-54, c 51, s. 150A, as enacted by SC 1959, c 41, s 12. The trial judge eventually ruled that the book was obscene and ordered that the copies be confiscated. This decision was upheld by the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side (now the Quebec Court of Appeal).Brodie v The Queen (1961), 36 CR 200 (Que QB (App Side)). Scott then appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. That Court allowed the appeal on a 5‚Äì4 split, holding that the book was not an obscene publication. On 15 November 1960 an Ontario panel of experts, appointed by Attorney General Kelso Roberts, found that novel was not obscene according to the Canadian Criminal Code. = United States = Lady Chatterley's Lover was banned for obscenity in the United States in 1929. In 1930, Senator Bronson Cutting proposed an amendment to the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act, which was then being debated, ending the practice of having United States Customs censor allegedly obscene imported books. Senator Reed Smoot vigorously opposed such an amendment, threatening to publicly read indecent passages of imported books in front of the Senate. Although he never followed through, he included Lady Chatterley's Lover as an example of an obscene book that must not reach domestic audiences, declaring \\"I've not taken ten minutes on Lady Chatterley's Lover, outside of looking at its opening pages. It is most damnable! It is written by a man with a diseased mind and a soul so black that he would obscure even the darkness of hell!\\"\\"Decency Squabble\\" , Time magazine, 31 March 1930 A 1955 French film version based on the novel and released by Kingsley Pictures was the subject of attempted censorship in New York in 1959 on the grounds that it promoted adultery. The US Supreme Court held on 29 June 1959 that the law prohibiting its showing was a violation of the First Amendment's protection of free speech.. The ban on Lady Chatterley's Lover, Tropic of Cancer, and Fanny Hill was fought and overturned in court with assistance by publisher Barney Rosset and lawyer Charles Rembar in 1959.. It was then published by Rosset's Grove Press, with the complete opinion by United States Court of Appeals Judge Frederick van Pelt Bryan, which first established the standard of \\"redeeming social or literary value\\" as a defence against obscenity charges. Fred Kaplan of The New York Times stated the overturning of the obscenity laws \\"set off an explosion of free speech\\". Susan Sontag, in a 1961 essay in The Supplement to the Columbia Spectator that was republished in Against Interpretation (1966), dismissed Lady Chatterley's Lover as a \\"sexually reactionary\\" book, and suggested that the importance given to vindicating it showed that the United States was \\"plainly at a very elementary stage of sexual maturity.\\" = Japan = Translator Sei It≈ç (left) and his publisher Hisajir≈ç Oyama (right) at the 1st Chatterley trial in Japan. The publication of a full translation of Lady Chatterley's Lover by Sei It≈ç in 1950 led to a famous obscenity trial in Japan, extending from 8 May 1951 to 18 January 1952, with appeals lasting to 13 March 1957. Several notable literary figures testified for the defence, and the trial ultimately ended in a guilty verdict with a ¬•100,000 fine for Ito and a ¬•250,000 fine for his publisher. = India = In 1964, bookseller Ranjit Udeshi in Bombay was prosecuted under Sec. 292 of the Indian Penal Code (sale of obscene books) for selling an unexpurgated copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1965 SC 881) was eventually laid before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India, where Chief Justice Hidayatullah declared the law on the subject of when a book can be regarded as obscene and established important tests of obscenity such as the Hicklin test. The judgement upheld the conviction, stating that:  Cultural influence  In the United States, the full publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover was a significant event in the \\"sexual revolution\\". At the time, the book was a topic of widespread discussion and a byword of sorts. In 1965, Tom Lehrer recorded a satirical song entitled \\"Smut\\", in which the speaker in the song lyrics cheerfully acknowledges his enjoyment of such material; \\"Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately?/I've got a hobby: rereading Lady Chatterley.\\" British poet Philip Larkin's poem \\"Annus Mirabilis\\" begins with a reference to the trial: By 1976, the story had become sufficiently safe in the United Kingdom to be parodied by Morecambe and Wise; a \\"play what Ernie wrote\\", The Handyman and M'Lady, was obviously based on it, with Michele Dotrice as the Lady Chatterley figure. Introducing it, Ernie explained that his play \\"concerns a rich, titled young lady who is deprived of love, caused by her husband falling into a combine harvester, which unfortunately makes him impudent.\\"‚ÄúThe Morecambe & Wise Show (1968‚Äì1977).

Lawrence novel ever to be staged, and his dramatisation was the only one to be read and approved by Lawrence's widow, Frieda. Despite her attempts to obtain the copyright for Harte to have his play staged in the 1950s, Baron Philippe de Rothschild did not relinquish the dramatic rights until his film version was released in France. Only the Old Bailey trial against Penguin Books for alleged obscenity in publishing the unexpurgated paperback edition of the novel prevented the play's transfer to the much bigger Wyndham's Theatre, for which it had already been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain's Office on 12 August 1960 with passages censored. It was fully booked out for its limited run at the Arts Theatre and well reviewed by Harold Hobson, the prevailing West End theatre critic of the time. A new stage version will open in autumn 2016 adapted and directed by Philip Breen opening at Sheffield Theatre and going on a UK tour Produced by English Touring Theatre and Sheffield Theatres.

It lies south-east of Brussels, south-east of Charleroi and south of Namur. Dinant is situated north of the border with France. The municipality includes the old communes of Anseremme, Bouvignes-sur-Meuse, Dr√©hance, Falmagne, Falmignoul, Foy-Notre-Dame, Furfooz, Lisogne, Sorinnes, and Thynes. Geography Dinant is positioned in the Upper Meuse valley, at a point where the river cuts deeply into the western Condroz plateau. Sited in a steep sided valley, between the rock face and the river. The original settlement had little space in which to grow away from the river, and it therefore expanded into a long, thin town, on a north-south axis, along the river shore. During the 19th century, the former √éle des Batteurs (Drummers' Island) to the south was attached directly to the town when a branch of the river was filled in. Dinant has been enriched by the agricultural opportunities presented by the fertile land on the plateau that overlooks it. Within the town, brassware production is a traditional craft that has benefited from the presence of the broad and, at this point, easily navigable river which has facilitated easy delivery of the raw materials and ready distribution of the resulting products of the artisans' workshops. Another traditional source of wealth is provided by the limestone cliffs overlooking the town, which supported a high-end quarrying industry, producing black marble and bluestone, and whose distribution also benefitted from the proximity of the relatively wide and deep navigable river. History =Origins to the 10th century= The name Dinant comes from the Celtic Divo- Nanto, meaning \\"Sacred Valley\\" or \\"Divine Valley\\"; it can also be translated as \\"Celestial Gorge\\" or \\"Luminous Gorge\\" (as in modern Welsh Nant Dwyfol). The Dinant area was already populated in Neolithic, Celtic, and Roman times. The first mention of Dinant as a settlement dates from the 7th century, when Saint Perpete, bishop of Tongeren, which at the time had its capital in Maastricht, took Dinant as his residence and founded the church of Saint Vincent. In 870, Charles the Bald gave part of Dinant to be administered by the Count of Namur, the other part by the bishop of Tongeren, which was by that time based in Li√®ge. In the 11th century, the emperor Henry IV granted several rights over Dinant to the Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge, including market and justice rights. From that time on, the city became one of the 23 ‚Äò‚Äòbonnes villes‚Äô‚Äô (or principal cities) of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The first stone bridge on the Meuse and major repair to the castle, which had been built earlier, also date from the end of the 11th century. Throughout this period, and until the end of the 18th century, Dinant shared its history with its overlord Li√®ge, sometimes rising in revolt against it, sometimes partaking in its victories and defeats, mostly against the neighbouring County of Namur. =Late Middle Ages= Its strategic location on the Meuse exposed Dinant to battle and pillage, not always by avowed enemies: in 1466, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, uncle of Louis de Bourbon, Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge, and Philip‚Äôs son Charles the Bold punished an uprising in Dinant during the Li√®ge Wars, by casting 800 burghers into the Meuse and setting fire to the city. The city's economic rival was Bouvignes, downriver on the opposite shore of the Meuse. Late Medieval Dinant and Bouvignes specialised in metalwork, producing finely cast and finished objects in a silvery brass alloy, called dinanderie and supplying aquamaniles, candlesticks, patens and other altar furniture throughout the Meuse valley (giving these objects their cautious designation \\"Mosan\\"), the Rhineland and beyond. Henri Pirenne gained his doctorate in 1883 with a thesis on medieval Dinant. =The Old Regime and World War I= Dinant's destruction in World War I In the 16th- and 17th-centuries wars between France and Spain, Dinant suffered destruction, famine and epidemics, despite its neutrality. In 1675, the French army under Marshal Fran√ßois de Cr√©quy occupied the city. Dinant was briefly taken by the Austrians at the end of the 18th century. The whole Bishopric of Li√®ge was ceded to France in 1795. The dinanderies fell out of fashion and the economy of the city now rested on leather tanning and the manufacture of playing cards. The famous couques de Dinant also appeared at that time. The city suffered devastation again at the beginning of the First World War. On the 15 August 1914, French and German troops fought for the town in the Battle of Dinant, among the wounded was Lieut. Charles de Gaulle. On 23 August, 674 inhabitants were summarily executed by Saxon troops of the German Army -- the biggest massacre committed by the Germans in 1914. Within a month, some five thousand Belgian and French civilians were killed by the Germans at numerous similar occasions. Sights *The city's landmark is the Collegiate Church of Notre Dame de Dinant. It was rebuilt in Gothic style on its old foundations after falling rocks from the adjacent cliff partially destroyed the former Romanesque style church in 1227. Several stages for a pair of towers on the west end were completed before the project was abandoned in favour of the present central tower with a famous onion dome and facetted multi-staged lantern. *Above the church rises the vertical flank of the rocher surmounted by the fortified Citadel of Dinant that was first built in the 11th century to control the Meuse valley. The Prince-Bishops of Li√®ge rebuilt and enlarged it in 1530; the French destroyed it in 1703. Its present aspect, with the rock-hewn stairs (408 steps), is due to rebuilding in 1821, during the United Kingdom of the Netherlands phase of Dinant's chequered history. A cable car is available during the high season to take visitors from the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame to the top of the Citadel. *Apart from the main block is the Rocher Bayard that was said to have been split by giant hoof of Bayard, the giant horse carrying the four sons of Duke Aymon on their legendary flight from Charlemagne through the Ardennes, told in Les Quatre Fils Aymon, a famous 12th-century chanson de geste. In reality the rock has been divided by the soldiers of Louis XIV after the conquest of Dinant in order to construct a road alongside the river Meuse. *The house of Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone located in the street of the same name.

The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis's 1970 novel Jack's Return Home. Producer Michael Klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio to finance and release the film, bringing in Hodges and Caine. Caine became a co-producer of the film. Get Carter was Hodges's first feature film as director, as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong. MGM was reducing its European operations and the film became the last project approved before it closed its Borehamwood studios. The film is set in north-east England and was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. The story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), who travels back to his home town to discover more about his brother Frank's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, and with vengeance on his mind, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element. Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film. Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter. Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film. Combined with Hodges' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the one-armed bandit murder) and the use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras, produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes. The shoot was incident-free and progressed speedily, despite a one-day strike by the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with location shooting lasting 40 days. Get Carter suffered in its promotion, firstly from MGM's problems and secondly owing to the declining British film industry of the period, which relied increasingly on US investment. Initial UK critical reaction to the film was mixed, with British reviewers grudgingly appreciative of the film's technical excellence but dismayed by the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse at his actions. Despite this the film did good business in the UK and produced a respectable profit. US critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film but it was poorly promoted in the US by United Artists and languished on the drive in circuit while MGM focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation version of the same novel, Hit Man. On its release Get Carter received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered. It was not available on home media until 1993 but always maintained a cult following. Endorsements from a new generation of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognized as one of the best British movies. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film. Get Carter was remade in 2000 by Warner Bros. under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter, with Caine in a supporting role. This remake was not well received by critics in the US and was not given a UK theatrical release. Plot Newcastle-born gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) has lived in London for years in the employ of organised crime bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher (Terence Rigby and John Bindon). Jack is sleeping with Gerald's girlfriend Anna (Britt Ekland) and plans to escape with her to South America, but he must first return to Newcastle and Gateshead to attend the funeral of his brother, Frank, who died in a purported drunk-driving accident. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral Jack meets his teenage niece Doreen (Petra Markham) and Frank's evasive mistress Margaret (Dorothy White); it is later implied that Doreen is Jack's daughter. Jack goes to Newcastle Racecourse seeking old acquaintance Albert Swift (Glynn Edwards) for information about his brother's death, but Swift spots Jack and evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice (Ian Hendry), who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear (John Osborne). Jack bursts in on Kinnear, who is playing poker, but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda (Geraldine Moffat). As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone. He is given the name \\"Brumby\\". Jack knows Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) as a businessman with controlling interests in local seaside amusement arcades. Visiting Brumby's house Jack discovers the man knows nothing about him and, believing he has been set up, he leaves. The next morning two of Jack's London colleagues ‚Äì Con McCarthy and Peter the Dutchman (George Sewell and Tony Beckley) ‚Äì arrive, sent by the Fletchers to take him back, but he escapes. Jack meets Margaret to talk about Frank, but the Fletchers' men are waiting and pursue him. He is rescued by Glenda who takes him in her sports car to meet Brumby at his new restaurant development at the top of a multi-storey car park. Brumby identifies Kinnear as being behind Frank's death, also explaining that Kinnear is trying to take over his business. He offers Jack ¬£5,000 to kill the crime boss, which he flatly refuses. Jack has sex with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches a pornographic film where Doreen is forced to have sex with Albert Swift. The other participants in the film are Glenda and Margaret. Overcome with emotion, Jack becomes enraged and pushes Glenda's head under water as she is taking a bath. She tells him the film was Kinnear's, and that she thinks Doreen was pulled into the production by Eric. Forcing Glenda into the boot of her car, Jack drives off to find Albert. Jack tracks Albert down at a betting shop. Albert confesses he told Brumby that Doreen was, indeed, Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear. Eric and two of his men arranged Frank's death. Information extracted, Jack fatally stabs Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. In the ensuing shootout, Jack shoots Peter dead. As Eric and Con escape, they push the sports car into the river unaware that Glenda is in the boot. Returning to the car park Jack finds Brumby, beats him senseless and throws him over the side to his death. He then posts the pornographic film to the vice squad at Scotland Yard in London. Jack abducts Margaret at gunpoint. He telephones Kinnear in the middle of a wild party, telling him he has the film and makes a deal for Kinnear to give him Eric in exchange for his silence. Kinnear agrees, sending Eric to an agreed location; however, he subsequently phones a hitman to dispose of Jack. Jack drives Margaret to the grounds of Kinnear's estate, kills her with a fatal injection and leaves her body there. He then calls the police to raid Kinnear's party. Jack chases Eric along a beach. He forces Eric to drink a full bottle of whisky as Eric had done to Frank, then beats him to death with his shotgun. Having avenged his dead brother and the sexually abused Doreen, Jack walks along the shoreline. As he goes to throw his shotgun into the sea, he is shot in the head from a distance. The sniper rifle is wielded by Kinnear's hitman, only identified as \\"J\\", who then proceeds to carefully deal with his equipment before calmly walking away with it in his bag. Jack lies dead on the shore with the waves beginning to lap up against him. Casting Michael Caine in the trailer for Get Carter (1971) There was pressure from MGM to have more big-name American stars in the film, which was successfully resisted by Hodges. As well as Telly Savalas, names posited by Klinger and studio executives were Joan Collins, and someone Hodges described as \\"the Canadian lead actress in TV's Peyton Place\\", which most probably means Barbara Parkins. The production also utilised a large number of extras, most of whom were locals who just happened to be on scene when filming was happening. Others were sourced from local casting company Beverley Artistes, which sent everyone registered with it for audition, one of these being Deana Wilde, who was cast as the pub singer. Several of the company's actors were also in background shots in the film including the casino, streets, bars and the police raid scene. * Michael Caine as Jack Carter. Hodges wrote the screenplay with Ian Hendry in mind for Carter, but learned that Michael Klinger had already signed up Caine for the role. With the backing of a major studio Klinger was keen to secure a big name for the lead, and Caine was very prominent at the time, having starred in Alfie, The Italian Job and The Ipcress File. Hodges was surprised that a star of Caine's stature would want to play such a thoroughly unlikeable person as Carter. Giving his reasons for wanting to be involved with the film, the actor said \\"One of the reasons I wanted to make that picture was my background. In English movies, gangsters were either stupid or funny. I wanted to show that they're neither. Gangsters are not stupid, and they're certainly not very funny\\". He identified with Carter as a memory of his working-class upbringing, having friends and family members who were involved in crime and felt Carter represented a path his life might have taken under different circumstances: \\"Carter is the dead-end product of my own environment, my childhood; I know him well. He is the ghost of Michael Caine\\". He made subtle changes to Hodges' depiction of Carter in the script, cut out pleasantries and gave him a cold, hard edge; closer to Lewis's original envisioning of the character. Caine was determined to show a more minimalistic and realistic, less \\"pornographic\\" form of violence than was generally depicted on screen. Carter's violent actions are restrained, business-like and sudden, never using 30 punches when one would do. Although he is not credited as such in the film, Caine has been acknowledged in retrospect as a co-producer. In a strange coincidence, Caine's stand-in on the film was a man called Jack Carter. * Ian Hendry as Eric Paice. Hendry had previously been cast by producer Klinger in Roman Polanski's Repulsion, and was Hodges' first choice to play Carter, but by 1970 his career was rapidly declining. Hendry's alcoholism and poor physical conditionChibnall, 2003 p. 86 were apparent on set in Newcastle, and his envy at contemporary Caine's success was exacerbated by his drinking. Hodges and Caine used his animosity towards Caine to their advantage to create extra tension in the scenes between Carter and Paice.Chibnall, pp. 37‚Äì38 * John Osborne as Cyril Kinnear, Jack's main adversary. Famous playwright Osborne was an unusual choice of actor; he was suggested by Hodges' agent. The writer enjoyed the change, and saw it as a way to erase the image in the public's mind of him as an angry young man. Osborne had never played card games before and practised poker before the shoot to lend realism to the gambling scene. Osborne's portrayal was a contrast to the description in Lewis's novel of Kinnear as an uncultured, corpulent spiv, giving him an urbane and relaxed demeanour, his delivery being so relaxed and quiet that it was difficult for the sound recordist to pick up, but Hodges liked the \\"menace in that quietness\\". Britt Ekland in trailer for Get Carter (1971) * Britt Ekland as Anna. Ekland was cast as the leading lady of the film, as she was a prominent sex symbol of the time and would have already been familiar to US audiences through her work in The Night They Raided Minsky's and Stiletto. Accordingly, her small role in the film was overemphasised in the publicity. Ekland was afraid of becoming typecast, having already played two gangster's molls before Carter. She was also reluctant to take the part as she did not want to take her clothes off; however, she had financial problems at the time as a result of bad investment decisions by her accountant. She was later happy that she had been involved with the project. * Bryan Mosley as Cliff Brumby. MGM executives initially wanted Telly Savalas for the part of the \\"big man\\", but were impressed by Coronation Street actor Mosley's performance in fight scenes in Far from The Madding Crowd. A devout Roman Catholic, Mosley was concerned about taking part in such a violent film with depictions of criminal behaviour, consulting his priest over the moral implications. * George Sewell as Con McCarty. Sewell was the man who introduced Barbara Windsor to Charlie Kray. He grew up in working- class Hoxton and had come to acting late when in 1959 he joined Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. A well-known face on British television in the 1960s, his sandblasted features and shifty, haunted looks made him ideal for playing villainous characters or hard-bitten detectives. He seemed ideally cast as a London gangster colleague of Carter's. After Carter, Sewell became more known for playing policemen rather than villains. * Tony Beckley as Peter the Dutchman. Lewis depicted Peter as a misogynistic homosexual in his novel; these elements were not emphasised in the film, although the character is flamboyant and camp. Beckley had developed a specialism of playing sadistic criminals, so his part in Carter was somewhat similar to his role of \\"Camp Freddy\\" alongside Caine in The Italian Job. * Glynn Edwards as Albert Swift. Like Sewell, Edwards was an apprentice of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop who had come to acting in his thirties. He had previously appeared alongside Caine in Zulu and The Ipcress File. After the film Edwards found work as a character actor and appeared regularly in the TV show Minder.Chibnall, p. 33 * Alun Armstrong as Keith. This was Armstrong's screen debut. The themes of Get Carter echo those of Armstrong's better-known role 25 years later in BBC drama Our Friends in the North, which also dealt with local government corruption. He wrote a letter to MGM when he learned it was making the film in Newcastle, and he was invited to meet director Mike Hodges, who wanted to cast local actors.Mitchell, Wendy, \\"Get Armstrong\\" , Screen Daily, 23 March 2011. Retrieved 28 April 2011. * Bernard Hepton as Thorpe. Bradford-born Hepton was cast by Hodges as Kinnear's nervous messenger. * Petra Markham as Doreen Carter. Petra Markham was a 24-year-old experienced theatre actress when she was asked to play the role of Carter's 16-year-old niece. Her appearance in only four scenes in the film meant she could balance the film work with appearing at the Royal Court and her role in the television series Albert and Victoria. She went on to play the unfortunate Rose Chapman in EastEnders.Chibnall, p. 32 * Geraldine Moffat as Glenda. Moffatt was an experienced actress who had trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She attracted Hodges' attention not just for her good looks but for her work on television plays such as Stella and Doreen. * Dorothy White as Margaret. White had a successful career as a television actress and was particularly well known for Z-Cars, but the part of Margaret was her first credited cinematic role (the only other being a part in the 1955 film Touch & Go). She had previously worked with Mike Hodges on the television play Suspect. * Rosemarie Dunham as Edna, Carter's landlady. Although she had appeared in The Avengers and A Family at War on television, this was Scottish-born Dunham's film debut. * John Bindon as Sid Fletcher. He was the son of a London cab driver who was \\"discovered\\" by Ken Loach in a pub. As a young man Bindon had been in and out of borstal, and spent most of his adult life associating with criminals, so he was ideally suited to play a gangland boss, despite being young, having intimate knowledge of that world. In the late 1970s his career suffered as he became entangled in accusations of protection racketeering in Fulham and was acquitted of murder at the Old Bailey. * Terence Rigby as Gerald Fletcher, one of the London crime boss brothers. Rigby was another actor Hodges cast from his familiarity in television police drama.Chibnall, p. 34 Mike Hodges recruited a band of experienced character actors to play the small supporting roles. Godfrey Quigley was cast as Eddie, a colleague of Frank Carter's. Kevin Brennan appears as Harry the card-player. Ben Aris, who plays one of the architects, is better known for British situation comedies. Carl HowardListed as 'Karl Howard' on IMDB. See here: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4202087/'s character of the assassin, \\"J\\", is only identified by the initial on his ring, in his only film role, and an appropriate mystery surrounds his real identity. His name does not appear on the credits of some prints. Mike Hodges explained that Howard was an extra in his TV film Rumour, and the director gave him a line to say, but another extra was wrongly credited. Hodges promised he would make it up to him and cast him in Carter, but his name was missed off some of the original prints. When the film credits were printed in the Radio Times and TV Times, Howard was also trimmed. Hodges said in 2002 \\"Carl and credits don't seem destined for each other\\".Chibnall, p. 35 Production =Development= In the late 1960s film censorship relaxation produced an increase in dark, uncompromising films, with many directors pushing the boundaries of acceptability. Get Carter was a film which explored this freedom. The project went from concept to finished film in just 10 months. In 1969, producer Michael Klinger devised plans for a gangster film to capitalise on public interest in the British criminal underworld after the Kray Twins' convictions. Klinger was invited to view a first print of Peter Walker's Man of Violence (1969) and was unimpressed, telling the director \\"I'm going to make a gangster film, but it's going to cost a lot more than this and it's going to be better\\".Chibnall, p. 21 After searching many publishers for material to adapt into a film, Klinger purchased the rights to Ted Lewis's novel Jack's Return Home. Andrew Spicer has written that \\"he [Klinger] sensed its potential to imbue the British crime thriller with the realism and violence of its American counterparts\\". Klinger had been approached in 1969 by another producer Nat Cohen to make a couple of films for MGM.Steve Chibnall, Robert Murphy (eds.) British Crime Cinema, London: Routledge, 1999, p.128 In financial trouble and shutting down its British operations, MGM was in the process of closing its British studios at Borehamwood and was looking to make smaller-budget films to turn a profit. At this time Klinger's friend Robert Littman had been appointed head of MGM Europe and so Klinger took his proposal to him.Chibnall, p. 21 MGM agreed a reasonable but below average budget of 750,000 (there is some dispute as to whether it was dollars or pounds) for the production. Within months of agreeing the deal MGM had pulled out of the UK.Chibnall, p. 21 Klinger had seen Mike Hodges' television film Suspect (1969) and immediately decided he was the ideal candidate to direct his new project. Hodges had also previously worked on current affairs programme World in Action, the arts programme Tempo and a 1968 children's television serial, The Tyrant King, and all these past experiences informed his approach to his film debut. Klinger contacted Hodges on 27 January 1970 with a copy of Jack's Return Home and contracted him to direct and adapt the screenplay, paying him a flat fee of ¬£7,000 for his services. Hodges' original working title for the film was Carter's The Name. Steve Chibnall writes: \\"his treatment retained the essential structure of Lewis's novel with its strong narrative drive, but introduced some minor changes to characterisation and more fundamental alterations to narratology\\". As Ted Lewis had not specified where his novel was set, Hodges felt free to relocate the story to a place he was familiar with, considering Grimsby, Lowestoft, Hull and North Shields before deciding on Newcastle Upon Tyne. Hodges said he was influenced in his writing by the works of Raymond Chandler and Hollywood B-movies such as Kiss Me Deadly, because they showed \\"how to use the crime story as an autopsy on society's ills\\". He did not, however, employ a traditional noir technique of using a voiceover to expose the character's inner feelings. He also dispensed with flashbacks to Carter's youth featured in the novel which explored his relationship with his brother Frank, streamlining the plot to a linear narrative spanning a single weekend. As Chibnall writes The significance of the double-barrelled shotgun as Carter's choice of weapon (which in the novel symbolises family ties and Carter's memories of more innocent times hunting with his brother) was lost in the film adaptation. Carter's killing of BrumbyChibnall, 2003, p. 81 and his own assassination were further alterations from the novel, emphasising the film's parallels with revenge tragedy and Carter's role as what Geoff Mayer calls \\"the moral agent... a \\"knight\\" forced to dispense his own sense of justice in a corrupt world\\". However, in his DVD commentary Hodges implies that he did not see Carter as morally any more justified than those he kills, and his death is intended to present his actions to the audience as morally bankrupt and futile: \\"I wanted him to be dealt with in exactly the same way he dealt with other people. Now that's a sort of Christian ethic in a way [...] That was a prerequisite of the film for me, that the hitman should go [click] and that's it\\".Chibnall, 2003, p. 88 =Pre-production= Trinity Square car park, with Brumby's rooftop cafe, was demolished in 2010 Locations along the east coast of England had been scouted by Hodges and Klinger in the spring of 1970, to find a landscape that suggested a \\"hard, deprived background\\". Newcastle was selected after Hodge's first choice of Hull proved to be unsuitable. Hodges thoroughly researched the local Newcastle crime scene, adapting the script to make use of settings and incorporating elements of his research into the story. His background at World in Action had made him accustomed to making films based on hard investigation and this informed his approach to Get Carter. One of the first locations which attracted Hodge's attention was the Trinity Square multi-storey car park, which dominated the centre of Gateshead. To Hodges, the car park and the cast iron bridges over the Tyne, \\"seemed to capture the nature of Jack Carter himself\\". The car park symbolises one of the film's more subtle themes, which is the destruction of an old cityscape and its rebuilding in line with modern Brutalism. Hodges described how wandering alone through the upper structure, he realised how the different levels could be used to reveal the hunter, Carter, and the hunted, Brumby, simultaneously but without either being aware of the other ‚Äì adding to the suspense. The shopping centre and car park were closed in early 2008, and demolished in late 2010. Beechcroft, Broomside Lane, County Durham, the location of Cliff Brumby's house, awaiting demolition in 2007. Beechcroft stood derelict for many years and was finally demolished in December 2008, despite a campaign to preserve it as a tourist attraction. The location for Cyril Kinnear's house, Dryderdale Hall, near Hamsterley, Bishop Auckland, provided a real-life connection with organised crime. It was the recently-vacated country house of North East fruit machine businessman Vince Landa, who had fled the country in 1969 after the murder of his right-hand man Angus Sibbett, the so-called one- armed bandit murder. Many believed the crime was part of a failed attempt by the Kray twins to gain control of the Newcastle underworld. Michael Klinger and the MGM publicity spokesman dismissed the use of the location as mere coincidence; however, Hodges was aware of the significance of the house and chose it deliberately. Steve Chibnall writes \\"It proved a perfect location, wreaking of authenticity and full of useful details such as the cowboys and indians wallpaper...the African shield and crossed spears on the wall of the crime lord's living room\\". The Landa case also is referenced at the start of the film with a shot of a newspaper bearing the headline \\"Gaming Wars\\". Other locations in Newcastle and Gateshead, Northumberland and County Durham were also used. =Filming= Principal photography took place in the north east between 17 July and 15 September 1970. Hodges favoured the use of long focal length lenses (as he had used previously on Rumour) in many scenes to create a naturalistic documentary feel, especially in crowd scenes. The film was shot in \\"Metrocolor\\", which was MGM's trade name for films processed at its Eastmancolor laboratory. This lab processed Kodak's Eastman Color Negative, so it is most likely the film was shot on this stock. Asked to comment on what he was aiming for in the look of the film, cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky said \\"The camera work on it... it was very influenced by Mike Hodges who has a very good eye for setups and he of course conferred with his operator and myself, but he influenced all of us, and much of the good look is due to him, I confess. My main task was lighting on location, very moderately, and waiting for the right daylight and setting the exposure on the lens\\". In the first week of shooting in Newcastle, the ACTT called the crew out on a one-day strike. At the advice of Richard Lester, Hodges and his assistant director stayed at a separate hotel to the rest of the cast and crew, which enabled him to have some respite from the production after the shooting day was done. Klinger was present on set for much of the film shoot. However, Hodges said he encountered very little interference by the producer. At one point Klinger and Caine asked if Hodges might work in a \\"chase sequence\\", but he persuaded them that it would draw too many comparisons with Bullitt (a chase sequence between Carter and the London gangsters is mentioned in the shooting script).Chibnall, 2003, p. 80 Hodges tried to rehearse the racecourse scene between Caine and Hendry in their hotel the night before shooting, but \\"Hendry's drunken and resentful state forced Hodges to abandon [the] attempt\\" (Chibnall 2003).Chibnall, 2003, p. 56 Hodges described Caine as \\"a complete dream to work with\\". Caine only lost his temper once on set, during the very tense and emotional day filming in Glenda's flat, when the focus puller ruined his first take. Caine apologised immediately. The most complicated scene to shoot was Kinnear's game of cards. There are four simultaneous conversations, with a lot of plot exposition and the introduction of two important characters, Kinnear and Glenda. The technical complexity was compounded by the variation in light coming through the windows, and Osborne's whispered deliveryChibnall, p. 57 which made microphone placement difficult. Hodges moved the camera and the boom closer to Osborne as the scene progressed. Chibnall says that Hodges regretted not rehearsing the scene more thoroughly. Blackhall Beach near Hartlepool. Base of the North Side coal staithes, North Blyth, Northumberland. Carter chases Paice along these near the film's conclusion. The tops of the staithes as they appear in the film have been demolished so only the base of the structure remains In shooting the scene in which Carter throws Brumby to his death from the multi-storey car park, Hodges used four shots: one of the pair struggling high up on the stairs; one from the lowest level of the stairwell where Caine actually threw Bryan Moseley over the side onto mattresses; one shot of a dummy falling; and one of the body of Brumby on top of a crushed car. Carter's climactic pursuit of Eric used an amalgamation of two locations spaced apart: Blyth staithes and Blackhall Beach near Blackhall Colliery.\\"The 50 best beach scenes in the movies\\" , The Daily Telegraph, 23 August 2008 The chase scene was shot in reverse, with Hodges filming Eric's death scene first because of Hendry's poor condition, Hodges being worried that he would be too out of breath to play the death scene after running. Hodges chose the beach for its bleak, dark atmosphere but when he returned to shoot the scene he found it bathed in bright sunshine, unsuitable for the sombre conclusion he was hoping for. He waited hours until the sun began setting to capture the overcast shadowy lighting seen in the film.Chibnall, 2003, p. 86 The film shows the beach black with coal spoilings, dumped there by the mine's conveyor system. The conveyor, a common sight on the East Durham coast, was known locally as 'The Flight'. In the early 2000s, ¬£10 million was spent removing these conveyors and the concrete towers, and cleaning tons of coal waste from the beaches of East Durham. The cleaning programme was known as 'Turning the Tide'. =Post-production= Klinger was a very hands-on producer and was present during shooting and in post-production. He suggested Hodges use John Trumper as editor. Hodges said that he and Trumper argued and disagreed constantly, but he still thought he was a \\"brilliant, brilliant editor\\" and was \\"very grateful to him for ...how much he contributed\\". Sound editing and dubbing was done by Jim Atkinson, whom Hodges described as \\"so obsessive about the job\\". He gave Hodges multiple possibilities of how the sound could be dubbed, and explored every angle. Klinger was worried that the debut director might be overwhelmed with too many options, but Hodges said he and Atkinson got on very well. =Music= The majority of the music in the film was composed by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who had previously worked on soundtracks for Soldier Blue and Flight of the Doves. Budd composed 13 distinct pieces for the film, including three songs: \\"Looking For Someone\\", \\"Love Is A Four Letter Word\\" (with lyrics by Jack Fishman) and \\"Hallucinations\\". The theme (otherwise known as \\"Carter Takes a Train\\"), the best-known piece from the film, was played by Budd and the other members of his jazz trio, Jeff Clyne (double bass) and Chris Karan (percussion), and was recorded on a budget of ¬£450. The musicians recorded the soundtrack live, direct to picture, playing along with the film. To save time and money Budd did not use overdubs, simultaneously playing a real harpsichord, a Wurlitzer electric piano and a grand piano.Get Carter DVD, Warner Archive, 2000 Budd described the experience as \\"uncomfortable, but it sounded pleasant\\". The theme tune features the sounds of the character's train journey from London to Newcastle. The theme was released as a 7\\" vinyl single by Pye Records in 1971, titled simply Carter and backed with \\"Plaything\\", another piece composed for the soundtrack. Original copies of the record are much sought after by collectors and sell for around ¬£100. The soundtrack‚Äîincluding pieces not used in the film‚Äîwas originally only available in its entirety in Japan, where it was released on Odeon Records. It was released in the UK in 1998 by the Cinephile label, a subsidiary of Castle Communications. In 2012, the theme was included on the Soul Jazz Records compilation British TV, Film and Library Composers. The film includes other music which is not included on the soundtrack LP. The music playing in the nightclub scene is an uptempo cover of the 1969 Willie Mitchell tune \\"30-60-90\\" performed live by the Jack Hawkins Showband, which was the resident band at the Oxford Galleries night club. Hawkins' name can be seen on the poster outside the club before Thorpe runs inside, and the band can faintly be seen on stage as Thorpe enters the club. A version of the band's rendition was available on a live LP by Jack Hawkins, which was released under two titles, Psychedelic '70s and later as Everything Is Beautiful, The pub singer, played by Denea Wilde, performs a cover of How About You? by Burton Lane and Ralph Freed, a song more associated with glamorous Hollywood films than the backrooms of Newcastle pubs. The Pelaw Hussars, a local juvenile jazz band and majorette troupe, also appear and perform two numbers, When The Saints Go Marching In and Auld Lang Syne. Releases A London AEC Routemaster bus bearing promotional posters for Get Carter, 1971 The film's premiere was held in Los Angeles on 3 February 1971, with a preview held in New York on 3 March. The film finally opened for general release across the UK on 10 March 1971 and in the US on 18 March, where it was rated 'X' for violence and female nudity, meaning it was for adults only. It was later reclassified as 'R', meaning children under the age of 17 had to be accompanied by an adult. A censored edited version was released in West Germany on 6 August 1971, with a running time nine minutes shorter than the original. Michael Klinger was involved in promotion of the film in the UK, using the experience from his background as a distributor to conduct a strong advertising campaign. Teaser posters for the film appeared on the front of every London bus, with the tag-line 'Caine is Carter'. The original British quad poster with artwork by Arnaldo Putzu, in common with many film posters, has aspects or images that differ from the finished screen version. Carter is depicted wearing a gaudy floral jacket, as opposed to the dark raincoat and mohair suit he wears in the film. Asked in 2006, Putzu could not remember his artistic rationale for painting the floral jacket, but said he was painting a lot of flowers in designs at that time. Chibnall describes the flower power imagery as \\"what seems like a desperate and misguided attempt to suggest the hipness of a genre which had largely fallen out of favour\\".Chibnall, p. 90 However, movie poster expert Sim Branaghan liked its eccentricity, calling it was \\"that kind of quirkiness you wouldn't get these days\\". Jonny Trunk of Trunk Records‚Äîa long-time aficionado of the film and its history‚Äîhas observed that the floral pattern of Carter's jacket is taken from the distinctive pillow and matching sheet design from the bed in the scene where Britt Ekland writhes naked whilst on the phone to Jack. The poster also places Carter's shotgun in Eric's hands, and features a grappling man and woman who seem to belong to a different film.Chibnall, p. 133, footnote 1 Promotional shots and poster artwork exist from the film showing Carter holding a pump action shotgun; in the finished film the only shotgun used by Carter is a double-barrelled shotgun, which Carter finds on top of his brother Frank's wardrobe. MGM sold distribution rights to the film in the U.S. to its future subsidiary United Artists, which promoted it poorly, amidst worries the cockney dialogue in the opening scene would be unintelligible to U.S. audiences. The film's release was delayed while parts of the film were redubbed, with no great improvement. In the process of redubbing the opening, the version of the film with the original dialogue was lost. For years the version shown on British television was the redubbed American cut. UA placed the film on the declining drive-in movie circuit, where it played at the bottom of a double bill with Dirty Dingus Magee, a vehicle for Frank Sinatra. Michael Klinger complained in 1974 to president of UA Eric Pleskow about the lacklustre promotion of Carter, and tried to get him to relinquish the U.S. rights to the film so that Klinger could find a better distributor. The film did not encounter many censorship problems, although the scene where Carter knifes Albert Swift caused concern for the censor John Trevelyan.Chibnall, 2003, p. 76 In South Africa the censor cut out Britt Ekland's phone sex scene, shortening her already brief role; her name was still left on the poster, leaving filmgoers to wonder why she was advertised as appearing.Chibnall, p. 61 A resurgence of critical and public interest in the film in the 1990s led to the British Film Institute releasing a new print of the film in 1999. It worked with Hodges to restore the film, with Hodges sourcing another set of negatives of the original opening, which were found in the archives of the BBC. The team then spliced the beginning segment onto a high-quality print of the film. The reissue premiered at the National Film Theatre and went on general release on 11 June 1999, showing at the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle. It was also re-released in Germany and Greece in 2000 and in France in 2004. =Home media= Chibnall has established that the film was shown on LWT in 1976 and 1980 \\"in a bowdlerised version\\" (which edited out Britt Ekland's phone sex scene) and once on Westward Television, but it was not shown nationally and in its entirety until a post-watershed BBC broadcast in 1986.Chibnall, p. 99 It was finally released on home media in 1993 by MGM/UA as part of its \\"Elite Collection\\". Chibnall says \\"There was no advertising to suggest a significant event had occurred. It was simply a part of the long process of exploiting MGM's back catalogue in the run-up to Christmas\\". Despite this, the release was given a five-star review in Empire, where it was described as \\"one of the best British films of the 70s\\". Chibnall notes \\"it did not, however, find a place in Empires top fifty videos of the year\\". Warner Bros. reissued the film in a special edition on DVD in October 2000 in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Extras included three trailers; the international trailer, an introduction by Michael Caine to the people of Newcastle, and a third featuring Roy Budd playing the opening theme.This format was also used in a VHS set released by Warner Brothers, copyrighted 2001, which included Bullit and Shaft. Also included on the DVD was commentary from Caine, Hodges and Suschitzky, constructed from separate interviews with the three. The soundtrack was presented in 1.0 mono Dolby Digital The film was bundled in the 2008 \\"Movies That Matter ‚Äì 70's Classics\\" DVD set with Deliverance and Dog Day Afternoon. It is available from the Warner Archive Collection as a Made on Demand (MOD) DVD-R or a download, with the same extras as the 2000 release, although with only two trailers and this time in 16:9 ratio. Reception =Critical response= Screenshot from trailer for Get Carter (1971) Describing the initial critical response to the film, Steve Chibnall wrote \\"Initial critical vilification or indifference establishes the conditions in which a cult can flourish. Get Carter had to make do with ambivalence\\".Chibnall, p. 91 He thought the general stance of British critics \\"was to admire the film's power and professionalism while condemning its amorality and excessive violence\\".Chibnall, p. 92 Geoff Mayer observed that \\"Mainstream critics at the time were dismayed by the film's complex plotting and Carter's lack of remorse\\". In Sight and Sound, Tom Milne said the film was well-constructed and had good characterisation, but lacked the mystery and charisma of the earlier American crime films it attempted to emulate. He found Carter's motivations were inconsistent, either being an avenging angel or an \\"authentic post-permissive anti-hero, revelling in the casual sadism\\". In contrast, Nigel Andrews found the characters to be clich√©d archetypes of the criminal underworld, such as the \\"homosexual chauffeur, bloated tycoon, glamorous mistress\\", describing the film as \\"perfunctory\\". Richard Weaver in Films and Filming praised the realism of the film, describing it as \\"crime at its most blatant\\", while George Melly writing in The Observer confessed to vicarious enjoyment of it, but admitted it was \\"like a bottle of neat gin swallowed before breakfast. It's intoxicating all right, but it'll do you no good\\". Steve Chibnall writes that \\"America was rather more used to hard-boiled storytelling\\" and that reviewers there were \\"more prepared than British criticism to treat Get Carter as a serious work\\",Chibnall, p. 93 Pauline Kael admiring its \\"calculated soullessness\\" and wondering if it signalled a \\"new genre of virtuoso viciousness\\". US publication Box Office gave a cautiously approving review, describing the film as \\"nasty, violent and sexy all at once\\". It predicted that \\"It should please in the action market, but won't win any laurels for Caine although his portrayal of the vicious anti-hero impresses\\". The reviewer also opined that \\"Tighter editing would help considerably\\". Roger Ebert was less reserved in his praise, writing that \\"the movie has a sure touch\\". He noted the \\"proletarian detail\\" of the film which is \\"unusual in a British detective movie. Usually we get all flash and no humanity, lots of fancy camera tricks but no feel for the criminal strata of society\\". Of Caine's performance he wrote, \\"The character created by Caine is particularly interesting. He's tough and ruthless, but very quiet and charged with a terrible irony\\". Judith Crist in New York magazine gave a glowing review, saying \\"Michael Caine is superb, suave and sexy\\" and describing the film as \\"a hard, mean and satisfying zinger of the old tough-tec school done in frank contemporary terms\\". Variety also praised the film, saying it \\"not only maintains interest but conveys with rare artistry, restraint and clarity the many brutal, sordid and gamy plot turns\\". However, Jay Cocks writing in Time was disparaging, calling the film \\"a doggedly nasty piece of business\\" and comparing it unfavourably to Point Blank. The film appeared on several US critics' lists of best films of the year. In Michael Klinger's The Guardian obituary in 1989, Derek Malcolm remembered the film as \\"one of the most formidable British thrillers of its time\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 32 reviews. On IMDb Get Carter's average rating is 7.6 based on 12,329 user votes. In 2003 Steve Chibnall observed a large gender imbalance in voting on the film up to April 2002, with less than 6% of votes cast (where the voters gave their gender) by women (53 out of 947). He also noticed a substantial increase in women voting on the film in the eight months leading up to April 2002. However, although by 2012 the number of votes cast had increased tenfold, the ratio of female to male voters had not changed greatly, falling slightly from 2002, dropping to nearly 5% (526 out of 9566 voters who gave their gender were women). =Box office= Get Carter was a financial success, and according to Steve Chibnall its box office takings were \\"very respectable\\". On its opening week at ABC2 cinema at Shaftesbury Avenue, London, it broke the house record, taking ¬£8,188. It out- performed Up Pompeii, which was showing in the larger ABC1. It also performed strongly when moved to the ABCs in Edgware and Fulham Road. On its general release in the North of England, Chibnall notes it had a \\"very strong first week\\", before an unseasonal heatwave damaged cinema attendance. Chibnall writes that \\"Interestingly, although [the film's] downbeat and unsentimental tone is now thought to express the mood of its times, the mass cinema audience preferred Love Story (Arthur Hiller 1970), which remained the most popular film in Britain throughout Get Carter's run\\". It was the sixth-most popular \\"general release\\" movie at the British box office in 1971.Peter Waymark. \\"Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas\\". Times [London, England] 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012. =Accolades= At the time of its release, the only recognition the film received was a 1972 BAFTA Awards nomination for Ian Hendry as Best Supporting Actor. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time. In 2008 the film was placed at 225 on Empires 500 Best Movies of All Time list, which was selected by over 10,000 Empire readers, 150 filmmakers and 50 film critics. In October 2010 the critics from The Guardian newspaper placed the film on their list of \\"Greatest Films of All Time\\", placing it at number 7 in the 25 greatest crime films. In the accompanying poll conducted amongst Guardian readers, it was voted fifth. In 2011 Time Out London placed the film at 32 in its 100 Best British Films list, which was selected by a panel of 150 film industry experts. Remakes Warner Bros., now in possession of the pre-1986 MGM library, decided to produce a remake in 2000 under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter. As with Hit Man, the film credited Ted Lewis's Jack's Return Home as its source, not Hodges' film, and again it contains scenes which are directly borrowed from the original, such as the opening train ride. Michael Caine appears as Cliff Brumby in what Elvis Mitchell described as \\"a role that will increase regard for the original\\", speculating that \\"maybe that was his intention\\". Mickey Rourke plays the villain Cyrus Paice. The remake was compared unfavourably to the original by the majority of reviewers. The consensus opinion of critics on Rotten Tomatoes was that it was \\"a remake that doesn't approach the standard of the original, Get Carter will likely leave viewers confused and unsatisfied. Also, reviews are mixed concerning Stallone's acting\\". It was so badly received on its US release that Warner Bros. decided not to give it a UK theatrical release, anticipating the film would be savaged by British critics and fans. Elvis Mitchell in The New York Times wrote \\"it's so minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world's first movie without even a text\\". Mike Hodges said in 2003 he had still not seen the remake, but was informed by a friend that it was \\"unspeakable\\". His son brought him a DVD of the film back from Hong Kong and he tried to watch it, but the region format was incompatible \\"so we put it in the dustbin\\". The film was voted the worst remake of all time in 2004 by users of British DVD rental website ScreenSelect (precursor of Lovefilm). Another film based on Lewis's book, Hit Man, directed by George Armitage and starring Bernie Casey and Pam Grier, was released in 1972, taking some plot details and treatments, such as a sniper shooting Carter on a rocky beach, from Hodges' film. Legacy Tom Cox writes that many British film makers \\"have stolen from Hodges without matching the cold, realistic kick\\" of Carter. Films such as The Long Good Friday, Face and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels borrow from the Carter blueprint. Steven Soderbergh's 1999 film The Limey is a homage to Carter and other British gangster films, and contains similar plot elements and themes of revenge, family and corruption. Soderbergh said he envisioned The Limey as \\"Get Carter made by Alain Resnais\\". Shane Meadows' film Dead Man's Shoes has also drawn comparisons to Get Carter, being similarly a revenge gangster story set around a provincial English town. The behind-the-scenes featurettes accompanying the DVDs of Life on Mars repeatedly cite Get Carter. The series' set designers and property masters state that, while the audience and critics may liken the series to The Sweeney, Get Carter was their visual guide and the source of series' look. The film's music also enjoyed its own resurgence in popularity, as it tapped into a 1990s interest in vintage film soundtracks. Portishead's Adrian Utley explained that they found the music to Get Carter inspiring as \\"it was done quickly and cheaply with only a few instruments, and it had to be intensely creative to disguise its limitations\\". The Human League album Dare contains a track covering the Get Carter theme, although it was only a version of the sparse leitmotif that opens and closes the film as opposed to the full- blooded jazz piece that accompanies the train journey. Stereolab also covers Roy Budd's theme on their album Aluminum Tunes, although they call their version \\"Get Carter\\", as opposed to its proper title, \\"Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)\\". This Stereolab version was subsequently used as a sample in the song \\"Got Carter\\" by 76. The Finnish rock band Laika & the Cosmonauts cover the film's theme on their 1995 album The Amazing Colossal Band. BB Davis & the Red Orchidstra released a version of the film's title theme in 1999. Jah Wobble produced a dub cover version of the theme tune in 2009. Wobble had long been a fan of the bassline of the track, saying in a 2004 interview with The Independent that \\"There are some bass lines that contain the whole mystery of creation within them\\".

On 1 January 2006, Rochefort had a total population of 12,038. The total area is 165.27 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 73 inhabitants per km¬≤. It was a resort in the 19th century. The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Rochefort proper, Ave-et-Auffe, Buissonville, √âprave, Han-sur-Lesse, Jemelle, Lavaux-Sainte-Anne, Lessive, Mont-Gauthier, Villers-sur-Lesse, and Wavreille. Its ancient position at the crossroads where the route to Saint-Hubert crossed that from Li√®ge to Bouillon required fortifying: the ruins of the old castle, which gave the place its name and a title to a long line of counts who had the right of coining their own money, still exist. This castle underwent many sieges and suffered at the hands of Marshal de Ch√¢tillon (1636). Near Rochefort are the red marble quarries of St. Remy, and Rochefort Abbey, a Trappist monastery, which operates the Rochefort Brewery, known for brewing dark and sweet beers, especially the Rochefort 10, a deep dark-brown rich and fruity beer. The town was the site of the Battle of Bure during the Second World War. Caves Rochefort is well known for its caves. The Grotto of Rochefort, within the town, contains six chambers, the largest and highest of which was called the Sabbat (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911). It was swept clear of its prehistoric remains before electric lighting was installed. The cave has recently been given the Christian name of \\"Lorette\\" after a nearby chapel of Our Lady of Loreto. The more famous local caves are at Han-sur-Lesse, one of Rochefort's constituent towns, where the Lesse River disappears at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux and passes by subterranean passages under the hill called Boeme or Boine. The endeavour to trace the course of the river led to the discovery of the grottoes, which consist of fifteen separate connected \\"halls\\" that emerge in a bay of the river from a dark and extensive cavern forming a sort of side creek or bay. Except in flood-time, when the exit has to be used, the entrance is near the point where the river disappears at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux, and the exit is made by boat from the cavern last described, which leads out to the open river. A beautiful effect for tourists in boats is afforded by emerging from the complete darkness of this cavern into the light. The finest stalactites are in the three halls called the Mysterieuses, the Vigneron and the Draperies where is \\" the tomb\\", which looks as if chiseled out of white marble. The central hall called the Salle d'Armes (\\"the Armory\\") is immense, and one of the river channels flows through it. Twin cities Rochefort is twinned with the city of Broussard, Louisiana.
