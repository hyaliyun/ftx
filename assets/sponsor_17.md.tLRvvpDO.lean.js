The ministry commands the police force, also known locally as militsiya, directly and thus policemen carry the insignia of the ministry (ИИМ). This structure of law enforcement is similar to its predecessors and many other post-Soviet states. The ministry is subdivided into numerous departments that tackle the different aspects of law enforcement in the Kyrgyz Republic and is also supported simultaneously by other governmental agencies. The police is contactable via the emergency hotline number 102. History Before Kyrgyzstan's independence, the main law enforcement agencies in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic were the KGB's Kirghiz branch and the Committee for State Security of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic. Both were however dissolved after the independence of Kyrgyzstan, with the then newly formed Ministry of Internal Affairs taking over the responsibilities. Since its independence, the republic has been rocked by several revolutions, terror incidents and international cross border standoffs which has put pressure on the law enforcement agencies in maintaining public security as well as law and order in the absence of proper governance. In addition, highly institutionalised corruption and traditional practices such as Ala kachuu (bride kidnapping) has further exacerbated the problems and have caused mounting criticisms by the public on the republic's law enforcement agencies, to which years of newly elected government have tried but with limited success in attempting to reform the law enforcement agencies and its institutions. For example, in recent times, the government has been reviewing the changing of the name of the force from militsiya (Милиция) to police (Полиция), so as to encourage an increase in police interaction with the general public and consequently gain the public's confidence in the force. Nonetheless the republic has with its Soviet predecessor set aside days to celebrate the contributions of law enforcement personnel, past and present. The first of November is set aside as the professional Day of Police which also commemorates the founding of the predecessor of the current Kyrgyz police in 1924. Other dates set aside include the 28 of May for Border Guard Day. Local agencies Troops of the Kyrgyz internal ministry during a rehearsal for a Victory Day parade in Bishkek There are several agencies like the Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety (traffic police), Service for Combating Drug Trafficking (counter narcotics force) and Specialised State Security Service (counter-terrorism force) that are departments under the direct command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Whilst other agencies work separately but alongside the internal ministry, and are known as State Committees or Public Service Departments. Several of these agencies are: State Committee * State Committee for National Security, responsible for intelligence on counter terrorism and organised crime Public Service Departments * State Border Guard Service, responsible for border security and immigration * State Customs Service, responsible for customs and excise * State Forensic Experts Service, responsible for forensics * State Penitentiary Service, responsible for the upkeep of prisons * State Service for Combating Economic Crimes, responsible for tackling economic crimes International agencies The Ministry of Internal Affairs has forged relationships with several international policing organisations, these include Interpol and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. These organisations have assisted and likewise received assistance from the republic in tackling international crimes related to drug trafficking and organised crime. Several international agencies have also been invited by the Kyrgyz Republic in helping to reform and improve the efficiency of the police, although they do not have the right to exercise law enforcement powers. An example would be the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe which has developed the Community Security Initiative programme.

Early life John Walz was born 31 August 1844 in Württemberg, Germany to John and Elizabeth Walz. When Walz was thirteen or fourteen, he immigrated to the United States. His parents had died, and he went to Philadelphia to live with his married sister. There, he worked for eight years as a stonecutter, saving money to return to Europe for his education. Walz studied sculpting in Paris under the direction of Aimé Millet and in Vienna under the direction of Viktor Oskar Tilgner. In 1885, Walz returned to the United States. Life in Savannah Statues commissioned for the Telfair Academy Carl Ludwig Brandt, the director of the Savannah, Georgia Telfair Academy, commissioned Walz's employer to create the statues that stand in front of the Academy. In 1886, Walz accompanied the statues to Savannah. He fell in love with the city, deciding to stay and open his own studio. Walz became a popular choice for creating gravesite monuments, creating over 70 monuments within Bonaventure Cemetery. Walz's works can also be found in Laurel Grove Cemetery and the city's Catholic Cemetery. Gracie Watson Monument of Gracie Watson, created by Walz One of his most famous works is the monument he created for Gracie Watson. Gracie Watson was the only daughter of W. J. Watson and his wife, Frances. Gracie became ill with pneumonia and died in 1889 at age six. The year after her death, W. J. Watson took a photograph of Gracie to Walz, requesting a memorial to her. Walz sculpted a lifelike monument of a pensive Gracie lost in thought. Gracie's grave has been called \\"one of the most visited sites in Bonaventure Cemetery.\\" Gracie's monument is also one of the only funerary monuments in Georgia sculpted in someone's exact likeness. Death Walz died in 1922, and was interred at Bonaventure Cemetery. Surprisingly for his profession of creating gravesite memorials, Walz's grave was not initially marked by a memorial. A simple wooden sign indicated his grave until the Bonaventure Historical Society commissioned a monument for it. Legacy In 2012, the Bonaventure Historical Society held a rededication ceremony for the John Walz Memorial Garden. The Memorial Garden contains a variety of over 80 plants. Bonaventure Cemetery also has a street named Walz Way in honor of him. Walz has been called a sculptor of \\"transcendent local importance.\\" Personal life Walz married Sarah Gilmore in 1907 at the age of 63.

It was developed and published by French company Titus Interactive, which acquired the rights to a RoboCop video game in 1999. After several schedule changes, the game was released in 2003 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, with the European versions distributed through Avalon Interactive. A GameCube version was released in Japan in 2004, under the title RoboCop: Aratanaru Kiki (English: RoboCop: New Crisis). According to Metacritic, the Xbox version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews. Gameplay RoboCop is a first- person shooter based on the RoboCop films. In the game, RoboCop, a cyborg police officer in Neo Detroit, is tasked with finding the people responsible for the spread of a new designer drug known as Brain Drain. Simultaneously, RoboCop is tasked with investigating connections between a mayoral candidate, Omni Consumer Products (the creator of RoboCop), and Brain Drain. The game features nine large levels, each one divided into several sections. The player's progress is saved after the completion of each level. If the player is killed, then the level is restarted from the beginning. Each level consists of one primary objective and several secondary and bonus objectives. The player must complete the primary objective to advance through the game, while the other objectives add to the player's final score. RoboCop can use several weapons against enemies, including a pistol, a machine gun, a grenade launcher, and a missile launcher. RoboCop can also rescue civilians being held as hostages and can arrest enemies who surrender. Development and release In June 1999, French company Titus Software had acquired the rights for a RoboCop video game, with a release expected for late 2000. The license included the rights to develop it on all gaming systems, including Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 (PS2). Xatrix was expected to develop the game, which would be a first-person shooter. By April 2001, Infogrames was brought on as the developer of a PS2 version, expected for release in November 2001. Titus Interactive Studio ultimately became the developer. By May 2002, the PS2 version remained in development and was known as RoboCop: The Future of Law Enforcement, with an expected release that October. The game would include an original story based on the RoboCop films. In November 2002, Titus announced that the game would be released for the Xbox in February 2003. By the following month, the Xbox version had been scheduled for release in April 2003. For the United States, the PS2 version and a GameCube version were cancelled so Titus could focus on the Xbox version. In Germany, Titus published RoboCop for Microsoft Windows on April 25, 2003. Titus Software Corporation published the US Xbox version in July 2003. That month, the PS2 version was released in Japan, followed by a UK release. Titus later released a GameCube version in Japan on March 4, 2004, under the title RoboCop: Aratanaru Kiki (translated as RoboCop: New Crisis in English). Reception The Xbox version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Xbox game was particularly criticized for its lack of an in-level save option. The Swedish magazine Gamereactor called the Xbox version \\"the worst videogame since Superman 64\\" (also from Titus Software). Alex Navarro of GameSpot criticized the sound and graphics, and stated that despite the game's lengthy development period, it \\"has a bevy of horrible problems that render the game practically unplayable.\\" Navarro criticized the game's difficulty, slow player movements, a poor targeting system, poor controls, and the abundance of enemies, as well as the lack of objects to hide behind. Navarro further noted the limited amount of player ammo and the large amount of ammo needed to kill each enemy. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame noted the \\"realistic, gritty environment that offers some limited interaction\\" and stated that \\"the look and feel\\" of the RoboCop films \\"are well captured.\\" However, he criticized the slow cursor-based targeting system, stating that while it works in the RoboCop films \\"for dramatic effect\\", it \\"is downright dangerous in a game\\" with an abundance of enemy gunfire. Marriott also criticized the repetitive music and noted RoboCop's slow movements as being realistic to the films but frustrating to play. Ben Lawrence of Official Xbox Magazine criticized the game as repetitive and frustrating, and noted the limited weapons and their ineffectiveness against enemies. Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the Xbox version for its graphics, repetitive mission objectives, and poor artificial intelligence. Game Informer noted that the game included authentic elements from the films but that such details did not improve the gameplay, stating that the game \\"pretty much fails on every conceivable front and can't hold a candle to 99 percent of the games currently in the Xbox library.\\" TeamXbox considered the game repetitive and its storyline \\"rather uninteresting,\\" and noted that the graphics and sound were average. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of 26 out of 40.

His efforts to develop a compensatory education program in New York City served as a predecessor to the national Head Start program. He developed early intervention programs with what he called a \\"therapeutic curriculum\\", which aimed to specifically address the deficient experiences of children living in deprived environments. He believed that such environments put children at a disadvantage with respect to beginning school and acquiring basic literacy skills. Biography Born in New York City, Deutsch was educated at Columbia University (B.A., 1943; M.A., 1947; Ph.D., 1951). In 1958, he and his wife founded the Institute for Developmental Studies at New York University, where he became a professor in 1960. He remained director of the Institute for Developmental Studies for the rest of his career. He was the president of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues in 1969. He died of renal failure on June 26, 2002 at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut. Research In 1962, Deutsch began a pilot early childhood education program in Harlem for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds. In the program, Deutsch aimed to give children early exposures to experiences in which they had been lacking, such as music and books. In the short term, the program aimed to equip children with the skills they would need for formal education; in the long term, it was intended to improve participants' communication and learning skills, thereby benefiting them in adult life. A 1964 article in Life described the program as \\"the first scientific and concerted attempt by any public school system to confront the problem of educating poor preschool children. Criticism of hereditarianism Deutsch was an early critic of Arthur Jensen's controversial essay How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?, published in the Harvard Educational Review in 1969. In a subsequent issue of the same journal, Deutsch criticized Jensen's essay for allegedly supporting racism, and claimed that the essay contained \\"many erroneous statements, misinterpretations, and misunderstandings\\". In 1973, he debated Richard Herrnstein over the relative importance of genetics and environment in determining human intelligence. The debate was held at the Carnegie Center in Manhattan and sponsored by the magazine Social Policy.

She is currently the Pevsner Chair of the History of Art at Birkbeck, University of London. Nead's work studies British art, media, culture and often focuses on gender. Nead is a fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society and of the Academia Europaea.  Biography  Nead was elected as a fellow of the British Academy in 2018. She is a professor at Birkbeck, University of London, where she is the Pevsner Professor of the History of Art. She is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and of the Academia Europaea.  Work  Marcia Pointon, in Art History, writes that Nead's analysis of women in Victorian imagery in her book, Myths of Sexuality: Representations of Women in Victorian Britain (1988), is based on the idea that sexuality and power are related to one another. Nead discusses a feminist history of the female nude in her book, The Female Nude (1992). Her survey covers representations of the female nude from Ancient Greece to the present. In her exploration of the subject, she also included studies on \\"vaginal imagery,\\" \\"video pornography,\\" and \\"visibility and the female body.\\" In her book, she discusses the history of the female nude and how to decide where to draw the line between pornography and art. She also talks about how traditionally, the female nude \\"signifies the containment and disciplining of unruly female matter (and sexuality),\\" and also, how in a Kantian fashion, women's bodies represent a challenge of converting a troublesome nature into \\"pure art.\\" Nead also discusses how feminist artists have resisted these traditions in various different ways. She further explores the use of women's bodies in art in her book about Chila Burman's work, Chila Kumari Burman: Beyond Two Cultures (1995). In the art history book, Victorian Babylon (2000), Nead examines the gendered lives of people living in Victorian Era London between 1855 and 1870. Nead details different ways of living in urban London of the Victorian Era, looking at architecture and public spaces. She also examines maps, paintings, woodcuts and illustrations in the book. One chapter is devoted to maps of the sewer systems of London, for example, and how accurate maps helped create many of London's improvements. The Canadian Journal of History wrote that what Victorian Babylon \\"does best is to show how artists, cartoonists, illustrators represented\\" Victorian behavior. Art Journal describes her book as not only looking at behavior through art, but how things and people \\"circulate\\" throughout London during this time period. Art Journal also notes how Nead challenges the idea that women were \\"invisible\\" in Victorian England. Nead's book, The Haunted Gallery: Painting, Photography, Film c. 1900 (2007), examines film in Britain in the early twentieth century. The book covers not just the art of film, but how the moving picture helped shape society's perceptions of topics as diverse as sexual imagery to astronomy. The book itself contains a \\"wealth of beautiful illustrations\\" which help explain the various topics she explores. In 2015, Nead curated an exhibit at the Foundling Museum, called \\"The Fallen Woman.\\" The exhibit focused on the Victorian trope of the \\"fallen woman\\" who face difficult, morally ambiguous choices in society. Many of the \\"fallen women\\" were unmarried, single mothers who were often forced to give up their children to Foundling hospitals. Nead collected stories and art to create the exhibit. Nead's 2017 work, The Tiger in the Smoke, she explores post-World War II London in conjunction with an event that took place in December 1952, where Londoners were subjected to a \\"horrendous\\" five day long fog that kept thousands inside. Nead discusses art, media and history through this context.

In 1611 he became first a surveyor in Brussels, and then towards the end of the year one of the four secretaries to Antwerp city council. From 1617 to 1624 he served as pensionary to the city of Antwerp. He supported Anne of Saint Bartholomew's foundation of a Carmelite convent in Antwerp in 1612, and from 1610 to 1615 was lay leader of the city's Confraternity of the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

In 1629 he was transferred to the Council of the Admiralty in Brussels. He became a member of the Brussels Privy Council in 1631. He held an appointment as a councillor on the Supreme Council of Flanders in Madrid from 1633 to 1645, but was largely absent from Spain on royal business after the first year, during which he became a knight of Christ. In 1634 he accompanied Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria on his march through Germany, liaising with imperial forces and negotiating with the Emperor Ferdinand II's representatives at Regensburg. He was thereafter based in Brussels, giving significant support to the president of the Privy Council, Pierre Roose. He was appointed a councillor of state in 1641.

It occurs on shallow reefs in the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of California, Central America and South America as far south as Ecuador. Taxonomy This sea urchin was first described in 1867 by the American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill who gave it the name Psammechinus pictus. It was later transferred to the genus Lytechinus and became Lytechinus pictus. In 1912, another species Lytechinus anamesus was described by American zoologist Hubert Lyman Clark as Lytechinus anamesus. He was the curator of echinoderms at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University at the time. It had long been suspected that L. pictus and L. anamesus were synonymous, and this was confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA in 2004. Description The test of this sea urchin is up to in diameter. The general colour is greyish or pale straw brown, sometimes with a pinkish flush. The spines are robust, short and blunt, the basal half of each spine usually being white while the rest of the spine varies in colour. Juvenile urchins sometimes have banded spines. Distribution and habitat L. pictus is found in the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean at depths down to about . Its range extends from central California southwards to Ecuador. In California it tends to inhabit the middle and lower intertidal zone but in the northern part of the Gulf of California it mainly inhabits the subtidal zone. These sea urchins tend to form dense aggregations at the edge of, or inside, the kelp beds that line this coast. At San Onofre, California in 1978–79, the density of individuals close to the kelp beds was recorded at 80 per square metre while inside the kelp bed it was 40. At Anacapa Island, California, the highest densities (36 per sq.m.) were found in barren areas with coralline algae near the kelp beds. Ecology This sea urchin tends to be more active at night. During the day it may semi-bury itself in sand, and it sometimes disguises itself with fragments of shell and gravel held in place by its tube feet. It feeds on kelp, particularly Macrocystis, Gigartina and Laminaria, but primarily grazes on young stages rather than fully-grown fronds. In the California kelp forests, the painted urchin is preyed on by the bat star (Patiria miniata).

Background  Talking about her character in 2nd Half, Priyanka Upendra was quoted saying \\"The movie's content is such that it talks about the khakhi profession and highlights how juniors are treated insignificantly by seniors. It becomes very difficult to make yourself ‘heard'.\\" While explaining her interest to be part of new age cinema, she continues \\"It's easy to do the tried-and tested methods. But it’s hard to take the road less taken. The same applies for films and directors. One such is Yogi Devagange, a director who is open to taking risks. Which is why I like associating with him on work. Such roles, for me as an actor, are challenging. For example, when I first heard the story of 2nd Half, I felt that it was a story that would definitely work,\\" It also marks the entry of actor Upendra's nephew Niranjan into the Kannada film industry, on choosing 2nd half as a debut, he says \\"Since I've grown up being interested in theatre, I've closely observed my Uncle and his acting style.

I wanted to hone my skills, come in as a complete package and become a director's actor. But when 2nd Half happened, I realised that it was the right film to debut with,\\" says Niranjan, who consulted his uncle before taking the plunge into the industry. \\" He felt that I shouldn't miss an opportunity that came knocking at his door. His words made me realise that it's okay to start small and scale up,\\"  Plot  The story talks about the life of a women police constable Anuradha (Priyanka Upendra) who assigned to the police CCTV control room. On her job, she gets intrigued by the life of a young girl, Saranya (Surabhi Santosh) who is a free-spirited artist. In her newfound interest in spotting this girl on CCTV, she witnesses the girl go missing one day through the CCTV which abruptly ends when the camera stops working.

Clayton was an author of several letters to the Delaware County Republican newspaper based on his travels throughout Europe, Asia and Africa which were turned into a book. He was the brother of Arkansas Governor and U.S. Senator Powell Clayton, U.S. Attorney W.H.H. Clayton and U.S. Congressman elect John Middleton Clayton. Early life and education Clayton was born in Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, to John and Ann Glover Clayton. The Clayton family was descended from early Quaker settlers of Pennsylvania. Clayton's ancestor William Clayton emigrated from Chichester, England, was a personal friend of William Penn, one of nine justices who sat at the Upland Court in 1681, and a member of Penn's Council. Clayton studied law under Daniel M. Bates, the Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery and under Edward Darlington who became a U.S. Congressman for Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional district. He was admitted to the Delaware County bar in 1851 and to the Philadelphia bar in 1852. Career Clayton practiced law mainly in Philadelphia but lived in Delaware County in Thurlow which is now a part of the city of Chester. He was a skilled politician who never held office until being elected judge and built up a strong political machine in Delaware County. In 1856, Clayton was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor James Pollock as a member of his personal staff with the rank of Colonel. In 1868, he traveled to Europe and contributed a series of letter to the Delaware County Republican newspaper which were subsequently published in a book titled \\"Rambles and Reflections\\". Pennsylvania amended the state constitution in 1852 changing the position of President Judge from an appointed one to an elected position. In 1874, Governor John F. Hartranft appointed Judge John Martin Broomall to the interim position of President Judge for the newly created Thirty-Second Judicial District. However, Clayton defeated Broomall in the election for President Judge of the Thirty-Second Judicial District on an independent ticket which had support from the Democratic Party against Broomall who was the nominee of the Republican Party. He was re-elected on the Republican Party ticket after his first ten year term was completed in 1884 and again in 1894. He served until his death in 1900. During his career, Clayton faced accusations of fraudulent election practices and the use of liquor licenses for political leverage. Bibliography *Clayton, Thomas Jefferson, Rambles and Reflections, Press of the Delaware County Republican, Chester, Pennsylvania, 1892. Personal life In 1854, Clayton married Sarah J. McCay and together they had four children. Clayton is interred at the Chester-Bethel Church cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware. Legacy The Clayton School on 7th and Harwick Street in Chester, Pennsylvania was named in honor of Clayton. In 1920, the Reverend Augustine L.

Two Englishmen, Daniel Stuart and Joseph Cooper, founded the newspaper and also set up the Chronicle Printing Press. A large portion of the newspaper was dedicated to advertisements, and therefore was also called the 'General Advertiser'.  Newspaper History  Stuart and Cooper started printing the Calcutta Chronicle and General Advertiser on January 26, 1786, in Calcutta after arriving from England. At that time, another newspaper, Hicky's Bengal Gazette, had already been established and several other newspapers were also coming into play. Six years after Hicky's Bengal Gazette was established, four weekly newspapers (including The Calcutta Chronicle and General Advertiser) and one monthly magazine were being published in Calcutta.https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1955_7/9/the_story_of_the_indian_press.pdf The proprietor of the newspaper, William Baillie, had come to India as a cadet in the Bengal Infantry in 1777. The printing took place in the Chronicle Printing Press which was situated in Council House Street. = Notable Announcements = The Calcutta Chronicle and General Advertiser contained the first announcement of Thomas Daniell's \\"Views in Calcutta\\", a rare set of twelve etched and aquatinted views of Calcutta. The July 17, 1786, issue of the Calcutta Chronicle announced Daniell's intention to publish a set of views of the city. Daniell, along with his nephew William, was likely teaching himself the new art of aquatint engraving when he undertook these views, which were hand coloured by local artists under his supervision. This announcement came only a few months after the Daniells reached India. = Suppression = The newspaper was published for four years until 1790 when the East India Company withdrew its license. The company stated that the newspaper violated press rules and that the \\"contents of the Calcutta Chronicle having been for sometime past highly disrespectful to the government\\".  Form and Content  Readership of the newspaper spread from Calcutta to parts of India as far as Madras (present Chennai). The circulation was carried out through free postage facilities. During the colonial period, most newspapers collected subscription fees on a half yearly basis, with the exception of the Calcutta Chronicle. However, after 31 January 1788, when the British government ordered \\"equalized\\" charges for all newspapers—making it costlier for subscribers—Stuart and Cooper had to introduce the six month charge. This started from the third volume of the newspaper, which had articles concerning the British Senate, East India Company, and its activities. In addition, marriages, births, and deaths were listed in alphabetical order. A separate column included information regarding the military register. The transfer of every soldier from one battalion to another was reported and also mentioned were places to which several military troops were marching. Most of the news concerned the British people.

It is very similar to the Protection and Guard Service of Romania. The service's motto is Honor et Fides (Honor and Faith). History The initially entitled Presidential Guard Service was created by order of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur on 27 January 1992. It was organized as an independent sub-unit of the Ministry of National Security (now the Information and Security Service), being directly subordinated to the President of Moldova. On 6 May 1994, the Presidential Guard Service was renamed the Security Service of the President of Moldova before adopting its current name on 28 January 1998. One month later, on 26 February 1998, the service came under the direct control of government. It would serve as a government agency until June 2008 when it was subordinated again to the president.

Vierling was an important inventor and engineer of electronic and electro- acoustic instruments between the 1930s and 1950s. Life Electro chord in the Deutsches Museum, Munich Oskar Vierling attended school in Regensburg, and graduated with the Obersekundareife. In 1925 he graduated as an engineer at the Technische Hochschule Nürnberg in Nuremberg in Nuremberg, and later attending the Telegrafen technische Reichsamt in Berlin. Vierling then took a position at the Heinrich Hertz Institute. Fritz Sennheiser was his student and joined him in the founding of the high-frequency institute of the University of Hannover. Vierling was married and had two sons. The children took over the kind of Vierling Group. Career Testing and measuring technology production of the Vierling Group in Ebermannstadt (early 1960s). In 1929, Vierling along with Walther Nernst, created the Neo-Bechstein Electric Grand piano design, that divided the strings into groups of five, with their own electrostatic pickups. With amplification the strings were thinner and shorter. The Neo- Bechstein piano was eventually manufactured by the C. Bechstein piano factory company in 1932 after completion of development, but proved a commercial disappointment due to financial difficulties in the Bechstein company. In 1932, Vierling worked with Benjamin Miessner to design and invent the Elektrochord piano, for the August Förster company. The Elektrochord was one of the first electric pianos, whereupon the vibrations of the struck string by the hammer, were electronically recorded and then amplified. The sound was controllable in that it was configurable to provide a range from a salon grand piano to a full concert grand piano. In 1925, Vierling was promoted to Phd with a thesis titled, The Electroacoustic Piano. In 1938, Vierling was promoted to a full professorship at the Technical University of Hannover, and founded an Institute for the study of high-frequency technology and electro- acoustics. Wehrmacht In 1941, he was commissioned by the Wehrmacht to create the Vierling Group. For this high frequency and electroacoustic armament research, Vierling built the research laboratory Feuerstein Castle in Ebermannstadt, which was located centrally in Germany and disguised as a Franconian castle and hospital. While at the Feuerstein Castle, Vierling developed the first directional radio lines and tested and developed the control for the acoustically controlled G7es torpedo, Torpedo Wren () and later Torpedo Vulture (. Vierling worked with Erich Hüttenhain at the OKW/Chi, Werner Liebknecht who was Director of Engineering at Referat Wa Prüf 7 of the Waffenamt and Erich Fellgiebel Chief of Wehrmacht communications. Vierling worked with Hüttenhain, Liebknecht and Fellgiebel on the Hazardo machine. This machine was supposed to generate random sequence of teleprinter letters on a normal teleprinter tape. Such a key-hole tape could not be easily duplicated by also directly used for telex encryption or for deriving statistical letters or numerical sequences. Vierling also worked on the improvement of the encryption machine, Lorenz SZ 42. Vierling later worked on the testing of the acoustic ignition of mines, and collaborated in the invention of an anti-radar coating for submarines, with the code name chimney sweep. In addition, Vierling and his team developed radios and electric calculators. Another area that Vierling and his team were working on, was ciphony. Of the six methods the lab developed during the period of World War II to achieve secure voice, none were found to be successful and Vierling failed to develop a secure voice system. Vierling had an ambivalent relationship to Nazism. On the one hand he was a member of the Nazi party, on the other hand he worked largely independently and was negative in the party apparatus as he was not regularly present at party meetings. After 1945 During the post war period, Vierling made his intelligence technology, including Covert listening device, available for use to the Gehlen Organization, that enabled his group to survive. In July 1950, the group working on the Hazardo device, moved in secrecy to Kransberg Castle to continue work. In October 1950, the Hazardo produced the first keyhole strip. With the completion of the device, a separate four-person working group called Schlüsselmittelherstllung was formed to exploit the device. Between 1949 and 1955 Vierling taught as a Professor of physics at the philosophical Theological College at the University of Bamberg. The first test of the Deutsche Bundespost with transistors and later on microprocessor-based systems for mail delivery were based on Vierling work.

He constantly produces music and collects all kinds of images and sounds, integrating self-produced material and found footage to create sound pieces and audio installations or videos that combine sound with moving image. For him, “sound is half of the film/video or maybe even more.” He limits the amount of image material and tries to use just the basic effects: cut, dissolve, brightness, contrast.Interview with Pekka Sassi. impakt.nl Accessed 9.9.2018. Structurally, Sassi's works are “simple and vibrant”. > “When examined separately, the structure of the video track and sound is > often very simple. But glued together by Sassi, these elements generate a > magic, cathartic experience in the viewer – as if rock lyrics found just the > right melody.” = Scripted stories = Some of Pekka Sassi's works take the form of scripted stories that range from dystopian horror films to small comic impressions of the everyday.A focus on Finnish media art at the 16th Seoul International New Media Festival (NEMAF).

Accessed 9.9.2018. > ”Sassi does not actually describe the world but reconstitutes fragmented > images into basic narratives accompanied by his commentary – serious and > sometimes even fervent, however, often laced with irony.” > “Pekka Sassi’s films show viewers ordinary surroundings that open up into > self-contained universes which exist within and parallel to the real world. > His subtly humorous stories often deal with the relationship between an > individual and his surroundings.” For example, the “Kolya saga”, screened at the AAVE festival (Alternative AudioVisual Event) of 2016 in Helsinki, Finland, consists of loosely connected experimental films that address deep themes with a surreal twist.Pekka Sassi's Kolja saga. AAVE Festival 17.4.2016. Accessed 9.9.2018. “Kolya and I” (2006) is a black comedy about the relationship between human and God. In “Bad News from Heaven” (2007), the “metaphysical hooligans” Kolya and Yuri are faced with the concept of heaven. “The Suburb Within” (2009) is, according to the filmmaker, about “communication, narration and presence”. It is also a horror film where escalating anguish is created through the soundtrack while the abstract image has a supporting role.Schwierin, Marcel: Die lange Nacht der Ängste. Werkleitz Festival 2010. Accessed 9.9.2018. The fourth film of the series, “After Everything” (2014) emphasises visual narrative and is exceptionally long (28 minutes) compared with Sassi's usually very short videos. The film was produced with support from the Finnish Film Foundation“After everything”. Released short films, The Finnish Film Foundation. Accessed 9.9.2018. and premiered at the Tampere film festival of 2014. “After Everything” shows a dystopian world where brutality and inhumanity are part of everyday routine. The atmosphere of doom is emphasised by the combination of black and white footage, harsh settings and industrial noise music.“After everything.“ Tampere 44th International Short Film Festival. Programme catalogue. Tampere, 2014, p. 68. Sassi taps into the conventions and phenomena of contemporary media culture and moves beyond. “Sassi’s moving images work like modern poetry or jazz; flirting with existing, recognizable structures and genres – and simultaneously constructing something new in an intuitive way.” The approach is explicit in ”The Dead House” (2003), a horror film constructed following the clichés of the genre but shot in a dollhouse. According to Sassi, “The Dead House” is a “make- believe movie.”Avantoscope. Avanto festival 2004. Accessed 9.9.2018. In another piece of work, ”It’s All Around Us Now, Frank” (2006), a Western created in the spirit of Twin Peaks and emphasising narrative through sound, two male characters are forced to face the unknown and their own fears. = Abstract moving image = A parallel strand in Sassi's work combines optical, kinetic and constructivist art with the tradition of abstract experimental film. For example, in “A Friend” (2016) characterised as kinetic and constructivist by Sassi, the moving image is composed of black and white lines and grids. Another recent work, “Colours” (2016), characterised as minimalist/constructivist, is a video installation where large colour surfaces are projected in succession on three walls in a 20-minute loop. The immersive work can be seen both as a painting and as moving image.Valjakka, Timo: Viikonlopun näyttelykierros. [Weekend tour of exhibitions.] Helsingin Sanomat, 28.1.2017. Sassi explains: “I explored what happens when the element of time is integrated into the examination of an abstract painting by cropping and synchronising images by means of moving image.”Sassi, Pekka: Colours – video installation. www.galleriaheino.fi, 2017. Accessed 9.9.2018. > “Pekka Sassi builds in a meaningful way a bridge between experimental > modernism and contemporary art. In a certain manner, he is a formalist whose > roots go back to the early days of experimental film in the beginning of the > last century, but at the same time he is a filmmaker who reacts to the > present and its themes and who puts together his material out of the > congestion on offer.” Sassi's works are characterised by creative integration of simple, and sometimes random, audial and visual elements detected in the surrounding world. In a series of experimental films called “Domestic Studies in Cosmology” a new planet is discovered at the bottom of a paper coffee cup (“Void”, 2004), a seagull circling around a pier creates a new galaxy (“Bird”, 2004) and a black hole is found pulsating in a kitchen sink (“Schwarzschild Radius”, 2004).

Howard Center collaborates with many community partners and is a funded agency of the United Way of Northwest Vermont. Services and supports are community-based and provided in more than 60 locations, including area schools, hospitals, emergency rooms, and client homes, in addition to Howard Center offices and residential homes. In 2018, Howard Center's professional staff of 1,500 helped more than 16,000 people, primarily in Chittenden County, but also in the other Vermont counties of Franklin, Grand Isle, and Rutland.Howard Center Development and Communications Office History Founded in 1865 as the Home for Destitute Children, Howard Center is now the largest of Vermont's designated agencies representing Vermont's System of Care. It is currently the largest community-based center in Vermont and one of the largest in New England. Two significant events in the organization's history occurred in 1966 and in 1994. In 1966 the agency received its designation as the community mental health center for Chittenden County under the federal Community Mental Health Act of 1963. In 1994, the Howard Center for Human Services, merged with Champlain Drug and Alcohol Services, and The Baird Center for Children and Families into one organization, forming Howard Center today. In 2009, they were criticized, along with several other state-dependent agencies, for appearing to overpay officers and directors. Crisis services First Call for Chittenden County: 802-488-7777 The organization maintains First Call for Chittenden County, a 24/7 crisis hotline for Chittenden County residents experiencing a non-medical crisis. Specialized programs The organization operates four specialized therapeutic schools: * The Baird School, Burlington, provides an alternative educational environment for children ages 5–15 in grades K-8 whose needs can not be met in a regular educational environment due to social, emotional, and/or behavioral challenges. * Jean Garvin School (Williston, Vermont) provides a therapeutic educational program offering unique learning opportunities to inspire personal change and well-being for adolescents, ages 12–8 in grades 7-12. * Fay Honey Knopp Memorial School in the city of Rutland, Vermont is a licensed school that provides a supportive and safe educational environment that offers educational, therapeutic, and transition services to residents of HowardCenter's Park Street Program for adolescent males with sexual harming behaviors. * Howard Center is a partner with Matrix Health Systems and the Northeastern Family Institute of Vermont to operate the Centerpoint School Collaborative in South Burlington, Vermont. * School Services: Howard Center's School Services Program helps children ages 3 to 22—and their families—who face a broad range of challenges that may impact learning and school behavior. A component of the program includes masters- level clinicians who work in nearly all of Chittenden County's 50+ schools where many of the services are provided. Services are also provided in home and community settings. * Howard Center supports clients in recovery from substance use. When the Chittenden Clinic was established in 2002, it was the first medication assisted treatment clinic for opioid addiction in Vermont. From July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, the Clinic provided treatment and support to 1,342 individuals. Safe Recovery serves people who are currently using cocaine, heroin, or who are in early recovery from opioid dependence. Services include syringe exchange, low-barrier distribution to buprenorphine, fentanyl test strips, drug treatment options counseling, HIV and hepatitis C testing and referrals, hepatitis A and B vaccination, distribution of Naloxone overdose rescue kits, corrections outreach, basic needs assistance, advocacy, and other recovery support services. All services are offered free of charge, and many can be accessed anonymously. From July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, 1,236 individuals visited Safe Recovery. In December 2013, Safe Recovery began distributing Naloxone kits to reverse overdoses from opioids. Since then, 1,357 overdose reversals have been reported from the kits the program distributed. Although the goal of all Howard Center programs is to help individuals and families live healthy lives as independently as possible, several programs provide specific support for individuals with intellectual disabilities including autism. * Safety Connection program helps adults with intellectual disabilities or autism live independently in the community setting of their choice. The program assists youth in transition, single adults and families, and elders who wish to age in place. Safety Connection works with clients and their support teams which may include both HowardCenter staff and community partners. Safety Connection team collaborates with all partners to build an individualized independent living program, combining home-based monitoring technologies with clinically trained staff monitors and responders. * SUCCEED SUCCEED is a post-secondary education program for students with intellectual disabilities and autism, provided by HowardCenter in collaboration with area colleges. The goal of SUCCEED is to provide students with a comprehensive college experience that prepares them for a future of success, creativity, and contribution to their community. Students have the opportunity to participate in four program areas: student housing, education, campus life, and career development. Students graduate with the ability to live in their own apartment, develop meaningful friendships, obtain fulfilling employment, and establish social connections within their community.  Clients served and community impact  From July 1, 2017 – June 30, 2018, Howard Center provided support to 9,349 clients. Of those, 2,538 were new clients. * Crisis Services 2,757 * Outpatient Services 3,532 * Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) 1,342 * Residential Services 774 * School Based Services 1,490 * Community Based Support 2,292 * Employment Programs 420 In addition, Howard Center annually provides support to thousands of individuals in the community who receive services (particularly through 24/7 crisis services) without officially enrolling as a client. Several Howard Center programs offer treatment and support services that reduce the request for services from other city organizations and departments. For example, Howard Center's Street Outreach and Community Outreach Programs reduce reliance on the Police Department to respond to calls in the downtown area that are primarily the result of social service needs. Awards The Center has been recognized by the following organizations: * The Greater Burlington YMCA recognized Howard Center with their annual award for the organization's continued service to clients and the impact of their work. (May 2015) * KidSafe Collaborative's Annual Outstanding Service Awards presented the Gregory Packan Esq. Award for Outstanding Children's Advocacy to a Howard Center School Social Worker. (May 2015) * The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognized HowardCenter's medication assisted treatment program as a Patient-Centered Specialty Practice, the first outpatient treatment program in the nation to gain this level of recognition. (March 2015) * Jackson Healthcare Hospital Charitable Services Program of Excellence Awards named Howard Center's Street Outreach Program as one of 10 programs nationwide to receive a $10,000 award. * National Council for Behavioral Health's 2014-2015 Addressing Health Disparities Leadership Program selected First Call Director as one of 25 participants nationwide to participate in the leadership program. (October 2014) * The Governor's Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Cabinet appointed Howard Center's Chief Executive Officer to serve on the committee and a member of Howard Center's board of trustees to serve as chair. (September 2014)  Vermont System of Care Designation  As a Designated Agency (DA) within Vermont's System of Care, Howard Center participates in an extensive re-designation process every three years, most recently in 2015. The System of Care establishes a geographic region for each DA to establish, provide, coordinate, and administer services and supports for people for whom it is designated to assure services. The review process ensures minimum standards are met to provide publicly funded supports and that administrative rules and outcomes are met.  Accreditation  Howard Center's Chittenden Clinic, which provide medication assisted treatment for individuals with opioid dependence, received a three-year accreditation in 2015 from CARF International (formerly known as the Commission of Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities). The Clinic is affiliated with the University of Vermont Medical Center and the University of Vermont College of Medicine.  Affiliations and partnerships  In addition to the programs and services offered by Howard Center, the agency collaborates with numerous community partners to expand the support it offers to individuals and communities. Key examples include: * City of Burlington Police Department and the University of Vermont Medical Center: Street Outreach Program. * Central Vermont Substance Abuse Services: CVSAS is the designated substance abuse service agency providing effective alcohol and other drug outpatient and intensive outpatient treatment services for the Greater Washington County area. CVSAS offers services for adults and adolescents and their families. * Collaborative Solutions Corporation/Second Spring is a licensed, residential treatment facility helping its residents develop and implement personal recovery plans that will help them become independent. * HowardCenter is a funded agency of the United Way of Chittenden County. Organization The organization has a budget of $90 million. Over 90% of services are state funded. Nearly 80% of the organization's budget is allocated for workforce, for both regular and contracted employees. In 2014, Vermont Business Magazine ranked Howard Center as the 11th largest employer in the state by employee roster. In 2018, the President of Howard Center was Michael Simoneau.

Design and construction In mid-1890s Johnston Line considered employing two extra ships of approximately 9,500 deadweight for their North American cattle trade between Montreal and Baltimore and Liverpool. Ismore was the second of theses ships, and was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co.'s Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 April 1899 (yard number 419), with Mrs. Maclean of Ardgour being the sponsor. During her construction the vessel received extra strengthening with the view of North Atlantic trading, and had a continuous sheltered deck constructed both fore and aft to carry large quantities of cattle or light cargo. Ismore also had a water ballast placed aft to improve stability when travelling light. She had all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of the cargo, including several powerful steam winches and a large number of derricks. Ismore had also accommodations built allowing her to carry a large number of first and second class passengers. The ship departed Glasgow for sea trials on May 23, 1899 with a large number of guests present on board. The sea trials were held on May 24 on the Firth of Clyde and lasted for six hours, during which the ship could easily maintain an average speed of 15 knots despite rough seas and strong winds. The steamer returned to Greenock on the same day and was transferred to her owners and left for Montreal on May 27. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Insmore was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,500. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 607 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . To operate the vessel, a holding company, Ismore Steamship Company, Ltd. was registered in Liverpool on April 19, 1899 with capital of £30,100. Operational history Upon delivery Ismore was chartered to the Johnston Line, and departed Glasgow for Montreal in ballast on May 27, 1899 and reached her destination on June 10. After loading a large general cargo and 805 oxen she departed for her return trip on June 15 and arrived at Liverpool on July 1, concluding her maiden voyage. On her next trip she left Montreal on July 20 with a cargo consisting of 805 heads of cattle, 10,355 sacks of flour, 84,239 bushels of corn and 14,779 boxes of cheese and arrived at Liverpool on July 30. When entering the port, Ismore collided with steamer SS Dunconnell, with both vessels receiving only minor damage. On her third trip, Ismore arrived at Hampton Roads on August 17, and got grounded at Pinners Point on August 18 when the hurricane struck the city. She was pulled off the mud with the help of several tugs and proceeded to Norfolk to load her cargo of 5,254 bales of cotton, grain and other general cargo. She again visited Norfolk in early October and left with 477 heads of cattle, 4,492 bales of cotton and other general cargo arriving in Liverpool on October 18. On October 16 it was announced that Ismore with a number of other vessels was chartered by the Imperial government to transport troops and stores to South Africa as the war against the Boers got under way. =In the Imperial Government Service= After unloading her cargo, Ismore had to be modified into a transport, which was done in eleven days. On November 4, the vessel embarked 455 men of the 63rd Field Battery, No.9 Company of R.A.M. Corps, \\"A\\" Squadron of 10th Hussars, and one troop of \\"B\\" Squadron, plus 6 field guns, 334 horses and 22 vehicles, stores and ammunition, and sailed for South Africa in the early morning of November 6 under command of captain Frederick Crosby. =Sinking= On leaving the port the ship encountered rough seas and high wind and had to put into Moelfre Bay to wait out the weather, where she remained until the evening of November 8. She only was able to proceed as far as Milford Haven as the rough weather persisted and the horses became sick. Finally, the weather improved and Ismore departed Milford on November 11. The steamer coaled at Tenerife on November 16, and from there continued directly to Cape Town. The journey was largely uneventful. On December 2 at around noon, the ship's position was determined by observation to be approximately , and the course was set to pass the Dassen Island Lighthouse about 13 miles distant. At around 02:38 on December 3, Ismore struck on submerged rocks just off Columbine Point and got stranded. She immediately started to take on water filling her engine room and extinguishing the fires. The lifeboats were lowered and the ship was abandoned. The area where the ship went ashore was littered with rocks and it took a considerable effort to reach land, but, fortunately, the wrecked steamer was only about from the shore, and the military men were able to go back to the ship during the day to retrieve some clothing, ammunition and weapons as well as release some horses. Around 02:30 on December 4 Ismore broke amidships with only her stern remaining afloat. Only about twenty horses managed to get ashore with the rest going down with the ship. An inquiry into the wrecking was held in December 1899 at Cape Town, which found both the captain and the second mate to be at fault and negligent in their conduct, as they failed to use the lead to ascertain the ship's position, disregarded a strong northeast current present in the area which carried the ship closer to the shore, and failure to act when land was spotted on the port side about 8 minutes before the disaster. Captain Crosby had his license suspended for six month, and the second mate was severely censured.

Barry. The film integrates current political happenings — including the Silk Road (referred to \\"The Spice Trail\\" in the film's script), hacktivism, and cyberterrorism — into a dramedy set in Plant City, Florida. Principal photography began in Plant City in August 2016 filming on 35mm film. The film initially premiered on October 14, 2017 as an Official Selection of the Heartland Film Festival. The shortened and final version later premiered on June 28, 2018 at the Tampa Theatre in Hillsborough County, Florida where the movie was filmed exclusively. It released in theaters in ten markets across the United States on July 6, 2018 by Two Roads Picture Co. as well as on the decentralized application Vevue, making history as the first film to ever release via blockchain technology and available to stream using cryptocurrency as payment. The film's script is now part of the Core Collection of the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No Postage Necessary received mixed reviews, with praise for its heartfelt performances, music, production values, and ending that is \\"satisfying without artifice\\", but criticism suggesting it relies too heavily on its unique distribution strategy as its \\"hook\\". Plot Brilliant computer hacker Sam Collins is on probation and barred from the internet; his parole officer is Harry. He steals from mailboxes and works at a local dessert shop with hacking cohort Stanley, now going by David and claiming to have undergone a spiritual awakening. When Sam steals a letter written by Josie to her dead Marine husband, he begins stalking her, stealing her letters, and finding the courage to introduce himself. FBI agent Ames accuses Sam of stealing Bitcoins, which were actually stolen by David, and are now lost. Sam and Josie begin to date tentatively. When Sam hears about the job interview Harry arranges for him, he performs a social media attack to prove to his prospective employers he can tighten up their cybersecurity without having to use the Internet, which his probation terms prohibit him from doing. When Harry finds out, he scolds Sam. Ames increases pressure on Sam to relinquish the missing bitcoins, and goes on a hunt for Sam when he later finds out that his own personal bitcoin wallet has been emptied. Sam attempts to come clean to Josie. When Ames finds out that Sam has been stealing mail, he arrests Sam for the crime, interrupting his apology to Josie. Ames' departure is interrupted by the arrival of Harry and local police reinforcements, where Ames is arrested for money laundering. Jack, Josie's father, consoles Josie, including the revelation that her letters to her late husband---all addressed to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier---were always returned, because the Tomb receives no mail, and he kept them in a special box after taking out a post office box for them to be returned. Meanwhile, Harry recommends early parole release for Sam. David, now going by his real name Stanley, hacks into the Department of Justice in order to email Harry and take the blame for Sam's mail theft. Sam visits Josie at work, but she feels violated by how Sam has hacked into her life, but tells him of her plans to move to Nashville to enroll her daughter Daisy into a special needs school. A month later, Josie receives an acceptance letter for Daisy to the school with an anonymous scholarship for Daisy's tuition and fees. Josie, Jack, and Daisy move to Nashville. Sam interviews to enlist in the Army, offering his special computer intelligence skills, deciding to chase his dreams and while helping others. After he's accepted, he writes a letter to Josie, who smiles when receiving it, convinced that Sam is now becoming the man he wanted to be.

The passage of the Government of National Unity Law No. 03/99 provided for the establishment of the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, which became a permanent body in 2002, and continues its function to the present day. As its name suggests, the Commission is intended to promote unity and reconciliation amongst the former opponents present in the Rwandan population. A common misconception is that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is associated with the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. On the contrary, the ICTR and its prosecutions are initiatives of the United Nations Security Council, and are not associated with the Commission or its objectives. The work of this Commission also should not be confused with that of the International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events created by the Organization of African Unity in 1998. It is also distinct from the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide, which was established by the Rwandan government in 2007.  Historical background  From October 1990 to July 1992, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) took on Rwandan government forces in a brutal Civil War fueled by ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples. Conflict appeared to have ended with a ceasefire in July 1992, and the Arusha Accords signed August 4, 1993, but quickly reignited after the assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana on April 6, 1994. What followed was what is commonly known as the Rwandan genocide, which resulted in the deaths of at least 800,000 Rwandans, the majority of whom were Tutsi, but also included several moderate Hutu. The end of the Genocide is marked by the RPF taking control of the country on July 1, 1994. Article 16 of the Arusha Accords had provided for the establishment of the International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda since October 1, 1990, which made some progress toward reconciliation, but was sidelined by the 1994 Genocide. The National Unity and Reconciliation Commission was established in March 1999 as per the Government of National Unity Law No. 03/99, in order to promote reconciliation between the two opposing sides.  Mandate  The National Unity and Reconciliation Commission's mission statement is as follows: \\"To promote unity, reconciliation, and social cohesion among Rwandans and build a country in which everyone has equal rights and contributing to good governance.\\" As of August 2008, the Commission's responsibilities were defined as follows: # To prepare and coordinate the national programs aimed at promoting national unity and reconciliation; # [To] Establish and promote mechanisms for restoring and strengthening the Unity and Reconciliation of Rwandans; # To educate, sensitize and mobilize the population in areas of national unity and reconciliation; # To carry out research, organize debates, disseminate ideas and make publications on the promotion of peace, and the unity and reconciliation of Rwandans; # To propose measures and actions that can contribute to the eradication of divisionism [sic] among Rwandans and reinforce unity and reconciliation; # To denounce and fight actions, publications, and utterances that promote any kind of division and discrimination, intolerance and xenophobia; # To make an annual report and other reports that may be deemed necessary, on the level of attainment of national unity and reconciliation; # [To] Monitor how public institutions, leaders and the population in general comply with the National Unity and reconciliation policy and principle. Unlike its predecessor, the International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda since October 1, 1990, the focus of this Commission is on reconciling Rwandan society into a unified, peaceful nation. While it does acknowledge the events of the past, its primary focus is not investigation.  Structure and funding  The Commission consists of a Council of Commissioners composed of twelve Rwandan commissioners (including a President and Vice-President), and a Permanent Secretariat composed of twenty-six members. The roles fulfilled by these members are as follows: an Executive Secretary, an Advisor to the Executive Secretary, an Administrative Assistant to the Executive Secretary, a Division Manager, an Administrative Assistant to Division Manager, Unity & Regional Identity Coordinators for the Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western provinces, as well as one for Kigali City (five Coordinators in total), an Internal Auditor, a Procurement Officer, a Communication and Community Outreach Specialist, a Legal Affairs Officer, a Partnership and Capacity Building Specialist, a Unity and Reconciliation Research & Monitoring Specialist, a Human Resources Management & Capacity Development Specialist, a Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, a Director of Finance and Administration, two Unity and Reconciliation Research & Monitoring Specialists, an International Criminal Tribunal Officer, an Accountant, a Peace Building Specialist, a Budget Officer, and a Secretary in Central Secretariat. The Commission is subdivided into three departments: the Department of Civic Education, the Department of Peace Building and Conflict Management, and the Department of Administration and Finance. It is primarily funded by foreign governments, though funding for some activities also comes from the United Nations, as well as from local and international NGOs.  Reports and recommendations  Since the Commission became a permanent body in 2002, it has not issued a formal, final report as other truth commissions often do; instead, the NURC has issued several annual reports, many of which are based on the proceedings of conferences held since the early 2000s. One such report was the \\"Report on the Evaluation of National Unity and Reconciliation\\" which was published in November 2001. Official publications by the NURC are available through the Commission's website. = Report on the Evaluation of National Unity and Reconciliation, 2001 = This report provides information on the \\"Nationwide Consultations on Unity and Reconciliation\\" held from April to June 2001, in every Rwandan province except Gisenyi, as well as provincial consultations held on November 23, 2001. These consultations were intended as a \\"litmus test\\" to evaluate the progress of unity and reconciliation in Rwanda, and to receive recommendations from the population on how efforts at reconciliation could be improved. The report lists indicators of harmonious coexistence, indicators of division, and recommendations from the population. In consideration for the information provided by the aforementioned consultations, the NURC recommends that the population be given more transparent explanations of and access to development programmes (a responsibility of the organizing institutions, associations, and organizations, as well as a responsibility of the media to disseminate the information), and that the Ministry of Education speed up the integration of civic education into primary and secondary school curricula. The NURC also recommends (among others): haste in the establishment of Gacaca court jurisdictions, development programmes, a Compensation Fund, and legislature condemning corruption as well as legislature related to land ownership.  Activities  The Commission has a particular focus on homegrown initiatives based in Rwandan history and culture to promote unity and reconciliation. The following are a few such initiatives. = Ingando = Ingando are solidarity camps held across Rwanda as a means of reconciliation through civic education and cooperation. Women, local leaders, and youth ranging from childhood to prospective university students are specifically targeted for solidarity camps. Solidarity camps have also been associated with the concept of Itorero ry'Igihugu. Igando camps have also been used for the reintegration of former offenders associated with the Genocide, including former members of the armed forces and provisionally-released prisoners. Camps typically last from one to three months, but duration varies depending on the reason for a participant’s attendance. The practice is said to be rooted in Rwandan history, as a tradition of taking a break from society to reflect on serious issues of common concern to the community. = Itorero ry’Igihugu = Another practice rooted in traditional Rwandan education, these events are intended to promote cultural values associated with reconciliation and efforts to move forward as a nation united by common goals, such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS, the encouragement of gender equality, the awareness of environmental change and impact, and the combat of genocidal ideologies. Itorero ry'Igihugu typically targets youth. =Gacaca= Gacaca is a traditional Rwandan form of communal justice, whereby local judges are elected by the community to preside over court proceedings. The tradition was revived in 2003 under the presidency of Paul Kagame, in order to try some of the 120,000 people who had been arrested since 1994 in relation to the Genocide. The goals of the Gacaca courts are “to enable truth-telling,” “to promote reconciliation,” “to eradicate the culture of impunity,” “to speed up the trial of genocide suspects,” and “to demonstrate Rwanda’s own problem-solving capacity.” These courts \\"encourage offenders to confess, to express public apology, and to offer reparations, thereby facilitating the reintegration of perpetrators back into Rwandan society.\\" = Abunzi = Abunzi employs mediators in local justice, as a first step in conflict resolution. Wherever possible, the mediation of the Abunzi is meant to resolve conflicts before there is a need for the involvement of judicial courts. This Rwandan tradition was revived by the country’s government in 2006. = Umuganda = The tradition of Umuganda was revived by the Rwandan government in 1998, but was only institutionalized with laws passed in 2007 and 2009. The aim of this initiative is to use the resources of the community to foster growth in the community, through activities such as tree planting, building houses, schools, clinics, and so on. In so doing, the activities associated with Umuganda encourage reconciliation by bringing together former opponents to work on constructive tasks which in turn, promote national reconstruction. It is a recurring activity, taking place on the last Saturday of every month (though communities can decide to do it more often, if they wish). It lasts for three hours, and is mandatory for all able persons aged 18 to 65. = Girinka = Also known as the “One Cow Per Poor Family” Program, Girinka \\"aims at ending malnutrition, poverty, and strengthening social cohesion.” It was set up in 2006 under the government of President Kagame. Poor families are provided with one heifer each, which in turn provides them with milk for sustenance, manure for fertilizer, and a varied source of income. As of 2015, 203,000 families had benefited from the program, while the goal was to reach 350,000 families by 2017.  Challenges and criticism  In a 2016 publication entitled Unity and Reconciliation Process in Rwanda—22 years after the 1994 Genocide perpetrated against Tutsi, the NURC acknowledges four major hindrances to its attempts at unity and reconciliation. The first is identified as \\"genocide ideology, divisionism [sic], and denial,\\" which the Commissioners note, prevails especially with the elderly and youth. They acknowledge that the legacy of hatred is not easily erased, and the persisting ideologies still cause conflict in Rwanda today. The proposed solution is one of re-education, as with the Ingando and the Itorero ry'Igihugu, for example, and the denouncement of hate speech and other forms of discrimination, as with the anti-discrimination law passed in 2001. Along the same lines, the second hindrance identified by the NURC is one of \\"fresh wounds\\" and \\"memories of divisions and genocide\\" felt through generations of perpetrators and survivors, which the NURC is attempting to deal with through its various activities. The third hindrance is a \\"problem with the compensation of properties looted [or] destroyed.\\" Generally, the approach to this issue has been to oblige perpetrators to repay their victims for damages incurred, which has proven to be problematic due to outright refusals, or a lack of resources to do so. The Commission also acknowledges the responsibility of the current government to do so on the behalf of the government in power during the Genocide, both in terms of the national debt incurred for genocidal purposes, and the destruction of individuals' property. Some solutions to these issues proposed in the publication include the posting of a report listing the names of people owing debts for destroyed property (with an indication of whether the debt is outstanding based on refusal or incapacity to repay the debt,) as well as the possibility of repaying debts by means other than financially (e.g. building houses). A third suggestion is to solicit funds to repay debts from the international community, in acknowledging the role of the international community in the conflict. The fourth and final hindrance acknowledged in the publication is \\"poverty and socioeconomic inequality,\\" which the Commission equally acknowledges was also a \\"contributing trigger/factor\\" to the Genocide itself. A dependence on foreign aid and goods, a lack of available land for generally young and still- growing population, and a lack of employment for a generally low-skilled labor force are all contributing factors to the economic struggle which stands in the way of reconciliation. Proposed suggestions to regulate these issues include a shift from the agrarian-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, increased agricultural productivity, the creation of at least 200,000 new jobs annually, reforming education, encouraging vocational training, promoting technological skills, stimulating entrepreneurship with access to financing, and expanding the country's markets both within the continent and across the globe. Other scholarly criticism has also arisen regarding the approaches to reconciliation by the NURC. Denise Bentrovato, in her article \\"Accounting for Genocide: Transitional Justice, Mass (Re)Education and the Pedagogy of Truth in Present-day Rwanda,\\" argues that efforts at re-education in Rwanda have been ineffective in transforming the divisive tendencies of Rwandans, especially in their selectivity of what truth will be told. Janine Natalya Clark argues in her article \\"National Unity and Reconciliation in Rwanda: A Flawed Approach?\\" that the attempts of the NURC to glaze over Hutu and Tutsi identities and favor a uniform \\"Banyarwanda\\" identity undermines the effectiveness of the Commission to achieve true reconciliation and unity. Susan M. Thomson argues that attempts at reconciliation have been too narrow, in that they have further marginalized the ethnic Twa living in Rwanda, by presenting a narrative of genocide and reconciliation which is ignorant to this segment of the Rwandan population. Some other barriers to reconciliation encountered in Rwanda are the refusal of many perpetrators to admit to the crimes they committed during the conflict, and the inability of surviving family members to reconcile without the recovery of their loved ones' bodies.

The park contains campgrounds, around of hiking and biking trails, a disc golf course, sports fields, boat launches, and a beach on Chickasabogue Creek. It is linked via Chickasabogue Creek to the town of Chickasaw and Mobile Bay. The park also contains a museum featuring Native American, Colonial, and plantation-era artifacts, housed in a former African Methodist Episcopal church built in 1879. History The earliest known inhabitants of the park were Woodland period Native Americans around 1500 BCE. Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, founder of Mobile, relocated Apalache tribe members along Chickasabogue Creek. The first European settlement came in 1787, when Spaniard Don Diego Miguel Álvarez was granted land there. Frederic Daniel Myers and his sons built a saw mill along the creek as early as 1843. The plantation came to encompass a grist mill, a brick kiln, rice, corn, and livestock fields, and a town which contained a public school. In the final months of the Civil War, around 700 residents of Whistler hid in the area to escape advancing Union troops. The area was used as a recreation area as early as the 1930s. The Myers family sold the property in 1903. The land was later purchased by Scott Paper Company, who donated the original to the county in 1969.

It was the most prevalent variation on Art Deco furniture during this time, primarily created for the mass market and for bedroom suites. Distinguishing features The style was distinguished by numerous features. It was named \\"Waterfall\\" due to its distinctive rounded drops at the edges of all horizontal surfaces, intended to mimic a flowing waterfall. Pieces in this style were usually finished with a blond veneer, though a small percentage were finished in a darker walnut finish. Drawer faces on more expensive Waterfall furniture often featured unusual designs such as decorative crossbanding and bookmatched panels. Handles were typically of orange Bakelite and brass, and some vanities had illuminated spheres or frosted panels. Pieces in this style were sometimes paired with oversized round mirrors with etched trim. The furniture was made with plywood, which would be molded during manufacturing. Higher-quality pieces would feature the Waterfall curve in molded plywood where the plywood softened edges of side corners. Mass-produced Waterfall furniture often simply featured a quarter- round edge. Waterfall furniture contrasted from boxy walnut or mahogany pieces of the 1920s due to Waterfall's curved lines and its use of imported woods, including blond-colored Carpathian elm and golden padouk. History The Waterfall style became popular in America after creating a stir at the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931. A company in Grand Rapids, Michigan was among the first to produce furniture in the style in the United States; their efforts were successful enough to inspire other furniture factories to produce Waterfall furniture, much of which was mass-produced and of poor quality.

They are known for their strict anti-fascist stance.  History  The band began performing in May 1999. Members put down its formation to a dislike of the numerous sophists and pseudo-intellectuals flooding the Bratislava anarcho-punk and crustcore scenes of the time, and as a response to the absence of bands of a similar nature in the region. Rejecting lyrics about transnational corporations and the third world as issues distant from their lives, they planned songs on topics they knew and which impacted them directly. They also wanted to avoid tormented clichés about police, neo-Nazis, and \\"the system\\". In 2000, Rozpor self-published their debut album/demo, Nezabudneme! (We Will Not Forget!). Their 2002 album, Ilegálna spravodlivosť (Illegal Justice), brought the band not only participation in punk compilations and intensive touring in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and nearby, but also a creative decade of additional releases under \\"Žiadna značka – No label\\", by which the band highlights the DIY (Do It Yourself) ethic. Rozpor has gained notoriety for its passionate and original stage show, the frequent brawls accompanying its performances, many of its fans' rowdy nature, for playing shows in poverty-stricken Roma regions, and for their opposition to Slovak far right politician Marian Kotleba. The band drew minor controversy in 2008 following an appearance on Česká televize, when the Czech Republic's Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting investigated a complaint about the display of an Antifa flag and the lead singer's \\"Good Night White Pride\\" T-shirt during the broadcast.

According to CNN, as of August 2018, the Mueller team includes 15 attorneys, led by Mueller. The additional supporting staff brings the number over 30. Emmet Flood heads a team representing the White House, and Trump personally is represented by Jay Sekulow, Andrew Ekonomou, Rudy Giuliani, the Raskin & Raskin law firm, and Joanna Hendon. Former members of this team include white-collar crimes expert John Dowd and Ty Cobb representing the office of the presidency. Mueller's legal team has been consistently attacked as biased against President Trump, who has repeatedly referred to it as \\"The 13 Angry Democrats\\". Mueller, though, is a registered Republican, and choosing to hire or not hire career attorneys on the basis of political affiliation is contrary to both Justice Department policy and federal law.  Mueller and investigation team  Special Counsel and former FBI Director Robert Mueller. Upon his appointment as special counsel, Mueller resigned his position at the Washington office of law firm WilmerHale, along with two colleagues, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III. On 23 May 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice ethics experts announced they had declared Mueller ethically able to function as special counsel. Politico proposed that the \\"ideal team\\" would likely have six to eight prosecutors, along with administrative assistants and experts in areas such as money laundering or interpreting tax returns. Mueller had hired 17 lawyers by February 2018, and had a total staff of over three dozen, including investigators and other non- attorneys by August 2017. He also has an active role in managing the inquiry. =Attorneys= * Zainab Ahmad: assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, specializing in terrorism cases; \\"concluded her detail\\" under Mueller in March 2019 \\"but will continue to represent the office on specific pending matters that were assigned to her during her detail.\\" * Heather Alpino: Previously at the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the DOJ National Security Division. * Greg Andres: former Deputy Assistant Attorney General, managed foreign bribery division * Uzo Asonye: Deputy Chief of the Financial Crimes and Public Corruption office at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. * Rush Atkinson: trial attorney in the DOJ fraud section * Deborah Curtis: Deputy Chief of the Counterespionage Section at the DOJ's National Security Division * Michael Dreeben: Deputy Solicitor General, who oversees the Justice Department's criminal appellate docket; an expert in criminal law * Andrew D.

Republican members of the House of Representatives have accused the investigation of being manned by personnel with an \\"anti-Trump\\" bias who \\"let Clinton off easy last year\\", in reference to the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, which also contradicts the stated reason for Trump's firing of James Comey. =Investigation expenses= As of December 2018, the total cost of the investigation has been approximately $25 million, while gaining approximately $48 million. More than half of the cost of the investigation was for personnel compensation and benefits. The gains were accrued primarily by uncovering unpaid taxes by targets in the investigation, seizing assets, and collecting fines. The attorneys have taken significant cuts in pay to work on the investigation, with their normal salaries \\"ranging from just under $1 million (for Zebley) to about $4.1 million (for Quarles)\\".

Trump has called such views a \\"Fake News narrative\\", but, according to Ryan Lovelace of The National Law Journal, \\"many Washington defense attorneys aren't so sure\\". A number of prominent lawyers and law firms are known to have declined offers to join Trump's legal team, including Robert S. Bennett of Hogan Lovells, Paul Clement and Mark Filip, both with Kirkland & Ellis, Robert Giuffra Jr. of Sullivan & Cromwell, Theodore B. Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Brendan V.

The single blade travels horizontally in one direction down the log, and returns in vertical position, thus removing a sawn piece of timber. The swingblade head unit is normally mounted on a moving frame that travels along a track or tracks, up and down a stationary log.  History  Carl Peterson's first 1987 prototype swingblade sawmill An initial swingblade saw concept was conceived and a patent applied in 1975 by Peter Lynn, an inventor who lived in the South Island of New Zealand. The patent application lapsed in 1980. A second, much smaller swingblade saw concept was conceived in the early 80’s by Carl Peterson, an American living in the jungles of the Fiji Islands. In 1987 Mr Peterson fled to New Zealand with his family to avoid the first Fijian military coup. Carl devised a more portable swingblade concept, initially incorporating a chainsaw powerhead as the drive, and a frame that rolled down tracks placed along a stationary log. This new version was crude but quite workable – the first ‘portable’ swingblade mill. It was much lighter than the typically cumbersome twin-bladed or bandsaw mills of the time, and more practical for the remote, hilly farms of New Zealand. He began selling them in 1989 under the brandname Peterson Portable Sawmills.  Advantages  Swingblade sawmills have shown a much improved ability to saw hardwoods, cross-fibred timber, and larger-diameter logs, while also allowing for greater versatility of cut sizes and grain patterns moving through a log. Better production rates and accuracy are trademarks of the swingblade sawmill, and at significantly reduced blade maintenance costs: often down to 1/10th the blade running costs of portable bandsaw mills. Other advantages include being able to ‘chip away’ at a log with smaller depths of any cut, rather than being forced to make the entire cut in one pass like with a bandsaw, circle saw, or quarter saw (double-bladed sawmill). Portable swingblade sawmills also greatly reduce the need for transporting and even moving logs – the entire sawmill can be moved from log to log by hand, and set up over the felled tree – there is no need to move the log at all. Portable swingblade sawmills can usually be operated by a single person.  Disadvantages  Disadvantages include a wider kerf (tooth bite) than a bandsaw, creating more sawdust with the cut width. However many concede the improved accuracy and straightness of the sawn boards often mitigates the initial loss of sawdust in the cut. The result is fewer rejected boards and less planing required further down the processing path.  Uses  A swingblade mill in action Swingblade sawmills can cut lumber with speed and accuracy, though the subsequent steps of planing and drying must still be performed to produce finished lumber. Commodity lumber in standard sizes can be made this way. The more common use, however, is in the production of specialty timber products not readily available through lumber yards. The most common ways they are used to generate an income are - sawing lumber for customers as a mobile service using a portable sawmill, cutting and selling lumber locally, and cutting lumber that is directly used to create a final product. Swingblade sawmills are also used for low-volume production of specialty hardwoods used in furniture, and can be used to produce the large timbers used in post-and-beam framing techniques. Swingblade sawmill owners often use their mills to build their own projects, finding that the money saved by producing their own lumber for their projects justifies the expense of the mill.  Types  * All-terrain sawmill * Winch production frame * Automated swingblade mill  Related machinery  On some swingblade models, you can exchange the swingblade for a clip-on slabber chainsaw to produce timber slabs.

In 1928 he travelled to Buriat-Mongolia on an expedition to study syphilis and the effects of the anti-syphilitic drug Salvarsan. After escaping Nazi occupied Europe in the mid-1930s, he settled in New York. Jessner is remembered for the development of the chemical peel known as Jessner's solution and the description of Jessner-Kanof disease. Early life and education Max Jessner was born on 2 November 1887 in Stolp (now Słupsk in Poland), the son of the dermatologist and lecturer at the University of Königsberg Samuel Jessner (1859–1929). He studied medicine at the universities of Munich and Königsberg. Jessner did his dermatological training at clinics in Breslau (now Wroclaw) under Albert Neisser. He became assistant to Joseph Jadassohn at the University Department of Dermatology in Bern from 1912 to 1914. Following the interruption of the First World War, in which he also fought, he followed Jadassohn to the University of Breslau in 1917. After his habilitation there in 1922, he was appointed associate professor in 1926.  Career  In April 1928, Jessner travelled to Buriat-Mongolia as part of the Soviet-German Syphilis Expedition, an expedition to study syphilis and the effects of the anti-syphilitic drug Salvarsan. The mission involved eight Soviet and eight German researchers. For post-revolutionary Russia, the expedition marked an opportunity to use science to solidify political relations and improve communication. For the Germans, it was an opening to the east. In 1931, he was appointed to Josef Jadassohn's chair. In either 1934 or 1935, he was forced to resign, along with Hans Biberstein, because of his Jewish descent. His successor was Heinrich Gottron who was favoured by the National Socialist regime.Dermatology and Dermatopathology under the Swastika. Wolfgang Weyers. Derm101. Retrieved 9 September 2018. Biberstein later became professor of dermatology at New York University like many other dermatologists who escaped Nazi-occupied Europe by travelling to North America. Jessner first emigrated to Switzerland in 1935, then in 1941 to New York,Jessner, Max (Bestandsbildner). Deutsche National Bibliothek. Retrieved 9 September 2018. where he was reunited with Biberstein. At first, he found work at the New York Postgraduate Medical School and later, he was appointed to the teaching staff of New York University School of Medicine's Skin and Cancer Unit. =Research= Also known as the Coombe's formula, Jessner developed it to form Jessner’s solution, a liquid peeling treatment for hyperkeratotic epidermal lesions, containing salicyclic acid, resorcinol, and lactic acid in 95% ethanol, and works by breaking intracellular bridges between keratinocytes. He reduced the concentration of resorcinol due to its associated allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and skin discolouration. Modified Jessner’s solutions, replacing resorcinol with TCA are available. In New York, he was assisted, like many others, by Marion Sulzberger at the New York Skin and Cancer Unit. It was here that in 1953, with Kanof, he became renowned for the description of Jessner-Kanof disease, a lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin where the lesions were asymptomatic, presenting as red spots or plaques with spontaneous recurrences. Later life After retiring, Jessner moved back to Switzerland, where he died on 27 June 1978.

It is an evergreen, terrestrial orchid with a thin, upright stem, papery, pleated leaves and a short flowering stems with up to sixty crowded, short-lived green and white flowers. Description Corymborkis veratrifolia is a terrestrial, evergreen herb that forms clumps and has thin rhizomes and thin, upright, unbranched, wiry stems tall. There are between six and fifteen narrow elliptic leaves long and wide. The leaves are dark green, thin-textured and corrugated. Between twenty and sixty short-lived, cinnamon-scented flowers are crowded along the branched flowering stem, the flowers wide. The sepals are green, linear to lance-shaped or spatula-shaped, long and wide. The petals are white, long, wide and wavy. The labellum is pale white, long and wide with a narrow tube- shaped base and a broad egg-shaped end with wavy edges. Flowering occurs between December and March in Australia, December to July in New Guinea and in July in China. Taxonomy and naming The white cinnamon orchid was first formally described in 1825 by Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt who gave it the name Hysteria veratrifolia and published the description in Sylloge Plantarum Novarum Itemque Minus Cognitarum a Praestantissimis Botanicis adhuc Viventibus Collecta et a Societate Regia Botanica Ratisbonensi Edita. In 1859 Carl Ludwig Blume changed the name to Corymborkis veratrifolia. The specific epithet (veratrifolia) is derived from the Latin words veratrum meaning \\"hellebore\\" and folia meaning \\"leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Corymborkis veratrifolia grows in shady places in forest and rainforest in China, Taiwan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Ryukyu Islands, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, islands in the south west Pacific and northern Australia. In Australia it is found between the Iron Range and Airlie Beach in Queensland.

He was born as Janos Neufeld to a Jewish family in Budapest. From 1947 to 1950, he attended a private school, and later, a High School for Fine and Applied Arts. In 1950, his mother married Bela Major, which made he and his sister adopt the name Major as their last name. Upon high school graduation, he got accepted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest where he studied graphic reproduction: etching, lithography, and woodcut under Karoly Koffan. His diploma work in 1959 were etchings of women workers at an electronics factory.  Career  Major's work often appeared in group exhibitions. He made gravestone photographs from the beginning of the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, he destroyed a significant part of his work. In the 1960s, he experimented with mezzotint, line engraving, aquatint, acids on steel plates and imprints into vernis mou. His epic etching In Memoriam of Moric Scharf, a reference to a famous Hungarian blood libel case, to the Holocaust, and to Renate Muller. In the late 1960s, he began to photograph tombstones, producing hundreds of black and white prints. Some photos informed his drawings while others inspired conceptual work. He produced art that was grotesque, (self) ironic, absurd sexual engagements blend with Jewish and political motifs. In the 1980s, he became interested in perspective illusion. He has dealt with the subconscious and taboo. He staged a one-man protest on October 18, 1969 at Victor Vasarely's retrospective exhibition at the Mücsarnok gallery in Budapest. Janos walked around the exhibit with a one-inch sign under his lapel and showing it only to friends: Vasarely Go Home. In 1976, Major destroyed a significant portion of his work. The same year, he became associated with the Budapest History Museum as an archaeological draftsman and did not resume his own work for a decade. His late work consists of tombstone photography, drawings, and comics. These drawings make use of a certain perspective representation he called ‘coincidences,’ resulting in absurd misperception (with pornographic overtones).  Exhibitions  Source: Veri, Daniel.

She continued to win medals into her 70s and 80s. Early Career Nora Young was born in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, England (September 8, 1917), the youngest of ten children, and her family immigrated to Fort William (now Thunder Bay) when she was two years old. She grew up playing hockey on Lake Superior and in backyard rinks, with Eaton's catalogues under her wool socks for shin pads, always the only girl on the ice. As she grew older, she began to play for girls’ hockey teams in the area such as the Port Arthur Maroons. In the late 1920s, when Young was about 10, her family moved to Toronto so her father could find work as the Great Depression began. They settled first in Cabbagetown, and then moved to Parkdale. In her teens, Young began participating in organized sports in the city, starting with softball at age 11. At the time, women were beginning to participate in organized sports at a mass level in the 1920s and 30s, a phenomenon colloquially referred as the Golden Age of Women's Sports in North America, Young being a paradigm of the era. Nora and The Golden Age A national champion in three sports (cycling, javelin, basketball), Young competed in top venues all over North America during the Golden Age, in front of the likes of William Randolph Hearst and Mary Pickford. She was a natural athlete and a rare “all-rounder” who excelled in multiple sports. For example: She was an ace player at Sunnyside Stadium (famous across North America for women's softball) where she was coached by legendary athlete Bobbie Rosenfeld. She was a basketball player who helped her Toronto team to capture the national championship (Underwood trophy) in 1948. She was a member of the Toronto Ladies hockey team when it was invited to demonstrate the sport at Madison Square Gardens in New York, and then participate in a “barnstorming” tour, playing games across the United States. Cycling and Nora Among her many athletic pursuits, and beyond her considerable prowess in many of them, Young excelled the very most at cycling - it was also her favourite sport. Toronto's audacious 'girl cyclist' left riders — and stereotypes — in the dust, Toronto Star She competed constantly in the cycling competitions of her day, starting in the early 1930s, and usually winning or placing near the top of the weekly women's races on dirt tracks the Canadian National Exhibition (where the top female cyclists of the time competed). Often Young was racing on her women's coaster bike – because that's what she had – except in cases where she borrowed a professional bike from one of her male colleagues. It was at the CNE that she set a national record in the ¼ mile time trial in the 1930s, winning the Corcoran trophy. She also distinguished herself at major long- distance road races in Toronto (sometimes as the only female competitor) and at a historically significant women's demonstration held as part of a Six-Day Race at Maple Leaf Gardens. This event will be featured in \\"Undeniably Young: Nora Young and the Six-Day Race\\", an animated film in progress. Animated film in progress, \\"Undeniably Young: Nora Young and the Six-Day Race\\" The 1950s and Beyond Outside of her sporting career, Young also had a career in the workforce. She was employed in a variety of jobs during her peak years as an athlete, from domestic servant (in her teens) to lab technician . She served in Europe in WWII in the Canadian Women's Army Corps as a jeep driver and canteen operator. In 1959, Young bought a house in the Danforth area of Toronto on her own (a rare thing for a woman in those days). She retired from her job early, in her 50s, as she was beginning to experience arthritis that affected her work. She also stopped cycling for a while, but missed it, and began racing training again in the 1970s. Later life In the 1980s she embarked on a second astonishingly successful athletic career in masters athletic tournaments. As a masters athlete, she competed in Canada, across the U.S., and even in Australia, in cycling and a number of other sports, accumulating numerous medals and setting many records, and often beating others much younger than she was. In 2005, Young moved from Toronto to Newcastle, Ontario, where she lived independently during her final years; she finally gave up bike riding at the age of 92. She died in Bowmanville on March 26, 2016, at 98, a friend and inspiration to many and a true pioneer and lifelong athlete.

In 1625 water was obtained from a single well and delivered by cart, but as the town grew, companies supplied water to homes through pipes. There were two main companies by the 1840s, but the water supply was intermittent, and there was general dissatisfaction with the service. Liverpool Corporation decided that such an important service should be provided by a public body, and sought to take over the water supply companies. A series of Acts of Parliament were obtained, the first being the Liverpool Sanatory [sic] Act 1846, which created three key posts, the Medical Officer of Health, the Inspector of Nuisances, and the Borough Engineer. The latter post was filled by James Newlands, a visionary man who defined the role of the Borough Engineer, to be copied by many other towns and cities. He set about creating large scale maps of Liverpool, building a water-based sewerage system, making provision for bath houses, wash houses, swimming lessons, minimum sizes for rooms, paving and street lighting. The sewage was emptied into the River Mersey for the tides to take away, but he saw this as an interim measure, with a sewage treatment works being required. This part of his vision was not implemented until the 1980s. The second Act was the Liverpool Corporation Water Act 1847, which allowed the corporation to buy out the private water companies, and subsequent Acts authorised the construction of reservoirs, initially on Rivington Pike, where a total of eight reservoirs were eventually completed, most of the work being overseen by the engineer Thomas Hawksley. The work included sand filters to treat the water before it entered a pipeline to Liverpool. The volume of water that this scheme supplied was rather less than that estimated, and the promised constant supply of water to residents reverted to an intermittent supply, as the population expanded and the volume of water used by households increased. This issue was eventually resolved by building the Vyrnwy Reservoir in Wales and a aqueduct to convey the water to Liverpool. Following the Water Act 1973, both water supply and sewerage services were taken over from the Corporation by the North West Water Authority, which subsequently became United Utilities. Newlands' vision for a sewage treatment works was realised in 1991, when a works was completed in Sandon Dock, which was extended by a £200 million upgrade in 2016, utilising the adjacent Wellington Dock. Hawksley's sand filters for the Rivington chain of reservoirs were replaced by a £38.9-million water treatment works in 1994, although the water is now used to supply Wigan rather than Liverpool. The Liverpool Sanitary Act became the model for the Public Health Act 1848, which saw many other towns benefit from the reforms Newlands introduced. He reduced mortality in Liverpool significantly, and crowds lined the streets for his funeral in 1871. History The city of Liverpool sits on a bed of lower new red sandstone, which is covered by a layer of clay, up to thick. Early water supply was from wells dug down into the sandstone aquifer. The principal supply in 1625 was Fall Well, near St John's Lane, from which water was supplied to the seven or eight streets that formed Liverpool by cart. The first known commercial supply of water was in 1694, when a company was granted permission by the Corporation to supply Liverpool with water from springs at Bootle. The permission passed to Sir Cleave Moore in 1709, and construction of a masonry culvert began, but was abandoned. The engineer Thomas Steers was associated with the waterworks in 1720, as were Sir Thomas Johnson and Sir Cleave Moore. The company had a reservoir and a steam engine which pumped the water into wooden pipes. Duncan, writing in 1853, suggests that the Bootle Company combined with another company, known as the Liverpool and Harrington Company, in 1799, to more effectively supply Liverpool with water. Thomas Telford was linked to the Bootle Waterworks between 1799 and 1802, and Thomas Simpson was linked to the Harrington Waterworks in 1799. However, Sheard, writing in 1993, suggests that the Bootle company, formally known as the Liverpool Waterworks Company, was formed by Act of Parliament in 1799, while the Harrington company, which was officially the Liverpool Corporation Waterworks, although it is unclear whether there was any formal link with the Corporation, was formed by Act of Parliament in 1822. These dates were also quoted in the evidence to Parliament as part of the Liverpool Corporation Waterworks Bill. The two companies agreed to divide up Liverpool and each supply their own area, rather than competing. The Bootle Company had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1810 and 1813 allowing them to supply water to Bootle, Linacre, Kirkdale, Everton and West Derby. The Harrington Company extracted their water from boreholes, of which they had 17, varying in depth from to . The water was pumped into a network of iron pipes by three steam engines, and some was stored in four reservoirs. They supplied per day, and the reservoirs could hold a total of . Liverpool experienced a number of fires in 1840, and the failure of the water companies to supply sufficient water to extinguish them resulted in widespread damage. Consequently, an independent water supply for fighting fires and flushing sewers was proposed by the Highways Board, for which the engineer was James Simpson. Work on a well at Green Lane, deep, began in 1841, from which the water was pumped by a steam engine and stored in a reservoir at Kensington Fields holding . A network of cast iron pipes conveyed the water through the city, and the system was completed in 1847. The reservoir was subsequently covered, to reduce the growth of green algae, and was extended to hold . The scheme provided a constant water supply, although Simpson stated that a constant supply for the whole city would be useless, a view for which he was attacked in the Liverpool Post newspaper. Water supply was intermittent, in some cases only being available for a short period three times a week, and there was dissatisfaction with the service provided. In 1845, the Liverpool Guardian Society for the Protection of Trade demanded that an inquiry be held, as the water companies' shares were over-valued, and they thought that the water supply was \\"not only miserably inadequate but the most expensive in the country.\\" A Special Committee of the Highways Board sat to consider the evidence, and concluded that such a vital resource as a clean water supply ought to be managed by a public body, rather than private companies. At the time, the mechanisms by which water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid were transmitted was poorly understood, but the theory that they were miasmic, that is, spread by airborne smells, at least meant that the action to deal with the smells actually resolved the problem. Engineers were in short supply, as most were occupied by the railway mania, but the Corporation obtained the services of the Scottish engineer James Newlands, who became the first Borough Engineer. He produced a detailed report on sewerage in April 1846, which the Corporation adopted in July. They obtained the Liverpool Sanatory [sic] Act 1846 to allow work on the construction of sewers and other works to begin, but the city was struck by another epidemic of cholera in 1847. A second enquiry was held in February 1847, to consider how Liverpool Corporation might take over the private water companies, and having valued the companies at £537,000, they sought an Act of Parliament to authorise their actions. The Liverpool Corporation Water Act 1847 was granted in July of that year, and the transfer took effect immediately. The water engineer Thomas Hawksley worked on the water supply schemes, while Newlands worked on the sewerage system. =Water supply= There was initially some disagreement between the two engineers over how to secure a reliable water supply. Newlands and James Simpson, who had some success in constructing wells in Liverpool during the 1840s, recommended an extension of the system of wells, whereas Hawksley favoured bringing water into the town by gravity from a network of reservoirs in the Rivington Pike area. Although the estimated costs of this scheme had risen from £200,000 to £450,000 between 1847 and 1850, there was a majority within the council who supported it. An Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise it, but then a change in the makeup of the council resulted in a majority being against the scheme. However, they discovered that the contracts for the Rivington Pike Waterworks had already been awarded, and despite the legal obstacles, convened a court of enquiry to see if it was possible to reverse the decision. The Council asked Robert Stephenson to arbitrate, and agreed to abide by his decision. He reported that the well scheme would be cheaper if less than of water per day were required, but that the Rivington Pike scheme was better for larger volumes, and he therefore recommended that option. His estimate that it could easily supply per day was over-optimistic, as Parliament decided that the scheme should also supply of compensation water per day, to maintain flows in the rivers. The Rivington Pike scheme gathered water from of moorland, in an area which supplied the River Ribble and the River Douglas. Hawksley planned to build five dams to impound his reservoirs, each with a central clay core and an earth embankment, with a slope of 3 to 1 on the upstream side and 2 to 1 on the downstream side. The upstream faces were protected by stone pitching, to prevent wave action eroding the dam, with supply shafts and a shaft to allow the release of compensation water constructed of blue brick upstream of the clay core, but within the structure of the dam. These linked to horizontal culverts, which passed beneath the dam. Although other schemes of the period assumed that spring water could be used untreated, Hawksley constructed of slow sand filters to effectively filter the water before it entered a pipeline which was long and in diameter. At the time it was the longest water supply pipeline to have been constructed. Three of the reservoirs, at Lower Rivington, Upper Rivington and Anglezarke, were used to hold water for consumption. Compensation water was stored in two further reservoirs built at a higher level, at Rake Brook and Lower Roddlesworth, and linked to the first three by an open channel called the Goit, which ran for , and also served to collect water from the area between the two sets of reservoirs. The scheme as built impounded a total of of water. In 1856, Liverpool Corporation Waterworks bought out Chorley Waterworks, authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in April 1856. Chorley also owned a reservoir on Rivington Pike, just to the east of Anglezarke. The High Bullough Reservoir had been built by John Frederick Bateman, who had estimated the cost of the project while working for Edwin Chadwick's Towns Improvement Company, and had then acted as Engineer for the project. The reservoir was operational by 1850, with the outlet consisting of a pipe running through the dam, and supported by two masonry piers where it ran through the central clay puddle. The outlet valve was at the downstream end of the dam, and although this configuration is no longer thought to be good practice, there were no serious issues with the reservoir throughout its operational life. The Corporation obtained another Act of Parliament in 1860, to authorise the construction of the Upper Roddlesworth Reservoir. The dam was long, and was high above the original ground level at its tallest point. It increased the total storage capacity of the Rivington scheme by about six per cent, but the volume of water entering the supply did not increase. It is unclear who designed and oversaw the construction, but it was not Hawksley, and a number of issues have occurred since its completion in 1865. Swallow holes appeared in the dam in 1904 and 1908, and the toe of the dam consisted of sand, which washed away in 1954 due to heavy rain, resulting in a slip on the downstream side of the dam, and requiring the construction of a drainage system to prevent a reoccurrence. The 1860 Act had also authorised the construction of Yarrow Reservoir, near the lower end of Anglezarke, which was completed in 1875, but only permitted a small increase in the volume entering supply. Work on the dam had begun in 1867, to the designs of Thomas Duncan, the successor to Newlands as Borough Engineer for Liverpool, and had been completed by Joseph Jackson, an engineer from Bolton, after Duncan died. When the Rivington Pike scheme had been promoted, it had been assumed that it would provide enough water for a constant supply to homes, as well as water to flush an arterial drainage system. However, the scheme only yielded about per day, some short of Hawksley's estimate, and by 1872, faced with a rapid increase in the population of Liverpool and growing demands for water, this was no longer adequate to provide a constant supply. In 1874, the Corporation therefore asked Jackson to assess all of the schemes which had been proposed since 1826. He considered six such schemes, four in the Lake District, using Ullswater, Haweswater, Windermere, and the headwaters of the River Lune and River Hodder, one in Wales, using Bala Lake, and the scheme which Jackson favoured, using the headwaters of the River Brock, a tributary of the River Wyre, some to the north of the city. In May, the Water Committee sought second opinions, and approached Hawksley and Bateman. Hawksley supported Jackson's proposal, but Bateman felt that it was flawed in a number of areas, and suggested instead a joint scheme with Manchester to use water from Ullswater. =Vyrnwy scheme= The valley of the River Vyrnwy had been proposed as a source of water for London in 1865, but in 1877 a civil engineer from Wigan called Hugh Williams suggested that it could provide a gravity supply for Liverpool. He expected to be involved in its development, but instead the Water Committee asked their Borough Engineer, G F Deacon, to produce a report, which he did on 18 December 1877. Manchester were not keen on the joint Ullswater scheme, and this was dropped in June 1879. With only one scheme left, Parliamentary approval was sought and obtained for the Vyrnwy Reservoir and aqueduct on 6 August 1880. Deacon then carried out a thorough survey, including trial borings and shafts to ensure that the dam site was suitable, and on 2 March 1881 Hawksley was appointed as Chief Engineer, to be assisted by Deacon. The work included the construction of a dam and of aqueduct to convey the water to Liverpool. Hawksley was an experienced engineer in his early seventies, whereas Deacon had no experience of such large projects. The two worked together on promoting the bill through Parliament, and both signed some of the early drawings for the dam, but Hawksley was not prepared to allow the cooperation to continue. In February 1885 both were asked for estimates of the cost to complete the project, and provided quite different answers. The bill had stated it would cost £1,250,000. Deacon estimated the actual cost at £1,773,508, while Hawksley quoted £2,183,750. When a member of the Water Committee stated that they had been betrayed by the engineers, Hawksley resigned, but was persuaded to return. However, in May 1885, Hawksley learned that Deacon had been officially appointed as joint engineer in March 1881, and resigned again. There was a dispute about the amount of money still owing to Hawksley, which was settled by arbitration, with the judgment in favour of Hawksley, with the Corporation having to pay him an extra £14,123. Deacon was replaced as City Engineer, and devoted himself to the Vyrnwy project, with the water supply coming on line in 1892, and the second phase of the project completed in 1910. =Sewerage= The Liverpool Sanatory [sic] Act of 1846 took effect from 1 January 1847, and made provision for three key personnel. There was to be a Medical Officer of Health, which was filled by William Henry Duncan. He had supplied Edwin Chadwick with much information on conditions in Liverpool while he was researching his book, The sanitary conditions on the Labouring Classes in Britain, which was published in 1842 and was a major influence on sanitary reforms. The second key person was the Inspector of Nuisances, held by Thomas Fresh, while the third was the Borough Engineer, a post held initially by James Newlands. Liverpool had previously had two town surveyors, John Foster senior and John Foster junior, but their remit had been very narrow, and so they had done little to improve drainage within the town. Water flowed downhill towards the River Mersey, but there were problems with flooding when there was heavy rainfall. Newlands found that existing surveys of Liverpool were inadequate for his requirements, and set about producing accurate plans at a scale of 1 to 240, for which he employed his own surveyors, rather than using the Ordnance Survey or the army corps of engineers. They made some 3000 geodetic measurements, and his first report of April 1848 was expansive in its content. It included surface water drainage, the introduction of water closets to replace cesspits and privies, a water-based sewerage system, minimum sizes for rooms in houses, provision for swimming lessons, public baths, wash houses, and also suggested that planning of new streets to reduce the costs of drainage should fall within his remit, as should the outlying villages of Everton, Kirkdale and Toxteth Park, which he thought would soon become part of a larger urban Liverpool. Construction of the first integrated sewerage system in Britain began in 1848, and was keenly observed by many who were involved in public health and civil engineering. The main sewers were egg-shaped, to ensure that they were flushed even when low volumes of water were present, and were by brick structures. Edwin Chadwick had championed glazed pipe sewers for connections to houses, despite opposition from engineers, and Newlands adopted these. Gullies were built with traps to contain noxious smells, but this resulted in sewer gases building up within the system. He wanted to burn these off by linking the sewers to a redundant chimney, but the council would not allow it. By 1851, of main sewers had been built, and this had increased to around by 1869. There were some attempts to use sewage for land improvement, with the private Sewage Utilization Company spraying it on land near Sandhills, but the company was in financial difficulties by 1869. Because the sewers were constructed at a level below that of most building foundations, they reduced issues with rising damp in buildings considerably. As an interim measure, the sewers emptied into the Mersey, where the fast tides carried the effluent away, but Newlands was clear that what was required was a central treatment plant, but it was not until 1984 that such a plan was implemented. There were some problems with the system initially, due to the Rivington Pike scheme providing significantly less water than envisaged. Overcrowding was an issue, exacerbated by 300,000 Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in 1846, and not helped by the council demolishing houses deemed to be unsanitary in the 1850s. Nevertheless, Newlands gained recognition for his policies, both nationally and internationally, and he was briefly seconded to the Crimea in 1855, to improve sanitation in the army camps at Sebastopol. The Public Health Act 1848 was modelled on Liverpool's Act of 1846, and as a result, many towns employed a Borough Engineer, a role which Newlands had largely defined himself. His co-operation with the Medical Officer of Health was crucial to the success of Liverpool's sanitary reforms, and shortly after his death in 1871, the Association of Municipal Engineers was formed, later becoming part of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He had significantly reduced mortality in the city, and crowds lined the streets for his funeral in recognition of this. The Liverpool Corporation area expanded in 1895 and 1913, as outlying districts were absorbed. They inherited sewage works at Walton and Fazakerley, both draining into the River Alt, and at Woolton, draining into Ditton Brook. Extra capacity at Fazakerley was created in 1913 by constructing an diameter sewer, to carry effluent through a ridge to the River Mersey. =Development= The second half of the twentieth century was marked by a number of legislative attempts to address the problems of the water industry. Pollution from sewage was a particular problem, and although the concept of discharge licensing had been introduced by the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951 and a similar Act in 1961, the Working Party on Sewage Disposal, which reported in 1970, concluded that there were over 3000 sewage treatment works in England and Wales which were performing inadequately. There was little incentive to invest in sewage treatment works, and in many areas the rapid increases in population had resulted in rivers becoming grossly polluted. Pollution of the Mersey estuary was particularly bad, with raw sewage from a population of around one million emanating from Liverpool and from Birkenhead on the opposite bank of the Mersey entering the river, supplemented by industrial discharges from Runcorn and Widnes. In 1971 a Steering Committee on Pollution of the Mersey Estuary was set up, to which consulting engineers reported in 1974 on possible sites for sewage treatment works. The Water Act 1973 had focused on providing a single unifying body with responsibility for all water-related function within a river basin or series of river basins. It established ten Regional Water Authorities, which would have responsibility for water supply, sewage treatment, and river quality. In Liverpool's case, the functions of water supply and sewerage passed to the North West Water Authority, although only the main sewers, treatment works and outfalls were covered by the legislation, so the smaller sewers remained the city's responsibility. There were issues with the new structures, as a single authority responsible for river quality and sewage treatment was unlikely to prosecute itself for breaches in quality. It also became obvious that the industry suffered from ageing infrastructure and chronic under-investment. The Conservative Party of the time saw privatisation as a means to solve the funding gap, and under the terms of the Water Act 1989, the North West Water Authority became North West Water plc, a water and sewerage company, with the river quality functions passing to the National Rivers Authority. North West Water merged with Norweb in 1995 to become United Utilities. By 1982, there were 48 outfall sewers pouring raw sewage into the Mersey from Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral. Consideration had been given to creating a new island between Eastham and Garston, as finding land near the river front on which to build a wastewater treatment works was proving difficult, but the chosen solution was to route an outfall through Alexandra Dock. While plans were being drawn up, Sandon Dock became available, and became the site for the new works, which Newlands had suggested was needed in 1848. It had the advantage that building an interceptor sewer to link the outfalls to the works would be relatively simple, the treated effluent could still be routed into the estuary, and sludge could be taken to sea for dumping. Planning permission to construct the works was granted in 1980, Although surveys suggested that an outfall pipe some long would be required, to discharge the effluent into water below the low tide level, it was initially discharged over the dock wall as the site became operational between April and June 1991. By October 1992, 6 of the 28 outfalls in Liverpool had been linked to the works, and a hydrological survey showed that the outfall pipe was required. Dumping of sludge at sea ceased in 1998, as a result of the adoption of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The works was extended in 2016, by building additional facilities in the adjacent Wellington Dock as part of a £200 million upgrade. Both the original works and the new facilities were formally opened by Princess Anne. The Rivington Reservoirs are still supplying drinking water, although Hawksley's sand filters were replaced by a new £38.9-million water treatment works in 1994, which was opened by Michael Heseltine. It treats per day, but the water now supplies the Wigan area rather than Liverpool. There are a number of websites that state that High Bullough Reservoir is no longer used to supply drinking water, but the reservoir was still contained in a list of reservoirs in the Rivington Chain when United Utilities issued an application for a drought permit to reduce compensation flows to the River Yarrow in mid-2018.

It is most notable for its opening lament, Élégie, which Satie composed in memory of his friend Claude Debussy. A typical performance lasts under 4 minutes. Background Claude Debussy In the autumn of 1920, Henry Prunières, founder-editor of the monthly music journal La Revue musicale, announced he would publish a commemorative edition of his magazine to honor the legacy of Claude Debussy, who had died in 1918. It would include a memorial supplement, Le Tombeau de Claude Debussy,In French the term tombeau, derived from the words \\"tomb\\" or \\"tombstone\\", is a musical composition commemorating the death of a notable individual. a collective musical tribute for which Prunières invited Europe's leading composers to contribute. Ten musicians responded with either newly- written pieces or excerpts from their current works in progress: Paul Dukas, Albert Roussel, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Eugene Goossens, Béla Bartók, Florent Schmitt, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and Erik Satie. For Satie the commission was an opportunity to address an unhealed wound. Debussy was probably the closest friend he ever had.Louis Laloy, \\"La Musique retrouvée\\", Librairie Plon, Paris, 1928, pp. 258-259. He once wrote, \\"From the moment I saw [Debussy] for the first time, I was drawn to him and wanted to live constantly at his side\\".Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 144. But both were difficult men and their relations grew strained in the 1910s, as Satie emerged from decades of obscurity as a composer while the world-famous Debussy was tormented by a long battle with cancer. After Debussy bitterly teased Satie during rehearsals of the latter's breakthrough ballet Parade in March 1917, Satie ended their friendship once and for all. When Debussy died the following year, Satie did not attend his funeral.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", pp. 148-149. But the loss had a profound impact on him. Years later he would jot down in one of his private notebooks, \\"When all is said and done, the good Debussy was more than all the others put together\\".Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 149. Satie completed his musical eulogy to Debussy, an Élégie for voice and piano, on September 27, 1920,Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 321. dedicating it \\"In memory of an admiring and tender friendship of thirty years\\".Pierre-Daniel Templier, Erik Satie, MIT Press, 1969, p. 104. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. It was first published as part of the Le Tombeau de Claude Debussy supplement in the December 1920 issue of La Revue musicale, with a frontispiece created by Raoul Dufy. Prunières said in his introduction, \\"This international tribute to the memory of Debussy will be a real 'monument' like those that Renaissance poets raised to the artists they had loved\\".\\"A Special Night in French Music\\", France Musique, March 25, 2018.

He composed three additional songs between October and December 1920 to comprise the Quatre petites mélodies.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 321-322. Songs The definitive version of the Quatre petites mélodies is set to verses by four French authors spanning two centuries. Alphonse de Lamartine 1. Élégie (Elegy), poem by Alphonse de Lamartine :- Déclame (with emphasis) Satie's very personal lament for Debussy is set to stanza 7 of Lamartine's 1820 poem L'Isolement (Isolation).Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 321. :What to me are these valleys, these palaces, these cottages :Vain objects from which for me all charm has been taken away? :Rivers, rocks, forests, solitude so dear :A single being is lacking and everything is emptyQuoted in Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 149. Robert Orledge observed that in the Élégie \\"Satie for once brings his inner emotions to the surface in a wide-ranging vocal line of almost exaggerated expressiveness\\".Orledge, Satie the Composer, p. 39. With its anguished prosody and desolate, tonally ambiguous piano part it is almost unique in Satie's vocal music, comparable only to his 1893 song Bonjour Biqui, Bonjour!. The latter was similarly inspired by an emotional upheaval in the composer's life.Satie's brief, stormy affair with the painter Suzanne Valadon. Jean Cocteau 2. Danseuse (Ballerina), poem by Jean Cocteau :- Non vif (not too lively) Cocteau's poem is a bit of satirical nonsense in which an opera dancer is likened to a crab. An angular, tiptoeing piano accompaniment subtly nails the comparison, suggesting both the sideways movement of the crustacean and en pointe dance technique. The implications of the absurd text would certainly have attracted Satie. He had strong opinions about ballet performers, whom he believed cared only about themselves and for creating \\"spectacular effects that will bring applause\\";Quoted in Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 230. and in private correspondence he referred to his frequent collaborator, choreographer Léonide Massine, as \\"very stupid...and very much a dancer\\".Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 162. Satie also loved seafood and had depicted a crab being devoured by an octopus in an earlier composition, La Pieuvre from the piano suite Sports et divertissements (1914). 18th Century illustration of carousing in a French tavern 3. Chanson (Song), poem by anonymous 18th Century French author :- Assez lent (moderately slow) Dating from pre-revolutionary France of the 1700s, the text is a libertine drinking song (chanson à boire) rife with double-entendres: :It's my treasure, it's my jewel :The pretty hole through which :My vigor wakes up :Yes, I'm crazy, crazy, crazy :About the hole of my bottleEnglish summary of original French text on IMSLP at https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Petites_m%C3%A9lodies_(Satie%2C_Erik) Satie - himself no stranger to alcohol - playfully crafted the vocal line to emulate the slurred speech of an inebriate. After the line \\"My vigor wakes up\\" the music stumbles into a brief pause, then shakily resumes. Raymond Radiguet 4. Adieu (Farewell), poem by Raymond Radiguet :- Modéré (moderately) In 1920 Radiguet was the 17 year-old protégé of Jean Cocteau, long before achieving independent success with his precocious first novel, Le Diable au corps (1923). His contribution to the Quatre petites mélodies was an unpublished quatrain originally entitled Mouchoir (Handkerchief). It would appear in his posthumous poetry collection Les Joues en feu (1925).Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 322. A slightly-skewed waltz rhythm underlines the poet taking an old admiral to task for waving a white handkerchief in a gesture of farewell. Radiguet's final verses - :It is the custom to hunt :The flies of the pastEnglish summary of original French text on IMSLP at https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Petites_m%C3%A9lodies_(Satie%2C_Erik) - provide a thematic throwback to the opening Élégie and close the cycle with melancholy irony. Publication and performance Early promotion of the Quatre petites mélodies reflected the piecemeal nature of its composition. Following the original publication of Élégie in the La Revue musicale supplement, Satie's Chanson, retitled Chanson à boire, appeared in facsimile in the 1921 edition of the Parisian Almanach de Cocagne (Cockaigne Almanac). This was an annual publication \\"dedicated to true gourmets and serious drinkers\\" edited by Satie's friend, culinary historian Bertrand Guégan.Guégan's Almanach de Cocagne appeared annually from 1920 to 1922. Along with classic recipes it featured essays, artwork and even music scores from prominent French creative figures. For the 1920 edition Satie contributed a Marche de Cocagne for two trumpets, which became the basis of his orchestral suite Trois petites pièces montées.Bertrand Guégan (1892-1943) was an editor for the publisher Éditions de la Sirène, which had Satie under exclusive contract in the early 1920s. His notable culinary works include La Fleur de la Cuisine Française (2 volumes, 1921), a collection of French recipes ranging from the 13th Century to the modern era; the first French translation of the Ancient Roman cookbook Apicius (1933), for which the Académie française awarded him the 1934 Prix Langlois; and Le cuisinier français (1934). He also edited a critical edition of Molière (7 volumes, 1925-1929). During World War II Guégan took part in the French Resistance and was executed by the Nazis. See http://data.bnf.fr/11906122/bertrand_guegan/ All four songs were published by Éditions de la Sirène in 1922, and subsequently reissued by Eschig.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 322. Mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori and pianist André Salomon gave the first public performance of Élégie at the Galerie la Boétie in Paris on December 19, 1920. Pierre Bertin premiered the complete cycle at the Galerie Georges Giroux in Brussels, Belgium, on April 12, 1921.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 322. The Quatre petites mélodies stands as one of Satie's more obscure compositions. Biographer Rollo H. Myers (1948) found the Élégie \\"somewhat disconcerting\\" and felt it did not \\"quite 'come off'\\"; he concluded, \\"At all events it cannot be said that there is any attempt here to imitate Debussy's style\\".Rollo H. Myers, Erik Satie, Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, pp. 95-96. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. And Patrick Gowers, writing for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1980, claimed the cycle was \\"less individual\\" than Satie's other forays in mélodies.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 142. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. For his part Satie remained fond of the work. On his deathbed in 1925 he told his young admirer Robert Caby, \\"If you want to learn something about me, look carefully at the Quatre petites mélodies. They are very different, aren't they?\\"Robert Caby, interview with Robert Orledge, Paris, September 13, 1986.

Life Lucas III originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) Péc, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was a son of Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Lucas had four brothers, Gregory, Mark II, Stephen I and Apor.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Péc 1.

Szentgyörgyi branch) Lucas is first mentioned by contemporary records in 1289, when he already served as ispán of Zala County. He held the dignity until mid-1291, when he was replaced by Gregory Kőszegi. Sometimes before 1291, shortly after the death of Bishop Peter Kőszegi, Lucas and his brother Apor successfully besieged and captured Tátika Castle (located near Zalaszántó), which belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszprém. The bishop, Benedict Rád vainly objected at the royal court, but without success. Thereafter, Lucas and his offspring were sometimes called with the title \\"of Tátika\\". However the castle was lost to the Kőszegi family by 1314, when Andrew Kőszegi owned the fort. As a supporter of Andrew III of Hungary in his efforts against the oligarchic powers, including the Kőszegis, Lucas functioned as Master of the treasury in the court of Queen Fenenna of Kuyavia in 1291. He was again made ispán of Zala County by 1298, but it is possible he held the dignity without interruption since 1289, as Gregory Kőszegi could usurp the title in his documents.

BAPSA says it stands for assertion, follows Ambedkarite ideology and is critical of both Left- and Right-wing forces on campus. BAPSA is also active in Central University of Gujarat. Campus activities Founded by members of the United Dalit Students’ Forum, BAPSA conducts rallies and protests, as well as inviting students and teachers from the campus to talk about their issues.

In February 2018, BAPSA protested the Tata Institute of Social Sciences administration’s decision to withdraw financial aid to students from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class communities. JNUSU elections BAPSA has contested the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) polls since 2016.

He was killed in action while taking part in Operation Chastise, popularly known as the 'Dam Busters' raid. Early Life John Hopgood was born on 29 August 1921 in Hurst, Berkshire, to solicitor Harold Hopgood and his second wife Grace. Harold's first wife Beatrice had died in 1918. John was the middle of three children from this second marriage (in addition to two step-brothers from the first) and was educated at Marlborough College. Hopgood's younger sister Elizabeth Bell recalled John as a child: Hopgood was due to go up to the University of Cambridge and study at Corpus Christi College but the outbreak of the Second World War intervened in these plans. Second World War Hopgood joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1940, qualified as a pilot in February 1941 and earned his commission in 1942 when he was promoted to flight lieutenant. October 1942 saw him awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after completing 47 operations, and a Bar to the award in January 1943. His initial service was with No. 50 Squadron, where he completed his first tour before being posted to a training unit. While in service with No. 106 Squadron, Hopgood participated in the air raid on Gdynia in August 1942 and the daylight raid on Le Creusot in October of the same year. It was during the Le Creusot raid that he made a low level attack on an electrical transformer station from 500 feet. The new Commanding Officer of No. 106 Squadron, Guy Gibson, arrived in April 1942 and recorded his first thoughts on Hopgood in his book 'Enemy Coast Ahead': =Dambusters Raid= Gibson selected Hopgood as his deputy for the attack against the Möhne Dam. While awaiting take off Hopgood spoke with Dave Shannon, telling him that he had had a premonition that he would not survive the mission. Gibson responded to the premonition with, \\"Hoppy, tonight's the night; tomorrow we will get drunk\\". Hopgood took off in the first group alongside Gibson and Mick Martin. It was on the journey to the Mönhe that Hopgood's aircraft AJ-M (M Mother) was hit by flak while passing the airfield at Dülmen. Hopgood along with gunners George Gregory and Tony Burcher were injured but they continued the attack. There is a possibility that Gregory was killed by flak at this point. The damaged aircraft reached the dam where they attacked at 00:32, ten minutes after Gibson. However, they were struck again by anti-aircraft fire and their bomb was released too late. It bounced over the dam and exploded on a power station on the other side. The aircraft was fatally damaged at this point and Hopgood remained at the controls, gaining height to allow his crew to bail out. Rear gunner, Pilot Officer Tony Burcher, remembered hearing Hopgood say; \\"Get out you damn fool. If only I could get another 300 ft. I can't get any more height\\". John Fraser, John Minchin and Tony Burcher jumped, but the already injured Minchin did not survive. However, Fraser and Burcher survived and were made prisoners of war. AJ-M crashed in a field near Ostönnen, 6 kilometres (3.72 miles) from the dam. The bodies of Hopgood, Brennan, Navigator Kenneth (Ken) Earnshaw from Bridlington and Gregory were found inside. Hopgood's body rests in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Rheinberg War Cemetery (Coll. grave 17. E. 2-6). Popular culture Hopgood was portrayed in the 1955 feature film The Dam Busters by the actor John Fraser.

Before their divorce in 1914 (she later remarried to the artist Henry Clews Jr. and moved to the Chateau de la Napoule in France), they were the parents of two sons: * Ogden Goelet (1907–1969), who married five times, the first being to Florence Enid Connfelt (1912–1992) in 1933. They divorced in 1938, and later that year, he married Maria Virginia Zimbalist (1915–1981), the daughter of singer Alma Gluck and violinist Efrem Zimbalist. They divorced in March 1941, and in April 1941, he married Mimi Nicholson Browne (1922), whom he also divorced. He later married for the fifth time to Sarah Sherborne Haigh (1908–1989) in 1963, remaining married until his death in 1969. * Peter Goelet (1911–1986) On October 22, 1919, he remarried to Donna Fernanda (née Rocchi), the Princess Riabouchinsky (1885–1982) at the American Church in Paris. Donna was born in Perugia, Italy and was the former wife of Prince Nicholas Riabouchinsky, a close friend of Goelet. The marriage reportedly infuriated his mother, who refused to receive his wife, and she cut him off from his share in her personal fortune, closed her New York home, her Newport home, and went to England to live. They eventually won over his mother four years later after the birth of a son, but the couple divorced in 1924 and she was later known as the Duchess de Villarosa. Donna and Robert were the parents of one son: * Robert Wilson Goelet, Jr. (1921–1989), a film producer who first married Jane Potter Monroe in 1942. They divorced, and in 1949, he remarried to Lynn Merrick. After their marriage, his mother disinherited him. After a \\"stormy\\" marriage, they divorced in 1956. On September 24, 1925, he married for the third time to Roberta Willard (1891–1949), the daughter of Col. Joseph Willard of Newport. Roberta had reportedly been voted \\"the prettiest debutante there in 1916.\\" Both of their mothers were ill and could not attend the wedding, with her mother dying a month later, and his mother, a few years later in 1929. Together they were the parents of a daughter: * Mary Eleanor Goelet (1927-1994) who married (and later divorced) James Eliot Cross in 1949. She later married Harold C. King. Glenmere's southern garden, c. 1920 Following his donation of Ochre Court in 1947, he purchased a home known as Champ Soleil, designed by Polhemus & Coffin and located at 601 Bellevue Avenue in Newport. He served on the boards of Bailey's Beach and the Newport Country Club, both of which were co-founded by his uncle, and which he was one of the largest shareholders. In New York, he was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Harvard Club, Turf Club, the St. Nicholas Society, the Piping Rock Club, and the Tuxedo Club. He also owned a plantation near Charleston, South Carolina, and was the builder of Glenmere mansion, his estate on the Hudson River built in 1911 and designed by Carrère and Hastings, where he entertained Babe Ruth and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Glenmere was a 62-room manor house in the style of an Italian villa set on 1,322 acres. Goelet died at his home, 4 East 66th Street in New York City, on February 6, 1966. His funeral was held at St. Thomas’s and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. He was worth an estimated $50,000,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) at the time of his death. A month after his death, the Chemical Bank of New York, as executor of his estate, listed his New York apartment, which was the entire sixth floor of the building at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 66th Street, for sale for $240,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). In October 1966, Goelet's collection of 18th century French furniture, porcelain, and other valuable objects from his New York and Newport homes were auctioned off by Parke-Bernet in New York. =Descendants= Through his eldest son Ogden, he was the grandfather of Ogden Goelet Jr. and Enid Goelet (1934–2005), who married Ranald Trask McNeil (1933–2013), a graduate of Columbia University School of Painting and Sculpture who served with the U.S. Air Force in Korea, in 1955.

It houses the world's largest collection of Johnny Cash memorabilia and artifacts, including a stone wall taken from his lake house in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and is officially authorized by Cash's estate.  History  Born in 1932 in Kingsland, Arkansas, Johnny Cash is one of the bestselling recording artists of all time. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote and recorded music in a lot of different styles, including country, rockabilly, gospel, blues, and rock and roll, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. His trademark nickname – Man in Black – came from the signature all-black wardrobe he wore for performances. The original museum honoring the star – known as House of Cash – was in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and although Cash lived in the same town for over thirty years, he did not at any time live in the museum.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6543503.stm The House of Cash had been closed for many years and had fallen into a state of disrepair, and appeared in Cash's music video \\"Hurt\\".

The museum opened to the public in 2013 with the restored original House of Cash sign as one of its exhibits.  Location and site details  The 18,000-square-foot museum is located in the busy South of Broadway (SoBro) neighborhood, near 4th Avenue North and the Broadway Avenue SB bus station and at Stop 3 on the Old Town Trolley Tour. It is open daily (except Thanksgiving and Christmas) and charges admission for anyone 6 years and older. Besides exhibits, the museum site has a gift shop stocked with Johnny Cash souvenirs and collectibles, a café and coffee shop, and event space for hosting parties, meetings, banquets, weddings, corporate events, and more. The space is large enough for 200 standing guests or 114 seated guests. Cash's personal chili recipe is served at the onsite café. A museum expansion took place in 2016 to add interactive exhibits, such as technology centers to create mixes of Cash's songs and listen to covers of his music by dozens of artists. Visitors can also pose in front of a green screen to take photos with Cash to take home. The site is wheelchair accessible but does not have its own private parking reserved for museum visitors. Limited street parking is available in the area.  Exhibits  The Johnny Cash Museum chronicles Cash's life, from his early years and Air Force career to his personal life and music career, including memorabilia from his famous prison concerts. Exhibits are arranged in chronological order, with more than 1,000 artifacts on display, consisting of personal items, memorabilia, and interactive exhibits. One example is the \\"Progression of Sound\\" exhibit, which focuses on Cash's crossovers into different styles and genres of music on various types of recording media, including LPs, 8-tracks, and CDs. Another section focuses on Sun Records, the Memphis label that helped launch Cash's career – along with the careers of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and many others. Besides items belonging to Cash, other items in this section include a pair of glasses worn by Roy Orbison, a microphone used by Elvis Presley, and the drum set belonging to \\"Fluke\\" Holland – Cash's friend and drummer for 40 years. (The set was also the first full drum set used on the Grand Ole Opry stage.) Visitors can play video footage of his collaborations with other legendary performers. An exhibit that focuses on his TV and movie career includes clips of Cash hosting his own variety show, clips of his appearances on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and Hee Haw, and various props and costumes from the movie Walk the Line as well as several of Cash's movies. Movie and show posters are also on display. According to Cash's family, he used a folded dollar bill threaded through the strings of his guitar to mimic a percussion sound in the years before he had a drummer. That Martin guitar – with the dollar bill still threaded through the strings – is on display at the museum along with numerous other artifacts, including: * Stage costumes, including his infamous prison jumpsuit costume * Handwritten letters and notes * Handwritten lyrics, including the lyrics from the last song he wrote days before his death * Yearbook page * Vintage guitar amps * Air Force uniform and other Air Force memorabilia * Gold and platinum records * Numerous music instruments * School report cards * Cash family piano * Highwaymen memorabilia * Grammy and CMA awards * Bag of cotton from childhood home in Dyess, Arkansas * Personal belongings, such as photographs, items from his home, and his personal bible * Birth certificate * Future Farmers of America card The most recent full exhibit – added in February 2018 – focuses on Cash's all-black look and his history with the man who helped him create it, Manuel Cuevas.

He was the count of Molfetta from 1068 until his death and of Giovinazzo from 1068 until 1073. He came from a prominent family often opposed to the rule of the Hautevilles. In 1067–68, 1072–73 and 1079–80 he took part in rebellions against the Hauteville Duke of Apulia. In 1067 and 1079 he received aid from Byzantium against the duke. Family tree of the \\"sons of Amicus\\" In 1074–75, Amicus invaded Croatia in support of the Papacy in a dispute with the Croatian king. He captured the king, Petar Krešimir IV, paving the way for coronation of the Papacy's ally, Dmitar Zvonimir. He probably intended to carve out for himself a principality there, but he was defeated by the Republic of Venice (acting on behalf of Byzantium) and returned to Italy. In 1081–82, Amicus participated in the invasion of Byzantium. He led the right wing at the Battle of Dyrrhachium. His bungled attack almost cost the Normans the victory, and he endeavoured to redeem himself by charging the emperor, which was nearly successful. By 1093 he had been succeeded by his son Godfrey. Descent Amicus II belonged to a family known to modern scholars as the \\"sons of Amicus\\". His grandfather and namesake, Amicus I, lived in Normandy before 1030. Two of the latter's sons, Walter and Peter I, arrived in Italy before 1038. Walter was the father of Amicus II and Peter of Lesina. Amicus was thus the first cousin of Peter I's sons, Geoffrey of Taranto and Peter II of Trani. The family was related—how is not known—to the Hauteville family. Lands Amicus acquired lands in several places across southern Italy, as well as the lordships of Giovinazzo, Molfetta, Spinazzola and Terlizzi. On 26 June 1066 in Molfetta, Amicus and his father-in-law made a donation to the Abbey of the Santissima Trinità in Venosa. He also possessed lands in Campomarino that he gave to the Abbey of Santa Maria a Mare in the Tremiti Islands. Amicus' family was active in the conquest of Apulia. His cousin, Peter II, took Trani in 1054, and his cousin, Geoffrey, took Taranto in 1063 and Otranto in 1064. These conquests were made on their own initiative and the cities were held by them by right of conquest. According to the Anonymous Chronicle of Bari, Amicus entered the small coastal town of Giovinazzo in 1068, a euphemistic way of saying he conquered it from the Byzantines. Amicus may have been given Giovinazzo (or its tribute) as early as 1058. That he did not, however, possess it at the start of the rebellion of 1067 is suggested by the fact that the Norman chronicler Amatus of Montecassino does not refer to him by any territory, but simply as Ami de Galtier, that is, Amicus son of Walter. Likewise in 1068, with the rebellion crushed, Amicus' father-in-law fled to Greece and Amicus took over the port city of Molfetta. Amicus' was pardoned after his failed rebellion and forfeited only some minor properties. By October 1069 he had acquired the lordship of Spinazzola, probably by ducal grant. He is called Amico de Spiencello in a charter issued by the duke's chancery. At some point in the next decade, Amicus built a wall around Spinazzola, as the chronicle William of Apulia notes when recording the duke's capture of the town in 1080. Amicus of else his son Godfrey was responsible for the Norman-era fortification of Terlizzi, of which only the square tower still stands. Following the second failed rebellion in 1073, however, Robert Guiscard confiscated Giovinazzo (which had gone over to his allegiance during the revolt). Amicus did retain Spinazzola, Terlizzi (acquired sometime earlier) and Molfetta after 1073. On 5 September 1073, Amicus founded and made a donation to the church of Saint Michael the Archangel in Terlizzi, which later became the cathedral. The witnesses present were his vassals Bernard Lautard and Azo, the notary Melo and the former Byzantine tourmarches Pantaleon. The donation made no mention of Duke Robert. Following the third and final rebellion in 1078, Amicus was deprived of Spinazzola as well as his land on Mount Serico (today Castello di Monteserico, part of Genzano di Lucania). Early rebellions Robert had to deal with four rebellions: in 1067–68, 1072–73, 1079–80 and 1082–83. Only in the last of these did Amicus not join the rebels. =1067–68= There is disagreement among scholars concerning the dating of the first revolt. The Anonymous Chronicle of Bari has it beginning, under the leadership of Amicus' father-in-law Joscelin of Molfetta, in 1064, but there is little indication of military activity between that year and 1067. It is possible there were three separate but related revolts in 1064 (led by Joscelin), 1066 (Abelard) and 1067–68 (Amicus). The revolt led by Amicus began between September and November 1067 while Guiscard was in Calabria. Among the other rebels were Joscelin, as well as Roger Toutebove and Guiscard's own disaffected nephews, Count Geoffrey of Conversano and the dispossessed Abelard. The rebellion received Byzantine financing. According to Amatus of Montecassino, Amicus himself was \\"lent … 100 hundredweight of gold\\" to spread the revolt, in exchange for which he sent a son as a hostage to Leo Perenos, the Byzantine duke of Dyrrhachium who was organizing the revolt. Amatus stresses that Guiscard moved quickly to suppress the first challenge to his rule, campaigning in the autumn of 1067 and into 1068. The beginning of the Siege of Bari in August 1068 suggests that the revolt had collapsed early that year, to allow enough time for Guiscard to prepare a major military operation against the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy. Following their defeat, Joscelin and Roger Toutebove fled to Constantinople, while Amicus and Guiscard's nephews were pardoned, losing only a few lands. Amicus and Abelard were present with the ducal entourage soon after. As an incentive to obedience, they were offered the opportunity to recover the lands they had lost or else receive new lands. By October 1069 Amicus had acquired the new lordship of Spinazzola. =1072–73= The cause of the second revolt was Guiscard's order to Peter II to hand over Taranto, which he was governing on behalf of his young nephew, Richard, son of Geoffrey. Peter refused to comply and the pardoned rebels of 1067, Amicus and Abelard, supported him. The rebellion was also joined by Abelard's half-brother Herman, the Calabrian baron Robert Areng and Count Richard of Monte Sant'Angelo. Through the latter's contact, the rebels gained the support of the Prince Richard I of Capua, the main rival of the Hautevilles in Italy. The second revolt went badly. Guiscard captured Trani on 2 February 1073 and shortly afterwards Duke Guy of Sorrento captured Peter in a skirmish outside Andria. This time Amicus was deprived of Giovinazzo, although he held onto Molfetta and was allowed to keep Spinazzola and Terlizzi. Herman was captured during the revolt, but Abelard remained defiant in Calabria and did not make peace with the duke until early 1078. Amicus never recovered Giovinazzo. After Guiscard's death (1085), it was granted to his son Bohemond as part of the succession settlement in 1086. Invasion of Croatia Italy and the Adriatic in Amicus' time. He captured Spalato (Split) in 1074 and took part in the battle of Durazzo (Dyrrhacium). In 1060, the synod of Split outlawed the Old Church Slavonic liturgy in the Croatian church and replaced it with the Latin rite. This sparked a rebellion on the island of Krk in 1064. At the same time as the church was seeking to enforce the synodal decrees of 1060, King Petar Krešimir IV was extending his authority over the Dalmatian coast. In 1069, he was made imperial representative in the Theme of Dalmatia. After 1074, Krešimir disappears from the sources; there is no further record of him, including no mention of his death. Dmitar Zvonimir, erstwhile ban of Slavonia, was crowned king in the fall of 1075. It was during the period from the fall of Krešimir to the coronation of Zvonimir that Amicus was active in Dalmatia. At the time, the papal legate to Croatia was Gerard, who, as the archbishop of Siponto, was almost a neighbour of Amicus in southern Italy. It was probably his idea to use Amicus to help place Zvonimir, considered an ally of Rome, on the throne. Having been recently deprived of his lordship of Giovinazzo, Amicus was probably easily persuaded to make his fortune in Dalmatia. He was almost certainly promised land or a principality of his own as a reward. It is unlikely that the invitation of Amicus took place without Pope Gregory VII's knowledge. Guiscard, on the other hand, had been excommunicated in 1074 and Amicus would not have felt any need to seek his permission. Formally, Amicus was invited to Dalmatia by the communes of Split, Trogir, Zadar and Biograd. He embarked in the autumn of 1074, probably from Molfetta, which was in his control, or possibly from Ancona further up the coast. He occupied several coastal cities, including Split. In November, Gerard held another synod at Split to reaffirm the decisions of 1060. According to a synodal document, it took place \\"at the time when duke Amicus took the Croatian king prisoner.\\" Although it does not named the king, Petar Krešimir must be meant. A letter of Pope Gregory VII to Stephen II, bishop of Zadar, dated to 1075, also mentions the capture of Petar Krešimir by Amicus. This is the last mention of Krešimir in any source. According to one source, it was while capturing the stronghold of Novalja on the island of Pag that Amicus captured the king. It has been argued that the Croatian king whom Amicus captured was not Petar Krešimir, but rather a certain Slavac, a champion of the Old Church Slavonic liturgy, who had succeeded the childless Krešimir upon the latter's death in late 1073 or early 1074, when his nephew Stephen was judged unfit and forced to enter a monastery. Gregory VII allegedly encouraged the expedition of Amicus to remove Slavac and restore the Latin rite. The reign of Slavac is known only from a Renaissance source, Johannes Lucius. In fact, there was no 11th-century king of that name, but rather a 12th-century nobleman who was mistaken for a king by later generations. While the Croatian king was in captivity, it seems that negotiations between the Papacy, the ban and the Norman count were ongoing. In a letter to Sweyn II of Denmark on 25 January 1075, Gregory VII writes that an unnamed Danish bishop had intimated that Sweyn might be willing to send one of his sons with an army to assist the Roman church against its enemies in a land which Gregory does not name but which was almost certainly Croatia. The Danish plan came to nothing and Zvonimir was crowned by Abbot Gebizo with regalia gifted by the pope at Solin on 9 October 1076 after swearing an oath to the papacy. In the spring of 1075, according to a late source, Amicus attacked the coast of the Gulf of Quarnero. Between 14 April and 9 May (Translation of Saint Nicholas), he besieged the town of Rab on the island of the same name. The Miracula Sancti Christophori of Bishop Juraj Koštica, written towards 1308, reports that \\"a large group of Varangians\\" assaulted Rab. He provides dates, but no year, although from context it appears it can refer only to the expedition of Amicus who, as a Norman, could be described as a \\"Varangian\\" (Viking). By 8 February 1075, however, Amicus had been substantially defeated through Venetian intervention. He had lost control of the Dalmatian cities of Split, Trogir, Zadar and Biograd, for on that date the Venetian doge, Domenico Selvo, exacted an oath from four cities that they would never again allow the Normans in. Although Venice had been encouraged by the Byzantines to remove the Normans from Dalmatia (which Krešimir had only governed as a Byzantine province), the Venetian treaty with the Dalmatian cities made no reference to Byzantine authority: \\"Venice was now a fully autonomous state exercising its sovereignty without reference to any higher authority\\". Third rebellion In 1078, Robert provoked a third revolt when he demanded an aid (auxilium) from his barons for the dowry of his daughter Gersent, betrothed to Hugh, son of Azzo II, marquis of Este. The revolt began in early 1079, when Peter II seized Trani, which had been confiscated from him in 1073. He was soon joined by Amicus and other inveterate opponents of Guiscard: his nephews Abelard, Herman, Geoffrey and now Geoffrey's brother, Count Robert of Montescaglioso; Count Henry of Monte Sant'Angelo, brother of Richard; and a certain baron named Baldwin. Argyritzos, former leader of the pro-Norman faction in Bari, had arranged the marriage of his daughter to Abelard in 1078. He threw his support behind the rebels and negotiated aid from Byzantium. Abelard had also arranged the marriage of his sister to a certain Gradilon, probably one of the leaders of the Slavic communities in northern Apulia. Through the Count of Monte Sant'Angelo, Prince Jordan I of Capua, who had succeeded his father in 1078, lent his support to the rebels. The square tower of Terlizzi, much modified over the years, was built by Amicus or his son. Amicus appears to have been recognised as the senior rebel, since William of Apulia labels him the \\"most learned (experienced) count and ally\\". With Peter II, he marched on Giovinazzo. Defended by William, son of Ivo, the town remained loyal to Guiscard. The cousins put it to siege, but it was relieved by the arrival of a sizeable army under Guiscard's son Roger Borsa. It received an exemption from all taxes for three years in reward for its loyalty. In the fall of 1079, Guiscard negotiated an agreement with Jordan of Capua, which destroyed the rebels' hope of outside support. Soon after Amicus made peace. In early 1080, Peter surrendered Trani and the rebellion came to an end. Even before Amicus had surrendered, Guiscard had confiscated Spinazzola and granted it to Godfrey, one of Amicus' vassals who had not joined him in revolt. Amicus' land on Mount Serico was likewise confiscated. Between 1072 and 1080, documents survive from Terlizzi dated by the reigns of the Byzantine emperors. Amicus appears to have allowed this so as to prevent his subjects from recognising Duke Robert. His cousin Peter II followed a similar policy. In 1080 it came to an end and private documents from Amicus' domains (and Peter's) are dated from then on by the regnal year of \\"most invincible Lord Robert, duke of Italy, Calabria and Sicily\\". Also from this time Amicus was represented in Terlizzi by a viscount, Urso, perhaps delegated to enforce the new permanent peace. Loyal vassal Having made his peace, which turned out to be permanent, Amicus took part in Robert Guiscard's attack on the Byzantine Empire in 1081, which culminated in the fall of Dyrrhachium in February 1082 after an eight- month siege. He led the right wing at the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Anna Komnene, daughter of the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, is the primary source for the battle. She calls Amicus Amiketas. Amicus' wing faced the Byzantine wing under Gregory Pakourianos to the north. Anna records that Amicus, leading a \\"formation of infantry and cavalry\\"—his entire wing—\\"struck near to the extremity of the battle line of Nabites\\", one of the Varangian generals. The charge was repulsed, with some men fleeing towards the sea while some Byzantines, believe the battle over, plundered the Norman baggage. Seeking to redeem himself, Amicus then led a small detachment to charge at Alexios himself and his guard of cavalry. The emperor barely escaped Amicus' lance, but the disorderly behaviour of his troops had rattled the emperor's Dukljan allies, who abandoned the field. Alexios then called a retreat and the Normans were victorious. Amicus did not take part in Guiscard's invasion of Cephalonia in 1085, during which the latter died. He remained loyal to the duke's successor, Roger Borsa. He was recorded with Roger in Calabria in May 1087. Marriage and issue Ruins of Santa Maria a Mare today. Amicus was married to a daughter (name unknown) of Count Joscelin of Molfetta. With her he had at least one son named Godfrey or Geoffrey (fl. 1089–1105). Having in effect acquired Molfetta through Godfrey's mother, Amicus was able to pass it on to his son despite the loss of his other lands through confiscation for rebellion. Godfrey also inherited from his father the castle of Terlizzi, a connection to Dalmatia and possibly a rebellious spirit. He was returning from Dalmatia, quite possibly from exile, when he passed through the Tremiti Islands in 1092 or 1093. In August 1093 he restored to the Abbey of Santa Maria a Mare the two properties in Campomarino that his father had donated because that God had \\"restored him to his power\\", suggesting that he had been temporarily out of power. In 1098, a document refers to Godfrey as an \\"imperial sebastos\\", suggesting a continued link with Byzantium. When his father's old ally Herman left on the First Crusade in 1097, Godfrey took control of his fief at Cannae. In the event, Herman died on crusade. Godfrey himself was dead by October 1107. Roger (fl. 1120–29), \\"son and heir of Count Godfrey\\", seems to have lost both Molfetta and the rights in Campomarino, but retained Terlizzi. Count Robert II of Loritello took control of Campomarino and Godfrey's grant of 1093 was voided, only for Robert to grant the same two properties anew to the Abbey of Santa Maria a Mare in 1111. Unlike his father and grandfather, Roger did not use the title of count, suggesting a clear diminution of his authority. A certain William, count of Cannae in 1117, may have been another son of Count Godfrey, but there is no proof.

A number of guns were also converted to railway guns during World War I in order to meet a need for heavy artillery. Design The Canon de 19 C modèle 1875 were typical built-up guns of the period with mixed construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and several layers of iron reinforcing hoops. In French service guns of mixed steel/iron construction were designated in centimeters while all steel guns were designated in millimeters. However, reference materials do not always distinguish the difference in construction and use either unit of measurement. The guns used a de Bange breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The mle 1875 was mounted on a number of different models of garrison mounts with limited traverse. One exception was the GPC mount which was a rectangular steel firing platform which sat on top of a large circular steel track embedded in concrete behind a parapet. A rectangular steel firing platform with four wheels rotated on the track and gave 360° of traverse. The recoil system for the mle 1875 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Railway guns In order to address a need for heavy artillery a number of mle 1875's were converted to railway guns. The conversion entailed removing the gun cradle from its carriage and mounting it on one of three different types of rail carriage. Carriage Types: * The first designated 19 cm Canon G modèle 1916 was a convertible two-axle Schneider design that allowed the rail bogies to be replaced with road wheels so it could be towed by an artillery tractor to the front. This version retained the inclined hydro-gravity recoil system of its predecessor and its rear axle was taller than the front to assist returning the gun to battery after firing. This carriage had three wooden beams attached to the axles which were lowered to lay across the tracks by screw jacks to take weight off of the axles. Elevation was +40° and range was but there was no traverse so in order to aim the gun had to be drawn across a section of curved track. All versions had an attachment at the front of the carriage for a tie bar which attached to an earth anchor to help anchor the guns in place and an ammunition hoist on the rear of the carriage. On November 11 1917 there were fifty mle 1916's in service. * The second designated 19 cm Canon G modèle 1917 was a simpler two-axle flatbed carriage built from steel I beams and timbers. On this carriage, the gun cradle was mounted horizontally with a hydro-spring recoil system where the hydraulic buffer absorbed the recoil and a spring (or a system of hundreds of rubber bands, adopted due to spring breakage in cold weather) returned the gun to battery after firing. This carriage had three wooden beams attached to the center of the wagon which were lowered to lay across the tracks by screw jacks to take weight off of the axles. Elevation was largely the same as mle 1916 but there was no traverse so in order to aim the gun had to be drawn across a section of curved track or placed on a turntable which took two days to assemble before use. On November 11 1918 there were twenty-eight mle 1917's in service. * Lastly, there was a simple three-axle flatbed carriage built from steel I beams and timbers. This version retained the inclined hydro-gravity recoil system of its predecessor. This carriage had three wooden beams with one between each axle which were lowered lay across the tracks by screw jacks to take weight off of the axles. Elevation was largely the same as the other versions but there was no traverse so in order to aim the gun had to be drawn across a section of curved track.

Historically, bosniakisation was directed mainly towards some other South Slavic groups, like ethnic Muslims (Muslimani) in former Yugoslavia. Since Bosniaks are Sunni Muslims, Bosniakisation was also manifested towards some distinctive ethnoreligious minorities within Serbian and Croatian national corpus, mainly towards Serbian Muslims and Croatian Muslims. History This process was initiated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, originally during the period of Austro-Hungarian administration (1878–1918), when the first political projects were designed to create an integral \\"Bosnian\\", and then a special \\"Bosniak\\" nation. An integral \\"Bosnian\\" project proved to be unachievable even during the Austro-Hungarian administration, since not only the Bosnian Serbs, but also the Bosnian Croatians gave a determined resistance to the creation of an integral \\"Bosnian\\" nation. Therefore, the focus was transferred to a special \\"Bosniak\\" project, which acquired a certain foothold in the Bosnian- Herzegovinian governor. The key role in the design and implementation of these projects was played by Austro-Hungarian Minister Benjamin Kalai, who from 1882 to 1903 was responsible for Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a foothold for Bosniak ethnogenesis and history, Bogomilism and a non-Slavic origin had been contrived. Then after the direct influence of the Ottoman Conquest, a cultural identity was imposed (through the process of Islamization). This gave to the ultimate expression of a Bosniak specificity, which has led to the religious doctrine of ethnos. The Bosniak project was restarted at the time of the breakup of Yugoslavia, when Yugoslavian Muslims decided to rename themselves ethnic \\"Bosniaks\\". This process initially affected much of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then spread to northeastern Montenegro and southwestern Serbia, including the Raška region, as well as parts of Kosovo and Metohija. Bosniakisation was often manifested through cultural and educational programs. In 1996, the Atlantic Council of the United States noted that \\"Non-Muslims in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and other areas under Bosniak control feel increasingly alienated in their own communities as a result of a wide array of government decisions, from the \\"Bosniakization\\" of the school curriculum\\". Specific forms of Bosniakisation were also integrated into linguistic policy, and perception of regional history. Insisting on the imposition of Bosniaks and the spreading of a Bosniak project outside of Bosnia, a controversy erupted on the part of Yugoslav ethnic Muslims primarily in Serbia and Montenegro. In opposing the imposition of Bosniaks, president of the Muslim Matica in Montenegro, Dr. Avdul Kurpejović explicitly stressed in 2014 that the \\"Greater Bosniak Nationalist, Islamic Assimilation Program\\" is based exactly on the Islamic Declaration of Alija Izetbegović.Авдул Курпејовић (2014): Муслимани су национална мањина A number of Gorani people were a subject of Bosniakisation in recent history.

She was best known for her piano playing and soprano voice. Between 1910 and 1920, she toured with Jack Kammerer, an acrobatic comedian. Billed as Kammerer & Howland, the duo described themselves as a “Classical Comedy Singing and Talking Act,” and as performers of “Jollity and Jingles Mirthfully Mingled.” Howland retired from show business in the early 1920s. Early life and career Edna Howland was born Sadie Edna Howland on September 22, 1886, to Benjamin L. Howland and Mary (Murray) Howland, in Somerset, Massachusetts. Her father, Benjamin L. Howland, served in the American Civil War. He spent eight months as a prisoner of war after the Second Battle of the Weldon Railroad.Special Schedules of the Eleventh Census (1890) Enumerating Union Veterans and Widows of Union Veterans of the Civil War.

Howland's first documented piano solo was at a church social given by the Junior Society of the Stewart Street Baptist Church. In 1902, Howland began taking piano lessons from Mr. and Mrs. Ernst Fischer. The Fischers were educated at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig, founded by Felix Mendelssohn. They instructed in singing, piano, harmony, and composition from their studio in the Conrad Building on Westminster Street. During her years as a pupil of the Fischers, Howland frequently performed classical piano music for public audiences. She was featured in numerous public recitals hosted by the Fischers. In 1907, Howland headlined a benefit for the Women's Christian Temperance Union at Frances Willard Hall on Snow Street. A year later she joined Providence Mayor, Patrick J. McCarthy, to entertain members of the Rhode Island Pharmaceutical Association at their annual conference. Kammerer & Howland Early Kammerer & Howland publicity photo by Smales Studio, Providence, RI In June 1909, Howland began making weekly appearances as a performer of illustrated songs at the Bijou theatre, one of Providence's many vaudeville houses. The Bijou was specifically designed as a venue for illustrated songs, which were performed between films, and a pianist like Howland would play nine programs per day at six days per week.> Howland soon formed an act with local comedian, Jack Kammerer (later known as Jack Cameron), which they described as “Kammerer & Howland -- A Classical Comedy Singing and Talking Act”. In 1911, the two joined Fred Homan's Musical Stock Company at the Scenic Temple on Matthewson Street. Eddie Dowling was also an actor in Homan's company. The company dissolved after two years, but not without leaving a lasting impression on Rhode Island theatregoers. In 1913, Kammerer & Howland started touring North American on Marcus Loew’s vaudeville circuit. They were known for comedic songs, clever banter, acrobatic dancing, and for Kammerer’s impersonations of Ford Sterling, Charlie Chaplin, and Bert Williams. Kammerer & Howland shared bills with major vaudeville names, such as Will Rogers and Marie Stoddard. When Kammerer joined the White Rats of America, a labor union organized by theatre employees in an effort to destabilize the Vaudeville Managers Association, Howland did not. Women were not permitted to join. In 1918, Kammerer & Howland entered American burlesque when they were cast in Max Spiegel’s Social Follies. Billboard’s burlesque critic wrote: “Edna Howland as an ingenue appears to good advantage by interspersing some real comedy into her actions, singing and dancing, all of which she does well.” While on tour with Pat White's Gaiety Girls, Howland gave birth to her only child, Donald L. Kammerer, born on May 28, 1920, in St. Louis, Missouri. The Gaiety Girls cast included Joe Yule and Nell Carter, who welcomed their only child, Mickey Rooney, while on the same tour. After the birth of their son, Kammerer & Howland ended their professional and romantic relationship. Howland returned to Providence, RI, with their son and proceeded to sue Kammerer for divorce on grounds of neglect and extreme cruelty. In 1923, Howland was awarded custody of Donald, as well as a provision of ten dollars per week. Kammerer and Howland advertise a new act in The New York Clipper. September 5, 1917.

They married in New York City and lived in New Jersey. By 1935, they were divorced and Howland had returned to Providence. She rented an apartment on Friendship Street, where she lived with her son, Donald, and worked as a housekeeper. Howland and her son performed music locally as part of an ensemble organized by Mrs. Eli E. Wilcox. Sadie Edna (Howland) Lindstrom died on October 14, 1964.

Her works include, Thoughts of Peace, Appointed Paths, and Book of Poems, as well as Arctic hospitality: a play. Early years and education Annie Batchelder Stevens was born in Salem, Massachusetts, April 12, 1868. She was the daughter of Charles Kimball and Mary E. (Batchelder) Stevens. When she was a year old, the family removed from Salem to Somerville, where she lived nearly sixteen years, and attended the primary, grammar and high schools. She had fond memories of her Prescott School life, which was spent wholly under the principalship of Gordon A. Southworth. She also attended Somerville High School, completing half of the college course. Perkins began to write verse at the age of eight. Her first published work appeared in the Radiator, the Somerville High School paper, in 1882. She was a member of its editorial staff. In June, 1884, the family removed to Lynnfield from which town Perkins attended the Salem Normal School (now Salem State University), completing the course in two years and graduating in June, 1887, being the poet of her class. The following year, at the triennial gathering of the alumni of the school, she was invited to write and read the poem. Career Perkins taught in the public school for a short time previous to marriage, and had many private pupils. Her early work, both stories and verse, was published in the Salem Gazette, Watchman, Golden Rule, the Silver Cross, the Contributor, and other periodicals. She was for a considerable time connected with the Daily Evening Item, \\"Lynn\\", as correspondent from her town, sustaining pleasant relations with that paper, as also, in the same capacity, with the Citizen and Banner, Wakefield, Massachusetts and was for a number of years doing regular work for the Normal Instructor, New York City, contributing exercises, verse, reports, articles, and songs. Primary Plans, the periodical published by the same house, used much of her work, and the editor gave her charge of the music page, which appeared regularly, and to which she contributed original rote and motion songs. She was inspired by the work of Professor S. Henry Hadley, supervisor of music of Somerville, and Dr. Daniel B. Hagar, of Salem Normal School, with regard to the fostering of her musical tastes. Professor George F. Wilson, supervisor of music in Wakefield and Beverly schools, used verse written by Perkins for his songs for different grades, requesting it as needed. Perkins' work for the Suburban brought her considerable local prominence, the series of illustrated articles on \\"The Pipe Organ in Suburban Homes\\" having attracted much favorable notice. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins were enthusiastic camera workers, especially interior work. The Suburban published a considerable amount of their work in this line. Besides the illustrated work, her stories and songs appeared from lime to time in that periodical. As editor of the department of \\"The Home and the School,\\" in the Suburban, Boston, Perkins had an opportunity for fostering co-operation of parents and teachers. Stories were published for the children's page of Youth's Companion, Our Little Ones, the Well-spring, and other periodicals. Through Mrs. Bemis, editor of the Normal Instructor, New York, Perkins was some time ago put into touch with Dr. Mary Wood-Allen, of the American Mother, to which magazine Perkins became a contributor of sketches, juvenile stories, and articles on the training of children from the mother-teacher point of view. In reference to her style of writing, Perkins said:—\\" If there is some word I want to speak to any friend or friends, I simply tell it as sweetly as I know how in verse, and that is all.\\" A quatrain which appeared in the Teachers' World with other verses, was used as a memory gem in many schools, and was proven to be a favorite with hundreds of little pupils. It reads:— \\"When the beautiful stars peep out one by one, ⁠As I look far up and away, How sweet to be able to whisper to God, ⁠I've made some one happy to-day!\\" Thoughts of Peace, a book of verse, and Appointed Paths, a story for girls, were published by James H. Earle, of Boston. These had positive reviews by the Congregationalist and other papers, notably, Teachers World (1897) commented:— \\"Appointed Paths, by Annie Stevens Perkins, is a good, wholesome, elevating story, full of wise counsel and stimulating thought. The story is well told and interest is sustained to the last chapter. It is a good book for the home circle.\\" Perkins was a member of the New England Woman's Press Association, and of the Kosmos Club of Wakefield. She wrote many poems for public occasions in her town, such as a poem written and read on the occasion of the dedicating of the new Town Hall being published in the History of Lynnfield. A poem written in honor of the naming of the Daniel Townsend Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (D. A. R.), Lynn, was read by her at the exercises in the old Town Hall and afterward, by request, at an afternoon meeting of the D. A. R. at their headquarters in Boston. At the Old Home Day exercises of Lynnfield, held at Suntaug Lake in August, 1903, she also read a poem written for the occasion. Personal life On November 28, 1889, she married John Winslow Perkins, of Lynnfield, and went to live in the cottage built for the young couple on the Perkins farm, which has been in the family since 1700, this being the date of the erection of the homestead. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins had one child, a son named John (1898–1910). As a member of the Congregational Church of Lynnfield Centre, Perkins found opportunity for religious work, having a class of young women in the Bible school and serving as clerk of the church, besides assisting in the music on Sundays.

Education and early career  Wallis received her Bachelors of Science in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Manchester in 1995. She received her PhD in Experimental Psychology and Anatomy from the University of Cambridge, where she worked in the laboratory of . Career and research Wallis moved to the United States for her postdoctoral research fellowship in the laboratory of Earl K. Miller studying neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex, or the region of the brain that plays a key role in executive functions, which allow animals to coordinate appropriate responses to plan, reason, problem solve, and effectively reach goals. There, she explored the neural basis of how the prefrontal cortex encodes abstract rules to inform decisions under different circumstances. Wallis's research centers on understanding how the frontal cortex of the brain is functionally organized to help people set and attain goals at the level of single neurons. Decision making requires weighing the costs and benefits of different courses of action. Wallis's group has investigated how cost-benefit analysis is undertaken in the brain to make effective decisions by monitoring single neuronal activity. They trained monkeys to make decisions that required integrating reward that required a certain amount of effort cost or a certain amount of delay cost. They found that single prefrontal cortex neurons played a role in encoding the type of cost decision the monkeys faced. The finding built on Wallis's previous work that found individual neurons in this region encoded several decision attributes, such as the probability of reward, the magnitude of the reward, and how much effort that reward would require. Her research group also found that neurons involved in associating stimuli with certain rewarding outcomes are found in the orbitofrontal cortex, while neurons involved in associating actions with certain rewarding outcomes are found in the anterior cingulate cortex. Wallis's group has also studied the dynamics of decision making in both humans and monkeys over the period of time over which they are making a particular decision. Using primate neurophysiology and human magnetoencephalography, they measured how brain activity changed as primates and humans were making different decisions. Their findings were consistent with a mathematical model of decision making, drawing connections between economic models of choice and the underlying neuroscience. In a different study, Wallis's group was able to deduce neuronal signatures as the brains of monkeys evaluate different choices, tracking the dynamics of neurons firing over time and space in the orbitofrontal cortex of the brain. When considering two options, the group of neurons associated with each of the two options would alternate firing, flipping back and forth between the two options before finally deciding. Her research is currently supported by two Research Project Grants (R01) awarded by the National Institute of Mental Health — one for the Functional Architecture of the Oribitofrontal Cortex awarded in 2014 and the other for the Frontostriatal Rhythms Underlying Reinforcement Learning awarded in 2018. The ultimate goal of her group's work is to better understand how to develop treatments for mental illness. She was first drawn to the field after her PhD supervisor introduced her to patients who sustained damage to their orbitofrontal cortex and had difficulty making decisions, despite having other cognitive processes intact.

This article includes those fact-finding publications issued by the United Nations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/ civil society entities. This article focuses on listing fact-finding reports, which distinguish themselves from other publications such as pamphlets, news articles, books, or journal articles, in that they are meant to aggregate information from multiple sources and provide a balanced, overall view of the topic covered for the non-commercial purpose of informing the general public and policy makers. These reports tend to rely more on the credibility of their publishing institutions than on their individual authors. Fact-finding reports are also distinct from policy briefs as the latter ground their analysis and recommendations on the facts laid out in the former. The inclusion is based on the notability (and not the concurrence to any particular view) of the publishing institutions to the inquiry and deliberations on the situation in North Korea. This list lays out the evolution of the reporting efforts, with a first wave of reports by human rights NGOs just describing the general characteristics of the regime, followed by another wave of civil society and governmental reports with some more details, then prompting the United Nations to also exercise greater scrutiny and pursue its own investigations. The vast majority of reports (except those published by the DPRK itself, also included in this article) point to a very grave situation, with human rights systematically violated by the North Korean government. Efforts to continue to investigate and document the situation of human rights in the DPRK are on- going, given that there are no indications of substantial improvements in the regime's policies, and despite the continued isolation of the regime that limits outside investigators' access to the country and to its general population. Introduction and overview =Historical context= The Korean peninsula, with China and Russia as its Northern neighbors, and Japan to the East and South Korea had for centuries been a high-ranking tributary state within the Imperial Chinese tributary system,Kang, David C. (2010). until in the late 19th century Japan began to assert greater control over the Korean peninsula, culminating in its annexation in 1910. It remained a colony of Japan, until Japan lost World War II in 1945.The Abacus and the Sword; Duus, Peter; Univ of California Press, 1995; pp. 18–24 At the end of WWII, with Japan stripped of its colonial territories, the Korean peninsula became a United Nations trusteeship, with the northern half administered by the Soviet Union, and the southern half administered by the United States. The ultimate stated plan was to allow Korea as a whole to become again a united and independent country. Disagreements among the parties on how and when to implement the united self-rule led to the two territories established their own separate and rival governments. The Korean War (1950-1953) was the last attempt to reunify the peninsula by force, but it ended in stalemate and it entrenched two very different regimes. Within the Soviet and American spheres respectively, the North became a Stalinist totalitarian regime uninterruptedly led by the Kim family, and the South became a capitalist society that until 1987 included short periods of unstable democracy as well as longer periods of authoritarian rule, including over 25 years of right-wing military rule. Propped by their allies, North and South experienced rapid economic growth after the Korean War, but in the 1970s the North's growth faltered while the South's accelerated. 2014 Night satellite photograph of the Korean peninsula; showing the bordering territories of China and Russia at the top, North Korea in the center, and South Korea in the bottom-right While South Korea had a period of military autocracy, mass mobilizations of its citizens forced its end in 1987. This led to the modern South Korea being a young, more stable democracy with a prosperous free market economy. Meanwhile, North Korea's totalitarian regime kept a stronger grip on its society, which was never able to mobilize to demand reforms. Its command economy stagnated in the 1970s, and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union it spiralled into crisis in the 1990s, leading to a massive famine. North Korea remains to this day as one of the most isolated countries in the world, with a struggling economy, within an isolationist, militaristic, and totalitarian regime. =Chronology and major themes= The reporting of human rights in the DPRK follows the progression of the modern movement of human rights, which from the 1970s civil society and governmental efforts made violations more visible to the general public and in international politics. Given the opacity of the DPRK's regime, especially before the 1990s, little was known about the situation of human rights. The few reports that were issued at that time made note of the lack of concrete information, mostly only being able to describe the general characteristics of the country's political system. Amnesty International, founded in 1961, began to issue some basic reports on the DPRK in 1977. In 1979 the US's Department of State also began to cover the DPRK in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent North Korean famine of the 1990s, a higher number of individuals began to flee the country, and more first-person accounts began to be collected by human rights organizations. That was also followed in the early 2000s by greater availability of satellite imagery. South Korea, having itself transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy in the late 1980s, began to publish reports in 1996 through its governmental think tank Korea Institute for National Unification. In the late 1990s and 2000s several NGOs specialized on North Korea emerged and began to publish their own research: Citizens' Alliance for North Korean Human Rights (1996), Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (2001), Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (2003), People for Successful Corean Reunification (2006). Around the same time some other world-wide human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity Worldwide also began to publish reports on the DPRK. As reports from NGOs and governments began to reveal more details on the human rights situation in the DPRK during the 1990s and 2000s, these concerns were elevated to the United Nations, where various UN bodies and parties also began to express a growing concern on the situation and opacity of the regime. The mounting evidence being collected and published by governments and civil society led in 2004 to the establishment of the mandate for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK, issuing reports annually. The growing amount of information, and the grave situation it increasingly revealed, led the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) to repeatedly pass resolutions officially expressing their concerns and urging the DPRK's government to change its ways. Ten years later, further joint efforts by the UN Special Rapporteur, governments, and NGOs led to the establishment of a special one-time investigation unprecedented in depth and breadth commissioned by the Human Rights Council, with a landmark report published in 2014. It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point. The report unequivocally concluded that the DPRK regime committed gross and systematic violations of human rights including freedom of thought, expression and religion; freedom from discrimination; freedom of movement and residence; and the right to food, as well as crimes against humanity entailing \\"extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation\\". The UN's fact-finding process continues to yield periodical reports, which greatly rely on and are underpinned by the also on-going research and publishing conducted by NGOs and governmental agencies. Increased awareness of human rights abuses has led to efforts in shaping policy and pressuring the North Korean regime. However the pursuit for the improvement of human rights in the DPRK has had to contend with the efforts of preventing a nuclear weapons escalation. Further, the isolationist and totalitarian nature of the regime has also meant that information and freedom of movement of its population as well as that of foreigners is still tightly controlled, making extremely challenging to document abuses on the ground, including having access to imagery (other than satellite imagery) that could inspire greater action. United Nations UN's Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK The United Nations has issued four main kinds of reports on the human rights of North Korea. The first are a series of documents intended to be recommendations from Treaty-based bodies, which are issued by those bodies to each country that is party to it (in contrast to charter-based bodies, which all UN members are part of). These treaty-based bodies that North Korea has decided to be a party to include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Committee on the Rights of the Child, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The first document of this kind was issued in 1998 (Convention on the Rights of the Child); the second was in 2001 (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), after a 17-year delay in North Korea submitting the required information to the committee. Prompted by growing evidence provided by human rights NGOs, during the 1990s and 2000s various UN bodies and parties expressed greater concern on the situation of human rights in North Korea and the opacity of the country's government. That led to another series of reports that were started by the UN Commission on Human Rights (the predecessor of the UN Human Rights Council), which established the mandate for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK in 2004, issuing reports annually. They are issued in detail to the Human Rights Council, and in a more condensed form to the General Assembly. The United Nations also conducts a Universal Periodic Review (every 3 or 4 years, in which all UN members are subject to a review on their human rights practices), with the first report on North Korea issued in 2010. Finally, the most notable one was the 2014 Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK, considered a landmark document resulting from a special in-depth, one-time investigation commissioned by the Human Rights Council, It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point. =2014 Commission of inquiry= * (Archived here) * (Archived here) =Universal Periodic Review= Presentation of the 2014 Commission of Inquiry Report on North Korea at the UN Human Rights Council =Special Rapporteur= Special Rapporteur annual reports to the Human Rights Council   =Other reports= Governmental reports =North Korea= North Korea published a report on its own human rights situation, as a rebuttal to the 2014 United Nations report.

Other reports, including reports by the U.S. government, use South Korea KINU's reports as part of their sources.

Also, two different bodies within the U.S. government have published reports on religious freedom: the Department of State (since 2001), and U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCRIF; since 2003). Finally, the DOS' Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons also publishes Trafficking in Persons Reports (TIP) that include some coverage of North Korea. The TIP reports series began in 2001, following the passing of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, with North Korea beginning to be briefly covered starting in the 2003 report, and more fully covered beginning in 2005. The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices issued by the DOS noted every year the difficulty of having detailed an up-to-date information, and instead relying on sparse information collected over several years. This was especially the case in the during the 1970s and 80s, and began to change in the 1990s with more witness accounts, while continuing to note a lack of more detailed and more timely information. As more reports became available, the DOS and USCRIF reports have frequently cited reports from the United Nations, South Korea's Korea Institute for National Unification (starting in 1996), nonprofits (especially the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea and Data Center for North Korean Human Rights, since their establishment in the 2000s), and from the press.

Its published research has been relied upon as sources in reports issued by the United Nations and governments. HRNK has issued three types of reports: reports analyzing the situation on prison camps, reports on other human rights issues in the country, and reports on North Korea's leadership and institutions, as well as policy briefings addressed at the international community.

Many manufacturers implement this feature into tools specifically with a spinning blade or cutter. Usage in corded tools An electric brake is commonly used in corded tools such as circular saws, miter saws, routers, bandsaws, angle grinders, and more recently, table saws. These mechanisms are designed to prevent injuries resulting from things like kickback or skin-to-blade contact. The way these mechanisms work are almost universally the same; When the trigger or switch is released, the polarity of the electricity running to the motor's brushes is reversed, causing the motor to quickly rotate in the opposite direction, which, by inertia, causes the motor to quickly come to a stop. This allows the motor to stop much faster than it would without the brake. In circular saws, this feature can reduce the risk of the saw accelerating backwards when the saw is set down, as well as prevent damage to the cord or the user. In other tools (such as miter saws or table saws), the brake can reduce the risk of injury to an operator's fingers or hands when the saw is switched off (such as when grabbing a scrap piece off the table). Disadvantages of this feature is that it wears the brushes prematurely when compared to non-brake tools, which over time can cause the brake to malfunction or not work completely. The first use of an electric brake on a tool was that of the miter saw, invented in 1964 by Ed Niehaus, a tool engineer for Rockwell Tools. Since then, a number of manufacturers have incorporated brakes into their power tools. Usage in cordless tools Electric brakes on cordless tools have been prevalent since the invention of the first cordless drill by Makita in 1969. They are found on most cordless tools, with the exception of tools such as cordless vacuums and blowers, where such a feature isn't very practical. The way the brake on cordless tools works is slightly different than in corded models; when the switch is released, the motor terminals are shorted together, causing a slight spark and the motor to stop almost instantly. This is because the smaller motor size produces much less inertia. However, this wouldn't work on corded tools, as they generally use series-wound field magnets. Both brushed and brushless tools work this way.

Predominantly used as a rugby league ground, it is the home ground of the Townsville Blackhawks, who play in the Queensland Cup. The ground is also used by the Townsville Brothers junior and senior rugby league teams. History Originally based at Queens Park and, later, Gill Park, the Townsville Brothers rugby league club purchased 20 acres of land from Kern Brothers Earthmoving in the early 1980s in Kirwan to develop a new clubhouse and playing fields in the suburb. On 14 May 1983, the venue was officially named Jack Manski Oval, in honour of Jack Manski, a club official who worked for the club for over 40 years. The ground was officially opened on 13 August 1984, with Brothers playing University and winning in all four grades. On 10 September 2014, it was announced that the Townsville Blackhawks were admitted into the Queensland Cup for the 2015 seasons and would play their home games at the venue. On 14 February 2015, the Blackhawks played their first game at the venue, a 12–24 loss to the North Queensland Cowboys in a pre-season trial. On March 7, they played their first Queensland Cup at the venue, defeating the Mackay Cutters. In 2017, the venue was upgraded with new playing lights thanks to a state government grant. The new 227 lux lights allowed the venue to host night games.

It is predominately used by archaeologists and anthropologists to examine mummified remains due to its non-invasive nature. Paleoradiologists can discover post-mortem damage to the body, or any artefacts buried with them, while still keeping the remains intact. Radiological images can also contribute evidence about the person's life, such as their age and cause of death. The first recorded use of paleoradiology (although not by that name) was in 1896, just a year after the Rōntgen radiograph was first produced. Although this method of viewing ancient remains is advantageous due to its non-invasive manner, many radiologists lack expertise in archeology and very few radiologists can identify ancient diseases which may be present.  Techniques  = CT = CT scans are most commonly used in paleoradiological studies because they can create images of soft tissue, organs and body cavities of mummified remains without performing an invasive and damaging autopsy. This enables archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally unwrap the remains and reveal what they contain. CT scanners create these images by taking multiple radiographic planes (or cuts) of the body at different angles which records the layers of different structures in the remains. This differs from typical radiographic scans (X-rays) where all the structural layers are documented in one image, which can create shadows and therefore limit their accuracy. There are several main viewing techniques used in CT imaging. * Axial Imaging: images that are taken from transverse planes, cutting across the body. This provides information about the chest, abdomen and pelvic area of the body, as well as the cranium. * Sagittal Imaging: images taken from the left or right sides of the body. This gives a greater indication of the length of fractures found on the remains. Together with axial imaging it can create a greater depth of visual understanding of the interior of the body. * Coronal Imaging: images are taken from the back to the front of the body. This can provide a more accurate indication of the presence of organs in the chest cavity (e.g. the heart). A 3D image of the skull of an Incan mummy After these different views of the remains have been obtained, it is possible to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the body. This brings into focus details which may have been missed on the axial imagining. Algorithm manipulation is used to create the rotational 3D images. In paleoradiology, the 3D images provide a greater understanding of the remains themselves. For example, in 2002, a study of nine Egyptian mummies found that by using the 3D reconstructions they could see the preservation of soft tissues, such as the penis on one male body and braided hair on female remains. The 3D modelling also illustrated discrepancies between the remains, as some had their internal organs removed while others had not. Due to their ability to take multiple planes of the remains, CT scans are able to virtually 'fly through' the body to assess internal composition and cavities. These techniques are commonly used for diagnostic scans such as colonoscopy and bronchoscopy, and the same method is applied to ancient remains. This enables researchers to digitally look through the remains from the top down, as though they were watching a short video of footage from the interior of the body. The technique presents observable data from the hollow cavities in the chest and abdomen regions. It can demonstrate whether there are internal organs present or if, in the case of Egyptian mummies, linen has been packed to maintain the body shape of the remains.  Micro-CT  Micro-CT is a specialised form of CT scan used to create images with pixels in micrometres. These images are frequently used for bone density examinations and produce greater detail for images of bony structures. This radiology technique is often used to examine the teeth from mummified remains. Early use (1895-1970) alt= Radiographs, or X-rays, have been used to study and observe ancient remains since their invention by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895. This early form of X-ray, sometimes known as Röntgenograms, was immediately used by physicists, anthropologists, anatomists and archaeologists as shown below. * 1896; Carl Georg Walter Koenig, a German physicist, took images of an Egyptian child mummy as well as an Egyptian mummified cat. Fourteen images were taken using a very early form of X-ray, which Koenig realised could be used for more than just medical purposes. * 1897; Albert Londe, a French physicist, took radiographic images of an Egyptian mummy. From these images he was able to determine the presence of artefacts placed in the mummy's wrappings, such as decorative jewellery on the body (e.g. rings), as well as the approximate bone age of the remains by examining the growth plates. Londe’s thorough examination of the pictures demonstrated how ancient remains could be studied without damaging the wrappings and body. * 1898; Charles Lester Leonard and Stewart Culin conducted a radiographic examination of a Mochica mummy (Peruvian mummy). The mummy had been tightly wrapped and was left unopened to preserve its integrity. Leonard determined that the body was of a child who had been decorated in beads before burial. * 1901-1902; Karl Gorjanovic- Kramberger took images of Palaeolithic skeletons found in Croatia. By comparing the X-rays of the jaw of these remains with X-rays from a modern man he was able to determine differences between the two. The X-ray of the Palaeolithic jaw was also used to measure the length of the teeth. An X-ray of Tutankhamun's skull, the arrow pointing to a possible cause of death * 1905; Heinrich Ernst Albers-Schoenberg used the radiological method to examine an Egyptian mummy. He discovered that there was a substance in the thorax and pelvis which had most likely been placed there for mummification purposes. He was also able to determine the perseveration of soft tissues around the nose and mouth as well as details within the skull and the state of the spine, which was wholly intact. * 1912; Sir Grafton Elliot Smith examined the mummy of Egyptian pharaoh Thutmosis IV and was able to suggest an approximate bone age from these images. He recommended in his publication on the mummy that the use of radiology would be able to provide greater detail to the study of the remains in the future. * 1921; F. Salomon studied a Peruvian mummy using X-rays, determining the bone age and the bone structure of the remains. He discovered that the remains were of a child around 2-3 years old, and bone structure was at a normal developmental stage for this age. *1933; X-ray imaging was used on Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I by Douglas Derry to discover the age of death. It was approximated to be 40-50 based on the wear and condition of the teeth. Derry also noted post-mortem damage to the body, which has been attributed to grave robbers, as well as amulets and beads used to decorate the remains during mummification. *1968; A portable X-ray machine was used to examine the mummy of Tutankhamun in his tomb in the Valley of the Kings by researcher R. G. Harrison. These images indicated an age of death of around 18-20 years based on bone age from a study of the limb lengths, as well as tooth analysis. The rumoured cause of death of tuberculosis was also ruled out during this study. A new hypothesis was formed that Tutankhamun died because of blunt force trauma to the head, due to a depressed fracture found on the skull.  Current use in archaeology  CT scans are the most common radiological technique used in modern archaeology due to their ability to provide more detailed information about ancient remains (such as soft tissue and blood vessels) and to produce 3D images by taking layers of different angled pictures. Archaeologists are able to collect data such as age, sex, the cause of death, socioeconomic status, mummification and burial practices by analysing the CT images. The images can also reveal whether the remains were subject to ancient diseases or post-mortem damage. Although paleoradiology practices are used on preserved remains such as European bog bodies and frozen bodies from the High Andes, they are more frequently documented in the analysis of Egyptian mummified remains. = Egyptology = Statue of Paramesses (later known as Ramesses I), pharaoh of Egypt during the 20th dynasty of New Kingdom Egypt CT scans are used in Egyptology to gain insight into mummified bodies without risking damage to the integrity of the remains. Hoffman's recent study of nine Egyptian remains discovered new information regarding the mummification practices of Egyptians. The typical process of mummification, as written by Herodotus, involves the removal of the four major internal organs (liver, intestines, lungs and stomach) and placement of them in four canopic jars. The heart is removed, embalmed and placed back into the body as it is an important feature in the journey to the Egyptian afterlife. However, Hoffman discovered that this was not the case in all mummies. Through analysis of CT-produced 3D images, the \\"fly-through\\" technique and a combination of axial and coronal images, it was discovered that four of the remains had not had their internal organs removed and in another four the heart could not be identified. Hoffman suggests this may be due to socioeconomic differences between the mummies during the time they were alive. CT scans were further used in Hoffman's study to potentially identify one of the remains as Ramesses I, a Pharaoh during New Kingdom Egypt. It was found that the mummification practices of this particular body were in conjunction with those typically used during the New Kingdom period, as images showed rolled linen placed inside the body in order to preserve its shape. The mummy's arms were also found to be placed across the chest as a symbol of nobility. Imaging done by Rethy Chhem, in 2004, was able to correct a diagnosis of Ramesses II from X-rays done in 1976. The incorrect diagnosis had been of ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis. However, Chhem perceived that the pharaoh actually had diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, a calcification of the joints causing ligaments to attach to the spine. The CT images provided a clearer and more detailed image of the spine when compared with the early X-rays. This enabled the researchers to provide a greater insight into diseases found in ancient remains and achieve a more accurate diagnosis. A recent CT scan of Tutankhamun in 2006 was able to provide evidence against the 'homicide theory'. A depression fracture noted on the skull from X-rays taken 30 years previously was found to be a post-mortem injury rather than a cause of death. The hole in the head had been created in order to continue the embalming process of mummification. This CT investigation was also able to confirm Tutankhamun's age of death as nineteen and disprove the idea that the young pharaoh had suffered from scoliosis; rather the bend in his spine was from additional post-mortem damage to the body.  Disadvantages  Although the information and evidence gathered by radiological imaging of ancient remains have been largely beneficial to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, not all of the information can be considered accurate due to the lack of radiologists who specialise in paleopathology. Instead, to obtain the most information from CT or X-ray images a team must meet to discuss the findings (e.g. for a skeletal study of the remains, an orthopaedic surgeon, bone pathologist and musculoskeletal radiologist would meet). Another disadvantage to this technique is the low contrast resolution. The researcher may be unable to determine a difference between soft tissue and artefacts left from the embalming process. Due to the decomposed state of some of the mummified remains, it can also be difficult to distinguish internal organs due to shrinkage and a lack of preservation. Post- mortem injuries and damage to the body can also hinder the ability of radiological scans to provide accurate information for researchers. For example, in frozen remains, there can difficulty when differentiating whether a CT suggests the body has air-inflated lung tissue or if there is frozen fluid in the lungs. Paleoradiology is informative in its ability to assist in determining the age of death of the remains, however, this is not always completely accurate or available information. In a sample of bog bodies, 35% were not able to be identified with any age group and 30% could not be sex determined. A radiological study of an iceman was only able to produce an estimate of 40-50 years at age of death. In order to achieve a more accurate time frame, the body would have to be subject to an autopsy or similar physical assessment which would cause irreversible damage to the remains. Another disadvantage of paleoradiology is the difficulty in transporting the equipment or the artefact/remains to spaces where the images can be taken. For example, in 2005 the mummy of Tutankhamun was imaged using a CT-scanner which had to be brought from the Cairo Museum to tomb KV62 in the Valley of the Kings. This was due to the fragile state of the remains which were unable to be removed from the climate-controlled tomb. In this study, funding came from a five-year grant from the Supreme Council of Antiquities, which was aided by the donation of a Siemens CT-scanner by the National Geographic Society, however typically funding for research can be problematic as equipment is costly and there may not be sufficient interest to prompt donations.

There is a continuous supply of calcium ions into waterways from rocks, organisms, and soils. Calcium ions are consumed and removed from aqueous environments as they react to form insoluble structures such as calcium carbonate and calcium silicate, which can deposit to form sediments or the exoskeletons of organisms. Calcium ions can also be utilized biologically, as calcium is essential to biological functions such as the production of bones and teeth or cellular function. The calcium cycle is a common thread between terrestrial, marine, geological, and biological processes. Calcium moves through these different media as it cycles throughout the Earth. The marine calcium cycle is affected by changing atmospheric carbon dioxide due to ocean acidification.  Calcium Weathering and Inputs to Seawater  Calcium is stored in geologic reservoirs, most commonly in the form of calcium carbonate or as calcium silicate. Calcium-containing rocks include calcite, dolomite, phosphate, and gypsum. Rocks slowly dissolve by physical and chemical processes, carrying calcium ions into rivers and oceans. Calcium ions (Ca2+) and magnesium ions (Mg2+) have the same charge (+2) and similar sizes, so they react similarly and are able to substitute for each other in some minerals, such as carbonates. Ca2+-containing minerals are often more easily weathered than Mg2+ minerals, so Ca2+ is often more enriched in waterways than Mg2+. Rivers containing more dissolved Ca2+ are generally considered more alkaline. Calcium is one of the most common elements found in seawater. Inputs of dissolved calcium (Ca2+) to the ocean include the weathering of calcium sulfate, calcium silicate, and calcium carbonate, basalt-seawater reaction, and dolomitization.  Biogenic Calcium Carbonate and the Biological Pump  thumb This image shows the effects of an acidic ocean (projected pH of the year 2100) on a Pteropod shell made of calcite. Biogenic calcium carbonate is formed when marine organisms, such as coccolithophores, corals, pteropods, and other mollusks transform calcium ions and bicarbonate into shells and exoskeletons of calcite or aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate. This is the dominant sink for dissolved calcium in the ocean. Dead organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean, depositing layers of shell which over time cement to form limestone. This is the origin of both marine and terrestrial limestone. Calcium precipitates into calcium carbonate according to the following equation: Ca2+ + 2HCO3− → CO2+ H2O + CaCO3 The relationship between dissolved calcium and calcium carbonate is affected greatly by the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Increased carbon dioxide leads to more bicarbonate in the ocean according to the following equation: CO2 + CO32− + H2O → 2HCO3− With ocean acidification, inputs of carbon dioxide promote the dissolution of calcium carbonate and harm marine organisms dependent on their protective calcite or aragonite shells.deposition of calcifying organisms/shells on the ocean floor The solubility of calcium carbonate increases with pressure and carbon dioxide and decreases with temperature. Thus, calcium carbonate is more soluble in deep waters than surface waters due to higher pressure and lower temperature. As a result, precipitation of calcium carbonate is more common in shallower oceans. The depth at which the rate of calcite dissolution equals the rate of calcite precipitation is known as calcite compensation depth. = Changes in global climate and the carbon cycle = Ocean acidity due to carbon dioxide has already increased by 25% since the industrial revolution. As carbon dioxide emissions continually increase and accumulate, this will negatively affect the lives of many marine ecosystems. The calcium carbonate used to form many marine organisms' exoskeletons will begin to break down, leaving these animals vulnerable and unable to live in their habitats. This ultimately has a flow on effect to predators, further affecting the function of many food webs globally.  Changes in Calcium Concentrations over Geologic Time  Calcium stable isotopes have been used to study inputs and outputs of dissolved calcium in marine environments. For example, one study found that calcium levels have decreased between 25 and 50 percent over a 40 million year timespan, suggesting that dissolved Ca2+outputs have exceeded its inputs. The isotope Calcium-44 can help to indicate variations in calcium carbonate over long timespans and help explain variants in global temperature. Declines in the isotope Calcium-44 usually correlate with periods of cooling, as dissolution of calcium carbonate typically means a decrease in temperature. Thus, Calcium isotopes correlate with Earth's climate over long periods of time.  Human/animal use of this calcium  bodily homeostasis of calciumBeing an essential element, calcium is obtained through dietary sources, the majority of which comes from dairy products. The three most significant mechanisms controlling calcium use within the body are intestinal absorption, renal absorption and bone turnover, which is controlled predominantly by hormones and their corresponding receptors in the gut, kidneys and bones respectively. This allows for calcium use throughout the body, namely in bone growth, cellular signalling, blood clotting, muscle contraction and neuron function. Calcium is one of the essential components of bone, contributing to its strength and structure in addition to being the main site at which it is stored within the body. Within the muscles, its primary use is to enable contractions. Muscle cells draw calcium from the blood, allowing it to bind with troponin, a component of the muscle fibre that signals for a contraction by moving actin and myosin. After a contraction, calcium dissipates and the filaments move back to a resting state before the release of more calcium for the next contraction. Furthermore, calcium plays a significant role in allowing nerve impulses to be transmitted between neurons. The release of calcium ions from voltage gated ion channels signals for the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. This allows for the depolarisation of a neuron, thus transmitting the signal to the next neuron where this process is once again repeated. Without the presence of calcium ions, the release of neurotransmitters would not occur, preventing signals from being sent and hindering body processes. Negative feedback mechanisms are implemented in order to control calcium levels. When low calcium levels are detected in the body, the parathyroid releases parathyroid hormone (PTH) which travels through the bloodstream to the bones and kidneys. In the bones, the presence of PTH stimulates osteoclasts. These cells break down bone to release calcium into the bloodstream where it can be used by the rest of the body in the above processes. In the kidneys, PTH stimulates re-absorption of calcium so it in not lost from the body through urine and returned to the bloodstream instead. Lastly, PTH acts on the intestines by indirectly promoting enzymes that activate vitamin D, a signal for the intestines to absorb more calcium, further increasing blood calcium levels. This will continue until the body releases too much calcium into the bloodstream. Excess calcium then promotes the release of calcitonin from the thyroid gland, effectively reversing the process of PTH. Osteoclast activity is stopped and osteoblasts take over, utilising the excess calcium in the bloodstream to form new bone. Calcium re- absorption in the kidney is prevented, allowing the excretion of excess calcium through the urine. Through these hormonal mechanisms, calcium homeostasis is maintained within the body.  Calcium in plants and soil  movement of calcium from the soil into the roots, through the xylem to the leaves of a plant Calcium is an essential component of soil. When deposited in the form of lime, it cannot be used by plants. To combat this, carbon dioxide produced by plants reacts with water in the environment to produce carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is then able to dissolve limestone, enabling the release of calcium ions. This reaction is more readily available with smaller particles of limestone than it is with large pieces of rock due to the increased surface area. When lime is leached into soil, calcium levels inevitably increase, both stabilising pH and enabling calcium to mix with water to form a Ca 2+ ions, thus making it soluble and accessible to plants to be absorbed and utilised by the root system. The calcium ions travel up the xylem of the plant alongside water to reach the leaves. The plant can utilise this calcium in the form of calcium pectate to stabilise cell walls and provide rigidity. Calcium is also used by plant enzymes to signal growth and coordinate life-promoting processes. Additionally, the release of calcium ions enables microorganisms to access phosphorus and other micro nutrients with greater ease, improving the soil ecosystem drastically thus indirectly promoting plant growth and nutrition. Inevitable plant and animal death results in the return of calcium contained within the organism back into the soil to be utilised by other plants. Decomposing organisms break them down, returning the calcium back into the soil and enabling the cycling of calcium to continue. Additionally, these animals and plants are eaten by other animals, similarly continuing the cycle. It is however important to note the modern introduction of calcium into the soil by humans (through fertilisers and other horticultural products) has resulted in a higher concentration of calcium contained within soil.  Industrial uses of calcium and its impact on the calcium cycle  The naturally occurring calcium cycle has been altered by human intervention. Calcium is predominantly extracted from limestone deposits to be utilised by many industrial processes. Purification of iron ore and aluminium, replacing asbestos break lining and some coatings for electric cables. Furthermore, calcium is used within the household to maintain alkaline pH of swimming pools, counteracting acidic disinfectants and in the food production industry to produce bicarbonate soda, some wines and dough. Aerial view of limestone mines at Cedar Creek With its widespread uses, a large volume of calcium must be obtained from mines and quarries to supple the high demand. As more limestone and water is removed from mines, underground stores of rock are often weakened making the ground more susceptible to sink holes. Sinkholes and mining both affect the presence of groundwater, potentially leading to a lower water table or altered pathways of flowing water. This may affect local ecosystems or farmland as the water supply is restricted. Additionally, the water that is released from mining areas will have higher concentrations of dissolved calcium. This can either be released into oceans or absorbed by the soil. Whilst not always detrimental, it alters the natural calcium cycle which may have flow-on effects for ecosystems. Furthermore, water being pumped from mines increases the danger of downstream flooding whilst simultaneously decreasing the volume on water in upstream reservoirs such as marshes, ponds of wetlands It is however important to note than limestone mining is comparatively less damaging than other mining process, with potential to restore the environment after the mine is no longer in use  The importance of the calcium cycle and future predictions  The calcium cycle links ionic and non ionic calcium together in both marine and terrestrial environments and is essential for the functioning of all living organisms. In animals, calcium enables neurons to transmit signals by opening voltage gated channels that allow neurotransmitters to reach the next cell, bone formation and development and kidney function, whilst being maintained by hormones that ensure calcium homeostasis is reached. In plants, calcium promotes enzyme activity and ensures cell wall function, providing stability to plants. It also enables crustaceans to form shells and corals to exist, as calcium provides structure, rigidity and strength to structures when complexed (combined) to other atoms. Without its presence in the environment, many life- preserving processes would not exist. In the modern context, calcium also enables many industrial processes to occur, promoting further technological developments. With its close relation to the carbon cycle and the effects of greenhouse gasses, both calcium and carbon cycles are predicted to change in the coming years. Tracking calcium isotopes enables the prediction of environmental changes, with many sources suggesting increasing temperatures in both the atmosphere and marine environment. As a result, this will drastically alter the breakdown of rock, the pH of oceans and waterways and thus calcium sedimentation, hosting an array of implications on the calcium cycle. Pteropod shell dissolving in oceans with a lower pH as calcium is drawn out of the shell Due to the complex interactions of calcium with many facets of life, the effects of altered environmental conditions are unlikely to be known until they occur. Predictions can however be tentatively made, based upon evidence- based research. Increasing carbon dioxide levels and decreasing ocean pH will alter calcium solubility, preventing corals and shelled organisms from developing their calcium-based exoskeletons, thus making them vulnerable or unable to survive.

The inferences being made are described as being extrapolated from the behaviour, as the link between the inferred trait and the perceived behaviour is not substantiated, only vaguely implied. The inferences that are made are spontaneous and implicitly formed, with the cognitive mechanism acting almost reflexively. Research into spontaneous trait inference began with Hermann von Helmholtz and his unconscious inference postulation. He first formed this concept to describe human perception of optical illusions, and then in his third volume of \\"The Treatise on Physiological Optics\\", connected the concept to social psychology and human interaction. However, his concept of unconscious inference was widely criticised, and has since been refined as spontaneous trait inference. In experimental research, there have been multiple ways in which spontaneous trait inference has been observed and measured. These include the cued recall paradigm, the picture priming paradigm, and the word fragment completion paradigm. Research of the applications of spontaneous trait inference, has been of recent interest amongst social psychologist. Studies have been conducted which have found that despite the circumstantial differences, between social media interaction and physical interaction, spontaneous trait inference is still prevalent. It has also been found that individuals raised in collectivist cultures form different inference to those raised individualist cultures, despite being witnessing the same behaviour. Spontaneous trait inference has numerous and widespread implications. With the formation of unsubstantiated conclusions based on a single behaviour, an individual formulates an inaccurate perception of the person being observed. This can, in turn, influence interactions with the person and treatment of them. Spontaneous trait inference has been centralised as a key concept of social psychology, as it forms the foundation of models for other psychological phenomena, such as factor attribution error (also known as correspondence bias) and belief perseverance.  Overview  Spontaneous trait inference refers to the phenomena where, when a behaviour is observed by an individual, they extrapolate trait inferences that aren't actually known to them through that observation alone. For example, an individual that would see a stranger on the bus reading a book would infer them to be smart or intellectual, or an individual who witnesses a person not keeping the door open for the people behind them, would make the inference that they are impolite. The distinctiveness of spontaneous trait inference is that the inference being made about the individual is not strictly connected with the behaviour witnessed, and are not indicative of the individual's personality, circumstance or natural behaviour. Perhaps the stranger on the bus who was reading the book had to read it for educational purposes, and maybe the person who didn't keep the door open was in a rush. It is logical to conclude that a single behaviour exhibited by a person should not be the basis for a general trait, however spontaneous trait inference is a mechanism that goes against this ideal. Another novelty of spontaneous trait inference, is that it occurs unintentionally without specific instruction or purpose to do so. It is also considered to be reflexive, a reactionary conclusion made by an individual when witnessing a behaviour, however they are not automatic. Also spontaneous trait inferences have been found to be much stronger when the inference being made aligns with a prevailing stereotype. For example, the trait of “bread- winner” is significantly more likely to attributed to a male than a female, as the notion of men being sole providers is ingrained within gender stereotypes. Spontaneous trait inference is a concept explored widely within social psychology, as it has broad implications on the how and why humans interact the way they do and the impressions that are formed in a social setting. Spontaneous trait inference is an area that is linked to other psychology theories, such as, attribution theory, factor attribution error and naïve realism. Spontaneous trait inference is not synonymous with spontaneous trait transference, which is the phenomena where an individual is attributed a trait that they describe as being in someone else.  History and concept origin  In the Cafè Wall Illusion the horizontal line patterns are visually processed as being tilted. However these horizontal lines are in fact parallel. Helmholtz' unconscious inference works in the fact that despite knowing this information, we still process the lines as being tilted. Unconscious inference was the term first put forward by Hermann von Helmholtz, a German physicist and philosopher, in effort to define the phenomena which occurs when humans visually process certain qualities pertaining to people and, in particular, objects. Helmholtz found that people unknowingly extrapolate data from visually processed information. He articulated this reflexive mechanism as the way in which people form impressions, through his exploration in the field of optical illusions. He posited that unconscious inference is the cause for people being able to be fooled by optical illusions. The example commonly used to explain unconscious inference is that when a person visually perceives a sunset, they make the inference that the sun is moving below the horizon, but in reality, the sun is completely stationary and it is the earth which is moving. Later on, in his research, Helmholtz related his concept of unconscious inference to psychology. In the third volume of \\"The Treatise on Physiological Optics\\", he explores the impact that visual perception has on the psychology of an individual. Though Helmholtz’ research and postulations were initially dismissed by psychologists. Largely due to the fact that his unconscious inference theory posed a fundamental error in logical reasoning. Edwin G. Boring explored this error, stating that the act of inferring is a conscious process, and in turn, can not be considered unconscious. It has also been critiqued that Helmholtz’ studies and research on the subject hasn't effectively or significantly influenced the area of social psychology. However, the idea has since been revitalised by modern research. The theory that visual impressions trigger an instinctual reflex of inference, has been reshaped and refined to apply also to social psychology and human interaction. Its adoption into the psychology vernacular has been though, under alternate names such as snap judgments, unintended thought, but the most universally used is spontaneous trait inference. This adaptation of Helmholtz’ unconscious inference describes the human tendency to allocate traits or qualities to individuals based on certain behaviours they observe the individual exhibiting. This allocation occurs spontaneously and is often a subconscious process, hence it is known as spontaneous trait inference. The result of spontaneous trait inference is that a person unknowingly constructs a perception of an individual within their mind, based on the inferences made through behaviour observation. This perception contributes to the overall impression the individual will have on the person, and in turn contribute to the person's overall behaviour to the individual.  Examples  = Helmholtz’ examples = Helmholtz’ first example was that of how sunsets are perceived. When an individual witnesses the sun setting, they acknowledge it as if it were the sun moving to be hidden by the earth's horizon. This inference has been, and still continues to be made, despite the fact that the individual understands and knows that the sun is a stationary body, and it is the earth that is in motion. This example shows that the mental mechanism that comes to this conclusion has an enormous influence upon the impressions and perceptions of the individual, even overcoming factual knowledge. The second example that Helmholtz uses to express his theory of unconscious inference is that of a theatre performance. When an actor is on stage portraying a certain character with conviction, such that they are able to deliver a convincing and realistic performance; they are able to sway the emotions of the audience, evoking laughter, sadness, anger etc. within their audience. This is able to be done, despite the fact that all the audience members have the programme in hand which discloses to them the fact that the character on stage is merely an actor, and that all that is being portrayed is not real. Helmholtz posited that it was due to unconscious inference, the impression that the audience have of the actor allow them to be emotionally swayed. = Social psychology examples = > “Lily is, for instance, entertaining ladies and I come in with my filthy > plaster cast, in sweat socks; I am wearing a red velvet dressing gown which > I bought at Sulka’s in Paris in a mood of celebration when Frances said she > wanted a divorce.

Isn’t that awful” This imaginary fidelity thrills them.” – Saul > Bellow, Henderson the Rain King (1958, p. 9) This extract from Saul Bellow's novel “Henderson the Rain King”, portrays a common display of spontaneous trait inference. Here the character Mr. Henderson believes that the ladies, which he is introducing himself to, would be excited by his “fidelity” to his first wife. As he is reintroducing himself to his current wife, Lily, and in turn they would assume that “he doesn’t know her”. Showing that through the behaviour of reintroducing himself to his wife, the ladies would infer that he still believes he is married to his first wife. However, Mr. Henderson also displays spontaneous trait inference through his assumption that that is what the ladies will think. As Mr. Henderson has made the inference that the ladies would be presumptuous.  Measurement  Numerous methods have been developed and utilised by researchers to investigate the prevalence and effect of spontaneous trait inference in an experimental context. These paradigms provide a construct through which spontaneous trait inference can be tested. The most prevalent paradigms utilised in research include the cued recall task, the picture priming task, and the word fragment completion task. For the cued recall task, an individual would be presented with written accounts of different behaviours, such as “Brittany fell over when she walked down the hill”. Later on, the experimenter would provide the individual with a cue, and utilising the cue as a prompt, the individual was asked to recall the behaviours that they had read earlier. The cues formed the independent variable of the experiment, as the experimenter would change them in order to observe if there was a change in response. It was found that characteristic words that described inferences extrapolated from the behaviour read, such as “clumsy”, presented as better cues for memory retrieval than actual words that appeared in the description itself. This implies that not only were trait inferences spontaneously made, but they also established a lasting impression on the individual, such that the individual formed strong cognitive links between the behaviour and the trait. For the picture priming task, individuals were presented with an image or video, and then would have to identify a characteristic word that is initially hidden behind a black image and then gradually revealed over a 5-second period of time, by removing pieces of the black image at random. It is the speed at which the individual is able to identify the word which is being tested. As when the characteristic word that is being identified is similar to inferences made from the image or video previously presented, the identification speed increases when compared to cases where the characteristic word that is being identified doesn't link to possible inferences made. This shows that due to the implicit inferences made when viewing the stimuli, formed cognitive cues which prompted quicker identification. For the word fragment completion task, there are two groups of individuals which are asked to complete a word which has blanked letters. The difference between the two groups is that, just prior to being given the word completion task, one group of individuals were presented with accounts of different behaviours, whilst the other group weren't presented with anything. This method relies on the notion that the description of the behaviour would generate a trait inference, which would in turn aid with the completion of the fragmented word. For example, an individual exposed to the description of “Brittany fell over when she walked down the hill”, would be able to produce the word clumsy from “c_ _ m _ y”, faster than an individual who wasn't primed with the description. The results showed this effect, in turn suggesting that the concept had already been implicitly formed by the individual when they were presented with the behaviour description.  Applications  = On social media = With the modern-day prevalence of social media, social psychologists have taken interest in the application of spontaneous trait inference within these contexts. As with the conditions surrounding social media, being very different to conditions of physical interaction, the question of whether spontaneous trait inference can still be applied arises. Research has been conducted in order to investigate the occurrence of spontaneous trait inferences in circumstances typical of social media. These circumstances involved moderate, self-tailored content, multiple cues displayed simultaneously, with the speed of browsing dependent on the individuals own pace. It was found that, without instruction to do so, individuals participating in the task had formed impressions and inferences of people based on social media information. Research concluded that whilst scrolling through different social media platforms, the social media user extrapolates information from the content provided, and these inferences then implicitly inform the perception of the user. = In culture = Research has been conducted in the area of cognitive mind-sets which promote the inclination to spontaneously infer traits based on behaviour. Through investigation it has been found that the cultural group, of which the individual is a part of, informs the types of inferences made by the individual. Thus, being raised in a collectivist culture, which is generally the framework of Eastern societies, influences the types of inferences made by an individual differently, then if they were raised in an individualist culture, which is generally the framework of Western societies. As individuals raised in collectivist cultures form an interdependent model of self and individuals raised in individualist cultures form an independent model of self. It was found that those who were raised in individualist cultures were not only more likely to form spontaneous trait inferences than those raised in collectivist cultures, but they also formed inferences that attributed behaviours witnessed to dispositional factors rather than accounting for situational factors. Inferences made by those raised in collectivist cultures placed more weigh on the effect of situational factors on an individual's behaviour, than immediately attributing the individual's behaviour to their personality.  Implications  Spontaneous trait inference has numerous implications in theoretical and practical instances. The quick and insubstantial conclusions formulated when observing an individual, leads to the formation of an inaccurate mental representation of that individual. The representations humans form of each other, determines how they interact with each other. If that representation is formulated from inaccurate inferences, then the interaction between people will, in turn, be affected. This result then has the potential to cause serious conflicts, lead to further erroneous judgements, and result in rash decision making. It can impact and influence a range of areas in society, ranging from social gatherings to decisions made in a legal setting. It can also contribute to the formation and perpetuation of social and cultural stereotypes. Through the understanding of spontaneous trait inference the interpretation models for other psychological phenomena are founded and further advanced. For example, factor attribution error, which is the instinctive tendency to ascribe a certain behaviour to the individual's personality whilst neglecting the influence of situational factors, is a central concept to social psychology and is heavily founded on the spontaneous trait inference. Another concept that is derived from the effect of spontaneous trait inference is belief perseverance effect, which is that individuals are more likely to retain their beliefs then change them, when exposed to contradictory information. Due to the fact that it provides a framework for the reasoning of other observable phenomena, spontaneous trait inference has a multitude of implications in the area of social psychology.

She ran a passenger-cargo service between Unalaska and the Pribilof Islands, and also carried passengers, supplies, and provisions to destinations on the mainland of the Territory of Alaska and in the Aleutian Islands. She occasionally supported research activities in Alaskan waters and the North Pacific Ocean, and she conducted patrols to protect Alaskan fisheries and marine mammals. In 1924, she provided logistical support to the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. Prior to her acquisition by the Bureau of Fisheries, the ship was the commercial fishing vessel MV Idaho. From 1942 to 1945, the ship served in the United States Coast Guard as the harbor fireboat YP-198 during World War II. After the end of her Fish and Wildlife Service career, she served in the United States Geological Survey from 1949 to 1954, and from 1955 she operated in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  Construction and commissioning On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands, to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF).AFSC Historical Corner: The Pribilof Islands Tender Vessels Retrieved September 4, 2018 Since 1917, the BOF had operated a \\"Pribilof tender,\\" a dedicated supply vessel used to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands. On 1 July 1918, the U.S. Congress appropriated US$20,000 to the BOF for the construction or purchase of a wooden-hulled motor vessel capable of operating in the rough waters of the Bering Sea to replace its existing Pribilof tender,afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: Eider, Pribilof Tender and Patrol Vessel Retrieved September 7, 2018 the steamer .afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: Roosevelt, Bureau's First Pribilof Tender Retrieved September 8, 2018 The naval architecture firm of Lee and Brinton of Seattle, Washington, designed the ship, to be known as MV Tern, following the BOF's custom of naming its vessels assigned to operate in the waters of the Territory of Alaska after seabirds common in the region. Tern was to be 70 feet (21.3 meters) long and have a heavy-duty 80-horsepower (68-kilowatt) engine, a cruising range of over 2,000 nautical miles (3,704 km), a cargo capacity of 30 tons, and sleeping accommodations for 16 people. The BOF advertised in Seattle for bids for the construction of Tern in 1918, but when the bidding period closed on 3 December 1918, the lowest bid was US$27,500, which was US$7,500 more than the Congressional appropriation. The BOF advertised for bids in Seattle again, but when the bidding closed the second time on 8 January 1919, the lowest bid, $26,000, still was too high. The need to replace Roosevelt became more urgent on 17 January 1919, when the BOF assessed her as in need of major repairs, and the Steamboat Inspection Service later confirmed it; on 21 April 1919, an inspection at Bremerton, Washington, revealed extensive dry rot requiring an estimated US$186,000 in repairs, which the BOF deemed prohibitive. The BOF advertised in Seattle for bids for the construction of Tern for a third time, only to find that when bidding closed on 12 May 1919, the lowest bid, US$28,800, again exceeded the Congressional appropriation. Roosevelt was condemned on 4 June 1919. On 11 July 1919, the U.S. Congress passed a deficiency act that appropriated an additional US$7,500 for her replacement. The BOF scrapped plans to build Tern, and instead purchased the 88-foot (26.8-meter) motor schooner Idaho in the summer of 1919 for US$26,000. Nilson and Kelez had constructed Idaho in Seattle and launched her on 16 November 1913. Employed as a commercial deep- water Pacific halibut fishing vessel, Idaho was well-known in the area and regarded as seaworthy and capable of operating in the Bering Sea during voyages to the Pribilofs. The BOF renamed her MV Eider and converted her for fisheries use by transferring most of Roosevelt′s movable equipment to her before selling Roosevelt on 15 July 1919 and adding additional cabin space and a communications room. The United States Navy installed a modern 0.5-kilowatt wireless system in her communications room and a 1-pounder gun on her deck so that could provide armed protection of fur seal rookeries. Service history =Bureau of Fisheries= Carrying several United States Government employees as passengers and a cargo of general supplies, United States Mail, and coal, and with a crew of 13 – her master, first officer, second officer, engineer, assistant engineer, radio operator, and mess attendant and six seamen – Eider departed Seattle on 26 October 1919 for her first voyage to the Pribilof Islands. The Pribilofs lacked mooring facilities for her or any harbors, and so the BOF stationed her at Unalaska on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands – at 250 nautical miles (463 km) away, the closest port to the Pribilofs. In addition to her voyages between Seattle, Unalaska, and the Pribilofs, Eider also transported passengers and supplies between the two main islands in the Pribilofs – Saint Paul Island and St. George Island – and to and between other communities on islands in the Aleutians and the Bering Sea. Eider made one of her voyages to the Pribilofs in January 1920, an impressive feat in an era when few vessels attempted to operate in the Bering Sea during the hazardous winter months. In April 1920, she transported 1,312 sealskins and 938 fox skins from the Pribilofs to Unalaska, where they were loaded aboard the commercial steamer SS Victoria for transportation to Seattle. Outbreaks of smallpox forced health authorties to place her in quarantine at Unalaska on 18 October 1920 and again on 10 November 1920, but by then Eider had made 11 round trips between Unalaska and the Pribilof Islands and two voyages to King Cove on the southwestern tip of the Alaska Peninsula and had logged nearly 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 km). On 28 November 1920, she left Unalaska to undergo repairs at Kodiak on Kodiak Island, and during her return voyage to Unalaska at the end of 1920 received word that the mail boat Pulitzer was missing near Chignik, Alaska; after searching for Pulitzer and finding her disabled and in distress, Eider took her crew, passengers, and mail aboard and transported them southwestward to Unga and Unalaska. For several weeks in the autumn of 1921, Eider underwent a major overhaul at Kodiak in which her hull was sheathed with ironbark, her deck railings were modified, the floor of her forecastle was raised, her rudder was reriveted, her main engine was overhauled, a new bilge pump was installed, and her cabins, companionway, bulkheads, and heads received additions and modifications and new lockers were installed. In December 1922, Eider came to the assistance of the vessel Lister, which had run ashore at Cape Makushin on Unalaska Island, 40 miles from Unalaska. Eider arrives in port covered with ice. On 24 March 1923, Eider arrived in Seattle to have her original gasoline engine replaced with a 140-horsepower (118-megawatt), 6-cylinder Atlas- Imperial solid-injection, reverse-gear diesel engine. Her new engine was more efficient and proved to be very reliable in the coming years, and with it Eider averaged 8.75 knots during the summer of 1923, an improvement over the 8 knots she could make with her old engine. Beginning in 1923, BOF employees embarked on Eider for several weeks each summer to inspect the salmon fisheries at various canneries and spawning streams; BOF employees who made these deployments aboard her included Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, Willis H. Rich, and Dennis Winn. Following a 1923 Executive Order, Eider began guarding the sea otters and migratory fur seal herds in the Territory of Alaska. During the winter of 1923–1924, she found and assisted the missing vessel Viking. In 1924, Eider supported the first aerial circumnavigation of the world, achieved by United States Army Air Service aviators in four Douglas World Cruiser airplanes who took off from the naval air station at Sand Point in Seattle on 6 April 1924 and proceeded westward. The Soviet Union had prohibited the aircraft from landing on its soil, necessitating stops in the Territory of Alaska and Bering Sea area as the aircraft bypassed Soviet territory. Eider transported the advance personnel, supplies, gasoline, and lubricating oil needed to support the early stages of the trip to several locations in Alaska and the Bering Sea and provided the pilots with accommodations, meals, meteorological information, and moorings for the planes. Ultimately, two of the original airplanes completed the trip successfully by arriving at Seattle on 28 September 1924, 175 days after departing Naval Air Station Sand Point. By the mid-1920s, Eider′s patrol duties had expanded to include the protection of salmon in Southwest Alaska. In 1925, a 12-horsepower (10.1-megawatt) Cummins auxiliary diesel engine was installed aboard her. That year, she suffered hull damage when she struck a rock in Wrangell Narrows between Mitkof Island and Kupreanof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. In 1929, Eider′s patrol duties grew again to include protection of the Pacific halibut in the northern Pacific Ocean. She aided with the annual seal census in July 1929. In September 1929, she lost her rudder and skeg (an extension of her keel from her stern) when she struck a rocky reef off St. George Island in the Pribilofs during a storm in fog, and she had to be towed to Juneau, Alaska, for repairs. In performing her Pribilof tender duties and other assignments between 1920 and 1929, Eider logged as many as 17,000 nautical miles (31,484 km) a year. Exposure to harsh weather and ice had taken a toll on her, and by the late 1920s she required overhauls and major repairs at an ever-increasing rate. In 1928, the BOF suggested the construction of new Pribilof tender, larger and more powerful than Eider, for voyages in the Bering Sea, This ship, MV Penguin, entered service in May 1930.afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: Penguin, Pribilof Tender for 20 Years (1930-50) Retrieved September 7, 2018 With Penguin in commission and assuming duties as the BOF′s Pribilof tender, the BOF reassigned Eider to annual fisheries patrol duty in the more protected waters around Kodiak, although she also continued to transport passengers and supplies to various settlements and BOF stations in the Territory of Alaska. In the spring of 1934, Eider began patrol work to protect fur seal herds migrating northward along the coast of Washington near Neah Bay. Between February and April 1936, she took part in a Works Progress Administration stream improvement project in the Territory of Alaska′s Juneau and Wrangell districts. In 1938, biologists embarked on Eider conducted a tagging experiment to measure the travel times of fish. =Fish and Wildlife Service (1940–1942)= In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, Eider became part of the fleet of the new FWS in 1940. She continued her operations in Alaskan waters. On 24 October 1940, Eider struck a reef off Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada. Her hull sustained 14 feet (4.25 meters) of damage. =United States Navy and United States Coast Guard= The United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941, and in 1942 the U.S. Navy requisitioned Eider for war service and renamed her USS YP-198.NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive YP-198 Retrieved September 9, 2018 On 29 May 1942, the Navy transferred YP-198 to the United States Coast Guard, which converted her into a harbor fireboat. After the conclusion of the war, the Coast Guard transferred YP-198 back to the Navy on 26 October 1945. The Navy, in turn, struck her from the Naval Register on 20 March 1946 and transferred her back to the Fish and Wildlife Service. =Fish and Wildlife Service (1946–1949)= Once again known as MV Eider, the vessel returned to service in the Fish and Wildlife Service fleet. In October 1946, she transported a search party to Shuyak Island n the northern part of the Kodiak Archipelago in an unsuccessful attempt to locate a missing U.S. Navy enlisted man. At some point later in the 1940s, the FWS declared Eider to be surplus property. =United States Geological Survey= In January 1949 a United States Geological Survey (USGS) geologist, G. D. Robinson, acquired Eider for use in studying volcanos and geology in and around the Aleutian Islands. Eider provided USGS geologists conducting this research with their first dedicated transportation to and from the Aleutians since 1946. In 1951, her engine was replaced with a 500-horsepower General Motors diesel engine. She supported USGS research in the Aleutians until October 1954, when the USGS declared her to be surplus property. =Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands= In 1955, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands acquired Eider for use in providing support for medical and dental personnel in the Marshall Islands. At some point during this service, she became disabled and sank while under tow for repairs.

It was for the entire period located at the corner of Amagertorv (No. 33) and Hyskenstræde (No. 1) but the current building was built for the pharmacy in 1908. History =17th century= Løve Apotek was established by Esaias Fleischer on 12 September 1620 and served as pharmacy for the Danish Royal Court from 1633 to 1715. Esaias Fleischer was married twice, last to Maren Hansdatter, a sister of Hans Nansen's wife. He died in January 1663. In 1650 his pharmacy privilege was made heritable, and his son Gregorius Fleischer inherited the pharmacy. He ran it for fifty years, from 1665 to 1715. =18th century= Ludvig Manthey The pharmacy was from 1716 to 1742 owned by Andreas Winter. The pharmacy was then acquired by August Günter. His son ran it until 1790. It was then endowed to his son-in-law, Ludvig Manthey, who had just passed his pharmaceutical exam. The pharmacy was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Manthey commissioned Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to designed a new building for the pharmacy and it was already completed the following year. In 1796, he was also appointed as director of the Royal Porcelain Manufactory. In 1800. he was sent abroad by the king to study porcelain manufacturing. Hans Christian Ørsted, his protegé, managed his pharmacy while he was away. =19th century= Late 19th-century advertisement In 1805, Manthey took over the management of Ørholm and Brede Works. He therefore sold the pharmacy on Amagertorv to Max Boye, who kept it until 1835. His successor, Jørgen Albert Bech, who owned the pharmacy from 1735 to 1859, was later able to purchase the estates Tårnborg and Kruusesminde at Korsør. The next owner, Harald August Faber, operated the pharmacy until his death in 1873. Niels Nørgaard Aggersborg was the owner from 1877 to 1889. He was succeeded by Paolo Victor Madvig, who owned it until 1904. =20th century= Løve Apotek's old building August Kongsted and Anton Antons, who acquired the pharmacy in 1908, founded Løvens Kemiske Fabrik (now Leo Pharma) the same year. The company acquired a lot in Hyskenstræde and constructed a production facility. The new building The photographer Frederik Riise operated a photographic studio in the top floor of the building between 1909 and 1913. The photographic studio was from 1914 to 1928 continued by Julius Folkmann. August Kongsted's son August Julius Helmuth Kongsted took over the pharmacy in 1920. Its production facilities relocated to Brønshøk in 1926 and Ballerup in 1958, August Julius Helmuth Kongsted died in 1939. The pharmacy was then passed on to his son-in-law, Ludvig Holtmann, who ran it until it closed in 1971. Building The current building at the site was built in 1907-08. It was designed by Victor Nyebøllle og Chr. Brandstrup. A lion relief from Harsdorff's building has been installed above the gate.

She is known for her expertise in the field of artificial intelligence and technology policy.  Education and early career Lyons was raised in Fort Collins, Colorado. She received her Bachelor's Degree from Harvard University in 2014 in Social Studies with a focus on Network Theory and Complex Systems. During her time at Harvard, she received the Thouron Award in 2012 to study for a summer at the University of Cambridge. While at Harvard, she worked as a research analyst for David Gergen at the Kennedy School of Government Center for Public Policy. Her senior thesis was entitled \\"Social Networks and Shibboleths: Gender Diversity and Stratification in Structures of Elite Corporate Leadership.\\" Following her time at Harvard, she became a Fellow with the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences based in Cape Town, South Africa.  Public service career Lyons joined President Barack Obama's Office of Science and Technology Policy, which was run by the President's Science Advisor John Holdren, in 2015. In 2016, she began working for the United States Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith. During her tenure as a civil servant, her portfolio centered on machine intelligence, including AI, robotics, and intelligent transportation systems. Lyons co-directed The White House Future of Artificial Intelligence Initiative, which engaged stakeholders — ranging from industry, academia, government employees, the international community, and the public at large — to develop a domestic policy strategy on machine intelligence. That work culminated in a report called Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, which detailed opportunities, considerations, and challenges in the field of AI. Highlights from the report include policy recommendations to ensure that the power of AI is channeled to advance social good and improve government operations, recommendations for regulations on AI technologies such as automated vehicles, and recommendations to develop a diverse workforce equipped to tap into the potential and tackle the challenges that will come with the AI revolution. The report was the culmination of five public workshops and a request for public comment that received 161 responses. Lyons also helped draft the December 2016 report Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy, which detailed the ways in which artificial intelligence will transform the American economy in the coming years and decades. The report outlined five key primary economic efforts that should be a priority for policymakers, including preparing for changes in skills demanded by the job market and the shifting of the job market as some jobs disappear while new opportunities are created.  The Partnership on AI  In 2017, Lyons was recruited to lead the Partnership on AI, a research and policy organization founded by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and a number of other technology corporations. The mission of the nonprofit organization is to research and provide thought leadership around the direction of AI technologies, including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning. As stated on their website, the goals of the organization are to: (1) develop and share best practices on research and development related to AI; (2) advance public understanding; (3) provide opportunities for engagement across diverse audiences; (4) identify new efforts for the future of AI for the social good. Lyons has testified in front of the House of Representatives Oversight & Government Reform Committee Subcommittee on Information Technology to discuss the promise of artificial intelligence and advocate for the importance of the Partnership on AI. In her position as Executive Director, Lyons has advocated for the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the AI workforce. In 2018, she spoke at The New York Times new work summit about why inclusion is a crucial issue to address in the fields of computer science and AI especially. Lyons is also a member of the Center for a New American Security's Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and Security to investigate opportunities and challenges AI poses to American security.

Their political activity has traditionally opposed and targeted socially progressive policies, and minorities (in particular; the LGBT community, and ethnic minorities like the Roma and immigrants (particularly those from the Southern Balkans)), and espoused traditional ultraconservative and reactionary views and values. More recently, a rise in new, incipient alt-right groups has been noted, particularly as a reaction to the European migrant crisis. While far- right actors have been responsible for multiple acts of violent extremism in Slovenia it is a relatively minor issue in the country. Background and history The far-right groups and subcultures in Slovenia have traditionally been largely impenetrable to uninitiated observers, existing in closed communities into which new members would need to be initiated/\\"grandfathered\\" into. Their internal discussions have been said to take place mostly online, where the members revealed their \\"true faces\\", and where members arranged group events, while tamer discussions take place on Facebook. During the 2000s, police statistics indicated a spike in \\"criminal acts involving public promotion of hatred, violence, or intolerance\\", with 5 incidents in the year 2000, up to 13 in 2005, and 19 in 2008. On September 6, 2011, prime minister Borut Pahor was briefed by the head of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA) regarding the activities of extremist groups (in particular, Blood & Honour), which, according to the agency's assessment, presented a clear and present danger to national security. Violent extremism nonetheless remains a relatively minor threat in Slovenia. Neo-Nazism As of 2010, the most active neo-Nazi groups in Slovenia included; Blood & Honour, Headhunters Domžale, and Slovene Radicals. Neo-Nazi social activity has mostly centered in the cities of Domžale, and Žiri, where members own or have access to venues available for staging various group activities (including annual celebrations of Hitler's birthday). Neo-Nazis have also established cordial relations with their foreign counterparts, mainly those from neighbouring countries. Though neo-Nazi groups are not on the whole more common than in other countries and represent a relatively low security risk, the tolerant attitude of the authorities towards neo-Nazi-organised events has led to a boom in private neo-Nazi social gatherings/parties/concerts; because such activities are not prohibited by law per se, Slovenia has become \\"a veritable Mecca for international activity and cooperation of extremists\\", according to a parliamentary investigative committee looking into the matter. = Blood & Honour = As of 2005, the Slovene B & H was operating a webpage (registered offshore to avoid domain seizure), promulgating neo-Nazi ideology. Their online activities have included compiling a list of Jewish residents of Slovenia. After the international B & H computer network was infiltrated by hackers and the data made available to the public, it was revealed that the Slovenian B & H faction was one of the most numerous and active, with membership comparable to that of Spain (which has a population 20 times that of Slovenia). B & H was active primarily in the central region of Slovenia, and generated revenue by staging concerts for their German counterparts. In October 2011 and November 2012, the Slovene branch celebrated its 10th and 11th anniversaries, respectively, with events in Domžale, and in Ljubljana (2011 only). Both events had attracted international attendance. At least two members of B & H (including a leader of the Slovene B & H) were identified as members of the Slovenian Democratic Party youth wing. B & H members have also included Slovene army soldiers. B & H members have also been known to have attended SDS events on multiple occasions, and to have met with high ranking SDS politicians. In September 2011, prime minister Borut Pahor was briefed by the head of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA), which assessed that extremist groups – Blood & Honour, in particular – presented a clear and present danger to national security. B & H members allegedly received training by members of the Slovene armed forces (including by ranking members) on an army training area and with advanced weaponry, borrowed army weaponry (a rocket launcher), attempted to purchase handguns, pressured detectives and individual politicians, were involved in direct correspondence with Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik by both mail and e-mail, with multiple B & H members receiving his manifesto before Breivik's killing spree, and were allegedly intimately implicated in orchestrating the violent riots which took place amid the 2012–13 Slovenian protests (the organised group of violent agitators that disrupted a major protest in Ljubljana was also suspected of having been trained, hired, and compensated, possibly by a political party, according to unofficial sources within the police). A police officer who served as bodyguard to Slovene prime ministers Janez Janša and Borut Pahor was found to be a close acquaintance of the leading members of the Slovene B & H. The individual was also an observing member (\\"sympathiser\\") of SDS. SDS has been criticised for alleged links to Blood & Honour. The journalist who uncovered the links (Anuška Delić) was charged with leaking confidential information. The state intelligence agency, SOVA, headed by an SDS appointee at the time of the indictment, inadvertently confirmed allegations made by Delić by stating that the information revealed in the reports was consistent with findings of an ongoing investigation into the activities of the violent extremist group. SOVA argued that the information revealed in the reports could not have been obtained by any other means than by gaining access to information collected during the agency's covert investigations, and that the publication disrupted its efforts to monitor the group by alerting B & H of the monitoring efforts. Delić alleged the charges were \\"politically motivated\\".  Alt-right, and other groups  = Skinheads = Slovene skinheads were initially (at the close of the 1980s) – as was the case in other countries – mostly \\"beer drinkers, party-goers, fighters, sports fans, patriots, and anti-communists\\", before becoming an almost exclusively \\"Nazi and racist\\" subculture during the 90s. Skinheads became less publicly prominent and less violent during the 2000s, and mostly engaged in organising Nazi rock/Oi! concerts, and group events where members partook in various social and sports activities (e.g. air gun tournaments). Their subculture was rooted in interpersonal/social connections, with a distinct dichotomy between the younger, and older members (who were less political). While Nazism remained their core ideology, skinheads began to establish international contacts and connections, with their ideological focus shifting from ultra-nationalism to white nationalism, resulting in the rise of the Slovene Blood & Honour (a British-based group) chapter among Slovene skinheads. Neo-Nazi groups conversely also gradually diversified their membership and shifted their image away from \\"Nazi skins\\" to expand their appeal. = Football hooligans = There is considerable overlap between Slovene sports fan groups/ultras and far-right political groups; football hooligans (particularly members of the Green Dragons (FC Ljubljana supporters), and Viole (FC Maribor supporters)) are often involved in far- right political ideology and activity, and incidents of far-right political violence. Neo-Nazism began to take root in these fan groups after the year 2005. In 2016, both the GDs and Viole were sanctioned for displaying hateful symbols during a game, the former a \\"Slavic swastika\\", and the latter a Celtic cross. = Tukaj je Slovenija = Tukaj je Slovenija (literal translation: \\"Here Is Slovenija\\") was a far-right organisation that operated a popular now defunct far-right website and web forum (starting in October 2005). The group was particularly successful in recruiting youths, and especially active in the dissemination of its characteristic stickers. By 2007, the group was said to have \\"recently\\" disseminated 10,000 such stickers throughout the whole of Slovenia. The stickers even appeared in Croatia. = Autonomous Nationalists of Slovenia = The Autonomous Nationalists of Slovenia – the Slovene faction of the Autonome Nationalisten neo-Nazi groups constellation – were an alt- right group active during the early 2010s. The group operated a webpage and engaged in dissemination of posters graffiti containing ideological propaganda. It focused on \\"defending the white race\\", espousing white nationalism, and xenophobia. The group also opposes \\"immigration, islamisation of Europe, homosexual families, alcohol and drug abuse, violence against animals [...] capitalism, liberalism, democracy, communism, and anarchy\\", abortion, and environmentalism. The group's communiqués featured a Celtic cross (which the group has adopted as its symbol) \\"embellished\\" with the White Pride World Wide motto. Members of the group allegedly shouted \\"Down with the government, for Slovenia!\\" while performing the Nazi salute during a 2011 demonstration in front of the parliament building. The group disseminated posters opposing a new family law bill that was up for a referendum challenge in 2012. The posters variously included a picture of two male exhibitionists engaging in a sex act with the underlying message reading \\"UNACEPTABLE Would you leave your children's upbringing up to people like this? [...] Let's protect our children and not allow them to become 'playthings' of perverts. [...]\\", or a Nazi propaganda image portraying an \\"ideal\\" Aryan family while blaming \\"abortions and same-sex partnerships\\" for a low birth rate and alleged poor health of the nation. The Slovene Autonomous Nationalists were suspected of also having been intimately involved in orchestrating the violent disruption and subsequent riot during a 2012 Ljubljana protest (the Autonomous Nationalist groups are characteristed by their embrace of black bloc protest tactics more typically associated with violent far-left extremist protesters).Kolovrat, or \\"Slavic swastika\\" (colloquial), the symbol adopted by Radical Ljubljana as the basis of their logo. = Radical Ljubljana = Radical Ljubljana was a \\"radical right\\" \\"urban nationalist\\" group espousing \\"Pan-Slavism\\" (towards which it evolved from a \\"pro-Germanic\\" ideology, according to representatives of the group), and opposed to \\"the LGBTQ community, the left, refugees, and immigrants\\". Its representative told the media that they desired to distance themselves from other far-right groups which they perceived as \\"neo-Nazis\\". Nonetheless, experts believe Radical Ljubljana still represents a \\"neo-fascist\\" and \\"neo-Nazi\\" group. The group is mostly involved in online political activity and drawing political graffiti. The group's Facebook site has rallied against \\"western liberals and Marxists\\" that finance \\"various degenerate movements and phenomena in Eastern Europe\\", and also contains instances of homophobia and anti-Semitism. = Generation Identity Slovenia = Activity of the Slovene branch of the far-right/alt- right Identitarian movement began to mount months prior to the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election. The local branch – Generation Identity Slovenia – rallies against \\"migrants, homosexuals, liberals, globalists, Soros, and socialists\\". Information regarding the group – its leadership, membership, and internal structure – remains sparse. The group operates in Ljubljana, Maribor, and Velenje, and appears to share members with the two largest sports fan groups; Green Dragons, and Viole. The organisation also maintains close relations with counterparts in other countries, in particular, Austria (with Slovene members partaking in events of Austrian Identitarians). Past activities of the group have included propagation of political stickers, signs, and graffiti, photo-ops with political undertones/messages, and social media activity. The members of the Slovene branch have also attended protests (in particular; against LGBT rights, migrants, and the construction of a mosque), and camping excursions where members \\"bond in paramilitary training\\". The Slovene Identitarian movement has fostered ties with the Slovenian Democratic Party. Individuals and media organisations associated with SDS have lauded the movement, and SDS members and politicians have co-attended events with, and shared social media posts of the movement. Observers have also noted that SDS leader Janez Janša adopted some of the rhetoric associated with the Identitarian movement in his speeches/public appearances. After SiOL journalists published an exposé about the Slovene Identitarian movement, the article and its authors were lambasted in SDS-affiliated media. Identitarian movement logo. In late August 2018, Slovene Identitarians anonymously published a book; the \\"Manifesto for the Homeland\\". The work was published under the auspices of Nova obzorja (Slo.: New Horizons), the SDS in-house publishing company. The book was also promoted by SDS-affiliated media organisations and individuals, including SDS leader Janez Janša, with SDS MP Žan Mahnič even going so far as to post on Twitter a photo of the book taken from his parliamentary seat, with the floor of the parliamentary chamber in the background. The book's foreword was written by Bernard Brščič, an \\"important SDS supporter\\" who has served as state secretary in the second Janša (SDS) cabinet and as chair of the party's think tank (Jože Pučnik Institute). = Institute for Patriotic Values = The Institute for Patriotic Values was founded in late 2016 as an \\"institution which aims to develop and encourage patriotism and preserve heritage\\". It was co-founded by a local Slovenian Democratic Party official. The institute organises social activities such as Krav Maga personal defense courses, and ceremonial wreath-laying on the grave of Rudolf Maister (a Slovene general and national hero). The institute also operates the \\"Rudolph Maister Division\\" which is \\"willing to go into battle against \\"the collaboration of left fascists antifa and radical Muslims\\"\\". According to Racist Extremism in Central & Eastern Europe, the Rudolph Maister Division was founded at the start of the 21. century by the neo-Nazi group Blood & Honour. The Institute has also hosted political discussions; in late January 2018, it hosted a meeting with the representatives of the Slovenian Democratic Party (MP Branko Grims), Slovenian National Party, and Unified Slovenia (Andrej Šiško (also representing the Hervardi society)). During the meeting, Grims spoke out in favour of Trump, and against the \\"globalists\\", who are supposedly headed by \\"George Soros, but also the Rothschilds and other wealthy families of financial speculators\\", and whom Trump is said to be combating. Styrian Guard paramilitary In early September 2018, photographs and videos of masked men - some armed with various weapons, and standing in military formation - surfaced on social media. Claims by the user who published the imagery that the armed group was Slovene were initially met with incredulity and scepticism, and led to speculation that the photos were of Russian or other foreign paramilitaries. However, the authenticity of the images was soon confirmed by Slovene politician Andrej Šiško, who could be seen leading the paramilitary formation. The images and videos portray some 70 masked individuals who could be seen wearing black balaclavas and drab army green T-shirts embroidered with emblems. Many were also wearing camouflage bottoms. Attendants were seen wielding axes and firearms, including the Zastava M70 assault rifle (the possession of any such military-grade weaponry by civilians is illegal under Slovene law under all circumstances). The only one of the multitude not concealing his face was Šiško, who could be seen wearing his trademark bright red baseball cap. Andrej Šiško is a fringe far-right politician who stood as presidential candidate during the 2017 Slovenian presidential election, winning a mere 2.2% of the vote. His party, the Unified Slovenia Movement, gained only 0.6% of the vote in the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election. While announcing his party's run in the 2018 parliamentary election, Šiško stated: \\"We are contending this election for one single reason: because this is the single and last attempt, I am saying this responsibly, to save the country in a peaceful manner. If this doesn't succeed even with the parliamentary election, we will have war in this country.\\" Šiško, a former leader of the Maribor sports supporters group Viole, has also headed the ultrapatriotic Hervardi society for over a decade and a half. Hervardi has been the dominant ultra-nationalist/traditionalist organisation in Maribor, largely stifling out various skinhead and neo-Nazi groups in the region. Hervardi was named after a military guard of the Old Slavic state Carantania. Šiško had already commandeered a volunteer militia during the brief Slovenian Independence War of the early 1990s. Hervardi had in the past also organised periodic get-togethers where members, clad semi- matching clothing (matching shirts and baseball caps embroidered with emblems, with participants many also wearing fatigue bottoms), engaged in group activities that included flag raising, and paintball tournaments. As one journalist put it in 2011, \\"Hervardi are otherwise also known for organising forest camps for the purpose of military training\\". Šiško has previously served a 2-year jail sentence for planting a car bomb. Šiško confirmed to be the leader of the paramilitary group; Štajerska varda (Styrian guard). Šiško stated that the \\"Guard\\" was formed more than a year prior, is not associated with the political party he also heads, and numbers several hundred members. He stated that members do not keep the weapons at home, but said the group would not let itself be disarmed peacefully. Šiško acknowledged the possession of the arms may be illegal under Slovene law (the legitimacy of which he denies), and called on \\"natural law\\" to justify the carrying of weapons. He also declared his intention to form similar paramilitaries in other regions of the country, and that their members may soon number several thousand, at which point the situation may aggravate if he is not heeded. Šiško said the guard was intended to \\"maintain order and peace, and control the borders\\", and would respond to \\"direct threats to our region, our homeland, our nation\\". He expressed his willingness to cooperate with relevant state organs, but threatened an armed insurrection if moves were made to reign in the \\"Guard\\". The paramilitary group was promptly harshly condemned by numerous high-ranking government representatives (including PM Šarec, Interior Minister Györkös Žnidar, former PM Cerar, and president Pahor), political parties, and veterans' and patriotic associations. A sweeping police investigation into the group was already underway by September 4. Šiško responded to the news claiming that he had sources within the police, and that a large part of the police and intelligence services were on his side. He also alleged that the group has been under training for over a year, and was being trained by former ranking military officials. He also claimed that included in the group were veterans who have seen combat \\"from Afghanistan to Ukraine, and elsewhere\\". Some 40 investigators carried out 5 house searches, and arrested Šiško and another person in connection with the affair on September 6. Police found 58 persons participated in the September 1 rally, with no evidence regular police or army personnel took part. One of the apprehended suspects said \\"this government had to be brought down, disabled\\", and called on rally participants to overthrow some of top ranking government officials. The suspects are facing charges of inciting violent change of the constitutional order, and illicit arms, and drug trafficking (the searches also yielded about a pound of cannabis). The police also stated that participants were misled by the organisers as to the nature of the gathering (which only became clear after the rally commenced), and urged all those who attended to come forward. Šiško and another participant were convicted by a lower court in March 2019, with Šiško sentenced to a 8-month jail sentence. Some two months after Šiško's conviction and just days prior to the 2019 European Parliament election, Šiško/his party released two campaign videos; one showed an AK-style firearm- wielding, military fatigues-clad Šiško calling on people to participate in the election (whilst waving the weapon in the air), while the other (recorded in a tongue-and-cheek manner) again showed an outdoor gathering of several individuals alongside Šiško – all dressed in matching black uniforms and masked with balaclavas – handling multiple weapons (including an AK-style rifle, and an AR-15 style rifles, a MP5 submachine gun, a Glock-style firearm, and several cold weapons, including a knife with a serrated back edge, axes, chainsaws, a pickaxe, a hoe, and a scythe) and enacting a mock-arrest of violent immigrants (while their remake of volksmusik tracks with vocals mimicking machine gun-sounds plays in the background (the video also features cut scenes of participants recording the music in a studio)). Police had on several occasions visited \\"training sessions\\" of the Styrian Guard, however, their activities themselves were not found to be punishable under existing laws. In November 2019, police, patrolling the border for migrant crossings, came across a group of 41 apparently armed guardists and seized 7 pieces of suspected firearms. The encounter followed a series of complaints from local residents about the presence of the masked guardists along the border. Responding to the incident, Šiško stated that the guardists train with toy guns \\"Because, when the time comes, we shall know how to handle real weapons also\\". Due to the incidents, the government proposed legal changes in late November that would enable police to more easily curtail the activities of the guardists. The changes would proscribe fines for carrying weapon replicas, or wearing camouflaged clothing or uniforms, so as to imitate police or military personnel, or any behaviour imitating police for the purpose of patrolling the border, or obstructing police border control activities. In December 2019, while patrolling the border, police again encountered 23 guardists and seized two handguns, an expandable baton, an electroshock weapon, and a pair of nunchuks. In May 2020, a gathering of some 50 uniformed guardists in a privately-owned area was visited by a police patrol. The group of guardists, demanding answers, then took to the local police station and interrogated the police commander while livestreaming the encounter on Facebook. In June 2020, guardists harassed a camping grounds owner, accusing him of harbouring migrants and saying that he is being watched. Incidents = Timeline = *In 2009, during Pride Parade week, a gay rights activist was physically assaulted in front of a gay bar (Cafe Open) in Ljubljana. 9 perpetrators attacked the activist while he was smoking just outside the bar. The perpetrators were clad in black, concealed their faces with hoods, hats, and masks, and wielded stones, red flares, and hockey sticks, and could be heard shouting \\"faggots!\\". The attackers beat up the activist, broke a window of the bar, and threw a flare into the bar before fleeing. Afterwards, three of the nine were apprehended. The attack proved to have been premeditated. The three denied being \\"far-right sympathisers\\" (in contrast with some of the other attackers), even though one of them was found to own Nazi literature, and neo- Nazi paraphernalia (a Blood & Honour shirt, and a shirt bearing the likeness of Nazi leader Rudolf Hess). After the three were given a one and a half year prison sentence each, some 100 \\"schoolmates and friends\\" of the convicted organised a rally in front of the court, protesting what they viewed as excessive penalties. It was speculated, however, that this March 2010 rally was actually organised by neo-Nazis. In June 2010, Cafe Open and the residence of the judge responsible for the conviction of the trio were defaced with \\"hateful graffiti\\". A cobblestone was also thrown through the window of the bar on one occasion. In 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of the original attackers due to \\"unjustified storage of trace DNA\\" evidence that was used to find the three perpetrators. The prosecution refused to further pursue the case. *In 2009, a group of \\"blackshirts\\" threatened the organisers of Tolerance Action in Maribor. A representative of a gay advocacy group present at the event stated that violence was averted only due to the presence of hired guards. *In early 2010, neo-Nazi violence spread to smaller cities, with incidents in Koper, Slovenj Gradec, and Ilirska Bistrica (where they attacked a local youth centre). * In April 2010, a group of three neo-Nazis physically attacked students at the Ljubljana Faculty of Arts. The students were presenting a new edition of a student newspaper in which they had often spoken out against Nazism and neo-Nazism, before being attacked as they left the building. Only a year prior, a group of 10–15 self-described \\"national socialists\\" entered the faculty and attacked a cameraman who was filming a round-table discussion entitled \\"Hate speech, neonazism, and neofascism in Slovenia\\" during an altercation. *In May 2010, a student demonstration before parliament descended into violence as people in the crowd began throwing cobblestones towards parliament, resulting in the injury of several police officers, damage to the edifice of the parliament building, and the arrests of 30 individuals. Later revelations, based on initial reports of an arrest of at least one B & H member, and subsequent insights from an intelligence agency document, confirmed suspicions that neo-Nazis/\\"skinheads\\" were involved in the incident. *In July 2010, a group of \\"intolerant skinheads\\" attacked a group of patrons at a Ljubljana pub. The attackers first began to verbally accost the group which included Cubans and women. An attacker then hit one of the Cubans over the head with a glass bottle, after which the group of assailants began to hurl stones and bottles at the victims. The Cuban nationality of some of the targets likely precipitated the attack. * In November 2011, students of the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana who were involved in the publishing of a school newspaper received a threat through email, and were warned that \\"... crossed out swastikas will be strictly punished\\". The faculty also experienced a disruption of a round table talk about intolerance by a group of neo-Nazis which assailed a speaker, but a prompt police intervention thwarted further escalation. The faculty had previously also been a target of graffiti which depicted swastikas, and pro-Nazi slogans. * In late 2012, a group of highly organised violent agitators disrupted a peaceful anti- government protest in front of the parliament building in Ljubljana, with at least 10 persons sustaining injuries (including multiple riot police, and a photographer), and 33 individuals arrested as a result of the violence. The violent group consisted of football hooligans, neo-Nazis, and members of extremist far-right groups. *The former Novo mesto Sokol lodge, which had been restyled into a squat, suffered repeated attacks in late 2015 and early 2016 while serving as a storage area for humanitarian supplies for refugees. In late December 2015, a Molotov cocktail was hurled at the door of the lodge, setting the wooden doors aflame, but causing only minor damage after prompt emergency intervention by firefighters. Eyewitnesses reported that the attack was carried out by two perpetrators, with one sporting a swastika on his sweater. The incendiary attack came a month after the door was defaced by a swastika. The building was targeted a third time in February 2016, with its edifice defaced with a swastika, Celtic crosses, and an inscription reading \\"traitors\\". An ominous note threatening to burn down the building was also left by the attackers. *In June 2016, the Rog factory squat in Ljubljana was attacked by a group of masked assailants. Shortly before midnight, a group of over 30 masked persons, armed with pyrotechnics, stones, and bats, descended upon the building. The attackers pelted the premises with cobblestones and firecrackers, and threatened the occupants of the building with arson. At least 6 individuals were reportedly injured, with one sustaining serious injuries. The perpetrators dispersed and fled after police intervened, although 6 were arrested (aged 17–20). Some 150 occupants were on the premises at the time of the attack. In the months leading up to the attack, Rog factory users were deeply involved in aiding refugees. * In November 2017, an attack occurred at the premises of the Maribor alternative culture centre Pekarna. During the night, a group of five arrived at the premises, whereupon they called upon an artist who lives on the premises to come outside. After the artist unlocked the door, one of the group lifted his shirt to reveal neo-Nazi tattoos before commencing to physically assault the victim. The victim believes the attack was politically motivated. * In June 2018, posters bearing Nazi imagery and mottos appeared plastered across Velenje.Violent agitators disrupt the 30 November 2012 Ljubljana anti-government protest (video). *In September 2018, images and videos of a paramilitary-style formation of several dozens masked and uniformed individuals surfaced online. Some participants appeared armed. The group was revealed to have been headed by fringe right- wing politician Andrej Šiško. A sweeping police investigation was promptly launched, revealing many participants were misled as to the nature of the rally, only grasping it once it commenced. Šiško is arrested on multiple charges, including weapons charges, and charges of \\"inciting violent change of the constitutional order\\". = 2012 Ljubljana protest = On November 30, 2012, a group of highly organised violent agitators disrupted a major protest of the 2012-13 Slovenian protests (\\"Pan-Slovenian uprisings\\"); a protest in Ljubljana that was taking place in front of the parliament building demanding the resignation of the right-wing government of Janez Janša. Several dozen young men – some wearing face masks – penetrated the mass of protesters in a \\"paramilitary formation\\". The group was carrying signs that included a Celtic cross, and could be heard shouting Nazi slogans and seen performing Nazi salutes. The group entered into a confrontation with riot police, pelting them with powerful firecrackers, bottles, cobblestones, Molotov cocktails, and homemade explosive devices. The confrontation resulted in the use of a police helicopter, and a water cannon (the first instance of its deployment in the history of independent Slovenia) as the Riot police action during the 30 November 2012 Ljubljana protest and subsequent riot (video). confrontation descended into a riot with police battling smaller groups of riotous hooligans through the streets of Ljubljana. 10-15 riot police sustaining bodily injury (with three sustaining injuries to the head after being hit by cobblestones), and 10 persons were treated at the Ljubljana clinical centre due to injuries sustained during the protests, including three police officers, and a photographer. The violent group was composed of football hooligans, neo-Nazis, and members of far-right extremist groups (with at least some also being members of Blood & Honour, Headhunters Domžale, and Green Dragons). According to unofficial sources, at least some among the violent agitators were trained, hired, and paid, and police was said to be investigating a suspicion that the agitators were hired and paid by political parties. It was later revealed that two members of the Slovene armed forces were also among the arrested. The incident prompted the establishment of a parliamentary investigative committee to look into the operation of extremist groups in Slovenia and their possible political ties, and adapt laws so as to be better able to address and combat extremism.

Personal life  Bedoya grew up in the region of Chocó, Colombia. He lived on his family farm for 11 years, growing rice, corn, and bananas. In 1996, Colombian paramilitary forces evicted his family from the farm. He returned to his land in 2008, where he was evicted again. He was almost evicted a third time in 2012, as his house was demolished twice, but the presence of the team from NGO Justice and Peace prevented their removal.  Activism  After nearly being evicted from his property three times, Bedoya converted his own land into the “Mi Tierra Biodiversity Zone”, in an effort to protect the farmland that belonged to the Afro-Colombian community in Chocó from encroaching agro-industry corporations. “Mi Tierra” was also founded for maintaining the rich biodiversity in the region. His calls for change were not limited to land rights, however; Bedoya was a member of Communities Building Peace in the Territories (CONPAZ) and worked to follow the 2016 peace agreement between FARC and the Colombian government. His anti- agribusiness activism resulted in numerous death threats from paramilitary groups with ties to the industry for over two years up until his assassination.  Death  On December 8, 2017, Hernán Bedoya was shot 14 times by the Gaitanista Self Defense Force in Chocó between the point known as El Acopio and the hamlet of Playa Roja. His death came after 2 years of threats against him and numerous other protestors from members of the paramilitary force identified by aliases “Coyote”, “Yeison”, and “Lute.”. Despite being under the official protection of the National Protection unit, Bedoya was given only a cell phone and a bulletproof vest to defend himself. His death devastated the population of the region, which had been celebrating 20 years of resistance to land encroachment from palm oil companies. On August 18, 2018 Bedoya's tombstone was found to have been burned, presumably in retaliation for the continued activism of his family.

It is across the street from the Federal Building and Post Office, which houses, among other things, the Eastern District of New York's bankruptcy court.  History  The courthouse stands on the location of the previous federal courthouse named the Emanuel Celler Federal Building. The previous courthouse, which was built in 1963, was a 6-story building that became unable to accommodate the court. This building underwent major renovations in 1999 under the direction of architect César Pelli. Upon its completion in 2006, the renovation had increased the number of floors to fifteen, bringing the total floor area to . The building contains 16 courtrooms and 9 magistrate courtrooms. The construction incorporated several extraordinary security features, such as having a structural frame that can withstand an explosion and having laminated glass face the exterior. On September 17, 2008, the courthouse was officially renamed in honor of Theodore Roosevelt with President George W. Bush signing into law legislation introduced by Senator Charles Schumer. A rededication ceremony was held on December 30 of that year. Located on Cadman Plaza in Downtown Brooklyn, east of Brooklyn Heights, it is one of many federal buildings in the area whose construction and renovation has played a role in revitalizing Downtown Brooklyn. The courthouse is located at 225 Cadman Plaza East, across Tillary Street from the historic Federal Building and Post Office, which houses the Eastern District's bankruptcy court. Along with the Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, the Theodore Roosevelt Courthouse houses the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

The Democrats held their Mississippi primary on the same day. Mississippi's 40 Republican delegates were contested. Donald Trump won the primary, receiving 47.24% of the vote, while Ted Cruz came in second, with 36.12% of the vote. Trump received 25 of the state's delegates, while Cruz received the remaining 15. The state of the campaign Trump had already become the Republican front-runner before the Mississippi primary. He was favored to win Mississippi partly because he had already done well in Southern states' primaries, including Alabama's, which he won with 43.4% of the vote on Super Tuesday. Opinion polling A poll of 995 likely Republican Mississippi voters, conducted on February 29, 2016 by Magellan Strategies, gave Trump 41% of the vote, 24% more than second-place Cruz. Results Analysis Trump's double-digit victory in Mississippi was seen as solidifying his status as the Republican front-runner, shortly after his disappointing performance in the Louisiana primary. Another unusual aspect of the Mississippi primary results was Marco Rubio's exceptionally poor showing: Rubio came in fourth despite having finished second in several other primaries in the South. Overall, Trump's victory was part of his generally strong performance in the South, in which, as a whole, he performed better than either John McCain in 2008 or Mitt Romney in 2012. Exit polls showed that Trump beat Cruz in virtually every demographic group. They also showed that Trump got an especially large share of the vote among Mississippi voters looking for a candidate who \\"tells it like it is\\". Trump also won among white evangelicals, the voters who Cruz had hoped would form his coalition. However, Trump came in second (behind Cruz) among Republican voters who decided whom to vote for in the primary within the previous week.

Its mission is to provide resources to homeless women in order for them to transition from being homeless. Programs and services include permanent supportive housing and basic necessities. Deborah's Place has worked with over 4,000 women, delivering employment training, access to education, healthcare, case management, permanent, interim and subsidized community-based housing. One-third of participants are recovering from drug abuse and mental illness.  Establishment  The founders named the organization \\"Deborah's Place\\" after an Old Testament story about a judge named Deborah, who raised an army of 10,000 soldiers to free oppressed people. They received assistance from the Immaculate Conception Church in Chicago in order to host their first overnight emergency women's shelter in the church's gymnasium. Funding began through the religious groups, community groups and private contributions. They networked with LaSalle Street Church, The First United Methodist Church, Holy Name Cathedral, St. James Cathedral and Fourth Presbyterian. Possible establishment locations have been rejected such as the one proposed by Reverend Pastor Joe Morin of St. Alphonsus in 2007, for a Deborah's Place shelter location to be placed on his church property, but lost in the South Lakeview Neighbors Association meeting due to \\"disgruntled residents\\". Deborah's Place has also faced disgruntled residents in possible establishment in Wicker Park. Audrey Thomas is the organization's current CEO. Thomas moved to Chicago in 1982 and began volunteering for Deborah's place in 1986. She held previously held positions of COO before becoming the CEO of Deborah's Place in 2004. Patricia \\"Patty\\" Crowley was a founder of Deborah's Place and helped with establishment in 1985.  History  With help from the Community Emergency Shelter Organization (CESO), Deborah's Place was able to create an its first overnight shelter for women on the North side of Chicago. The organization's first overnight shelter was opened in 1985 in a church gymnasium at the location of 1404 North Sedgwick Ave., Chicago, Illinois. The staff included three people with 25 volunteers and a budget of $69,000. By 1987 the organization was granted 501(c)(3) non-profit status. In 1998, Womancraft Inc, a for-profit program was launched, which employed participants of Deborah's Place to make jewelry and paper decorations to help raise funds for the organization. By 2004, the switch to providing long-term stability occurred and the organization opened its first daytime shelter in Bucktown, Chicago, along with a transitional housing program with the purpose of helping homeless women find housing and income.  Philosophy  Locations in Garfield Park, Lakeview and Old Town offer the practice of Housing First and Harm Reduction, which is the philosophy of reducing the harm associated with risky activities by including strategies such as participants setting goals, having alcohol free housing with sobriety checks upon entry and having room checks.  Housing programs and services  Deborah's Place offers interim and permanent housing that are all linked to supportive services at four locations throughout Chicago. Housing is for transitional purposes, which provides supportive services to become self-sufficient. Locations on the West and North Side of Chicago include supportive services such as: crisis intervention, counseling, health care assistance, job training, education, daytime learning centers, transitional housing, 129 supported living apartments and 90 rental studio apartments. Housing is only offered to individuals who identify as female or non-binary. Irene's was a housing program that provided job counseling, showers, laundry, art therapy, phones and lunches to its participants. It started in 1985 and closed in 2005. Another form of housing offered is The Overnight Shelter, which offers food, showers and a Learning Center between the hours of 5pm-8am, with the length of stay being unlimited. The Safe Haven offers shelter up to 15 homeless women, whom suffer from severe mental illness and/or have been chronically homeless. In 1988, Marah's Transitional Housing Program began and offers up to 22 women two years of a semi-structured environment with private rooms. In return the participants participate in communal meals and assist the program. In 1995, The Chicago Foundation for Women supported program within the Eleanor Network, Teresa's Transitional Shelter was opened and provided ten women housing and programs up to four months with dormitory-style living spaces. Participants who stayed in the housing had to help with community chores and cooking. Another housing option offered is Deborah's Place II Apartments with permanent supportive housing where tenants sign lease and pay up to 30 percent of their income as rent, as well as services such as case management, support groups, employment help, art therapy and educational resources. Redeveloped in 2000, Rebecca Johnson Apartments also offer permanent housing were the tenants pay 30 percent of their salary as rent for one of the 90 studio apartments offered with services such that include work out facilities, staff offices, case management, support groups, art therapy and The Learning Center.

It is similar in morphology and pigments to Aureococcus anophagefferens and Pelagococcus subviridis. The cell shape is spherical to subspherical and is 2.5 to 5.0 μm in diameter. It is golden-coloured and is encapsulated with extracellular polysaccharide layers and has a single chloroplast structure with pigments. Aureoumbra lagunensis thrives in a warm hypersaline environment as the greatest cell density has been found in water with salinity higher than 40 PSU and with temperatures between . Generally, the density of A. lagunensis is in the order of 106 cells mL−1, being higher in the summer months with lower abundance during the winter. Aureoumbra lagunensis causes harmful algal blooms and was the dominant microalga in the 7 year long brown tide (1990 - 1997) that happened in Laguna Madre, Texas. Its dominance over other coexisting phytoplankton is in part associated with its encapsulating mucus layer of exopolymer secretions (EPS) and its ability to revert from vegetative and resting cell forms. The A. lagunensis blooms cause a substantial increase in light attenuation, which in turn contributes to marine biodiversity loss, particularly phytoplankton communities and benthic invertebrates. A. lagunensis thrives in low-light conditions, where it can maintain high growth rates at 150 umol photons m−2 s−1, thus an increase in light attenuation causes a positive feedback which further perpetuates blooms. Aureoumbra lagunensis nutrient uptake is unlike other common microalgae. It uptakes inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrite (NO2−) and organic nitrogen in the form of urea, but does not utilize nitrate (NO3−). It uses environment dissolved organic phosphorus as the sole source to regenerate phosphate for growth.  Nomenclature  The name Aureoumbra lagunensis is Latin derived, where \\"Aureo\\" comes from the word Aureus meaning golden, pertaining to the colour of A. lagunensis populations; umbra refers to the reduction in light penetration that occurs when blooms occur, and lagunensis refers to the lagoon environment, namely Laguna Madre, Texas, from which this organism was first isolated.  Pigment characterization  * Chlorophyll a * Chlorophyll c * Fucoxanthin * Diatoxanthin * Diadinoxanthin * 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin * β,β-Carotene  Distribution  Aureoumbra lagunensis causes harmful algal blooms, most notably in Laguna Madre, Texas from 1990 to 1997, where it was first isolated. For over 20 years, A. lagunensis was confined to this bay system in Texas. More recently, small background concentrations of the species have been found in coastal bay regions along the rest of the Mexican Gulf coast, with larger populations found in Florida, Texas, and Mexico. In 2012 and 2013, A. lagunensis also caused brown tides in the Indian River Lagoon and Mosquito Lagoon, in Florida, USA. A. lagunensis brown tides have expanded as far as the Caribbean Sea into Guantánamo Bay, Cuba in 2013. = The Texas brown tide = Aureoumbra lagunensis cause a bloom in Laguna Madre, Texas for seven years where it maintained densities from 0.5 x 106 cells mL−1 to 5 x 106 cells mL−1. The hypersaline conditions of Laguna Madre (45 – 75 PSU) is thought to be the cause of the bloom which allowed A. lagunensis to thrive, as they achieve maximal growth at 70 PSU and can continue to grow in environments of 10 – 90 PSU. The development of these hypersaline conditions was due to a period of drought which caused a loss of benthic and planktonic grazers. This effectively reduced the grazing pressure on phytoplankton like A. lagunensis. In December 1990 a large fish die-off occurred upon severe freezing which served to release nutrients like ammonium to further support the phytoplankton population. By October 1997, The Texas Brown Tide was disrupted, after seven years of uninterrupted growth, due to heavy rainfall. = The Florida brown tides = The first brown tide in Florida began during the summer of 2012 and collapsed a few months thereafter, and the second brown tide began in the spring of 2013 and collapsed in mid-summer 2013. During the brown tides in Florida, A. lagunensis consisted of 98% of the phytoplankton community with abundances greater than 2 x 106 cells/mL. Similar to the causes of the Texas brown tides, the Florida brown tides were proliferated by high salinity, low grazing pressure, high dissolved organic nitrogen and low inorganic nutrients, and competitive advantage over other phytoplankton. However, these brown tides were short-lived compared to that in Texas, lasting no more than a few months. = The Cuba brown tide = In January 2013, A. lagunensis populations sharply increased in Guantanamo Bay, sparking a brown tide in Cuba. This in turn led to many shutdowns of the plant which supplied freshwater to the US Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay. Similar to the Florida brown tides, this A. lagunensis bloom was short lived compared to that in Texas, only lasting from January 2013 to November 2013. Unlike the Florida and Texas brown tides, hypersalinity was not found in the Caribbean waters where A. lagunensis bloomed. In the Texas and Florida brown tides, high primary productivity was always correlated with high A. lagunensis density, but in Cuba high primary productivity correlated with high A. lagunensis density only initially. After some time, productivity in Cuba remained high, but the dominant phytoplankton shifted from A. lagunensis to Synechococcus sp..  Competitive advantages  Aureoumbra lagunensis has competitive advantages that may allow it to persist in unfavourable marine environments such as low light intensities, nutrient limitations and high temperatures. A. lagunensis has an encapsulating mucus layer of exopolymer secretions (EPS) and is able to revert from vegetative to resting cell forms in unfavorable conditions. Allelopathic effects have also been observed that can cause cell lysis, reduced growth rates and reduced photosynthetic efficiency of co-existing phytoplankton. A. lagunensis experiences low mortality losses via its ability to discourage grazing by zooplankton and filter-feeding mollusks. Positive feedback involved in A. lagunensis’ ability to grow competitively in low-nutrient environments and low light levels and its ability to discourage grazing further contributes to brown tide blooms. = The EPS layer = The adhesive EPS layer surrounding A. lagunensis reduces grazing by hypotrichous filter-feeding protozoans such as Aspidisca sp and Euplotes, as marked by these protozoan's reduction in growth rate with increasing levels of EPS coating. It is speculated that the effects on grazing may be caused by the adherence of the exopolymer to cilia on the surface of protozoans thus affecting swimming abilities and clogging feeding apparatus, both of which may decrease grazing efficiency. With increasing salinity, the EPS layer of A. lagunensis increases. It has been hypothesized that with the hypersaline conditions of Laguna Madre during the bloom, A. lagunensis was able to out-compete other organisms due to a reduction in grazing pressure, which allowed it to thrive and further contribute to the Texas Brown Tide. The polysaccharide sheath is hypothesized to protect A. lagunensis from being digested in the guts of some zooplankton like that of the copepod Acartia tonsa as viable cells can be detected in its fecal pellets. = Vegetative and resting cell forms = Aureoumbra lagunensis has vegetative and resting cell forms in response to optimal conditions and environmental stressors respectively. Such a capability allows this organism to tolerate nutrient limitations, temperature fluctuations and light intensity variations. Relative to the vegetative form of A. lagunensis, the resting cell is larger, more round, has fewer and more aggregated plastids, lower chlorophyll A concentrations, decreased respiration rates and growth rates, reduced photosynthetic efficiency, greater vacuolar space and lower RNA:DNA ratio due to a decrease in RNA content but not DNA content. Red accumulation bodies have also been observed in resting cells but not vegetative cells. Such accumulation bodies are associated with increased sterol concentrations. Vegetative cells are described as irregularly shaped and containing sterols characterized as (E)-24-propylidenecholesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol, cholesterol, (24R)-24-propylcholesterol with trace amounts of 24-methylenecholesterol, crinosterol, clerosterol, campesterol, dihydrobrassicasterol, and 24-isopropylcholesterol.  Loss of biodiversity  Brown tides caused by A. lagunensis lead to substantial light attenuation, a loss in intensity of light travelling to the bottom of water. In the Texas Brown tide, the increase in light attenuation caused a decrease in seagrass beds which was abundant prior to the brown tide. This contributed to a loss in biomass in terms of primary producers and in turn the diversity of benthic invertebrates in Laguna Madre. The benthic phototrophs compete with A. lagunensis for nutrients, especially those regenerated in sediments, an important source of recycled nutrient in shallow lagoons that host these blooms. As a result, decrease in benthic biomass further contributes to the dispersion of benthic nutrient input to overlying water, fueling bloom development and causing more severe shading of the bottom water which further limits the growth of benthic phototrophs. Aureoumbra lagunensis favors a low light environment, thus an increase in light attenuation results in an increase in Aureoumbra populations on surface water which causes more severe shading. A. lagunensis could discourage grazing of zooplankton and filter- feeding mollusks to increase the chance of its survival. Brown tide blooms caused by A. lagunensis decrease the grazing activity, growth and egg release rates of the initially abundant mesozooplankton Acartia tonsa. The dominant clam, Mulinia lateralis, also experienced population declines during the Texas brown tide bloom, however, this decrease in abundance was initiated before the beginning of the bloom. In addition to Mulinia lateralis, the dominant polychaete, Streblospio Benedict, an important grazer of phytoplankton, also decreased in abundance.  Nitrogen uptake  Aureoumbra lagunensis are not able to use nitrate (NO3−) as a sole source of nitrogen and instead utilize inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrite (NO2−) and organic nitrogen in the form of urea. Aureoumbra lagunensis is found in high abundance where there is high organic to inorganic nitrogen ratios but growth rates of A. lagunensis are greater when grown with ammonium than urea. Collectively, ammonium and urea make up more than 90% of nitrogen uptake in bloom populations. A. lagunensis has higher affinity for and greater productivity with low levels of organic and inorganic nitrogen as opposed to high levels such that they are unable to increase growth rates in high ammonium concentrations (≈40 μM) which can ultimately cause them to be out- competed by Synechococcus species which thrive in such conditions. Low levels of ammonium (≈10uM) has been shown to enhance growth rates of A. lagunensis to a greater degree than phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria. Aureoumbra lagunensis is more productive when utilizing NH4+ or NO2− than with NO3−. A. lagunensis’ inability to use NO3− as the sole source of nitrogen is maintained when samples are supplied with iron and other trace metals. When nitrate is in excess the effects on A. lagunensis can be detrimental as it has been found that phycocyanin-containing cyanobacteria can thrive in such environments causing for an increase in its abundance and a decline in A. lagunensis abundance. Baffin Bay, Texas has seasonally and yearly stable levels of organic and inorganic nitrogen; however, when the large fish die-off occurred in 1990 due to severe freezing, more urea and ammonium became available to A. lagunensis, thus potentially initiating the brown tide.  Phosphorus uptake  Aureoumbra lagunensis blooms at a low phosphorus concentration. It has the ability to regenerate phosphate from environmental dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), a significant part of marine total dissolved phosphorus pool. It could use DOP as the sole source of phosphate for growth as a result. The mechanisms of phosphate acquisition in A. lagunensis remain unconfirmed, but it is hypothesized that A. lagunensis uses a common phosphorus-limitation specific protein, alkaline phosphatase, to dephosphorylate DOP compounds to alleviate the low phosphate bioavailability. High alkaline phosphatase activity accompanied with very low dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentration were measured in the A. lagunensis populations in the Texas Brown Tide at Laguna Madre. Aureoumbra lagunensis is capable of growing under a wide range of N:P ratios, but forms dense blooms when the water column N:P ratio increases to high levels (≈140). In cultures, A.lagunensis have a C:P ratio greater than 2000 when grown under severe phosphorus limiting environment.  Chloroplast genome  The chloroplast genome is non-circular. Strain CCMP1507 has a chloroplast genome size of 94,346 bp, encoding 110 proteins and containing 10 tandem repeats, 8 of which are adjacent to photosynthetic and energy production genes. The genome lacks large inverted repeats commonly found in chloroplast. Although A. lagunensis is similar to A. anophagefferens, it contains five chloroplast genes psaF, ycf45 and light independent chlorophyll biosynthesis genes chlL, chlN, and chlB which are not present in A. anophagefferens’ chloroplast genome. It is speculated that the presence of the light independent genes for chlorophyll biosynthesis is what allows A.lagunensis to persist in low light intensities.

Some major conjunct consonants in the Brahmi script. Conjunct consonants are a type of letters, used for example in Brahmi or Brahmi derived modern scripts such as Balinese, Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, etc to write consonant clusters such as or . Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel \\"a\\" (as with \\"k\\" 12px, pronounced \\"ka\\" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of a diacritic (as with \\"ki\\" 12px in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with \\"kya\\" 12px, formed with the consonants k 10px and y 10px assembled vertically). Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel. In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards. Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ).

Life Born in Naples, Gasse, who was probably related to the architect Louis-Silvestre Gasse, born eight years later in Naples, attended the violin class of Pierre Rode at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1798. He also had lessons with Rodolphe Kreutzer, the dedicatee of Beethoven's famous Kreutzer-Sonata. He also studied harmony with Charles-Simon Catel and musical composition with François-Joseph Gossec. From 1801 Gasse was violinist at the Paris Opera. In 1805 he received the deuxième Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata Cupidon pleurant Psyché (after a text by Antoine-Vincent Arnault). During his stay in Rome he composed, among others, a double choir Te Deum and a Christe eleison, works which were applauded by Étienne-Nicolas Méhul. From 1810 to 1812 Gasse stayed in Naples before coming to Paris, where he resumed his activity as violinist at the Grand Opéra after the interruption of his stay in Italy. In the year of his arrival, his opéra bouffe La finta Zingara was premiered here. In 1834 Gasse retired with a pension; his exact date of death is not known. In addition to several other operas, Gasse composed mainly works for the violin. It is assumed that Gasse was the father of Edme-Hippolyte Gasse.

Cassidy is a Democratic politician from the San Francisco Bay Area. He served as Mayor of San Leandro from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014. Early life On May 14, 1964, Cassidy was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child Cassidy lived in Los Angeles, California, where he was a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Cassidy was a featured actor on Saturday morning NBC television series Big John, Little John. He also appeared in \\"Rag Tag Champs,\\" a 1978 ABC Afterschool Special and an episode of the Lou Grant show in addition to performing in multiple television commercials. Cassidy graduated from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and received his law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.  San Leandro Unified School District  Cassidy first ran for political office in 2004, winning the At-Large seat on the Board of Education of the San Leandro Unified School District. Upon taking office, Cassidy called on the school board to build support for a new school construction bond to solve the overcrowding at San Leandro High School. In August 2006, the school board voted to place a $109 million bond measure, entitled Measure B, on the November 2006 election ballot. Measure B concentrated its funding on San Leandro High School by expanding the campus to address the overcrowding, removing student parking on the main campus to a new, adjacent lot, constructing an arts education center with a performing arts theater, modernizing the Career Technical Education facilities and expanding the school library. Measure B received 68% support from the voters. As a school board trustee, Cassidy criticized proposals by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to weaken state funding for California’s public schools. Cassidy commented on California ranking at the bottom of all states in spending per student and on the impact of Proposition 13 on California public schools: “Since the passage of Proposition 13, our schools have been dependent on Sacramento for the lion’s share of their funding. Today, local property taxes contribute less that 25 cents of every dollar spent on public education. No other governmental agency depends upon car washes, bake sales and magazine subscription drives to survive.” In 2007, Cassidy organized the largest anti-Iraq War protest that occurred in San Leandro. “No president, Republican or Democrat, is infallible,” Cassidy stated at the rally. “When the president is wrong and the lives of Americans are at stake, it is incumbent upon the people in each community to step forward and voice their opposition.” Cassidy chose not to seek re-election in 2008. After he completed his term on the school board, Cassidy led a community effort to name the new campus next to San Leandro High School for civil rights champion Fred T. Korematsu, who had deep connections to San Leandro.  City of San Leandro  In 2010, Cassidy ran for Mayor and defeated Mayor Tony Santos, Council member Joyce Starosciak, and two other challengers. The 2010 San Leandro City Council election, along with the elections in the Cities of Oakland and Berkeley, marked the first use of ranked choice voting or instant-runoff voting in Alameda County. Cassidy trailed Santos narrowly in the first round of voting but won when the final votes were counted. Cassidy set the goal of San Leandro \\"becoming a new center of innovation in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\" In January 2011, Cassidy met with Dr. J. Patrick Kennedy, a San Leandro resident, and president and founder of OSIsoft, one of the City’s largest employers. Together, Cassidy and Kennedy \\"began developing the public-private partnership that would become Lit San Leandro,\\" a high speed, fiber optic broadband network. In October 2011, the city approved a licensing agreement with Kennedy that allowed the installation of the fiber-optic cables in the existing conduits that circled the city's industrial zone. In 2012, San Leandro was awarded a $2.1 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to add 7.5 miles to the network. The following year, Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, visited San Leandro at Cassidy's invitation and praised the city \\"as a model for the country\\" in developing private-public partnerships to create fiber optic networks. By 2014, the network expansion was completed bringing the total length of fiber network to over 18 miles. In 2012, Cassidy worked with Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan to save San Leandro Hospital from closure by Sutter Health. At the time, San Leandro Hospital was the sole acute care facility in San Leandro. Its emergency room served 26,478 people annually. The City Council endorsed a plan proposed by Chan and advocated by Cassidy for San Leandro to donate $1 million per year for three years. With other funding, the city's donation was intended to keep the hospital open until it could achieve profitability as part of its transfer to public ownership by the Alameda Health System. Cassidy described the subsidy as \\"an investment that would preserve the hospital's $100 million a year payroll and maintain a local ER in the event of an earthquake or disaster.\\" As of 2018, the hospital remains open and is undergoing a $26.8 million renovation to provide in-patient rehabilitation care. In 2013, the United States Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution co-sponsored by 18 mayors including Cassidy that called on the federal government to respect state and local marijuana laws and policies. “Voters in states and cities that wish to break the stranglehold of organized crime over the distribution and sale of marijuana in their communities by legalizing, regulating and taxing marijuana should have the option of doing so,” Cassidy stated. Cassidy proposed flying the rainbow pride flag at San Leandro City Hall during the same week in 2013 that the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in the cases challenging California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act. His action generated publicity in the San Francisco Bay Area and led to the cities of Oakland and Berkeley following San Leandro's lead. Marriage equality is \\"one of the defining civil rights issues of our day,\\" Cassidy stated. \\"Flying the flag is a statement by the City Council saying we support marriage equality for same sex couples and that marriage is a fundamental human right that all couples who love each other should be able to enjoy.\\" Later in 2013, Cassidy, however, suspended a 4-3 decision by the City Council to fly at City Hall on October 1, 2013, the flag of the People's Republic of China to celebrate National Day, a day that honors the 1949 creation of the state by Mao Zedong. Cassidy sided with human rights activists that argued raising the flag signaled the city condoned oppression and abuses by the Chinese government against Tibetans and other peoples. \\"Those in our community wishing to celebrate the founding of the People’s Republic of China are welcome to use one of our parks, as are other groups celebrating key dates and events of the nation of their origin,\\" Cassidy said. Cassidy's outreach to the community including holding for the first time by a Mayor of San Leandro separate town halls for San Leandro's Spanish and Chinese speaking communities with translators. Cassidy did not seek re-election, and endorsed City Council member Pauline Cutter who succeeded him as Mayor of San Leandro.  Post-Mayoral Community Service  In 2016, Cassidy served as co-chair of the Measure J1 campaign in support of a $104 million school construction bond to renovate and modernize San Leandro public schools. Measure J1 received 74.8% support from the voters. In 2017 and 2018, Cassidy successfully advocated for the San Leandro City Council to recognize Surlene Grant, San Leandro's first elected African-American City Council member. “By dedicating a public location in Surlene Grant’s name, we show that San Leandro acknowledges the racism of its past, embraces its diversity of today, and is a welcoming community for all in the future,\\" Cassidy wrote. In the November 2018 elections, Cassidy ran unsuccessfully for a director position on the Eden Township Healthcare District Board. He also served as co-chair of the Measure I parcel tax campaign for San Leandro schools, which passed with 75% support.

According to the IRGC, the target of the missile strike wss described as intending to bring to an end to \\"terrorist and aggressive actions against Iran\\". The attack took place after ignoring serious warnings by officials of the Kurdistan Regional Government about Iran’s determination to dismantle their bases. Casualties According to initial reports the missile strike led to the death of 12 people and 50 others injured, party officials stated. Later reporting indicated the death toll had risen to 18, six of whom were members of the central committee of KDP-Iran. Rahman Piroti was among them.

It was released on April 6, 2013 as the lead single from the band's eponymous debut album (2014). \\"Archie, Marry Me\\" examines modern romance and traditional marriage, and touches on themes of commitment and financial stability. It was written by vocalist and guitarist Molly Rankin with guitarist Alec O'Hanley as a critique of the standard societal expectation that one is to marry upon entering adulthood. Rankin and O'Hanley were romantically linked, and had been collaborating for some time creatively. Then in their mid-twenties, they observed with derision friends quickly being wed. \\"Archie\\" was first developed during a period in which they lived on Prince Edward Island in a remote farmhouse. The song and accompanying album were produced by Chad VanGaalen, and recorded at his studio, Yoko Eno, in Calgary, Alberta. The song's lo-fi music video, filmed on a Super 8 camera, pictures Rankin at a wedding reception and sailing on the sea. \\"Archie\\" was the first song the band released; it debuted digitally via the band's website before the band was signed to a label. It was later released on Royal Mountain Records, in their home country. In the U.S. and Europe, it was distributed through Polyvinyl and Transgressive Records, respectively. Though it did not chart, \\"Archie\\" was considered the band's breakthrough hit; it grew in popularity in the mid-2010s on streaming services. Critical reviews of the track were very positive, praising its bittersweet tone and lyrical content. It was ranked on several best-of lists in 2014, and has been called a \\"indie-pop classic.\\" Background O'Hanley (left) and Rankin (right) on tour in 2014 Alvvays emerged in the early 2010s as an outfit for singer-songwriter Molly Rankin. Rankin's father fronted the Celtic folk collective the Rankin Family, which enjoyed international success in the 1990s.. She released an extended play, She, in 2010, with partner Alec O'Hanley assisting. As her writing style evolved, the duo shifted towards writing with a band in mind, with O'Hanley increasing his involvement in songwriting. They recruited her childhood friend Kerri MacLellan as keyboardist, as well as bassist Brian Murphy, and drummer Phil McIssac. In 2012, they relocated to Toronto, and supported acts Peter Bjorn and John and The Joy Formidable on tours; they began road-testing certain songs, including \\"Archie\\", at these concerts. The song—as well as Alvvays' self-titled debut LP—was recorded in March 2013 at Yoko Eno, a studio in Calgary, Alberta owned by musician Chad VanGaalen. The team sought out VanGaalen due to his work on the Women record Public Strain (2010). They utilized VanGaalen's guitars for added distortion and reverb. Rankin called the experience \\"colorful and engaging\\" in an interview, noting that VanGaalen was an interesting host and complimenting his percussive suggestions. Drums on the track were handled by Eric Hamelin, best-known for his work with Ghostkeeper. VanGaalen suggested that they devise a band name for the project, predicting Rankin would be subject to singer-songwriter connotations if not. The group created the monkier Alvvays, a play on the word always, which Rankin liked because of its sentimental quality. Holy Fuck's Graham Walsh assisted with tracking at his studio, Basketball4Life, while veteran engineer John Agnello served as mixer. The album and song were mixed at Agnello's Brooklyn space, Music Valve Studios. O'Hanley earnestly e-mailed Agnello, requesting his involvement, to which he agreed. The album was mastered by Greg Calbi and Steve Fallone at Sterling Sound. Composition \\"Archie\\" was written in the key of A major, and follows a simple I-V-II-IV chord progression. The song begins with the faint noise of birds chirping, before O'Hanley and Rankin come in on guitar, strumming the chords that the song cycles repeatedly. This sequence has been described as \\"sparse and dreamy.\\" The sounds were achieved on dual Fender guitars with slight distortion, \\"accentuating the top end of the guitars' frequency range.\\" Hamelin subsequently initiates a \\"driving backbeat\\" on his kit, while the guitar work possesses a contemplative, jangly sound. The song carries a considerable amount of reverb, sonically. O'Hanley introduces a counter-melody to the vocal line on a Fender Jazzmaster, making heavy use of the tremolo bar. The song has been variously categorized under the genres indie pop, indie rock, twee pop, dream pop, guitar pop, and surf rock. The song's tone was frequently compared to the acts Camera Obscura, Belle and Sebastian, and Teenage Fanclub, which were all influences on the group. Rankin wrote the song before Alvvays was formed. The song came at a period in which she had moved from Halifax, where she was attending school, to Prince Edward Island, and waitressed at a pub to make ends meet. She wrote the song at a rural farmhouse she lived in with O'Hanley for a year. The town had gone through its worst snowstorm in thirty years, and the home was engulfed in of snow. She remembered: \\"We had a snowmobile to get to the road, but we ended up burying the snowmobile. I guess we were inspired by it being so bleak\\". In an interview, Rankin detailed the track as \\"an open assessment on the idea of marriage.\\" It criticizes the standard expectation to marry when one reaches adulthood. Rankin at this period was in her mid-twenties and observed that while many of her friends were engaged to be married, she was not and pursuing a different path. She went into detail about this expectation: \\"We [all] watch a lot of people 'grow up' and get mortgages and have big dumb weddings [...] In society it's sort of looked at as 'The Next Level'.\\" She hoped to profile untypical types of love in the song, such as the dangerous type of partnership embodied by the criminal couple Bonnie and Clyde. The character Archie is fictitious. Rankin took the name for the character from Archie Rankin, her geologist/musician cousin formerly of the band Mardeen. \\"He's a very burly, curly-haired, super Scottish fisherman type. I think he was very perplexed about it,\\" Rankin admitted. Some journalists took the title as a reference to Archie Comics, which Rankin confirmed was untrue. Throughout the song, Rankin yearns for this partner's commitment. Each refrain begins with Rankin shouting \\"Hey\\" twice, before crooning the title. She paints a portrait of a lover burdened by financial pressure and unwilling to consider marriage: \\"You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony / You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony.\\" These lyrics have been interpreted as a reference to the increasing cost of student loan debt in North America at the time of the song's release. Rankin implores her beau to disregard his worries, and a proper ceremony, and simply unionize legally: \\"So honey take me by the hand and we can sign some papers / Forget the invitations, floral arrangements, and bread makers.\\" Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman interpreted these verses as \\"[sounding] less like she's fighting for the love of her life than checking items off a list.\\" In an interview, she described the song as \\"Just two kids without any direction, doing it on a whim in a courthouse, saying 'Who cares?' to everyone else who has all of their ducks in a row before settling down. It was the most romantic thing I could think of at the time.\\" Mike Katzif of NPR interpreted Rankin's point of view as confrontation of her own \\"conflicting motives and outside expectations.\\" Its lyrics have been considered tongue-in-cheek, while its subject matter has been characterized as melancholy or bittersweet. Music video View from Toronto Islands, where the song's music video was shot The song's official music video, directed by Gavin Keen and Allison Johnston, was released on July 30, 2014. In the grainy, lo-fi video, the band employ driftwood and a wedding cake to spell out the song's title, which is also spelled in sign language. Rankin is then depicted in a wedding dress, walking with a groom amidst a cloud of confetti. It also features the band sailing on a boat, an aquarium, a freak show, and images of the seafront at Coney Island. The sailboat was borrowed from a friend's parents, and the seaside shots were filmed off the coast of the Toronto Islands. For \\"Archie\\", the band initially shot with a full crew and professional high-definition digital equipment, but they concluded it did not feel like them. The group shot the final clip themselves using a Super 8 film camera, as they did in their video for \\"Adult Diversion\\" (2013). Halfway through filming, the camera battery was damaged by seawater. The group neutralized the battery fluid using vinegar and resumed filming. Employing outdated technology to film a music video was not a new concept, and several other indie music videos of this era utilize the Super 8 specifically, including the clips for the Pains of Being Pure at Heart's \\"Everything with You\\" (2008), Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' \\"Home\\" (2010), and Toro y Moi's \\"Still Sound\\" (2011). \\"The video is full of unstable handheld shots, discoloration, over-exposure, and dust marks, which further reinforce the appearance of the video as being homemade,\\" observed editors Lori A. Burns and Stan Hawkins in their 2019 Handbook of Popular Music Video Analysis. Alex Hudson of Exclaim! described the clip: \\"[The band] don some nifty sweaters and neckerchiefs, while some psychedelically colour-tinted effects add to the wooziness of the proceedings.\\" Robin Murray at Clash described the video as \\"wry, funny, and cute.\\" Release \\"Archie, Marry Me\\" was initially self- released as an early demo. The song was uploaded to SoundCloud and shared via the band's official website/Tumblr on April 6, 2013. Likewise, early copies of the album were made on cassette for festival bookers and fans at concerts to pass around. The song wasn't an immediate hit, and it took months for it to attract attention. \\"Archie\\" made its way onto various indie mp3 blogs, as did their second single \\"Adult Diversion\\" (2013), which led to their signing to independent record label Royal Mountain Records in late 2013. In the United States and Europe, \\"Archie\\" was licensed to Polyvinyl and Transgressive Records, respectively. On April 24, 2014, Polyvinyl began promoting \\"Archie, Marry Me\\" in the lead-up to the album's release via digital download; later that year, they issued it as a 7\\" single, with \\"Adult Diverson\\" as its B-side, exclusively to mail-order subscribers. Both the aforementioned companies distributed promo CDs with those tracks in their countries, aiming for airplay on college radio stations. Altogether, the song did not chart commercially. Troy Reimink, writing for the Detroit Free Press, suggested that \\"in another era, [the song would be] inescapable on the radio.\\" The song became popular online in mid-2014, finding an audience organically. It \\"lifted the Toronto quartet out of obscurity,\\" and was considered the band's breakthrough hit. Spin Ilana Kaplan wrote that it \\"garnered the attention of both indie-rock and pop fans alike.\\" Broadcaster Talia Schlanger said the song \\"turned the unknown band from Toronto into instant indie darlings.\\" Its success was considered unusual in that it lacked hallmarks of young indie bands' success stories, such as a licensing it for placement on television. Its publicity was also credited to Stars singer Torquil Campbell, who, on the CBC Radio One show Q, proclaimed it as his song of the summer. AllMusic biographer Scott Kerr credits the album's \\"sensational\\" popularity to \\"Archie, Marry Me\\". It went viral on Spotify, and was a favorite of BBC Radio 6 Music, an alternative digital station. Reception Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork, in his review, likened its sound to Neil Young, and complimenting its commitment to a more contemporary union as \\"a new sort of forever [...] some ideas—some desires—have ways of sticking around.\\" Chicago Tribune editorialist Josh Terry considered the song timeless, calling it \\"likable pop wrapped in a jangly, indie rock package.\\" He considered it similar to indie fore-bearers Teenage Fanclub or My Bloody Valentine, but thematically akin to \\"the lovelorn innocence of the Beatles.\\" Spins Ilana Kaplan praised the song as \\"superlatively catchy,\\" while Miles Bowe from Stereogum complimented its bittersweet tone and heavy guitars. Katzif of NPR abstractly compared its refrain to the feeling of summer, praising its \\"crisp guitars, [and] effervescent melodies,\\" as well as its \\"deceptively more nuanced\\" lyrical content. Rolling Stone contributor Simon Vozick-Levinson extolled it as the \\"kind of song some acts spend careers trying to write.\\" The song has been covered by musician Ben Gibbard, best-known for his band Death Cab for Cutie, who considered it his favorite song of that year. The song was ranked among the best tracks of 2014 by Rolling Stone, NME, Pitchfork, and the Washington Post. Rolling Stone later placed it at number 28 on its list of the 100 Best Songs of the 2010s, and altogether among the best new songs of the 21st century. \\"Archie, Marry Me\\" has repeatedly been called a \\"indie-pop classic,\\" and widely interpreted as a love song. Its satirical portrayal of marriage rather was lost on some listeners; Vozick-Levinson called it \\"one of the decade's most romantic songs at the same.\\" For Rankin, this was a rather unintentional conclusion to reach, but she conceded that \\"I'm glad people can glean their own narrative from the song.\\" Credits and personnel Credits adapted from Alvvays liner notes. ;Alvvays * Molly Rankin guitar, vocals, songwriting * Alec O'Hanley guitar, vocals, songwriting, keyboards, drum machine, additional mixing * Brian Murphy bass guitar * Eric Hamelin drums ;Production * Chad VanGaalen producer, recording engineer, programmer, tambourine, bongos * Graham Walsh additional tracking * Jeff McMurrich additional tracking * John Agnello mixing * Ian McGettigan additional mixing * Greg Calbi mastering engineer * Steve Fallone additional mastering Notes References External links * 2013 singles 2013 songs Alvvays songs Satirical songs Songs about marriage ","title":"Archie, Marry Me"},{"id":"58447535","text":"Samuel Jessner (5 January 1859 - 7 December 1929) was a German dermatologist known for his work on the skin and hair symptoms of patients suffering from syphilis.

Rosamond du Jardin (1902–1963)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14914312/rosamond-maud-dujardin was an author, best known for 17 books for teen girls published in the 1950s and 1960s. Before then, she wrote short stories and serialized novels for numerous magazines. Her work is of enduring interest in gender studies because it provides a useful view of 1950s norms and rites of passage. Personal life Rosamond du Jardin was born July 22, 1902 in Fairland, Illinois and grew up in Chicago. She married Victor du Jardin. They had three children. An elementary school in Bloomingdale, Illinois is named for her. Du Jardin died March 27, 1963. Writing career Du Jardin's teen series fiction was praised for showing \\"understanding of the young viewpoint,\\"Chicago Sunday Tribune, quoted on the back cover of Double Feature (1963). but like many novels for teen girls of the era (notably Betty Cavanna's and Anne Emery's, which are often discussed with du Jardin's), her plots favored romance and conformity. The choice of the right dress and the right boyfriend were often the key to happiness. Perhaps her most popular series was her four-book set about Pam and Penny Howard, twins who need to learn to establish themselves as individuals. The series begins with the twins' senior year of high school and continues through the end of their college years. Other series were about Marcy Rhodes and Tobey and Midge Heydon. She also wrote a historical novel, Young and Fair, and co-wrote a work of nonfiction about her daughter's college junior year abroad.

The official explanation focused on protecting Belgium as a neutral country; the main reason, however, was to prevent a French defeat that would have left Germany in control of Western Europe. The Liberal Party was in power with Prime minister H.H. Asquith and foreign minister Edward Grey leading the way. The Liberal cabinet made the decision, although the party had been strongly anti-war until the last minute. The Conservative Party was pro-war. The Liberals knew that if they split on the war issue, they would lose control of the government to the Conservatives. Daily Mail on Aug 5. 1914 European diplomatic alignments shortly before the war. Background The British Empire in 1914 For much of the 19th century, Britain pursued a policy later known as splendid isolation, which sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe without formal alliances. As Europe divided into two power blocs during the 1890s, the 1895-1905 Conservative government realised this left Britain dangerously exposed.Avner Cohen, \\"Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Lansdowne and British foreign policy 1901–1903: From collaboration to confrontation.\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History 43#2 (1997): 122-134. This resulted in the 1902 Anglo- Japanese Alliance, followed by King Edward VII's 1903 visit to Paris. By reducing anti-British feeling in France, it led to the 1904 Entente Cordiale, the first tangible impact of which was British support for France against Germany in the 1905 Moroccan Crisis. In 1907, the new Liberal government agreed the Anglo-Russian Convention. Like the Entente, the Convention focused on resolving colonial disputes but by doing so, paved the way for wider co- operation and allowed Britain to refocus its naval resources in response to German naval expansion. HMS Dreadnought. The 1902, 1904 and 1907 agreements with Japan, France and Russia allowed Britain to refocus resources during the Anglo-German naval arms race The 1911 Agadir Crisis encouraged secret military negotiations between France and Britain in the case of war with Germany. A British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 men would be landed in France within two weeks of war, while naval arrangements allocated responsibility for the Mediterranean to France, with the Royal Navy looking after the North Sea and the Channel, including Northern France. Britain was effectively bound to support France in a war against Germany regardless but this was not widely understood outside government or the military. Antagonism with Germany In explaining why Britain went to war with Germany, British historian Paul Kennedy (1980) recognised it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of neutral Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France (pp. 457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870, when Prussia and the German states smashed France, would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy-makers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security. Christopher Clark points out that the British cabinet decided on July 29, 1914, that being a signatory to the 1839 treaty about Belgium did not obligate it to oppose a German invasion of Belgium with military force.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers (2012) p. 539. Decision for war Immediately after the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on 28 June, British newspapers denounced the killer Gavrilo Prìncip and were generally sympathetic to the Habsburg monarchy. The papers blamed Serbia with rhetoric against \\"fanatics\\", \\"dangerous forces\\" and \\"reckless agitators\\". These responses included the political spectrum as Liberal and Conservative papers expressed their shock and dismay. By 27 July, press opinion had turned against Austria-Hungary. The national press divided on party lines. Conservative papers stressing the obligation to support France. Liberal papers insisted Britain had no such commitment and should remain neutral.

As Germany and Russia became central players British leaders increasingly had a sense of commitment to defending France against Germany. Firstly, if Germany again conquered France as had happened in the Franco-Prussian War, it would become a major threat to British economic, political and cultural interests. Secondly, partisanship was involved. The Liberal Party was identified with internationalism and free trade, and opposition to jingoism and warfare. By contrast the Conservative Party was identified as the party of nationalism and patriotism; Britons expected it \\"to show capacity in running a war.\\" Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party 1914-1935 (1966) p 51. Liberal voters demanded peace, but they also were outraged when the Germans treated Belgian neutrality as a worthless \\"scrap of paper\\" (in the words of the German chancellor ridiculing the Treaty of London (1839)). Germany, en route to a massive attack on France, invaded Belgium early on the morning of 4 August. The victims called upon Britain for military rescue under the 1839 treaty and in response, London gave Berlin an ultimatum which expired at 11pm London time, which was ignored. The king declared war on Germany that evening.Adrian Gregory, \\"A Clash of Cultures: The British Press and the Opening of the Great War,\\" in A Call to Arms: Propaganda, Public Opinion, and Newspapers in the Great War, edited by Troy R. E. Paddock, (Praeger, 2004) pp 15–49. Before war was declared, newspapers gave extensive coverage but ranged widely in recommended policy recommendations from peace to war.Hale, Publicity and Diplomacy: With Special Reference to England and Germany, 1890-1914 (1940) pp 446-70.Scott, Five Weeks: The Surge of Public Opinion on the Eve of the Great War (1927) pp 99–153 C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian maintained an intense campaign against war. It denounced a \\"conspiracy to drag us into a war against England’s interests\\", arguing that it would amount to a \\"crime against Europe\\" and warning that it would \\"throw away the accumulated progress of half a century\\". David Lloyd George told Scott on Tuesday 4 August 1914, \\"Up until last Sunday only two members of the Cabinet had been in favour of our intervention in the war but the violation of Belgian territory had completely altered the situation\\". According to Isabel V. Hull: :Annika Mombauer correctly sums up the current historiography: \\"Few historians would still maintain that the 'rape of Belgium was the real motive for Britain's declaration of war on Germany.\\" Instead, the role of Belgian neutrality is variously interpreted as an excuse to mobilize the public, to provide embarrassed radicals in the cabinet with the justification for abandoning the principal pacifism and thus were staying in office, or in the more conspiratorial versions to cover for naked imperial interests. Isabel V. Hull, A Scrap of Paper: Breaking and Making International Law during the Great War (Cornell UP, 2014) p, 33 Once war was declared defence of Belgium rather than France was the public reason given for war. Propaganda posters emphasized that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London.Bentley B. Gilbert, \\"Pacifist to interventionist: David Lloyd George in 1911 and 1914. Was Belgium an issue?.\\" Historical Journal 28.4 (1985): 863-885.Zara S. Steiner, Britain and the origins of the First World War (1977) pp 235-237. Lord Palmerston visible at the top) that guaranteed Belgian neutrality as merely a \\"scrap of paper\\" that Germany would ignore. As late as 1 August 1914, the great majority of Liberals—both voters and cabinet members—strongly opposed going to war. The German invasion of Belgium was such an outrageous violation of international rights that Liberals agreed for war on August 4. Historian Zara Steiner says: :The public mood did change. Belgium proved to be a catalyst which unleashed the many emotions, rationalizations, and glorifications of war which had long been part of the British climate of opinion. Having a moral cause, all the latent anti-German feelings, that by years of naval rivalry and assumed enmity, rose to the surface. The 'scrap of paper' proved decisive both in maintaining the unity of the government and then in providing a focal point for public feeling.Zara S. Steiner, Britain and the Origins of the First World War (1977) p 233. The Liberals succeeded in mending their deep division over warfare. Unless the Liberal government acted decisively against the German invasion of France, its top leaders including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, Foreign Minister Edward Grey, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill and others would resign, leading to a risk that the much more pro-war Conservative Party might form a government. Mistreatment of Belgium was not itself a fundamental cause of British entry, but it was used extensively as a justification in wartime propaganda to motivate the British people. The German high command was aware that entering Belgium could trigger British intervention but decided the risk was acceptable; they expected it to be a short war while their ambassador in London claimed civil war in Ireland would prevent Britain from assisting France. Historians looking at the July crisis typically conclude that Grey: :was not a great foreign secretary but an honest, reticent, punctilious English gentleman.... He exhibited a judicious understanding of European affairs, a firm control of his staff, and a suppleness and tact in diplomacy, but he had no boldness, no imagination, no ability to command men and events. [Regarding the war] He pursued a cautious, moderate policy, one that not only fitted his temperament, but also reflected the deep split in the Cabinet, in the Liberal party, and in public opinion.Clayton Roberts and David F. Roberts, A History of England, Volume 2: 1688 to the present. Vol. 2 (3rd edition, 1991) p. 722. Canada automatically joined the war, and vigorously recruited volunteers. =Irish crisis on hold= Until late July, British politics was totally focused on the threat of civil war in Ireland. In 1912 the government had presented a Home Rule bill that Irish nationalists demanded; under the terms of the Parliament Act 1911, by which the House of Lords retained the right to delay legislation by up to two years, it was due to become law in 1914. The Ulster Protestants demanded separate treatment; by 1914 the government was offering a six-year opt-out to the six counties which would eventually become Northern Ireland, but not the permanent exemption which they demanded. Both sides in Ireland had smuggled in weapons, set up militias with tens of thousands of volunteers, were drilling, and were ready to fight a civil war. The British Army itself was paralyzed: during the Curragh Incident officers threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than obey orders to deploy into Ulster. Elements of the Unionist (Conservative) Party supported them. On 25 July the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia became known, and the cabinet realized that war with Germany was increasingly likely. The Government of Ireland Act 1914 was enacted into law, but was suspended for the duration of hostilities, with the issue of Ulster still unresolved.J. A. Spender and Cyril Asquith. Life of Herbert Henry Asquith, Lord Oxford and Asquith (1932 ) vol 2 p 55. Grey told Parliament on 3 August \\"The one bright spot in the whole of this terrible situation is Ireland. [Prolonged cheers.] The general feeling throughout Ireland, and I would like this to be clearly understood abroad, does not make that a consideration that we feel we have to take into account.[Cheers.]\\" Empire at war The king's declaration of war automatically involved all dominions and colonies and protectorates of the British Empire, many of whom made significant contributions to the Allied war effort, both in the provision of troops and civilian labourers.

The ISPA was founded in 1976 by Peter Brand and Martha Prickartz in Aachen, Germany. It initially crossed swords with the world's largest national Skat association, the German Skat Association (Deutscher Skatverband, DSkV), and promulgated different rules for the game. Towards the end of the 1990s, talks between the top officials of each organisation led to rapprochement and agreement between the two large associations. The ban on double membership was lifted and a uniform International Skat Order (Internationale Skatordnung , ISkO) was adopted, which has been valid worldwide ever since. The ISPA delegates two regular commissioners to the International Skat Court (Internationale Skatgericht). ISPA World is divided into national branches with regional groups and further subdivisions down to local clubs. It operates its own leagues as well as cup and championship competitions. Its focus is on the open World and European Skat Championships, which have been held annually since 1978/1979 at various venues. In addition, ISPA has organized the Online Skat World Championships biennially since 2011. Furthermore, ISPA publishes the annual magazine, Skatmagazin. The subdivision of ISPA Germany (ISPA-Deutschland) has relatively few members in comparison with the DSkV and is inter alia jointly responsible for organising the annual German Skat Championship. This results in double events, because the DSkV also organises German championships with individual and team competitions and runs federal and regional Skat leagues.Meisterschaften & Turniere im DSkV  External links  * Official website (international) * Official website of ISPA Germany * Ein \\"Weltverband der Skatspieler\\", in der Bundesrepublik gegründet, tastet die Einheit der deutschen Skatbrüder an, in: Der Spiegel, 8 May 1978  References  Skat (card game) International sports organizations Organisations based in North Rhine-Westphalia 1976 establishments in Germany Sport in Aachen ","title":"International Skat Players Association"},{"id":"58447870","text":"Angela Hannah McCarthy is a New Zealand history academic, and as of 2018 is a full professor at the University of Otago.

It's a tribute to the 1967 album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, released fifty years ago at the time of recording. It's also Pizzarelli's first foray into the genre since his 2004 album Bossa Nova. The album features Jobim's grandson Daniel Jobim on piano and vocals, whose parts were recorded in his native Brazil. Other backing vocals are provided by his wife Jessica Molaskey, and daughter Madeleine Pizzarelli. The tracks include Antonio's Song, a tribute to Jobim by Michael Franks whom Pizzarelli also cited as a hero of his. Also included are two new tracks written by Pizzarelli and Molaskey. Reception Matt Collar of AllMusic rated it with the best of John Pizzarelli's albums to date, with 4.5 stars. He commented \\"Sinatra & Jobim at 50 works as both an homage to two of Pizzarelli's biggest influences and a revealing showcase for his ever deepening musical palette,\\" and that \\"the album was an unexpected delight for fans.\\" C. Michael Bailey summarised the album for All About Jazz as a \\"quiet, breezy affair of lilting Brazilian rhythms and melodies played by a crack team of musicians.\\" He commented \\"singing and guitar playing are of the level we have come to expect of Pizzarelli, who has matured fully into this role of keeper of the flame for this flavor of jazz music.\\" Will Friedwald of The Wall Street Journal ended his review saying the album \\"succeed[ed] at maintaining a tricky balance: staying true to the [original] while, at the same time, creating something new and exciting out of music already considered classic.

It aired in the United States on Fox on October 20, 2019. The episode was written by J. Stewart Burns, and was directed by Timothy Bailey. Plot =Opening sequence= In a parody of The Omen, Homer and Marge bring Maggie home after trading her due to originally having a boy, and she shows satanic powers and torments the family and the other people of Springfield. Ned vows to get rid of the evil, sacrificing her inside the First Church of Springfield, but Homer and Marge stop him. Ned however shows them the Mark of the Beast on her head, Mickey Mouse's logo, in reference to the Disney acquisition of Fox, and then reveals 666, parodying that this is the 666th episode. Maggie then kills all three of them, and the title for the episode appears, up top of the number of the beast 666 reads \\"episode\\" and below \\"or 667 if Fox changes the schedule\\" =Danger Things= The plot is a parody of Stranger Things season 1, featuring Milhouse as Will, Bart as Mike, Nelson as Dustin and Lisa as Eleven. The story takes place in the 1980s, where after a night of playing the Atari 2600 game E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Milhouse gets kidnapped by a Demogorgon. A concerned Kirk starts going crazy by destroying the wall and creating a Christmas light alphabet communication device (like what Joyce Byers used to communicate with Will in Stranger Things) to look for his son. The device actually works when Milhouse in the Over Under (parody of the Upside Down) uses it to send an SOS signal to his parents. Milhouse then calls the Simpson house with Lisa picking up, after Milhouse realises Lisa does not love him back he hangs up. Lisa goes to Starcourt Mall (infested by rats that change the sign into Rats court Mall) to find Bart and Nelson at the arcade. She tells them that Milhouse is still alive and in another dimension; Bart does not realize until Milhouse appears on the game he is playing. They decide to get help from Professor Frink to travel to the Over Under using a sensory deprivation device. As the device requires someone of high intelligence, a freshly-shaved bald Lisa volunteers and finds Milhouse in the other dimension. Whilst escaping, they find an alternate version of Springfield full of Demogorgons (with Comic Book Guy and Moe Szyslak). Lisa and Milhouse are surrounded by Demogorgons so Lisa uses her hidden psychic powers to get rid of the creatures. They are finally saved by Homer, who is working for Mr. Burns's secret government program to find monsters; however he informs them that they are permanently trapped in the new dimension. Lisa is horrified until a Demogorgon informs her that there is affordable housing and excellent schools as well as local shops and restaurants. With this new information, the Simpsons decide to live in the Over Under. Homer is glad that Ned is not there until a Demogorgon version of Ned appears, causing Homer to burn the Demogorgon. =Heaven Swipes Right= At the Springfield Atoms Stadium, Homer, Moe, Lenny and Carl are watching the Springfield Atoms vs. Shelbyville Shelbyvillians match, and when the crowd starts shouting choke, a hotdog ends up choking Homer to death. Arriving in Heaven, he meets St. Greeter, who welcomes him with the pun on his name, but Homer does not forgive the pun so he gets damned to Hell. Homer finds out God sold Heaven to Google, before discovering he died before his time, but cannot be sent back to Earth in his body due to the decay. Homer is given the option to live the life of a man who was going to die that day, so Homer chooses a football player's body. He goes to Marge and she loves the new body, but he ruins it in one night by overeating. Bart and Marge convince him to try Superintendent Chalmers as the next body. At school, Homer makes Principal Skinner give Bart all As and twist his nipple till its deep purple, and then goes to his house just to see he makes very little money, so Homer changes his body again, but Marge has had enough. Homer has to settle in for one body and stop changing, so he chooses the one of the man that loves her as much as he does, Moe, however Moe finds himself in Maggie's body and informs her he is thirsty. =When Hairy Met Slimy= This segment of the episode was a parody in the 2017 film, The Shape of Water. At the Power Plant, Selma enters a maximum security door to sneak a smoke. She finds herself in a laboratory, where she meets Kang and they fall in love. After offering to provide the secret to clean, natural energy, Mr. Burns wants to dissect him, so they flee to a distant galaxy, with Homer's much-obliged help. Selma and Homer sneak Kang out in a waste container full of rats, but Burns finds them. Kang bites off Smithers' head and knocks out Burns, with Barney driving the trio out in his car. Burns and the military follow, but his driver is shot as they flee to Mt. Springfield. Thinking they are safe, Kodos arrives with a ship but a shooting takes place and Selma is hit in the stomach. Kang then pulls out Thanos' infinity gauntlet to eliminate all military people, and when Burns survives, he hits him with a tin can. Kang then heals Selma and tells her he is pregnant. Patty arrives, protesting they are too different, being of different zodiac signs, but Kang points out he is from Sagittarius. Patty begs her not to go but falls in love with Kodos. They fly to space, and find themselves on the honeymoon planet, in the cool season, where it is 4,000 °F. The episode ends with a collage of clips from previous Treehouse of Horror episodes. Reception The episode was moderately well-received by critics. AV Club gave it an overall grade of B-, and said \\"The XXXth/666th \\"Treehouse Of Horror\\" is just The Simpsons' wheezy annual horror exercise.\\" Frightday was less impressed, saying \\"It’s hard to criticize a late series Simpsons episode without sounding like an old man yelling at a cloud, but this installment was a big letdown.\\" “Den of Geek” gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars.

A plan of the pension reform was unexpectedly announced by the Government of Russia on June 14, 2018, which was the opening day of the Football World Cup hosted in Russia. During the tournament, any demonstrations were prohibited, but afterwards (from July 2018, ongoing) thousands of Russians expressed their negative opinion on the planned reform of the pension system. The anti-reform rallies and other actions were mostly organized by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and A Just Russia party. However other political parties, trade unions and individuals also contributed to coordination of these protests. The corresponding bill was signed into law on October 3; afterwards some actions against the reform were continued although with a lower intensity. An intention to hike the national retirement age and the more so a final decision to launch the reform have drastically downed the rating of the president Vladimir Putin and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in Russia. For example, in July 2018, just 49% would vote for Putin if the presidential elections were held in that moment (while during the elections in March, he got 76,7%).  Background  On June 14, 2018, using a start of the FIFA World Cup as a cover, the Russian government announced the plan of the pension reform presuming a substantial increase of the retirement age (for men from 60 to 65 and for women from 55 to 63). Previously, until the 2018 Russian presidential election, this topic was practically silenced in Russian state media, in particular several days before the election the RIA Novosti agency published an article denying existence of any intentions to raise the pension age until 2030. In the previous years the problem was sporadically discussed but with no special accent. So an announcement of the reform plan by Prime Minister Medvedev has shocked the majority of Russian citizens. The pension reform became the central question in Russia at that time. Immediate protests during the World Cup were, however, not allowed (except Internet-activism) from security reasons. The street protest actions were appointed for the end-July and subsequent months. The government was accused of misusing soccer for hiding the unpopular measures. Near 90% of Russian citizens do not approve of the reform. On July 19, during the first reading of the corresponding bill in the State Duma, the pro-Putin political party United Russia (with a single exception of Natalia Poklonskaya) has supported the retirement age hike, while all the opposition fractions, left-wing and liberal, were against it.  Key protest events  Statistical studies show that the number of protest actions in the country has nearly tripled in the third quarter from the year before, almost exclusively because of the plan to raise the retirement age. = July–August 2018 = Anti-reform action on 28 July in Moscow The first noteworthy street rallies, related with the retirement-age reform, proceeded on July 1. Several thousand people protested across Russia against an extremely unpopular government decision to hike the pension age that has led to a record slump in President Vladimir Putin's approval ratings. No protests were held in World Cup host cities due to a regulation banning protest in the cities for the duration of the tournament. From mid-July, protest rallies and demonstrations were organized practically every weekend, and sometimes also on working days. They occurred in nearly all major cities countrywide including Novosibirsk, Saint-Petersburg and Moscow. Total number of participants exceeded 200 thousands. These events were coordinated by all opposition parties, who usually have nothing common in political affairs. Also trade unions and individual politicians (Alexey Navalny, Sergei Udaltsov) functioned as organizers of the public actions. The largest protest events of the summer occurred on July 18 and July 28–29. In particular, on July 28, more than 10,000 people attended a rally in the capital, Moscow. = September 2018 = On September 2, large-scale anti-reform manifestations were led by the Russian communists and some other left-wing oppositional political forces. In Moscow, about 9,000 people attended a rally against the governmental pension reform. A week later, on September 9, the demonstrations against the plans to raise the national retirement age were organized by Alexey Navalny all over Russia. The events occurred in more than 80 cities including the capital. The most of actions were not permitted by the authorities, and the police detained in total about 1000 participants. Beyond the anti-reform slogans, the participants chanted \\"Russia without Putin\\" and held signs with messages like \\"Putin, when will you go on pension?\\". Anti-reform rally on 22 September in Moscow Further rallies were announced for every Saturday or Sunday of September 2018. So, on September 22, the countrywide protest actions were organized by the Communist party. In Moscow, several thousands demanded abandoning the pension reform and blamed the Russian government for this unpopular initiative. The reform has heavily affected the Russia's local elections in September 2018: the results of the governmental United Russia party was the worst for more than 10 years. United Russia lost the Khabarovsk Krai gubernatorial election and Vladimir Oblast gubernatorial election to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, and lost Khakassia election to the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.  Reaction of authorities  The reform was passed by the State Duma on first reading on July 19, with a 328-104 vote. Following strong protests (and a strong fall in Putin's and United Russia's popularity), the president of Russia Vladimir Putin has submitted to the Duma some amendments to reduce the hike of the retirement age for women from 63 to 60 years (i.e. +5 instead of +8). Also some other softenings were foreseen, e.g. for women having 3 and more children. The amendments were unanimously passed by the State Duma on September 26. Nevertheless the opposition forces and the overwhelming majority of ordinary Russians estimated the presidential changes as by far insufficient and were disappointed at his decision. So in addition to the requirement of abandoning the reform in general and of the resignation of the Government, also the requirement of resignation of Vladimir Putin was raised. Despite the protests, on September 27, the amended version of the bill was passed by the State Duma on second reading with a 326-59 vote and 1 abstention . On October 3, the bill was also passed by the Federation Council with a 149-5 vote, with 3 abstentions. Finally, Putin signed the pension bill into law later on the same day. It entered into force after it was published on the Rossiyskaya Gazeta some days later.  After signing the bill into law  The oppositional political parties intended to continue fighting against the reform in order to convince the authorities to stop it. However the activity has gradually diminished and, except on November 5–7 (which commemorated the 101st anniversary of the October Revolution), no large anti-reform rallies were organized. Many people came to conclusion that neither the Government nor the president would react to street protests, if any. The pension reform was launched on January 1, 2019. A countrywide anti-reform movement was resumed from early spring 2019. Numerous picketing actions and conferences aiming at attracting attention to the potential dangers of the new pension law were organized by the left-patriotic Sut Vremeni group (leader: S. Kurginyan). Furthermore, on March 23, the CPRF called the meetings against the social politics of the Russian government (including the retirement age hike) in the largest cities of Russia, e.g. in Moscow there were several thousand attendees.

The invasion is presumed to have occurred during Malayalam Era 855 (AD 1680).  Invasion of Venad  Mukilan invaded Venad through the southern borders and held Thiruvananthapuram. The Rani of Venad, was then residing at Nedumangad Koikkal.  Destruction of Budhapuram Bhaktadasa Perumal Temple  Neythasseri Potti, one of the custodians of Padmanabhaswamy Temple, had a Temple at Budhapuram in Kanyakumari District. Koopakkara Potti, another custodian of the Temple in Trivandrum, was the Tantri of Budhapuram Temple. The Presiding Deity of Budhapuram was Lord Bhaktadasa (Balarama). There was another sanctum in the Temple housing Lord Rukmininatha (Krishna flanked by Rukmini). Neythasseri Potti came to know about Mukilan's plan to attack the Temple. With the assistance of Koopakkara Potti, Neythasseri Potti shifted the idols of Lord Balarama and Lord Rukmininatha to a nearby Swamiyar Madhom. When Mukilan and his forces launched an attack on Budhapuram Temple, Nairs and Channars of the region resisted ferociously. But Mukilan emerged victorious and he plundered the Temple. Rubbing salt into the wound, he brought cows into the Temple and killed them. Later he razed this ancient Temple to the ground. Locking up of Padmanabhaswamy Temple Historian P. Sankunni Menon has recorded that the Yogathil Potties, the custodians of Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and the eight Nair families of Travancore called Ettuveettil Pillamar had locked up the Temple and fled fearing caste pollution during the invasion.  Defeat of Mukilan  Umayamma Rani sought the assistance of Kerala Varma from northern Kottayam. Kerala Varma engaged Mukilan in battle at Thiruvattar as the major portion of the invading cavalry was dispersed from Varkala to Thovala to collect taxes. During the battle, according to legend, Mukilan was attacked by a swarm of bees and he lost his mount. The fallen commander was slain with arrows and slingshots. Three hundred horses and many swords and spears were captured from the defeated army by Kerala Varma. The Rani adapted him to the Venad household as Iraniyal prince in official recognition of the help rendered. Following this, Kerala Varma became the primary advisor of the Rani.  Remnants  Mukilan and his army is believed to have came through Ambasamudram and camped at Ottasekharamangalam Grama Panchayat and Manacaud. This place is believed to have been named Mukilanthara which later became Pukilanthara. There is a belief that the region in Kalkulam Taluk where the cavalry of Mukilan was stationed is Kuthirakkuzhi (Horse-hole). The place Kanjikkuzhi (Rice-gruel- hole) is believed to have been the place where his soldiers used to make rice gruel. The place from where the army was obtaining water was poisoned by the local population and hence came to be called Nanjukala.

Since an egg represents a complete organism at one stage of its life cycle, eating an egg is a form of predation, the killing of another organism for food. Egg predation is found widely across the animal kingdom, including in insects such as ladybirds, annelids such as the leech Cystobranchus virginicus, fishes such as haddock, snakes such as colubrids, birds such as carrion crow and buzzard, and mammals such as red fox, badgers and pine martens. Some species are specialist egg predators, but many more are generalists which take eggs when the opportunity arises. Snakes specialising in egg predation have greatly reduced venom, implying that the main function of venom is to subdue prey. Ecological relationship Generalist and omnivorous predators like this fish crow, Corvus ossifragus, eat eggs among many other prey when they have the opportunity. Egg predation is an ecological relationship in which an animal (a predator) hunts for and eats the eggs of another (prey) species. This reduces the evolutionary fitness of the parents whose eggs are preyed on. Among birds such as eider ducks in one study, half the individuals started a fresh clutch of eggs, always in a new nest, and they always avoided the area around the robbed nest. Egg predation rates can be high for ground-nesting birds such as the European golden plover, Pluvialis apricaria: in Norway 78.2% of nests of this species were preyed on. Experimental removal of two nest and egg predators, red fox and carrion crow, in another study raised the percentage of pairs that fledged young from c. 18% to c. 75%. Population increases among many generalist predators such as buzzard, badger, carrion crow, pine marten, raven, and red fox in Scotland have contributed to the decline in several ground-nesting bird species by taking eggs, young, and sitting hen (female) birds. Among fish, egg predation by species such as haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) can contribute to the decline in other fish populations such as of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). This effect can be important in attempts to restore fisheries damaged by overfishing. Invasive species such as the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis frequently prey on eggs and young of native species, in its case including those of other ladybirds such as the two-spot ladybird Adalia bipunctata. Females of the prey species laid eggs with higher amounts of defensive alkaloids when egg predation was occurring. Some colubrid snakes such as the Formosa kukri snake Oligodon formosanus specialise in egg predation. Egg predation by snakes is rarely opposed, but the Asian long- tailed skink Eutropis longicaudata aggressively protects its eggs from the Formosa kukri snake. Egg-eating snakes such as the marbled sea snake Aipysurus eydouxii have atrophied venom glands; this has been explained as an evolutionary consequence of their diet, since venom is not required to subdue their prey, unlike the case in their venomous and conventionally predatory ancestors. The aquatic piscicolid leech Cystobranchus virginicus is an egg predator; it may be an obligate egg-feeder as it has not been seen feeding on an adult but has been found in the nests of a variety of species of North American freshwater fish of the genera Campostoma and Moxostoma.

The Al Ali Fort was built in 1768 by the founder of the modern Al Mualla dynasty, Sheikh Rashid Bin Majid Al Mualla. Sheikh Hamad Bin Ibrahim Al Mualla was murdered in the fort in 1929 - shot and killed on 9 February 1929, by a slave called Saeed from the household of Hamad's blind uncle, Abdelrahman bin Ahmed Al Mualla. Hamad was succeeded by Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla following a colourful incident whereby the population of the town rose up against Abdelrahman and Saeed, who had barricaded themselves in the fort. Abandoning their initial plan of firing on the fort with a cannon, the people of the town instead elected to set a fire around the walls of the fort and in this conflagration both Abrelrahman and Saeed were killed.

He was known as a master marble-carver and was the founder of Studio Sem in Pietrasanta which has executed the monumental works of many contemporary sculptors, including Henry Moore and Joan Miro. Helaine Blumenfeld and Harold F. Clayton are amongst the artists who learned marble carving at his studio. Ghelardini died in Pietrasanta, the city of his birth, at the age of 69. Studio Sem continues to the present day, directed by his former assistant and collaborator Keara McMartin and his youngest son Pierangelo Ghelardini. Life and career Ghelardini was born in Pietrasanta, a town in the foothills of the Apuan Alps long known for its marble quarries and artisans working in marble. Michelangelo had been sent there in 1518 by Pope Leo X to source the marble for the façade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo. Marble quarry in the Apuan Alps above Pietrasanta As a 15-year-old, Ghelardini became a prominent member of the Italian resistance movement in the region, working with the American forces who would drop off money to fund their activity. After the war he studied at art schools in Massa and Florence and then returned to Pietrasanta where he trained as a marble sculptor with Dino Niccolai. When the firm they were working for went bankrupt in the early 1950s, Niccolai and Ghelardini opened their own studio specialising in the production of figurative statuary for churches and cemeteries. After Niccolai's retirement, Ghelardini carried on the firm which would later become known as Studio Sem. The business had thrived in the 1950s and early 1960s with clients from Italy and abroad. Amongst the works they executed during that time was a statue of the Madonna for Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York and the restoration of a bust of Diana for the Versailles Museum. In 1963, the Second Vatican Council advocated a retrenchment in religious art and removed the requirement that all Catholic churches have a marble statue of the church's namesake. The decision nearly brought the firm to bankruptcy and saw the closure of many marble-carving and bronze-casting businesses in Pietrasanta. However, Ghelardini was one of the first marble artisans in Italy to recognise the opportunities afforded by abstract sculpture and working with contemporary artists to help them realize the often monumental works which they had designed. It was to become the mainstay of Studio Sem. From the early 1960s Henry Moore entrusted Ghelardini's studio with the execution of the majority of his stone sculptures. Other artists for whom the studio had executed work in the 1960s and 1970s included Henri-Georges Adam, Emile Gilioli, Joan Miró, and Alicia Penalba. Amongst the artists who later collaborated with the studio were Barry Flanagan and Knut Steen. Ghelardini also took a keen interest in young sculptors, training them in stone carving and inviting them to meet with the major artists who were visiting the studio to supervise the execution of their works. Sculptors who trained with Ghelardini include Helaine Blumenfeld and Harold F. Clayton. In 2018, Blumenfeld described her first meeting with Ghelardini in 1974: Blumenfeld's Tempesta, executed at Studio Sem and installed at The Lancasters, London in 2012 > He was so charismatic. I immediately thought about Picasso because he had > that same vitality. Following a series of strokes which began in 1996 and became progressively worse, Sem Ghelardini died in Pietrasanta on 12 January 1997 at the age of 69. An exhibition by artists associated with his studio, entitled Omaggio a Sem: Se tutto va bene...siamo rovinati, took place in the town in the autumn of that year. In 2012, Piazza Sem Ghelardini in Pietrasanta was named in his honour. In the later years of his life, Ghelardini had acquired Il Feudo, a small farm in the hills outside Montignoso, and designed the vineyard's unique terracing system made from off-cuts of granite. The vineyard and its winery continue to be run by members of the Ghelardini family. Studio Sem after Ghelardini Since Gelardini's death, Studio Sem has been run jointly by his former assistant and collaborator Keara McMartin and his youngest son Pierangelo who is also a marble carver. The studio continues to specialise in the execution of works for contemporary sculptors including Helaine Blumenfeld, Damien Hirst and Peter Randall-Page but also produces classical and religious statuary. The Fondazione Sem, founded in 2003 and administered by McMartin and Pierangelo Ghelardini, has provided three-month residencies at the studio for emerging sculptors since 2006. The residency program is financed by the Brian Mercer Charitable Trust and was set up by Helaine Blumenfeld and the Royal British Society of Sculptors. Masters and Emerging Sculptors from Studio Sem, a major exhibition of 36 artists who had worked at the studio from the 1960s to the early 2000s, was held in the University of Leicester's Harold Martin Botanic Garden from July to September 2007. In 2016, the studio and its artists moved from the crowded historic center of Pietrasanta to more spacious premises in the nearby town of Camaiore.

A notional basis for Eritrean nationalism initially seems lacking, due to the divergence in its demographics. Eritrea has nine major ethnic groups, each with their own language and culture and is evenly split between two major religions. However the Eritrean government seeks to foster Eritrean nationalism through programs such as national service programs, the promotion of liberal nationalism and curbing foreign influences.Sorenson, John. \\"Discourses on Eritrean nationalism and identity.\\" The Journal of Modern African Studies 29.2 (1991): 301-317.

Education Goemanne began studying music at the age of six, and obtained his first music degrees magna cum laude from a so-called \\"central examination board\\".A government institution (in Goemanne’s days organized by the Belgian state, nowadays by the Flemish Community), which allows anyone to obtain various kinds of degrees without having taken state-approved courses. He then studied full-time at the Lemmensinstituut, where he had renowned teachers, among them composer Marinus De Jong, choirmaster Jules Van Nuffel, and organist Flor Peeters; and at the Royal Conservatory of Liège, where he his teachers included Pierre Froidebise and Charles Hens. Subsequently he studied for two more years with Flor Peeters as a private student.These details about his education in \\"Noël Goemanne: componist, orgelist\\" in Vlaanderen 17 (1968), p. 26–27; also available here (in Dutch). In Belgium During World War II the Nazi occupier tried to persuade him to become a composer for the Third Reich, but he refused. He was later arrested for playing music by Felix Mendelssohn, a Jewish composer, in public. His wartime experiences turned him into a committed pacifist, which was reflected in his demand, which he stuck to till the end of his life, that his singers sing the \\"Dona nobis pacem\\" (Grant us peace), the final words of the Agnus Dei, with all the power they had.Goemanne’s pacifism is described in Katleen Jun’s obituary, here, an excerpt of an older issue of The American Organist. Between 1950 and 1952, he was a regular piano recitalist for the Namur station of the Belgian National Broadcasting Institute, and from 1949 till 1952 he was organist and choirmaster at Rochefort. But he soon realized that Europe had a surfeit of organists. Newly married, he emigrated to the US in 1952. In the USA In the USA he was active as a choirmaster and organist of a number of Catholic churches in Victoria, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; Birmingham, Alabama; and Dallas, where he served in Christ the King Catholic Church from 1972 till the end of his life. He also taught music in various places, including the Palestrina Institute for Sacred Music in Detroit,According to Denis Havard de la Montagne, \\"Thomas Martin KURAS\\" on this page of the Musica et Memoria website, a school (1940–late 1960s) established to teach sacred music to future ecclesiastical musicians and to promote religious music in accordance with Pope Pius X’s Tra le sollecitudini and funded by the Archdiocese of Detroit. Saint John’s University, Saint Joseph’s College, and Tarrant County Junior College. He also gave workshops on sacred music in a number of colleges and universities during the 1960s. As a composer, he wrote over 200 sacred compositions, a number of them occasioned by the changes in Roman Catholic liturgy following the second Vatican Council. He was the first to compose masses in English that were approved for the liturgy. But his 20-plus masses are not all in English, for he often combines English and Latin texts in his masses. In 1987 he was commissioned to write the processional for the mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II during his visit to San Antonio (TX); this was Goemanne's Fanfare and Concertato on 'All Creatures of Our God and King'. He had his works published by various publishing houses, two of which, GIA Publications and World Library Publications (WLP, the music and liturgy division of the J.S. Paluch company; in Goemanne’s time called \\"World Library of Sacred Music\\") deserve special mention, as they still (2018) retain dozens of his works in their catalogs. This indicates that they are still performed quite regularly. Private life Goemanne was married to Janine Marloye, by whom he had three children.

In recognition of his deep devotion to the music and culture of Uttarakhand, he has been described as the \\"Bhishma Pitamah of Uttarakhand folk music\\".  Early life  Rahi was born Chander Singh Negi to Dilbar Singh Negi and Sundara Devi in a Giwali village in Maudadsyun. He belonged to a modest Ghadiyal family from the Nayar Valley of Pauri in Garhwal, Uttarakhand. Rahi and his brother, Dev Raj Rangeela, learned the tradition of Pahari (originating from the hills) music from their father, a singer of the jagar music of Uttarakhand. Rahi learned the foundations of Pahari music, including age-old traditional songs, musical instruments, and the cultural practices associated with the music of the Himalayas, early in life. As a child, he accompanied his father on traditional musical instruments, including the thakuli, the damru, and the huruki. Rahi learned Indian classical music with Keshav Anuragi and his guru, Bachan Singh, much later in his adult life.  Musical career  Rahi made his singing career debut on the All India Radio (AIR) Delhi station on 13 March 1963, on a program for army personnel, with the song \\"Par veena ki\\". He started singing for AIR Lucknow in 1972. He continued gaining popularity in Uttarakhand through the 1970s, when his songs were broadcast from the AIR Najibabad station, and from the 1980s onwards, when his songs were broadcast on Doordarshan. His was the first Garhwali voice to be heard on the radio. In 1966, Rahi composed his famous geet (song) \\"Dil ko umaal\\" (Outpourings of the Heart) for his mentor, the Garhwali poet Kanhaiyalal Dandriyal, who is said to have given him the sobriquet Rahi (traveller). Rahi sang more than 550 songs in the Garhwali and Kumaoni languages. His work was available on more than 140 audio cassettes. He performed live in over 1,500 shows across India. Some of his celebrated songs include \\"Sarg tara junyali rata ko sunalo\\", \\"Fyonladiya, Dekh hilma chandi ku batana\\", \\"Chaita ki chaitwali\\", \\"Bhana ho rangeela bhana\\", \\"Satpuli ka senna meri bau surila\\", \\"Tile dharu bola Madhuli\\", \\"Tyere chadri chhutgye pichhne\\", and \\"Sauli ghura ghur\\". His first recorded album, Sauli ghura ghur, was a commercial hit. Rahi was also a songwriter and poet. His poetry collections include Dil ko Umaal (1966), Dhai (1980), Ramchhol (1981), and Geet Ganga (2010). Rahi also wrote monographs and composed music for ballets. Rahi was considered to be the only person who could play all the folk instruments of Uttarakhand, including the dhol damau (drums), the shehnai, the daur, the thaali, and the huruki. He also had knowledge of the unknown tala sequences (beat patterns) unique to Pahari music and would seamlessly incorporate these elements in his musical presentations. Rahi collected and curated more than 2,500 age-old traditional songs covering various folk forms of Uttarakhand including \\"Khuder Geet\\", \\"Sanskar Geet\\", \\"Barhai\\", \\"Panwara\\", \\"Mela Geet\\", \\"Jhaura, Pandavani\\", \\"Chaunfla\\", \\"Thadiya\\", and \\"Jaagar\\". His book, A Comprehensive Study of the Songs, Musical Instruments, and Dances of the Central Himalayas, was to be published by Uttaranchal Sahitya, Sanskriti evam Kala Parishad. He was also an avid collector of folk musical instruments of Uttarakhand.  Personal life  Rahi sold flutes for a living during his early days in Delhi, to which he had moved from his native Garhwal in 1957. His search for a stable livelihood finally ended successfully when he got a government job with the telecom department. Rahi lived in a rented house in the Shakarpur locality of Delhi for 40 years. An anecdote told by his family is that Rahi chose to invest the little finances that he had on recording Uttarakhandi folk music, rather than an investing in a house. Rahi died on 10 January 2016 in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife, Sudha Negi, four sons (Virendra Negi, Mahendra Negi, Satish Negi, and Rakesh Bhardwaj), and a daughter (Nidhi Thakur). His entire family is involved in the field of music, including singing, composing, playing musical instruments, production, and direction of music. Rahi is said to have passed on the bulk of his learning to his eldest son, Virendra Negi, who had worked with his father as a musician and singer since childhood. Rahi's youngest son, Rakesh Bhardwaj, a rhythmist in the Indian rock-pop band Euphoria, paid tribute to his late father's legacy by remaking and releasing Rahi's popular Uttarakhandi songs online through his music company, Pahadi Soul.  Tributes, legacy, and influence  Rahi is remembered for having lived for his art and for the community at large. He was a holistically talented artist who could sing, write, compose, and play many rare Uttarakhand instruments. He also had an excellent understanding of the intricacies and significance of his craft. Apart from his creative pursuits, Rahi was deeply passionate about conserving and propagating the music of Uttarakhand. He was considered to be a treasure trove of knowledge of the musical culture of Uttarakhand, which he continuously researched, represented, and explained to his listeners. Rahi was known for his knowledge of the folklore of all of Uttarakhand, from Jaunsar to the Jauhar Valley. He was a strong believer in presenting authentic Pahari music, and in his later years would openly express his frustration with the \\"Bollywoodisation\\" and \\"VCD culture\\" of Indian folk music. Rahi was also deeply afflicted by the loss of prestige for languages like Garhwali, Jaunsari, Bhotiya, and Kumaoni in the minds of their speakers, which signified to him the slow death of Uttarakhand's unique Pahari culture. He was also critical of the lack of cultural policy of successive Uttarakhand state governments. He was concerned with the large-scale out-migration from Uttarakhand, which he tried to address through his 1980s song \\"Apni thaati ma tu laut ke aija\\". Rahi believed that conserving folk music would help in conservation of Uttarakhand's languages and culture. Rahi continued giving demonstration lectures across the country, especially to Garhwali and Kumaoni students, to popularise and share his knowledge of the traditional folk forms and the culture that they represented. His legacy continues to be an inspiration to Uttarakhandi artists of later generations. Popular Garhwali folk singer Narendra Singh Negi has cited Chander Singh Rahi as his inspiration. It has been reported that jagar singer and recipient of Padma Shri, Pritam Bhartwan while remembering the legacy of Chandra Singh Rahi on his demise had said that the Rahi had been blessed with a unique ringing melodious voice that would cast a magical spell over his listeners. Rahi's songs are still popular amongst the people of Uttarakhand. Two of his celebrated songs – \\"Fyonladiya\\" and the traditional anchari jaagar, \\"Chaita ki Chaitwali\\" – were covered by popular Garhwali singers in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The new version of \\"Chaita ki Chaitwali\\" became the first Uttarakhandi song to reach five million views on YouTube. In 2015, Sangeet Natak Akademi (The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama) presented a \\"Screening of Folk Music of Garhwal by Chandra Singh Rahi and Party\\" in its Sanchayan Series, an annual screening of the Academy's archival films and video recordings. Writer Charu Tiwari has written a book called Lok ka Chitera to mark 50 years of Rahi's musical journey. Every year on Rahi's death anniversary, his family and admirers organise a remembrance event in Delhi, in which his musical repertoire is presented by his family members and by popular singers from Uttarakhand. His children and grandchildren represent Rahi's musical and cultural lineage and style under the \\"Rahi Gharana\\"  Awards and recognition  * Mohan Upreti Lok Sanskriti Kala Samman * Dr. Shivanand Nautiyal Smriti Puraskar * Garh Bharati, Garhwal Sabha Samman Patra (1995) * Monal Sanstha, Lucknow Samman Patra References Singers from Uttarakhand 1942 births 2016 deaths Poets from Uttarakhand Musicians from Uttarakhand Indian folk singers People from Uttarakhand People from Pauri Garhwal district Culture of Uttarakhand ","title":"Chander Singh Rahi"},{"id":"58448898","text":"Ivan Saveljić (born 17 August 1995) is a Montenegrin tennis player.

Box was one of seventeen children, but was orphaned at the age of eight and began working as an agricultural labourer. A keen Methodist, he began preaching when he was sixteen. He spent periods working as a miner in South Wales, and on the railways, but by the early 1900s was again an agricultural labourer, based in Ledbury, in Herefordshire. He was a supporter of the Liberal Party, and at the 1906 United Kingdom general election, and January and December 1910 United Kingdom general elections, he was employed as an election agent for the party, giving him a clear picture of the state of agricultural workers throughout the county. Early in 1912, Box decided to form the Herefordshire Agricultural Workers' Union. Box wrote to Charles Duncan of the Workers' Union, asking for its support; the union sent Robert Morley to tour the county, speaking in support of union membership, and when this proved successful, it appointed Box as its full-time county organiser, and he merged the agricultural union into the Workers' Union. Box proved successful as a trade union organiser; he established fifty branches by the start of 1914, these now constituting around one-tenth of the branches of the entire Workers' Union. He received supportive coverage from the Hereford Times, and survived being shot at while cycling home from a union meeting. Although he left his post in 1915, he was reappointed in 1918. By this time, Box had switched his political affiliation to the Labour Party, and he held membership of the Independent Labour Party. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, he became the first Labour candidate in Hereford, taking 24.2% of the vote. He stood again at the 1923 United Kingdom general election, but his vote dropped back to only 4.7%. In 1954, Box published his autobiography, The Good Old Days: Then and Now.

It is a format that a candidature can use to present to a given election. To present the candidature, a candidate must present a minimum number of signatures relative to the electoral census.

In the first stage, during the late 18th century and early 19th century, most bottles were reused or returned. When bottles were mass-produced, people started throwing them out, which led to the introduction of bottle deposits. However, during the second stage, after World War II, consumption patterns changed and nonreturnable containers became popular, which littered the environment. Some states implemented \\"bottle bills\\" that instituted deposits. The beverage-container industry first implemented private recycling programs and then pushed for municipal curbside recycling as an alternative to \\"bottle bills\\". More recently, PET bottles have largely replaced other materials. The United States used to be the front-runner when it came to recycling PET, but European countries have since outpaced the US.  Early history  In the United States in the late 18th century, bottles for beer and soda were handmade and filled and were therefore relatively expensive. This meant that most beverages were consumed in restaurants and bars. When consumers would purchase drinks, they would return the bottles or bring their own. Historical research suggests that this system worked because stores were mostly locally owned and small. At the beginning of the 19th century, people still reused bottles many times, also to store homemade drinks and foods. By the end of the century, however, innovation led to bottles increasingly being mass-produced by machines which slowly replaced bottle blowers. Customers started to buy bottled drinks to consume liquor and carbonated beverages at home and bottles were sold in one-serving sizes. Most bottles had an engraving that urged consumers to return the bottles once they were empty: \\"This bottle to be washed and returned\\". Bottles were still expensive and manufacturers made a loss if they were not returned. Oftentimes, consumers would just throw bottles out, especially smaller soda bottles, and many bottles ended up being broken or in dumps. By 1910, \\"twenty glass containers were produced for every person in the United States\\". The solution to this problem was the introduction of bottle deposits (usually 2 cents), which had first been introduced by beer and soda distributors during the 1870s and 1880s and became more common in the soda industry by the 1920s. The deposit gave consumers an incentive to return the bottle and \\"defrayed the cost of the bottle when it was not returned\\". The Great Depression and \\"materials shortages\\" during World War II made the deposit system common for milk, beer, and soda bottles. By 1947, bottle loss in the United States decreased to about 3 to 4%. The bottle deposit system was common for beer and soda bottles in the United States until after World War II, when Americans’ consumption patterns changed.  The rise of nonreturnable bottles  The deposit system and returnable bottles started to get replaced by nonreturnable containers. The beer industry was the first to switch to non-returnable containers, which proved difficult at first, because pressure in the can could not release and the metal changed the taste. The first firm to successfully introduce cans was the Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company of Newark, New Jersey in 1935. Since the 12-ounce cans were much smaller and lighter than glass bottles, they could more easily be packaged and transported. However, bottlers soon started selling \\"one-way\\" bottles as well. Now, bottles and cans did not have a brand logo anymore, but an engravement that said: \\"No Deposit, No Return\\". In the early 1950s, disposable cans and bottles made up 30% of beer that was sold packaged. Technological advances made disposable bottles more prevalent, but social and economic changes were important as well. A reason for the trend toward nonreturnable containers is the fact that Americans’ lives and entertainment habits changed, with more families enjoying drinks and entertainment at home, especially after World War II. The glass and aluminum industries promoted convenience as an important part of modern life and many people started purchasing beverages to drink \\"on-the-go\\". The rise of large national soda companies, such as Coca-Cola in the 1920s and 1930s also contributed to the use of non-returnable bottles and cans. Big \\"self-serve\\" supermarkets also began replacing smaller, local stores. These new regional and national grocery stores did not want to deal with a deposit system that was not profitable, took up floor and inventory space. Further, deposit and reusing bottles did not seem to fit with a new shopping mentality that reduced interactions between customers and store owners. By the 1950s and even more so in the 1960s, more and more consumers became environmentally concerned when they saw that nonreturnable bottles littered the environment. Huge numbers of bottles and cans could be seen along highways and beaches throughout the country. The soda industry began the anti-litter campaign \\"Keep America Beautiful\\" in 1953 to teach consumers how to dispose of their single-use containers. The campaign was also intended to divert attention from legislation that would have banned single-use containers or installed deposits and instead focused on educating consumers. In 1971, Oregon became the first state in the US to implement a bottle bill that instituted bottle deposits of 5 cents. A side-effect of disposable bottles and cans were larger serving sizes. Single-use bottles were at first relatively expensive to produce, which meant that portion sizes became larger. This led to negative health effects for consumers since soda contains large amounts of sugar. Serving sizes increased from 6-7 ounce containers in the 1950s to 12-ounce bottles, which oftentimes seemed to be the smallest serving size available a decade later.  Private and federal recycling programs  In the mid-1960s, when the waste problem was becoming obvious, President Lyndon Johnson advocated for \\"federal funding for municipal solid-waste programs\\" and Congress looked at passing legislation to ban nonreturnable containers. By 1976, there were more than a thousand attempts to pass legislation that would ban or tax packaging. Politicians were worried about the costs that resulted from gathering and disposing nonreturnable bottles and cans. However, lobbyists from the beverage-container industry were mostly successful in stopping these bans and bottle bills by arguing that they would hurt sales and lead to job losses. Instead, soft-drink and packaging manufacturers presented recycling as an \\"industry alternative\\" to deposit systems. As consumer awareness about the waste problem began to spread, companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi pushed for recycling programs in their advertising campaigns (e.g. \\"Keep America Beautiful\\") in the early 1970s. However, public support for private recycling initiatives soon faded and many recycling plants had to close because they could not cover the operating expenses. Besides not making enough money, the recycling programs of the 1970s had low reclamation rates. As for glass containers, in 1972, only 912 million of the 36 billion produced containers ended up in recycling centers. Aluminum reclamation was not more successful either. To make recycling more effective, federal funding was put into municipal recycling programs. Companies, among them Coca-Cola, testified before Congress and advocated for legislation such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Act was passed in 1967 and granted more support from the federal government for \\"local resource reclamation initiatives\\". By the end of the 1970s, more and more people paid attention to the landfill crisis and the problem of nonreturnable containers. Several states followed Oregon's example and passed deposit laws. The beverage industry, however, wanted to install curbside recycling programs, since legislation would make producers bear responsibility for the containers they produced. To convince lawmakers to adopt recycling policies, lobbyists argued that recycling would not take away jobs and would be paid for by taxes. Curbside recycling programs became more widespread, and by 1992 there were over 4,000 such programs across the US. Yet, these programs were not profitable and had to be subsidized with taxpayers’ money.  History of PET bottle recycling  The American mechanical engineer and inventor Nathaniel Wyeth first patented PET in 1973 and soda companies soon started using PET to package their drinks. Over the past 20 years or so, PET bottles have become the most common material to package beverages, replacing glass and metal. Especially water and soda was starting to be packaged in PET bottles. This is because PET has certain material properties that make it more favorable than glass or metal cans. Most importantly, PET is lightweight and difficult to break. Further, PET is clear and has \\"good barrier properties towards moisture and oxygen\\". Because of these qualities, PET has replaced glass bottles and metal cans in many instances, with PET bottles also being used for energy drinks, beer, wine, and juice. The introduction of PET bottles marked the final stage in the change away from reusable bottles to \\"one-way\\", nonreturnable bottles. Before PET bottles were recycled to make new bottles, they were often recycled for other uses, such as paintbrush bristles or polyester fiber. Today, many companies, such as Patagonia, make clothing out of old PET bottles. It was at first difficult to recycle post-consumer PET bottles into new bottles because there was not sufficient knowledge about the ways in which PET was possibly contaminated during first use or during recollection. Contamination can occur either when substances from the beverages themselves get absorbed into the container or when bottles are reused to store unsafe liquids such as cleaners or chemicals. However, bottle- to-bottle recycling became more and more common as the number of PET bottles that got produced increased. PET reclaimers shred plastic bottles into flakes and then wash them, before reselling them as flakes or pellets to be used for new soda bottles or polyester fiber. For bottle-to-bottle recycling, the bottles have to be decontaminated which was achieved by introducing \\"super- clean recycling processes,\\" which in the US was done for the first time in 1991. These processes clean \\"recycled PET flakes to contamination levels similar to virgin PET pellets,\\" so that they can be reused as beverage containers. Around 1990, the US recollected more PET bottles than any other country. However, since then, many European countries have caught up with or outpaced the United States in terms of PET recollection. In 2009, 655.000 tons of post-consumer PET bottles were recollected in the US, with around 55% of those bottles being exported to other countries such as China. It is often cheaper, especially for cities on the West Coast, to send their plastic to China than to domestic reclaimers. As of 2009, 28% of PET bottles got recollected in the US. There are two recollection systems: curbside collection and the deposit system, which in 2009 in the US accounted for 26% and 17% of collected bottles respectively. Today, packaging still makes up most of the municipal waste in the US.

Plot Genius is the story of how the childhood pressures on overachieving in studies impact a person's life, rendering him socially awkward and stressed. The movie explores the brain freeze of an IT employee named Dhinesh (Roshan) and gives us a glimpse into his childhood and teenage life and explores what led to the current breakdown. Dhinesh's school life is shown to be a normal one, spending happy times at his grandparents' place in a beautiful village; until his potential as a genius is highlighted by the school principal at the school's annual day. From there, Dhinesh's father Ramamoorthy (Aadukalam Naren) takes it upon himself to push Dhinesh to the limits and make the world applaud for him. To this end, Dhinesh is taken from class to class from morning until dusk. All other social contacts, playtimes, and fun activities are shunned as distractions. The next happy memory that Dinesh remembers is the lovely friendship in his teens with a beautiful and smart girl named Priscilla. When Priscilla upstages Dhinesh in studies, Ramamoorthy puts an ugly end to it too, making Dhinesh lonely forever. Aided by the doctor (Jayaprakash), Dhinesh's parents embark on a mission to cure Dhinesh of schizophrenia using various methods. If Dhinesh will be cured and how he will be cured form the rest of the story.

It was built by John Craig in 1775. The building was extensively renovated in 1994-5 and now serves as the offices of the Scottish Civic Trust.  History  = 18th Century = The two-storey-and-attic, five-bay simplified Palladian town house was originally built by the Glasgow architect John Craig for himself. He purchased the land from Robert Hastie, an American merchant. Craig was the son of a timber merchant and listed himself as ' 'architect to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales'. Craig sold the house to the tobacco importer Robert Findlay of Easterhill in 1782. At that time Miller Street was the location of the private homes of a number of prosperous Glasgow merchants. = 19th Century = Findlay's son, Robert Findlay Jr., developed the nearby Virginia Buildings used by early-19th-century tobacco traders in Glasgow. Findlay Jr. sold 42 Miller Street to the family firm of Findlay, Hopkirk and Co. during this development. The house was later occupied by William Connel, who joined the business then trading as Findlay, Duff and Co. The firm went bankrupt sometime in the 1820s and the property at 42 Miller Street was taken over by the Thistle Bank (later Hunters and Co. and then the Union Bank of Scotland). Throughout the 1820s the building was used by a number of tenants. It was the premises of the merchant John Fyfe (1828–30), the writer (lawyer) W.C. Gordon (1828-9), Alliance Fire and Life Assurance (1829–31), the counting house of John Bryce (1829–31), who also had wine cellars and a tea warehouse nearby, accountant Alexander Mein (1829–30), junior merchant John Morrison (1829–30), merchants Pearson, Walker, & Co., and Thomas Bryce Buchanan of Boquhan (1830-1). In 1843-4, 42 Miller Street was the premises for the office of the Bankhead Colliery, Mr. R.H. Simpson, Coalmaster; the writer (lawyer) James Simpson; and Ebenezer Steven & Co., cotton spinners and power-loom cloth manufacturers. In 1856-7 the building was the office of the City & Suburban Gas Company.  Alterations  A number of changes were made to the structure at the end of the 19th century by the noted Glasgow architectural firm of Honeyman and Keppie at the time Charles Rennie Mackintosh was an employee. The building was then home to Gordon & Arnott, mantle manufacturers. Changes at this time included the addition of a mansard roof, which was removed during later renovations. = 20th Century = The building served a variety of purposes throughout the 20th century. By mid century it was a dress shop. The building's historical significance was recognised when it was it was Category B-listed in 1970 and upgraded to an A listing in 1992.  Renovation  By the 1990s, the building was derelict and faced an uncertain future. Credential Holdings Ltd., a property and development company, approached the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust with the offer of donating the property if the trust undertook its repair and restoration, which it did beginning in 1994. This work was undertaken by the firm McGurn, Logan, Duncan & Opfer, with works completed in 1995 for a total of £500,000. The building was then purchased by The Scottish Civic Trust with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the building remains the organisation's headquarters, as well as providing office space for a number of tenants.

Writing for the majority, Justice William O. Douglas said \\"A plea of guilty is more than an admission of conduct; it is a conviction... Ignorance, incomprehension, terror, inducements, subtle or blatant threats might be a perfect cover-up of unconstitutionality. What is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands utmost solicitude of which courts are capable, in canvassing the matter with the accused, to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence... So far as the record shows, the judge asked no questions of [Boykin] concerning his plea, and [Boykin] did not address the court. Boykin had been scheduled to go to the electric chair in June 1968 despite the fact that nobody had been killed in the robberies, and the only injury had been when a girl was struck in the leg by the ricochet of a bullet.

Ltd. in Murston. Name The barge is named after the Sittingbourne entrepreneur, George Smeed (1812- 1881) who began business in 1846 in Murston. The building of Victorian London created a vast demand for bricks. The yellow Kent Stock Brick which was cheaper to make than the more traditional red brick; Sittingbourne had the brickearth needed to make them, and easy access to the Swale and the London River. By 1860 he owned expanding brickfields, shipyards along the creek and barges. The business traded as Smeed-Dean Co Ltd until 1926 when it was sold.  Owners  *1882 Built for Smeed Dean & Co.

Description She was built in 1882 in Murston, Sittingbourne by Smeed Dean for their personal use. This meant she was a brick barge destined to take bricks from Sittingbourne or Snodland to London, and towns along the Kent and Essex coast. She was rated at 58 tons, and would carry a cargo of 110 GRT tons (the unit of volume). She was deep and did not have raised hatches or a raised cabin. She was steered with a tiller. Her compass was kept under the glass cabin hatch, so it could be seen from within and without. In 1922 she was rebuilt as a 64 ton vessel that could carry a 150 GRT tons cargo. However, she kept her original rigging and was under-canvased for this size of vessel, and very light headed, in that small corrections on the helm could cause large and unpredictable changes of course. By 1949 she was sailing with a crew of two, but earlier she had a skipper, a mate and a boy who acted as cook and tended the lamps. Her cabin was entered directly down a vertical ladder, though in later times, a wall was added to act as a vestible where the wet oilskins could be left. With a three man crew, the cooking was done in the fo'castle where the boy had his berth. She was spritsail rigged and had a bowsprit that would be topped in the harbours or along the quays. Although normally employed in the Thames, its estuary and adjoining rivers, she did venture further afield on occasions. Hedley Farrington recalls one voyage in the mid 1920s from Sittingbourne to Devonport in company with SB Gertrude May. They were loaded with cement. It was winter time and the voyage lasted three months. Typical passage Hervey Benham describes a typical passage on board the George Smeed in 1949 from Colchester to Gravesend. The passage is reliant on the speed and direction of the wind, and the depth and flow of the tidal river. He leaves Colchester on an Saturday afternoon, and the barge is pulled into the River Colne by a small motor launch. The hatches are fixed and first sail to be raised is the topsail then their boat is attached to the davits; this is the difference between a coastal barge and an inland barge. This is all done before passing Wivenhoe. The mainsail is dropped and set by the Alresford Woods. The launch casts off and seeks another tow. About 4.00 pm, the sails are set for a starboard tack- then the bowsprit with the jib attached to the stay is dropped and secured, the jib topsail is now set. The stays have to trimmed to re-establish balance, and the foresail, jib and jib- topsail sheeted. It is approaching high water when George Smeed edges out of the Colne, under the lee of East Mersea Point with the Bradwell shore to windward, and heads for the Bench Head Buoy []. As the wind was SSW, and they took the unmarked channel between the Knoll and the Whitaker- this was known as the West Spitway [] in 1801, they lowered the leeboard to act as a watchdog as they sailed over this shallow water, if it had bumped the bottom a chain would created some noise. They passed into the darker water and thus deeper water of the Whitaker Channel. They prepared themselves for the night, by rounding her into the wind, brailed her mainsail and the foresail slid down the mast, fifteen fathoms of chain was paid out and the anchor bit into the sand. Close by was the Whitaker buoy[] and to the south was the Swin and the Barrow Deep. The topsail sheet was let go, clewlines secured and the vang falls hardened on the quarter crab winches. The ebb flow finished and the rain arrived. All secured it was down to the cabin and the cooking stove. In the morning, time was spent tidying up the rigging which had been displaced for the previous cargo of timber. The chains spanning the hold had to be shackled up- as they had been released; these prevent the hull from splaying Barges are designed to have a long hold which is a structural weakness if the hold is not kept in tension. In that time it had moved a full inch. Rather later than was wise, the anchor was raised; it was slack water and the George Smeed did not get the advantage of the ebb tide to pull her to windward so she was put on a starboard tack to get onto the Maplins to get away from the full tide in the main channel. She went over the Middle Deep, to within a couple of cables length from the Barrow [beacon at ]. Round she came, as jib, jib topsail, and foresail were let fly; the moment is used to trim the jib topsail sheet and she set off south-westerly to the Sheers, (the point on the Maplin [Bank] where the Sheers lighthouse had stood [near ]). She tacked three times by the Blacktail Spit [] before joining the [Yantlet] channel. She passed the Nore, where the lightship had stood before being replaced by the forts. Medway was to windward and Southend to leeward. As the breeze strengthened, the topmast became whippy so the Jib topsail was dropped and stowed at the end of the bowsprit. She sailed all of Sea Reach, and a mile into the Gravesend Reach before anchoring for the night. The Monday, the start was at 5 am, the anchor didn't come up easily, and the sails were set. This time the bowsprit was topped and the jib-topsail was rehanked to the stemhead becoming a staysail. There was still little wind. To come up to the tier, a boomie would anchor up wind and drift in, but the George Smeed came in under sail from the leeward and crept to the tier. The anchor is lowered. Then 'Down foresail', 'Down tops'l', which must be lowered before it is sheeted. The voyage was over and the George Smeed loaded its next cargo of potash.

His debut studio album, Mangotale, was released in 2020. Midi Fighter 64 One of Shawn Wasabi's equipment is the DJ TechTools Midi Fighter 64, a custom 64-button MIDI controller. The Midi Fighter line of controllers is notable for using Japanese Sanwa arcade buttons rather than the rubber pads traditionally used on MIDI controllers. Initially, the Midi Fighter only came in 16-button variations. A prototype of a 64-button version was designed and 3D printed for him to use by DJ TechTools product designer Michael Mitchell. In 2016, his original Midi Fighter 64 prototype, along with his computer and hard drive, was stolen in a car burglary. This eventually led to the mass production of the Midi Fighter 64 in 2017.

Background Du Halde was a gentleman of Gascony. He was a brave soldier who had lost an arm in the service of the king. He was called \\"Bras de fer\\" (iron arm) after the artificial limb that he wore to replace the lost arm. Pierre du Halde was sergeant-major of the garrison of Brouage. He was named the king's lieutenant in the islands on 7 March 1635. Governor of Saint Christophe Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, the first Captain General and Governor of Saint Christophe, died in Saint Christophe in December 1636. He left all his property, including his rights to Martinique, to his nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet. Du Halde took over as interim governor in Saint Christophe. He maintained the arrangements that Enambuc had made for the militia, police and commerce. Du Halde sailed to Martinique on the Saint-Jacques to inform the younger du Parquet brother of the death of his uncle. The two du Parquet brothers decided to return to France, where the company confirmed the younger brother as governor of Martinique, and he returned to that island on 2 December 1837. The Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique heard good reports of du Halde and sent him a commission as captain general to command in Saint Christophe, the same as the commissions they had sent to Charles Liénard de L'Olive in Guadeloupe and du Parquet in Martinique. He received the commission in March 1637. Du Halde appears to have been a poor choice and strongly wanted to return to France. Whether he was tired of the islands, or whether he needed to leave due to his infirmities, he made strong representations to the king and the company to be recalled. The lords of the company, concerned that there would be unrest on the island in his absence, refused him permission to return until they had obtained another governor. They also obtained a decree from the king on 9 September 1637 that expressly forbade him from leaving without the king's permission. Replacement Du Halde retained command while waiting for the sieur de La Grange Fromenteau, who had been chosen as lieutenant general and was preparing to cross with his wife and family. De Lagrange Fromenteau had asked the company for the job of governor, which was granted, but did not have enough money to cover his travelling expenses. He made an offer to Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy to act as his lieutenant if Poincy would cover the costs, and Poincy agreed. Du Halde could now return to France. He was replaced in Saint Christophe in 1638 by René de Béthoulat, seigneur de la Grange- Fromenteau. Cardinal Richelieu had begun to take great interest in the islands, wanted to place them under a general whose birth, courage and views would be agreeable to the cardinal. He selected Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, whom King Louis XIII of France appointed as governor and lieutenant general of the American islands. Poincy was named governor general of the American islands and mainland (Gouverneur général des Isles et Terre Ferme de l'Amérique) on 25 February 1638. Poincy left Dieppe on 15 January 1639, arrived at Martinique a month later, then visited Guadeloupe and Saint Christophe. He was received in Martinique on 11 February 1639 and in Saint Christophe on 14 February 1639.
