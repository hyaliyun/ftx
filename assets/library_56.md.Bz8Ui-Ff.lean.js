In the Buphonia a working ox was sacrificed to Zeus Polieus, Zeus protector of the city, in accordance with a very ancient custom. A group of oxen was driven forward to the altar at the highest point of the Acropolis. On the altar a sacrifice of grain had been spread by members of the family of the Kentriadae, on whom this duty devolved hereditarily. When one of the oxen began to eat, thus selecting itself for sacrifice,\\"The ox itself thus broke the tabu and sinned against the god and his altar,\\" Burkert explains (Burkert 1983:138). one of the family of the Thaulonidae advanced with an axe, slew the ox, then immediately threw aside the axe and fled the scene of his guilt-laden crime.\\"Banishment had been the price for spilling blood since ancient times; the Greeks called it 'flight,' œÜœÖŒ≥ŒÆ\\" (Burkert 1983:139). Origins and duration The Athenians of the age of AristophanesAristophanes, The Clouds, 984f. regarded the sombre ritual as archaic; its founding myth attributed its inception to Cecrops, the chthonic king of remotest legend (Aristophanes), to Diomus (Theophrastus, cited by Porphyry in De Abstinentia 2.10.2) or to archaic Erechtheus (Pausanias 1.28.10). The Dipolieia survived at least to the time of the Roman Empire. The offering of grain was a reminder of the time \\"when people shrank from eating oxen,\\" as Plato related in The Laws (782c), \\"and offered no animals in sacrifice, but rather, cakes and the fruits of the earth soaked in honey, and other such pure sacrifices.\\"Quoted by Burkert 1983:138. Details and explanation Details of the rite can be reconstructed in detail, thanks to a passage in Porphyry that has been traced to a source in Theophrastus.Burkert 1983:137 note 6 bibliography. Although the slaughter of a laboring ox was forbidden, it was excused in these exceptional circumstances; nonetheless it was regarded as a murder.H. Nettleship ed., A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (London 1891) p. 186 The axe, therefore, as being polluted by murder, was immediately afterward carried before the court of the Prytaneum, which tried the inanimate object for murder, and, after the water- bearers who lustrated the axe, the sharpeners who sharpened it, the axe-bearer who carried it, each denied in turn responsibility for the deed, the guilty axe or knife was there charged with having caused the death of the ox, for which the axe was acquitted (Pausanias) or the sacrificial knife was thrown into the sea (Porphyry). Apparently this is an early instance analogous to deodand. In the enactment of this comedy of innocence, and the joint feasting of all who participated save the slayer himself, individual consciences were assuaged and the polis was reaffirmed. The burden of guilt was doubly displaced, not only through the buck-passing of the trial, but also through the apparently \\"guilty\\" act of the oxen in selecting itself through the initial eating.Darian Leader, The New Black (London 2009) p. 121 Notes References *Burkert, Walter, Homo Necans (1972) 1983, III.1 \\"From Ox- Slaying to the Panathenaic Festival\\" pp 136‚Äì43.

The vessel, a modified World War II British T-class submarine, had previously been of the Royal Navy. She was purchased by Israel from the Government of the United Kingdom in 1965 as part of a three T-class submarine deal. Dakar and her entire 69-man crew were lost en route to Israel on 25 January 1968. Despite extensive searches over the course of three decades, its wreckage was not found until 1999, when it was located between the islands of Cyprus and Crete at a depth of approximately . The submarine's conning tower was salvaged and is on display outside Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum in Haifa. The exact cause of Dakars sinking remains unknown. It was one of four submarine disappearances in 1968; the others were those of the , the , and the U.S. submarine .  Early career  HMS Totem was built as a group 3 variant of the British T-class submarine; these were constructed during World War II at HM Dockyard Devonport. She was launched on 28 September 1943 and commissioned in early 1945. After the end of World War II, Totem, along with the other surviving group 3 boats, was equipped with submarine snorkels to allow for longer periods of operation underwater. Between 1951 and 1953, Totem was one of eight British Navy submarines to be converted to the \\"Super T\\" design, which allowed the vessel to travel at higher and quieter underwater speeds.  Purchase by Israel  In 1965, Totem was purchased by Israel, along with two of her T-class sister boats, and . The former Totem was commissioned into the Israeli Navy at Portsmouth, England on 10 November 1967 as INS Dakar (, ), under the command of Major Ya'acov Ra'anan. She then headed to Scotland to conduct sea and dive trials. Late in 1967, Dakar returned to Portsmouth; she left for Israel on 9 January 1968. Dakars first port call after leaving the UK was Gibraltar, on the morning of 15 January. She departed at midnight on 16 January with the intention of crossing the Mediterranean Sea on snorkel. The original schedule was for the submarine to enter her new home base at Haifa on 2 February. During her voyage, she was making excellent speed, averaging over , and Major Ra'anan radioed Haifa to request entering port ahead of schedule. He was ordered to enter on 29 January. Later, Ra'anan requested to enter a day earlier, on 28 January. This request was denied, as the welcoming ceremony could not be rescheduled. Loss At 06:10 on 24 January 1968 Dakar transmitted her position, 34.16¬∞N 26.26¬∞E, just east of Crete. Over the next 18 hours she sent three control transmissions which did not include her position. Her final broadcast was at 00:02 25 January, after which no further transmissions were received. On 26 January the British Admiralty reported the submarine was missing and gave the last known position as west of Cyprus. An international search and rescue operation began, including units from Israel, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Britain and Lebanon. Although the Israeli Navy in Haifa began broadcasting calls to commercial vessels to be on the look out for Dakar, Israeli officials would not admit the submarine was missing. On 27 January, a radio station in Nicosia, Cyprus received a distress call on the frequency of Dakars emergency buoy, apparently from south-east of Cyprus, but no further traces of the submarine were found. On 31 January, all non-Israeli forces abandoned their search at sunset. Israeli forces continued the search for another four days, ceasing at sundown on 4 February 1968. Israel denied that Dakar sank as the result of hostile action. It stated that Dakar was involved in crash diving exercises on its return voyage and was probably lost as a result of a mechanical failure. On 25 April 1968, Vice Admiral Avraham Botzer, commander of the Israeli Navy, stated that Dakar sank on 24 January 1968, two days before being reported missing, due to \\"technical or human malfunctioning\\" and not \\"foul play\\". Searches and discovery Dakars emergency buoy in the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum in Haifa. The salvaged conning tower from Dakar outside Haifa's Naval Museum. On 9 February 1969, more than a year after Dakar went missing, a fisherman found her stern emergency buoy marker washed up on the coast of Khan Yunis, a town southwest of Gaza. British T-class submarines had two such buoy markers, bow and stern, secured behind wooden doors in cages under the deck and attached to the submarine with metal cables long. The experts who examined the of cable still attached to the buoy made several inaccurate determinations. These conclusions - that the buoy had remained attached to the submarine for most of the preceding year until the cable broke completely, that Dakar rested in depth between , and that it was off her planned route - misled searchers for decades. It was not until April 1999, after some 25 failed expeditions, that a search effort was concentrated along the original route. On 17 January 1970, the Egyptian newspaper Al Akhbar reported that Dakar had been sunk by an Egyptian warship with depth charges. The Egyptian story was told in a 2 July 2005 interview by Asharq Al-Awsat with General Mohamed Azab (a major at that time): :On 23 January 1968, the Egyptian frigate, Assyout, left Alexandria base in a training mission for the naval academy. After completing the training assignment and during the return journey to the base, students noticed the periscope of an alien submarine in Egyptian waters, about two miles (3 km) off Alexandria. The Egyptian commander was informed and the decision was taken to attack the unknown submarine. However, the submarine made a hasty dive and the Egyptian ship lost track of it. General Azab reported the story to his commanders and mentioned that there is a probability that the submarine had crashed into the seabed. However, the story was not believed by the higher Egyptian commanders and there was not sufficient evidence to start a search process. General Azab mentioned that the submarine may have crashed into the seabed due to the shallow depth of water in that region, about 36 meters, while it needed at least 40 meters to dive. It appears that the submarine commander took the risk.ŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÖÿßÿ™ ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ© ŸÇÿØ ÿ™ŸÅŸÉ ŸÑÿ∫ÿ≤ ÿßŸÑÿ∫Ÿàÿßÿµÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑŸäÿ© ¬´ÿØÿßŸÉÿßÿ±¬ª ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ∫ÿ±ŸÇÿ™ ÿ£ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßÿ≠ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÉŸÜÿØÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿπÿßŸÖ 1968 (translated herein from Arabic with minor editing) The Israeli government stated there was no evidence to substantiate the Egyptian unofficial charges. During the 1980s the Israelis, using a salvage vessel with Egyptian liaison officers, conducted three searches for Dakar in waters north of Sinai and another search off the Greek island of Rhodes. In August 1986, the U.S. Navy committed a P-3 Orion and an S-3 Viking to search Egyptian waters near al- Arish. In October 1998, Israel began running advertisements in newspapers in Turkey, Egypt, France, Greece and Russia, offering rewards of up to $300,000 for any information on the fate of Dakar. On 24 May 1999 a joint U.S.‚ÄìIsraeli search team using information received from U.S. intelligence sources and led by Thomas Kent Dettweiler, a subcontractor from American Nauticos Corporation, detected a large body on the seabed between Crete and Cyprus, at a depth of some . On 28 May the first video pictures were taken by the remote-operated vehicle Remora II, making it clear that Dakar had been found. She rests on her keel, bow to the northwest. Her conning tower was snapped off and fallen over the side. The stern of the submarine, with the propellers and dive planes, broke off aft of the engine room and rests beside the main hull. During October 2000 a survey of the Dakar wreckage and the wreckage site was undertaken by Nauticos corporation and the Israeli Navy. Some artifacts were recovered, including the submarine's bridge, the boat's gyrocompass, and many small items. The exact cause of the loss remains unknown, but it appears that no emergency measures had been taken before Dakar dived rapidly through her maximum depth, suffered a catastrophic hull rupture, and continued her plunge to the bottom. The emergency buoy was released by the violence of the hull collapse, and drifted for a year before washing ashore. Later developments Memorial for INS Dakar Dakar Park in Giv'at Shmuel A memorial designed by architect David Brutzkus was dedicated in 1971 at the National Military and Police cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. It is inscribed with a Hebrew Bible verse from Psalm 77:19: \\"Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though Your footprints were not seen.\\" Dakars bridge and forward edge of her sail are now a memorial display in the Naval Museum in Haifa. The recovery of any still-existing remains of the crew members has been considered. This would permit their Jewish burial in Israel as Judaism does not recognize burial at sea and requires burial in earth. To date, crew members' families have held a ceremony in a ship over the submarine's remnants. The Rabbinical authorities had to solve complicated problems of Jewish law before the crew members' wives could be declared officially widows, so that they could remarry.http://www.jta.org/1981/03/02/archive/all-crew- members-of-submarine-dakar-officially-declared-dead-chief-rabbi-says-wives-of- crew-members In 2008, a film was released, entitled Full Circle, a documentary about the search for the wreckage. In May 2009, a book was published by Nauticos president David W. Jourdan entitled, Never Forgotten: The Search and Discovery of Israel's Lost Submarine Dakar. This book chronicles the history of the submarine, the story of the families of the 69 lost sailors, and the events leading to the discovery in 1999. On 1 September 2015 it was reported that the previously-classified reports on the loss of Dakar and the subsequent search were released to the families of the submarine's crew. In 2018 the Navy proposed naming their newest submarine Dakar in tribute to the original vessel. After the families of the Dakars crew protested, the name was changed to Dragon, which shares the same letters in Hebrew.

Macka MacKail created the name \\"Rap Jumping\\" to describe his style of forward free-fall jumping and based it in Cairns, Australia as early as 1988. Founder, Macka MacKail gained Certification while serving with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). Commercial operation of Rap Jumping started in 1989 with the issue of permits from the Mulgrave Shire Council in the Barron Gorge Cairns on the site known as the Hinge (Split Rock), and Macka's Bluff which has six different jump faces.

The encounter, fought in the context of the Spanish American wars of independence, pitted a Patriot army under General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre against a Royalist army commanded by Field Marshal Melchor Aymerich. The defeat of the Royalist forces loyal to Spain brought about the liberation of Quito, and secured the independence of the provinces belonging to the Real Audiencia de Quito, or Presidencia de Quito, the Spanish colonial administrative jurisdiction from which the Republic of Ecuador would eventually emerge. Background The military campaign for the independence of the Presidencia de Quito could be said to have begun on October 9, 1820, when the port-city of Guayaquil proclaimed its independence from Spanish rule after a quick and almost bloodless revolt against the local colonial garrison. The leaders of the movement, a combination of Venezuelan and Peruvian pro- independence officers from the colonial army, along with local intellectuals and patriots, set up a governing council and raised a military force with the purpose of defending the city and carrying the independence movement to the other provinces in the country. By that time, the tide of the wars of independence in South America had turned decisively against Spain: Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's victory at the Battle of Boyac√° (August 7, 1819) had sealed the independence of the former Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada, while to the south, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, having landed with his army on the Peruvian coast in September 1820, was preparing the campaign for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Per√∫. First Campaigns in the Real Audiencia de Quito (1820-1821) There were three military attempts to liberate the territory of the Real Audiencia. The first campaign was carried out by the new independent government of Guayaquil, which raised an army with local recruits ‚Äî perhaps 1,800 men strong ‚Äî and in November 1820 sent it towards the central highlands, with the purpose of encouraging other cities to join the independentist cause. After some initial successes, which included the declaration of independence of Cuenca, on November 3, 1820, the Patriots suffered a costly defeat at the hands of the Royalist army at the Battle of Huachi (November 22, 1820), near Ambato, forcing the Patriots to retreat back to the coastal lowlands. By February 1821, Guayaquil began to receive reinforcements, weapons and supplies, sent by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, President of the fledgling Republic of Colombia. In May of that year, Brigadier General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Commander in Chief of the Southern Division of the Colombian Army and Bol√≠var's most trusted military subordinate, came to Guayaquil. He was to take overall command of the new Patriot army, and begin operations aimed at the liberation of Quito and the entire territory of the Real Audiencia de Quito. Bol√≠var's ultimate political goal was the incorporation of all the provinces of the Real Audiencia into Colombia, including Guayaquil, still undecided whether to join Per√∫ or Colombia, and with a strong current of opinion in favour of setting up its own republic. Time was of the essence, as it was vital to force the issue before General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, still fighting in Per√∫, could come up to bring forward any Peruvian claims to the important port-city. Sucre's advance up the Andes began in July, 1821. As had happened in the first campaign, after some initial successes, Sucre was defeated by the Royalist army on September 12, 1821, coincidentally at the same place as the previous battle (resulting in a Second Battle of Huachi). This second campaign came to an end with the signing of an armistice between the Patriots and the Spanish on November 19, 1821. The Final Campaign of Quito (1822) =Planning= Back in Guayaquil, General Sucre concluded that the best course of action for the next campaign would be to drop any further attempt of a direct advance to Quito by way of Guaranda, in favor of an indirect approach, marching first to the southern highlands and Cuenca before wheeling north and advancing up the inter-Andean \\"corridor\\" towards Quito. This plan had several advantages. Retaking Cuenca would cut all communications between Quito and Lima, and would allow Sucre to wait for the reinforcements that in the meantime San Mart√≠n had promised would come from Per√∫. Also, a more progressive and slower advance from the lowlands up the Andes into the southern highlands would allow for a gradual adaptation of the troops to the physiological effects of the altitude. Moreover, it was the only way to avoid another direct clash in unfavorable conditions with the Royalist forces coming down from Quito. =Renewed campaign, 1822= At the beginning of January 1822, Sucre opened the new campaign. His army consisted now of approximately 1,700 men, including veterans from the previous campaigns as well as raw recruits. There were men from the lowlands of the Province of Guayaquil and volunteers who had come down from the highlands, both contingents soon to be organized into the Yaguachi Battalion; there were Colombians sent by Bol√≠var, a number of Spanish-born officers and men who had changed sides; a full battalion of British volunteers (the Albi√≥n); and even small numbers of Frenchmen. On January 18, 1822, the Patriot army marched on Machala, in the southern lowlands. On February 9, 1822, having crossed the Andes, Sucre entered the town of Saraguro, where he was joined by the 1,200 men of the Peruvian Division, the contingent previously promised by San Mart√≠n. This force was mostly Peruvian recruits, with Argentinian and Chilean officers. Facing a multinational force numbering around 3,000 men, the 900-strong Royalist cavalry detachment covering Cuenca withdrew to the north, being pursued at a distance by Patriot cavalry. Cuenca was thus retaken by Sucre on February 21, 1822, without a shot being fired. During March and April, the Royalists continued to march northwards, successfully avoiding battle with the Patriot cavalry. Nevertheless, on April 21, 1822, a ferocious cavalry encounter did take place at Tapi, near Riobamba. At the end of the day, the Royalists abandoned the field, while the main body of Sucre's army proceeded to take Riobamba, staying there until April 28, before renewing the advance to the north. =Final approach to Quito= By May 2, 1822, Sucre's main force had reached the city of Latacunga, 90 km south of Quito. There he proceeded to refit his troops and fill up the ranks with new volunteers from the nearby towns, waiting for the arrival of reinforcements, mainly the Colombian Alto Magdalena Battalion, and new intelligence on the whereabouts of the Royalist army. Aymerich had meanwhile set up strongpoints and artillery positions on the main mountain passes leading to the Quito basin. Sucre, bent on avoiding a frontal clash on unfavorable terrain, decided to advance along the flanks of the Royalist positions, marching along the slopes of the Cotopaxi volcano in order to reach the Chillos valley, at the rear of the Royalist blocking positions. By May 14, the Royalist Army, sensing Sucre's intentions, began to fall back, reaching Quito on May 16. Two days later, and after a most difficult march, Sucre's main body occupied Sangolqu√≠. Climbing Pichincha On the night of 23‚Äì24 May 1822, the Patriot Army, 2,971 men strong, began to climb up the slopes of Pichincha. In the vanguard were the 200 Colombians of the Alto Magdalena, followed by Sucre's main body. Bringing up the rear were the Scots and Irish of the Albi√≥n, protecting the ammunitions train. In spite of the strenuous efforts made by the troops, the advance up the slopes of the volcano was slower than anticipated, as the light rain that fell during the night turned the trails leading up the mountain into quagmires. By dawn, to Sucre's dismay, the army had not been able to make much progress, finding itself just halfway along the mountain, 3,500 meters above sea-level, and in full view of the Royalist sentries down in Quito. At 8 o'clock, anxious about the slow progress of the Albi√≥n, and with his troops exhausted and suffering from altitude sickness, Sucre ordered a stop, ordering his commanders to hide their battalions as best they could. He sent part of the Cazadores del Paya battalion (Peruvians) forward in a reconnaissance role, to be followed by the Trujillo, another Peruvian battalion. One and a half hours later, much to their surprise, the men of the Paya were suddenly struck by a well-aimed musket volley. The battle had started. Battle, 3,500 meters above sea- level Unknown to Sucre, when dawn came, the sentries posted around Quito had indeed caught sight of the Patriot troops marching up the volcano. Aymerich, aware now of the young General's intention to flank him by climbing Pichincha, ordered his army‚Äî1,894 men‚Äîto ascend the mountain at once, intent on facing Sucre then and there. Having made contact in the most unlikely of places, both commanders had no choice but to throw their troops piecemeal into the battle. There was little room to manoeuvre on the steep slopes of Pichincha, amid deep gullies and dense undergrowth. The men from the Paya, recovering from the initial shock, took positions under withering fire, waiting for the Trujillo to come up. A startled Sucre, hoping only that the Spaniards would be even more exhausted than his own troops, began by sending up the Yaguachi Battalion (Ecuadorians). The Colombians of the Alto Magdalena tried to make a flanking move, but to no avail, as the broken terrain made it impossible. Soon, the Paya, Barrezueta and Yaguachi, suffering heavy losses and lacking enough ammunition, began to fall back. Everything now seemed to depend on the personnel of the British Legions bringing up the much needed reserve ammunition and additional personnel, but whose exact whereabouts were unknown. As time went by, the Royalists seemed to gain the upper hand. The Trujillo was forced to fall back, while the Piura Battalion (Peruvians), fled before making contact with the enemy. In desperation, the part of the Paya held in reserve was ordered to make a bayonet charge. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but the situation was somehow stabilized for the Patriots. Nevertheless, Melchor Aymerich had an ace up his sleeve, so to speak. During the march up Pichincha, he had detached his crack Arag√≥n battalion from his main force, ordering it to make for the top of the volcano, so as to fall upon the rear of the Patriots when the time came, and break their lines. The Arag√≥n battalion ‚Äî a veteran Spaniard unit that had seen plenty of action both during the Peninsular War and in South America ‚Äî was now above the Patriots. As luck would have it, just as it was about to charge down onto the faltering Patriot line, it was stopped dead in its tracks by the English, Scots and Irish veterans of Albi√≥n, which made a surprise entry into the battle. As it was, the Albi√≥n had actually advanced to a position higher than the Spaniards. Soon, the Magdalena battalion joined in the fight, and the Arag√≥n, after suffering heavy losses, was put out of action. The Colombians from the Magdalena then went up to the line to replace the Paya, which was forced to pull back, and charged upon the Royalist line, which was finally broken. At midday, Aymerich ordered the retreat. The Royalist army, now disorganized and exhausted, retreated down the slopes of Pichincha towards Quito. Although some units descended to Quito in disarray, harassed by the Magdalena battalion charging after them, others retreated in orderly fashion. The Colombians reached the outer limits of Quito, but did not go any further, acting on orders from their commanding officer who prudently decided against letting his soldiers enter the city. Thus, the Battle of Pichincha had ended. From the moment of first contact to the order of retreat, it had lasted no more than three hours. Sucre's after- action report General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Commander In Chief, Divisi√≥n del Sur The day after the battle, May 25, Sucre wrote down his report of the action: :\\"The events at Pichincha have brought about the occupation of this city [Quito] as well as its forts on the afternoon of the 25, the possession and peace of the entire Department, and the taking of 1,100 prisoners, 160 officers, 14 artillery pieces, 1,700 rifles...Four hundred enemy soldiers and two hundred of our own lie dead on the field of battle; we have also counted 190 Spanish wounded, and 140 of our own...[A]mong the latter are Captains Cabal, Castro, and Alzuro; Lieutenants Calder√≥n and Ram√≠rez, and Second Lieutenants Borrero and Arango...I make a special mention of Lieutenant Calder√≥n's conduct, who having suffered four wounds in succession, refused to leave the field. He will probably die, but I am sure the Government of the Republic will compensate his family for the services rendered by this heroic officer.\\" Thus was born the legend of native Cuencan Abd√≥n Calder√≥n Garaycoa, who along with Sucre came to symbolize the memory of Pichincha for the new Ecuadorian nation. Aftermath While in the general context of the Wars of Independence, the Battle of Pichincha stands as a minor clash, both in terms of its duration and the number of troops involved, its results were to be anything but insignificant. On May 25, 1822, Sucre and his army entered the city of Quito, where he accepted the surrender of all the Spanish forces then based in what the Colombian government called the \\"Department of Quito\\", considered by that Government as an integral part of the Republic of Colombia since its creation on December 17, 1819. Previously, when Sucre had recaptured Cuenca, on February 21, 1822, he had obtained from its local Council a decree by which it proclaimed the integration of the city and its province into the Republic of Colombia. Now, the surrender of Quito, which put an end to the Royalist resistance in the northern province of Pasto, allowed Bol√≠var to finally come down to Quito, which he entered on June 16, 1822. Amid the general enthusiasm of the population, the former Province of Quito was officially incorporated into the Republic of Colombia. One more piece to the puzzle remained, Guayaquil, still undecided about its future. The presence of Bol√≠var and the victorious Colombian army in the city finally forced the hands of the Guayaquilenos, whose governing council proclaimed the Province of Guayaquil as part of Colombia on July 13, 1822. Eight years later, in 1830, the three southern Departments of Colombia, Quito (now renamed Ecuador), Guayaquil and Cuenca, would secede from that country to constitute a new nation, which took the name of Republic of Ecuador.

In 1970, he became technical director of Eljim, Ltd., later a subsidiary of Elbit, Ltd. in Nes Tsiona, Israel, where he was a manager, a period that lasted a further 20 years.Biography of Lee M. Spetner at B'Or Ha'Torah Retrieved December 2010 His work here was on military electronic systems, including electronic countermeasures, and a military electronic navigation system. He taught courses at the Johns Hopkins University, Howard University and the Weizmann Institute, including classical mechanics, electromagnetic theory, real-variable theory, probability theory, and statistical communication theory. Spetner first became interested in evolution in the 1960s during a fellowship in the Department of Biophysics at Johns Hopkins University. He writes that he was skeptical of evolutionary theory because of his religious views and because of his intuition about how information in living organisms could have developed. Spetner published several papers on the subject of evolution between 1964 and 1970. In Israel, he continued searching for evidence that contradicted the modern evolutionary synthesis. Spetner was inspired by Rabbi David Luria (1798 - 1855), who calculated that, according to Talmudic sources, there was 365 originally created species of beasts and 365 of birds. Spetner developed what he called his \\"nonrandom evolutionary hypothesis,\\" which proposed rapid microevolution (which he attributed to a \\"built-in ability\\" in animals and plants to \\"respond adaptively to environmental stimuli\\"), and suggested that even some cases of macroevolution could be explained by his hypothesis. Spetner' critical stance on the plausibility of the evolutionary theory of the appearance of beneficial mutations was supported by the Australian statistician Professor Michael Hasofer.Hasofer, A.M. \\"A Statistician Looks at Neo-Darwinism.\\" B'Or Ha'Torah Vol. 3. (1983): 13-21.Hasofer, A. M. \\"A simplified treatment of Spetner's natural selection model.\\" Journal of Theoretical Biology 11, no. 2 (1966): 338-342. Spetner, an avowed theist, has been described as a Jewish Creationist.Tom McIver, Anti-evolution: an annotated bibliography, 2008 p. 277 However, his Non Random Evolutionary Hypothesis is, in fact, agnostic. It makes no claim that scientific evidence proves a supernatural creator. Additionally, Spetner vehemently rejects the teaching of Creation in public schools, asserting that \\"the subject is best handled in the home or within a religious environment.\\" In 1980, at a conference for Jewish scientists, Spetner claimed that Archaeopteryx was a fraud. Spetner continued his attack on the modern synthesis in his book Not by chance! Shattering the Modern Theory of Evolution.Randy Moore, Mark Decker, Sehoya Cotner, Chronology of the evolution-creationism controversy, 2010, pp. 286 - 287. Spetner is a critic of the role of mutations in the modern synthesis. Spetner claims that random mutations lead to a loss of genetic information and that there is no scientific evidence to support common descent: Spetner continued to study after retirement, pursuing interests in evolution and cancer cures. Spetner's latest book \\"The Evolution Revolution: Why Thinking People are Rethinking Evolution\\" develops his nonrandom hypothesis (NREH) and was published in 2014 by Judaica Press.

The method can also be used in conjunction with scenario testing. Session-based testing was developed in 2000 by Jonathan and James Bach. Session-based testing can be used to introduce measurement and control to an immature test process and can form a foundation for significant improvements in productivity and error detection. Session-based testing can offer benefits when formal requirements are not present, incomplete, or changing rapidly. Elements of session-based testing =Mission= The mission in Session Based Test Management identifies the purpose of the session, helping to focus the session while still allowing for exploration of the system under test. According to Jon Bach, one of the co-founders of the methodology, the mission tells us \\"what we are testing or what problems we are looking for.\\" =Charter= A charter is a goal or agenda for a test session. Charters are created by the test team prior to the start of testing, but they may be added or changed at any time. Often charters are created from a specification, test plan, or by examining results from previous sessions. =Session= An uninterrupted period of time spent testing, ideally lasting one to two hours. Each session is focused on a charter, but testers can also explore new opportunities or issues during this time. The tester creates and executes tests based on ideas, heuristics or whatever frameworks to guide them and records their progress. This might be through the use of written notes, video capture tools or by whatever method as deemed appropriate by the tester. =Session report= The session report records the test session. Usually this includes: *Charter. *Area tested. *Detailed notes on how testing was conducted. *A list of any bugs found. *A list of issues (open questions, product or project concerns) *Any files the tester used or created to support their testing *Percentage of the session spent on the charter vs investigating new opportunities. *Percentage of the session spent on: **Testing - creating and executing tests. **Bug investigation / reporting. **Session setup or other non-testing activities. *Session Start time and duration. =Debrief= A debrief is a short discussion between the manager and tester (or testers) about the session report. Jonathan Bach uses the acronym PROOF to help structure his debriefing. PROOF stands for:- * Past. What happened during the session? * Results. What was achieved during the session? * Obstacles. What got in the way of good testing? * Outlook. What still needs to be done? * Feelings. How does the tester feel about all this? =Parsing results= With a standardized Session Report, software tools can be used to parse and store the results as aggregate data for reporting and metrics. This allows reporting on the number of sessions per area or a breakdown of time spent on testing, bug investigation, and setup / other activities. Planning Testers using session-based testing can adjust their testing daily to fit the needs of the project. Charters can be added or dropped over time as tests are executed and/or requirements change.

Inara's mother is probably Hebat and her brother is Sarruma.  Myths  After the dragon Illuyanka wins an encounter with the storm god, the latter asks Inara to give a feast, most probably the Purulli festival. Inara decides to use the feast to lure and defeat Illuyanka, who was her father's archenemy, and enlists the aid of a mortal named Hupasiyas of Zigaratta by becoming his lover. The dragon and his family gorge themselves on the fare at the feast, becoming quite drunk, which allows Hupasiyas to tie a rope around them. Inara's father can then kill Illuyanka, thereby preserving creation. Inara built a house on a cliff and gave it to Hupasiyas. She left one day with instructions that he was not to look out the window, as he might see his family. But he looked and the sight of his family made him beg to be allowed to return home. It is not known what happened next, but there is speculationBy Oliver Gurney, says Siren. that Inara killed Hupasiyas for disobeying her, or for hubris, or that he was allowed to return to his family. The mother goddess Hannahanna promises Inara land and a man during a consultation by Inara. Inara then disappears. Her father looks for her, joined by Hannahanna with a bee.

It was her third for Geffen Records. The album features various duets with guest artists such as Peter Gabriel on \\"My Secret Place\\", Willie Nelson on \\"Cool Water\\", Don Henley on \\"Snakes and Ladders\\", Billy Idol and Tom Petty on the track \\"Dancin' Clown\\". Henley also performs backing vocals on \\"Lakota\\", and Wendy and Lisa perform backing vocals on \\"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)\\". History In early 1986, Mitchell and Larry Klein visited Peter Gabriel's Ashcombe House recording studio in Bath, England. Since Gabriel had mostly finished his album So by that time, he offered Mitchell and Klein the use of his studio if they wanted to record. They did, and the result was the track \\"My Secret Place\\" which was a duet between Mitchell and Gabriel. Mitchell told Musician magazine about this song: \\"It's a love beginning song. The song's about the threshold of intimacy. It's a shared thing so I wanted it to be like the Song of Solomon, where you can't tell what gender it is. It's the uniting spirit of two people at the beginning of a relationship\\". In February 1987, Mitchell saw Billy Idol performing his hit version of the William Bell R&B; ballad, \\"To Be a Lover\\" on the Grammy Awards show. She felt he captured the original spirit of rock'n'roll along with a new spark of energy, and would be perfect for a cameo on her song \\"Dancin' Clown\\". Idol came over to Mitchell's studio one evening a few days after the Grammys and recorded his part, complete with yelps and howls. Mitchell told Macleans magazine about this pairing up: \\"It was for the contrast he provided. It's a great little cameo for him, and he brings real life to the part.\\" Later, Tom Petty recorded his cameo on the same song. About Chalk Mark, Mitchell told interviewer Kristine McKenna: \\"I've discovered that with your focus no longer on finding a mate, you get a heightened sense of community, and I've become a bit more political ‚Äì not too political though\\". Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm was released in March 1988, and the song \\"Snakes and Ladders\\" (featuring Don Henley) was issued as a pre- release single to radio stations in January 1988. Themes Contemporary commercialism is addressed in the songs \\"Number One\\", \\"Lakota\\" which deals with the destruction of Native American culture and the unusual \\"The Reoccurring Dream\\" was constructed from samples Mitchell collected by recording TV commercials on her VCR for 2 weeks. \\"Cool Water\\" (a Mitchell rewrite of the Bob Nolan original) also discusses water pollution. War is explored in two very different stories: \\"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)\\" tells the tale of Mitchell's parents meeting during World War II after a surprisingly prophetic tea-leaf reading, while \\"The Beat of Black Wings\\" is about an embittered Vietnam vet named Killer Kyle, who found it difficult to get the sound of helicopter blades out of his head. This song may be based on a scene from the film adaptation of The Looking Glass War.Comment on Joni Mitchell.com Retrieved on 1 August 2010 In the more straightforward lovesongs, Mitchell sings of intimacy in \\"My Secret Place\\", and young, rambunctious love in \\"Snakes and Ladders\\" and \\"Dancin' Clown\\". Release The first official single from the album was \\"My Secret Place\\". Released in March 1988, it \\"bubbled under\\" for a few weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The video, shot on grainy, atmospheric black & white film featuring Mitchell and Peter Gabriel, got some airplay on VH-1, where it premiered in May 1988. Billboard magazine's Steve Gett reviewed the new album and awarded it an early rave. Other reviews were mostly very favorable, and the fact that there were cameos by many well-known musicians brought it a great deal of notice. \\"Most of the stuff for the isn't-Joni-wonderful club is on side two‚Ä¶\\" noted Fred Dellar in Hi-Fi News & Record Review. \\"There's a Willie Nelson-assisted version of the Sons of the Pioneers' hoary old 'Cold [sic] Water' that is so immaculately re- shaped it sounds like next year's thing.\\" The album improved on the chart position of her previous album, 1985's Dog Eat Dog, peaking at #23 in Canada, #45 on the US Billboard 200, and #26 in the UK. To promote the album, Mitchell also travelled to the UK in May and appeared on the Channel 4 music show Wired where she performed \\"Number One\\" and gave an exclusive world premiere of a brand new song called \\"Fourth of July\\" which would later be retitled \\"Night Ride Home\\" and be recorded as the title track for her next album. She also visited Australia and appeared on several television shows including The Midday Show with Ray Martin, Rock Arena, and the morning show Sunday where she again performed \\"Number One\\" and \\"Fourth of July\\".

Fotopoulos is Greek and lives in London.Takis Fotopoulos bio at eipcp's (European Institute for Progressive Cultural Policies) website. Early life Fotopoulos was born on the Greek island of Chios and his family moved to Athens soon afterwards. After graduating from the University of Athens with degrees in Economics and Political Science and in Law, he moved to London in 1966 for postgraduate study at the London School of Economics on a Varvaressos scholarship from Athens University. He was a student syndicalist and activist in AthensHe was elected as a member of the Administrative Council of the Law students Union in 1958-59, following the first victory of a Left alliance in which he participated against EKOF, an extreme right wing student association controlled by the 'deep' Greek state , which a few years later, in 1963, was responsible for the murder of Left parliamentarian Grigoris Lambrakis and 4 years later of the military coup which led to the military dictatorship (1967-74). and then a political activist in London, taking an active part in the 1968 student protests there, and in organisations of the revolutionary Greek Left during the struggle against the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974. During this period, he was a member of the Greek group called Revolutionary Socialist Groups in London, which published the newspaper ŒúŒ±ŒºŒÆ (\\"Midwife\\", from the Marxian dictum, \\"violence is the midwife of revolution\\") for which he wrote several articles.As testified by the Left composer Lakis Karalis in an interview in the Athens newspaper Eleftherotypia (06/09/2008) and in an Arts web site Œ†œÅŒøŒ≤ŒøŒªŒ≠Œ±œÇ . Fotopoulos married Sia Mamareli (a former lawyer) in 1966; the couple have a son, Costas (born in 1974), who is a Composer and Pianist. Academia and afterwards Fotopoulos was a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the Polytechnic of North London from 1969 to 1989, until he began editing the journal Society & Nature, later Democracy & Nature and subsequently the online International Journal of Inclusive Democracy. He was also a columnist of Eleftherotypia, Archive of Takis Fotopoulos' articles at the website of Eleftherotypia the second-biggest newspaper in Greece. Inclusive Democracy Fotopoulos developed the political project of Inclusive Democracy (ID) in 1997 (an exposition can be found in Towards An Inclusive Democracy). The first issue of Society & Nature declared that: > our ambition is to initiate an urgently needed dialogue on the crucial > question of developing a new liberatory social project, at a moment in > History when the Left has abandoned this traditional role.Editorial It specified that the new project should be seen as the outcome of a synthesis of the democratic, libertarian socialist and radical Green traditions.Our Aims @ Society and Nature/Democracy and Nature's website Since then, a dialogue has followed in the pages of the journal, in which supporters of the autonomy project like Cornelius Castoriadis, social ecology supporters including its founder Murray Bookchin, and Green activists and academics like Steven Best have taken part. The starting point for Fotopoulos' work is that the world faces a multi-dimensional crisis (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political) which is caused by the concentration of power in elites, as a result of the market economy, representative democracy and related forms of hierarchical structure. An inclusive democracy, which involves the equal distribution of power at all levels, is seen not as a utopia (in the negative sense of the word) or a \\"vision\\" but as perhaps the only way out of the present crisis, with trends towards its creation manifesting themselves today in many parts of the world. Fotopoulos is in favor of market abolitionism, although he would not identify himself as a market abolitionist as such because he considers market abolition as one aspect of an inclusive democracy which refers only to the economic democracy component of it. He proposes a model of economic democracy for a stateless, marketless and moneyless economy but he considers that the economic democracy component is equally significant to the other components of ID, i.e. political or direct democracy, economic democracy, ecological democracy and democracy in the social realm. Fotopoulos' work has been critically assessed by important activists, theorists and scholars.Jorge Camil, review of Hacia Una Democracia Inclusiva (in Spanish), La Jornada, Friday, 8 June 2001.Arran Gare, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 34 (1), Winter 2002, p. 97-99.Michael Levin, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, Anarchist Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2, October 1997.John Griffin, Dodgy Logic and the Olympians, Total Liberty, 1999-2000, p. 10-11.James Herod, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, Getting Free: Creating an Association of Democratic Autonomous Neighborhoods, Lucy Parsons Center (first printing edition), May 2007.

In southern Africa it is a pest of the black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) which is grown largely as a source of vegetable tannin. Kotochalia junodi is indigenous to Southern Africa, where it originally fed on indigenous relatives of the wattle. Like all members of the family Psychidae, the male larva develops into an adult in a mobile silken bag covered with materials such as thorns and twigs. Only once it is mature does it leave the bag to mate. The female never leaves her bag. In spring the eggs hatch in the bag in which the adult female had grown. Because the female never leaves the tree in which she grew and died, the insects need some other way to move to new trees or in general to disperse, and in fact the newly hatched (first-instar) larva is the dispersive stage of the wattle bagworm life cycle. The larva spins a silken thread on which it may float along on the breeze, much as some species of young spiderlings use gossamer for ballooning in their dispersive phase. Also, birds and probably other agencies may carry some larvae to suitable feeding sites. The young caterpillar does not feed for a day or two after hatching, but eventually, once the dispersive phase is completed, it begins to weave a conical bag of silk, incorporating fragments of plant material such as leaves, twigs and bark.Skaife, S. H., \\"African Insect Life\\", Pub. Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1953. The thorns and twigs covering the cocoon provide protection against enemies such as mantids. They also serve as camouflage that matches the tree from which the larva had stripped them. As it feeds and grows, it extends the size of the bag until it reaches some 55 mm in length and 18 mm in width and its outline becomes oval. The caterpillar hooks its anal prolegs into the silken lining of the bag. As it feeds and grows, the larva drags the bag wherever it goes until it is full grown and pupates. If alarmed, it shuts the opening by pulling in the slack in front. About February or March the larva is fully grown. It stops feeding, fastens its bag to the tree, and spins an inner lining within which it pupates. The males pupate in April or May and the females perhaps a month later. The winged male emerges from its cocoon some time between August and October. The male does not feed after emerging, and lives for only a few days. It has wings almost clear of scales and flies strongly, seeking out a mature female to inseminate. The female in contrast, remains in her bag after emerging from the pupa. She is a highly specialised, worm-like creature: she has no wings at all, and lacks legs and even eyes; she lies helpless in her shelter, only able to turn her posterior towards the opening of her bag for insemination, and away from the opening for oviposition. The male inserts the point of his abdomen through the neck of the bag and inseminates her. Oviposition starts immediately afterwards, sometimes even before insemination, and in mid- or late winter successful females produces on average about 1600 eggs. They remain in the bag together with the shrunken remains of the mother, hatching about two months later. This relatively large clutch size reflects the fact that on average only a few of the larvae survive to reproduce. The large number of eggs is at least in part an adaptation to the female's inability to fly and the compensatory strategy for dispersion of the newly hatched larvae; wattle bagworm larvae rely on an unusual mode of transport. After hatching as a caterpillar, the insect spins a silk thread and hangs from the end for a few days. The wind or a passing bird sometimes transports the caterpillar to another tree, spreading the species quite effectively, if inefficiently. Given the large number of eggs, there is a reasonable chance that at least some of them will find adventitious transport. The rest either starve, or settle down in the tree where they hatched which is likely to die from defoliation within a few seasons if natural or artificial controls do not prevent it. The wattle bagworm has many natural enemies. They include parasitic wasps, flies and beetles, and various predators, such as spiders and birds, not to mention fungal diseases such as Entomophthora and Isaria species, bacterial diseases such as Bacillus thuringiensis, and polyhedral virus diseases. Attempts to use such a virus for bagworm control during the 1950s gave results too inconsistent to be satisfactory at the time. In the wild probably the most important insect enemy of Kotochalia junodi is an interesting parasitoid wasp, a member of the Ichneumonidae, Sericopimpla sericata. In colour the wasp is largely black, yellowish, and red. The female wasp is about 12 mm in length, and like many Ichneumonids she has a protruding ovipositor almost as long as her gaster. A surprising feature of Sericopimpla sericata habits is that the adult kills bagworms in two ways. In either case it stings them with the ovipositor. The bagworm wriggles and contorts within the bag to avoid attack, but as a rule the female wasp succeeds in stinging it sooner or later. In some cases the female then proceeds to eat the prey herself. The sting paralyses the victim, and the wasp bites a hole in the bag and feeds through it. Such predatory feeding by parasitoids is very unusual. No doubt the female needs the plentiful fat and protein of the victim to produce eggs, much as many blood-sucking female insects need a blood meal before they can lay eggs. An adequately nourished female will parasitise the bagworm with several stings, perhaps dozens. Paralysed hosts remain fresh for months, long enough for the wasp larvae. The bagworm routinely infests the large local wattle plantations, which cover more than half a million acres (2,000 km2) in South Africa, primarily in Natal. Natural control of the bagworm is variable, but good enough that the use of the most dangerous insecticides has effectively been discontinued. Nowadays the policy is to spray only heavy infestations, and only at strategic times. In the mid-20th century chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides such as toxaphene and endrin were the treatments of choice for control of wattle bagworm infestations,Smit, Bernard, \\"Insects in South Africa: How to Control them\\", Pub: Oxford University Press, Cape Town, 1964. but since then the preference has shifted to the bacterial insecticide BTK. For small infestations or localized impact, \\"manual control\\"‚Äîsimply picking bags from the trees‚Äîmay be satisfactory.

Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister from 1998 to 2007. On February 8, 2016, Brice√±o again became Leader of the Opposition in Belize. Career In 1993, Johnny Brice√±o was elected to the National Assembly as the representative for the Orange Walk Central division; in 1994 he ran in the municipal elections in Orange Walk Town and served as a member of the Town Council for two terms from 1994 to 2001. In 1994 he was elected Co-Chairman of the People‚Äôs United Party; in 1996 he was elected to one of the two top positions, as Deputy Party Leader and he became the youngest Belizean ever to become Deputy Leader of the People‚Äôs United Party. Brice√±o served as Deputy Party Leader from 1996 until 2008 when he resigned and offered himself as a candidate for Party Leader. During his years as Deputy Party Leader Brice√±o and the PUP won national elections in 1998 and in 2003 and as the leader in the northern region the Party won more than 50 percent of their seats in the national as well as in local elections. A decade in government, Johnny Brice√±o served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Natural Resources and the Environment. He also assisted the Prime Minister with many of his international obligations. As a minister of government, he led efforts to modernize the Ministry of Natural Resources by implementing a computerized land management programme in Belize. As a result, thousands of Belizeans were able to acquire land titles and to register their properties. He also improved and enhanced the department of geology, increasing staff and hiring experts. This was an important decision and one which certainly help to play a role in the discovery of oil in Belize in commercial quantities. As Minister of the Environment, Johnny Brice√±o led the way in the development of regional initiatives on environmental protection and sustainable management of the region‚Äôs natural resources. Today Central America and the Caribbean have joined forces on several initiatives to protect forests, keep the waters safe and clean and to work together in disaster planning and mitigation. Through his lobbying efforts, the Mesa-American Barrier Reef System project as well and the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center have been established and working on regional efforts to mitigate against climate change and to look at the sustainable management of the resources of the regions. A native of Orange Walk Town, Brice√±o was first elected to the Belize House of Representatives from the Orange Walk Central constituency in 1993.Hon. Juan Antonio (Johnny) Briceno . National Assembly (Belize). (accessed 23 September 2014) He was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment, Commerce and Industry in 1998 after the PUP returned to power in the 1998 election. In August 2004 he led a group of ministers, known as the G-7 alliance, who made a number of reform demands, including the dismissal of Ralph Fonseca from the Cabinet. When Prime Minister Said Musa failed to meet these demands, the group resigned; however, Musa subsequently agreed to all of the demands except for the dismissal of Fonseca and the G-7 ministers remained in the Cabinet. Brice√±o was later one of the ministers who opposed Musa's proposal to settle the country's Universal Health Services debt; as a result of this, Musa attempted to demote Brice√±o from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, but Brice√±o refused to accept the lesser posts in the Cabinet that he was offered and instead resigned from the Cabinet on June 5, 2007.\\"Vildo is Deputy P.M. ‚Äì Florencio replaces Johnny!\\" , Amandala Online, June 5, 2007.

It was the product of a merger of three companies in 1929: Minneapolis Steel & Machinery (MSM) which was noted for its Twin City tractors, Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company (MTMC) which also produced Minneapolis tractors, and Moline Plow Company. It had manufacturing facilities on Lake Street at Hiawatha Avenue in Minneapolis, MN, in Hopkins, MN and in Moline, IL. History =Labour= MSM, the largest of the merged companies, had been a leader in the anti‚Äìlabor union (open shop) movement. It was a member of the Citizen's Alliance (CA), a powerful Minneapolis business league that kept the city largely union free for over 20 years. During World War I, the unions agreed to not strike to aid the war effort, in exchange the National War Labor Board ordered wage hikes for workers. MSM refused, starting a court battle that would not be fully resolved until the 1940s. Minneapolis-Moline inherited MSM's CA membership and attitude. However, it signed a contract with the AFL Machinists Union in 1935, during the Flour City Ornamental Iron strike and after the 1934 Teamster's Strikes, both of which were notable for their violence. This was a notable defection that foreshadowed the collapse of the open-shop movement in Minneapolis. However, this did not mean peaceful labour relations in the years to come. After World War II, the company would have to deal with strikes and pension disputes. =British assembly= Between 1946 and 1949 the company offered two tractors assembled in Great Britain, the UDS which appeared in 1946 with a price of ‚Ç§1,050 and the Meadows diesel powered UDM which was introduced in 1948 with a price of ‚Ç§1,200. Both tractors were too expensive for the British market and after poor sales, production stopped in 1949.Dunne, page 104. =Acquisition of Avery= In 1951 Minneapolis-Moline acquired the Avery farm equipment company. =1963 acquisition by White= It was acquired in 1963 by the White Motor Company who also owned the Oliver brand.Dunne, page 153. The Minneapolis-Moline brand name was dropped by White in 1974. AGCO purchased White in 1991. The Hopkins headquarters site has been redeveloped, and is now the location for a Honda automobile dealership. The Minneapolis Hiawatha Avenue site has been developed as a shopping mall, anchored by a Target store and a CUB (SuperValu) grocery store. Tractors =UDLX Comfortractor= Minneapolis-Moline pioneered the concept of the closed-cab farm tractor in 1938 by developing the UDLX Comfortractor (also known as the Model U Deluxe). The UDLX had flowing enclosing bodywork and a well appointed all-weather cabin, which contained a passenger seat, the idea being that the farmer and his wife would ride in comfort.Dunne, pages 86 and 87. Entry to the cabin was by a large rear door. The bodywork was painted in as the bright \\"Prairie-Gold\\" colour while the bumper and hubcabs were chromed. It was equipped with automotive features such as safety glass windscreen, windshield wipers, an electric starter and a dashboard with a speedometer, clock, sun visor, rear view mirror, plus several firsts in a tractor, including a heater, a cigarette lighter, ashtray, and a radio. 1938 Minneapolis-Moline UDLX tractor side view The 2.9 ton tractor was powered by a high compression Minneapolis-Moline four-cylinder 283 cu.in (4,637 cc) KED petrol engine which produced 46hp and drove a gearbox with five forward and one reverse gears which gave it a top speed of 40 mph. The model experienced poor sales due to its high cost of US$2,155 (1938) (double that of a Farmall or Deere), . A general recession starting in 1938 also negatively impacted sales of this and most other durable goods. Only 125 of the UDLX were produced before production stopped in 1941. UDLX was part of one of Minneapolis-Moline's most popular series. The U series saw a number of variants, including the UTU, UTS, UTL, UDU, UDU, UOPL, UB, UTIL, and UT. =GT= Introduced in 1941 this tractor was powered by a four cylinder petrol/paraffin engine which produced 40 hp and which was sufficient to give it a five-plow US power rating. Its transmission had four-forward and one-reverse gears.Dunne, page 84. =Uni-Tractor= In the early 1950s M-M introduced the Uni-Tractor which was a three-wheeled powered unit used to drive other units. The concept was instead of having different tractors and harvesters, one power unit mated to the correct unit could do all the jobs a farmer needed‚Äîi.e. of as M-M sales stated \\"All-in- One\\". While it was sold in small numbers the concept never was popular with most farmers. Many farmers referred to the Uni-Tractor as the Minneapolis- Moline Motorcycle. =ZB series= Introduced in 1953 the ZB was an improved version of the ZA tractor with a more comfortable seat and improved steering. It was powered by a four-cylinder petrol engine which produced 34.8 hp and drove a gearbox with five-forward and one reverse gears. The ZBU version had a tricycle front axle with double front wheels, while the ZBN version had a single front wheel and the ZBE had a wide front axle. production stopped in 1955. =M series= The M series was introduced in 1960 with the M-5, followed by the M-504 in 1962, the M-602 and M-604 (4WD) in 1963, and finally the M-670 in 1964. The M series ended production in 1970. =G series= The six-cylinder G series comprises the largest and most powerful Minneapolis- Moline tractors. Production started in 1959 with the G-VI, followed by the G-704 in 1962. Models that followed were the G-705, G-706, G-707, G-708, G-1000, G-900, G-1000 Vista, G-950, G-1050 and the G-1350. The G-1350 which was introduced in 1969 was powered by a six-cylinder diesel engine which produced 141 hp and drove a transmission with ten-forward and two-reverse gears. It was also sold as the Oliver 2155. It was only sold for two years before being replaced by the G-1355. The G-1355 was introduced 1972 and was the most powerful Minneapolis-Moline tractor ever built with 142 PTO HP. The G-955 was manufactured between 1973 and 1974 and was the last tractor manufactured under the Minneapolis-Moline name, as White ceased using the brand name in 1974. In the early 1970s, White also sold four Oliver models rebranded as Minneapolis-Moline: the Oliver 1555 was sold as the G-550, the Oliver 1655 was sold as the G-750, the Oliver 1755 was sold as the G-850 and the Oliver 1855 was sold as the G-940. These tractors had 53, 70, 86, and 92 PTO horsepower, respectively. In 1971, White sold two diesel imports made by Fiat as Minneapolis-Moline: the MM G-350 (41 PTO horsepower, 3-cylinder) and the MM G-450 (54 PTO horsepower, 4-cylinder). The G-350 was also sold as the Oliver 1265 and the Cockshutt 1265; the G-450 was sold as the Oliver 1365 and the Cockshutt 1365.

It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean, and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States. The sea receded when highlands to the west began to rise. Stratigraphy The Sundance Sea did not occur at a single time; geological evidence suggests that the Sea was actually a series of five successive marine transgressions‚Äîeach separated by an erosional hiatus‚Äîwhich advanced and receded from the middle Jurassic onward. The terrestrial sediments of the Morrison Formation‚Äîeroded from rising highlands to the west‚Äîwere deposited on top of the marine Sundance sediments as the sea regressed for the last time late in the Jurassic. The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils. Fauna The Sundance Sea was rich in many types of animals. Gryphaea was extremely common, and shark teeth have been found. In addition to fish, belemnites and to an extent ammonites swarmed in shoals. Crinoids and bivalvia dotted the seafloor. Ophthalmosaurus, a large 20 foot long ichthyosaur, swam in the seas using its large, long jaws to catch belemnite 'squid'. Pantosaurus, a 15-20 foot long cryptoclidid plesiosaur, went after the easier-to-catch fish. The largest marine reptile in the Sundance Sea was Megalneusaurus, a 25 foot long pliosaur similar to Liopleurodon. Its fossils have been found in Alaska and Wyoming, which were both covered by the Sundance Sea when it was alive. During the periods of recession, dinosaurs and other Jurassic terrestrial animals frequented the shores, as evidenced by the Red Gulch Dinosaur Tracksite near Shell, Wyoming.

Cem Kaner, who coined the term in 1984,Cem Kaner, \\"A Tutorial in Exploratory Testing\\", p.2 defines exploratory testing as \\"a style of software testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel throughout the project.\\"Cem Kaner, A Tutorial in Exploratory Testing, p. 36. While the software is being tested, the tester learns things that together with experience and creativity generates new good tests to run. Exploratory testing is often thought of as a black box testing technique. Instead, those who have studied it consider it a test approach that can be applied to any test technique, at any stage in the development process. The key is not the test technique nor the item being tested or reviewed; the key is the cognitive engagement of the tester, and the tester's responsibility for managing his or her time.Cem Kaner, A Tutorial in Exploratory Testing, p. 37-39, 40- .  History  Exploratory testing has always been performed by skilled testers. In the early 1990s, ad hoc was too often synonymous with sloppy and careless work. As a result, a group of test methodologists (now calling themselves the Context-Driven School) began using the term \\"exploratory\\" seeking to emphasize the dominant thought process involved in unscripted testing, and to begin to develop the practice into a teachable discipline. This new terminology was first published by Cem Kaner in his book Testing Computer Software Cem Kaner, Testing Computer Software, TAB Books, Blue Ridge Summit, PA, 1988. p. 6, 7-11. and expanded upon in Lessons Learned in Software Testing. Exploratory testing can be as disciplined as any other intellectual activity.  Description  Exploratory testing seeks to find out how the software actually works, and to ask questions about how it will handle difficult and easy cases. The quality of the testing is dependent on the tester's skill of inventing test cases and finding defects. The more the tester knows about the product and different test methods, the better the testing will be. To further explain, comparison can be made of freestyle exploratory testing to its antithesis scripted testing. In the latter activity test cases are designed in advance. This includes both the individual steps and the expected results. These tests are later performed by a tester who compares the actual result with the expected. When performing exploratory testing, expectations are open. Some results may be predicted and expected; others may not. The tester configures, operates, observes, and evaluates the product and its behaviour, critically investigating the result, and reporting information that seems likely to be a bug (which threatens the value of the product to some person) or an issue (which threatens the quality of the testing effort). In reality, testing almost always is a combination of exploratory and scripted testing, but with a tendency towards either one, depending on context. According to Kaner and James Marcus Bach, exploratory testing is more a mindset or \\"...a way of thinking about testing\\" than a methodology.Cem Kaner, James Bach, Exploratory & Risk Based Testing, www.testingeducation.org, 2004, p. 10 They also say that it crosses a continuum from slightly exploratory (slightly ambiguous or vaguely scripted testing) to highly exploratory (freestyle exploratory testing).Cem Kaner, James Bach, Exploratory & Risk Based Testing, www.testingeducation.org, 2004, p. 14 The documentation of exploratory testing ranges from documenting all tests performed to just documenting the bugs. During pair testing, two persons create test cases together; one performs them, and the other documents. Session-based testing is a method specifically designed to make exploratory testing auditable and measurable on a wider scale. Exploratory testers often use tools, including screen capture or video tools as a record of the exploratory session, or tools to quickly help generate situations of interest, e.g. James Bach's Perlclip.  Benefits and drawbacks  The main advantage of exploratory testing is that less preparation is needed, important bugs are found quickly, and at execution time, the approach tends to be more intellectually stimulating than execution of scripted tests. Another major benefit is that testers can use deductive reasoning based on the results of previous results to guide their future testing on the fly. They do not have to complete a current series of scripted tests before focusing in on or moving on to exploring a more target rich environment. This also accelerates bug detection when used intelligently. Another benefit is that, after initial testing, most bugs are discovered by some sort of exploratory testing. This can be demonstrated logically by stating, \\"Programs that pass certain tests tend to continue to pass the same tests and are more likely to fail other tests or scenarios that are yet to be explored.\\" Disadvantages are that tests invented and performed on the fly can't be reviewed in advance (and by that prevent errors in code and test cases), and that it can be difficult to show exactly which tests have been run. Freestyle exploratory test ideas, when revisited, are unlikely to be performed in exactly the same manner, which can be an advantage if it is important to find new errors; or a disadvantage if it is more important to repeat specific details of the earlier tests. This can be controlled with specific instruction to the tester, or by preparing automated tests where feasible, appropriate, and necessary, and ideally as close to the unit level as possible.  Scientific studies  Replicated experiment has shown that while scripted and exploratory testing result in similar defect detection effectiveness (the total number of defects found) exploratory results in higher efficiency (the number of defects per time unit) as no effort is spent on pre-designing the test cases. Observational study on exploratory testers proposed that the use of knowledge about the domain, the system under test, and customers is an important factor explaining the effectiveness of exploratory testing. A case-study of three companies found that ability to provide rapid feedback was a benefit of Exploratory Testing while managing test coverage was pointed as a short-coming. A survey found that Exploratory Testing is also used in critical domains and that Exploratory Testing approach places high demands on the person performing the testing.  Usage  Exploratory testing is particularly suitable if requirements and specifications are incomplete, or if there is lack of time. The approach can also be used to verify that previous testing has found the most important defects.

Most of SR 518 is located within the city of Melbourne. Route description Florida State Road 518 in the Eau Gallie neighborhood of Melbourne, Florida. State Road 518 begins at Exit 183 of I-95, and continues east on Eau Gallie Boulevard through a recently built suburban area. About 1/2 mile east of the I-95 interchange, it intersects Sarno Road, State Road 5054, and the former route of SR 518. The road continues through sparsely developed land until its intersection with County Road 509 (Wickham Road), where SR 518 continues through a denser area, passing through mostly commercial business, with residential areas not far away. At US 1, the road splits into a one way pair of Montreal Avenue and Eau Gallie Boulevard making its way to the Eau Gallie Causeway, which takes SR 518 across the Indian River. At the east end of the causeway, it intersects State Road 513, entering Indian Harbour Beach. It passes through more commercial developments for the rest of the route, where it ends at State Road A1A, just west of the beach and the Atlantic Ocean.

It was one of several B-films in which William Shatner starred between the original Star Trek television series and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Other cast members included Tom Skerritt, Ernest Borgnine, Eddie Albert, Ida Lupino, Keenan Wynn and John Travolta in his film debut in a minor role. Satanist Anton LaVey is credited as the film's technical advisor and appeared in the film playing a minor role. Plot A curse affects the Preston family, caused by their betrayal of the Satanic priest Jonathan Corbis (Ernest Borgnine). Corbis has harassed the Preston family for generations to obtain a Satanic book of great power. Corbis captures patriarch Steve Preston (George Sawaya), who is allowed to escape to warn his wife Emma (Ida Lupino) and younger son Mark (William Shatner) about Corbis' wrath. He tells them to give the book to Corbis, but during a rainstorm he melts into a waxy substance. Mark takes the book, hoping to meet with Corbis and defeat him. In a ghost town in the desert, Corbis gives Mark a drink of water from an old hand-pumped well. Mark drinks but then spits out the bitter water. He challenges Corbis to a battle of faith, then draws a pistol and aims it at him. Corbis belittles this threat and Mark tries to escape, but he is surrounded by Corbis' followers. He produces a cross, but Corbis transforms it into a snake and Mark discards it. Corbis' followers capture Preston, and Corbis uses a ritual to erase Mark‚Äôs memory in preparation for a ceremony later that evening. Mark's older brother, Tom (Tom Skerritt), and his wife, Julie, search for Mark. They are accompanied by Dr. Sam Richards (Eddie Albert), a psychic researcher. Their search leads them to Corbis' church, where Corbis is performing a ceremony to convert Mark into one of his soulless minions; during the proceedings Corbis transforms into a Satanic goat-like demon. Tom witnesses all of this; he is discovered by the Satanists but eludes capture. Later he and Richards meet at the Satanic church, where they discover that the source of Corbis' power is an ornate glass bottle known as \\"The Devil's Rain\\", which contains the souls of Corbis' disciples. Corbis and the Satanists converge on the church. Richards threatens to destroy The Devil's Rain, but he is overpowered by the acolytes. He appeals to Mark's lost humanity and convinces him to destroy the bottle, which he does in defiance of Corbis' entreaties. A storm rages outside, and the Satanists melt in the rain. Tom and his wife make a hasty exit. As Tom holds his wife, it is revealed that he is actually embracing Corbis, and his wife's soul has become trapped within a new Devil's Rain.

Response The Devil's Rain received a uniformly negative critical response, with the chief complaint being the incoherent storyline. The film's refusal to provide adequate scares was also widely criticized. Vincent Canby in The New York Times noted that \\"The Devil's Rain is ostensibly a horror film, but it barely manages to be a horror...It is as horrible as watching an egg fry.\\" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times said \\"All of this would be good silly fun if the movie weren't so painfully dull. The problem is that the material's stretched too thin. There's not enough here to fill a feature-length film.\\" He gave the film 1¬Ω stars out of four, and eventually added it to his \\"Most Hated\\" movies list. In his 2010 book Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies, Australian film reviewer Michael Adams called The Devil's Rain \\"the ultimate cult movie\\": \\"It's about a cult, has a cult following, was devised with input from a cult leader, and saw a future superstar indoctrinated into a cult he'd help popularize.\\" See also * List of American films of 1975 Notes External links  1975 films 1975 horror films Mexican horror films Mexican films American supernatural horror films American films English-language films Films directed by Robert Fuest American ghost films Films about Satanism Films about cults ","title":"The Devil's Rain (film)"},{"id":"2951464","text":"Democracy & Nature was a peer-reviewed academic journal of Politics established in 1992 by Takis Fotopoulos as Society and Nature, obtaining its later name in 1995.‚ÄúSociety and Nature (1992-1995),‚Äù Institute for Social Ecology (August 2nd, 2010).

For the flower, see Eschscholzia lobbii. ‚ÄúFrying pan‚Äù with running spiral decoration, Early Cycladic I‚ÄìII (ca. 2700 BC). From Syros? Frying pan (NAMA 4974) from the National Archaeological Museum Athens, drawing by Christos Tsountas in 1899 The same frying pan with incised decoration of a ship. Early Cycladic II, Chalandriani, Syros (Keros- Syros culture, 2800-2300 BC) Frying pans is the descriptive name for Early Cycladic II artifacts from the Aegean Islands, flat skillets with a \\"handle\\", usually made from earthenware but sometimes stone (Frying pan (Karlsruhe 75/11) is an example). They are found especially during the Cycladic Grotta- Pelos and Keros-Syros cultures. Their purpose remains unknown, although they are usually interpreted as prestige goods. Their backsides are typically highly decorated and were apparently carefully crafted. They have been found at sites throughout the Aegean but are not common: around 200 have been unearthed to date, all but a handful in pottery. They are usually found in graves, although they are very uncommon grave goods; the rarity of these objects has contributed to the difficulty in identifying their true purpose.John E. Coleman, Frying Pans of the Early Bronze Age Aegean, American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 89, (1985), pp. 191-219.  Description  Frying pans typically resemble skillets (hence the name 'frying pan') in that they have a diameter of 20 to 28 centimeters, a raised lip and a handle. However, all the decoration tends to be on the outside rim and on the base. The decoration is stamped or incised. The handles vary a great deal (more so on the mainland). Two types of \\"frying pans\\" are distinguished. One the so-called \\"Kampos type\\" is Early Cycladic, characteristically with its straight side decorated with incised lines framing spirals; its rectangular handle with a crossbar; the main circular field commonly decorated with incised running spirals around a central star (ref. Dartmouth). The other is the \\"Syros type\\" with a concave undecorated side, and a two-pronged handle; decoration of main circular field with stamped concentric circles or spirals, often accompanied by incised depictions of longboats or what is sometimes interpreted as female genitalia.Dartmouth College: Early Cycladic pottery Common patterns and designs on these \\"frying pans\\" include: *large stars with circles or bands inside *triangular patterns in rows (very common, called \\"kerbschnitt\\") *concentric circles *wheel-like patterns *many small spirals grouped together *ships (with paddles and fish banners) Proposed functions of \\"Frying Pans\\" Proposed functions of \\"frying pans\\" vary widely, but some of the more common theories include scrying mirrors, drums, religious objects, or salt pans. No \\"frying pan\\" found yet shows any physical wear from being used as a cooking utensil (ex: an actual frying pan). The plate interpretation is fairly neutral, as a plate could be anything from a decorative object to a religious one. It is unlikely that they are actual cooking utensils, as there is no signs of food or fire, and they are usually found in burial contexts. The drum theory is unlikely as one would expect a drum to have holes around the edges so that the hide could be stretched across it. Furthermore, with many of the handles found on these objects, it would be very hard for the drummer to hold the artifact in the style suggested.John E. Coleman, Frying Pans of the Early Bronze Age Aegean, American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 89, (1985), pp. 191-219. Prehistoric mirrors often have decorated backs, but are usually made of reflective materials rather than ceramic, although proponents of the mirror theory suggest that filled with water or oil, these objects could function as mirrors. A 2009 study concluded, via experimentation, that the frying pans work effectively as mirrors when filled water or olive oil. The use of olive oil was found to be particularly effective, especially if the oil is darkened with pigment. Olive oil is generally believed to have been too rare and expensive to be used for this purpose in the early Cycladic period, though recent discoveries on the island of Keros of a large pyramid, complex plumbing systems, and highly advanced metallurgy suggest that olive oil may not have been as rare as was once believed. It remains undetermined if they served some symbolic or religious purpose, but their presence in graves suggest they could have. Given the frequent depiction of female genitalia, it has been suggested that they could have been recepticals for libations as part of some kind of fertility rite. A further possibility was raised by Christos Doumas in 1993, who suggested that they were used to process sea salt. Doumas connected the issue of trade and exchange of goods before the invention of money with this, proposing that salt might have served as a valuable material, while leaving no archaeologically detectable traces.

Significant cases =IRS v. The Church of Scientology= In 1992, Judge Green ruled in favor of the Church of Scientology in the case of Church of Scientology v. Internal Revenue Service on a pretrial motion for summary judgment. =Release of BCCI's frozen assets= On September 1, 1995 Green Ordered $393 million seized from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International turned over to the bank's victims. BCCI had been involved in criminal activity and its assets had been freed in 1992. Green had heard, and ruled on, three challenges to the release of the seized funds. =FEC v. The Christian Coalition= Green ruled against the Federal Election Commission in Federal Election Commission v. The Christian Coalition Civil Action No. 96-1781 Opinion & Order; and Judgment, filed August 2, 1999. The FEC had challenged the propriety of the Christian Coalition's distribution of voter guides, on the grounds it had been too closely tied to large corporate donors. But, Green's 108-page judgment had supported the FEC in two instances; when the Christian Coalition had broken FEC guidelines in their explicit advocacy of the re-election of Newt Gingrich; and when the Christian Coalition had handed over their membership list to Senate candidate Oliver North. =In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases= Following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004), which determined that detainees had the right of habeas corpus and due process to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal, many habeas corpus cases were filed on behalf of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. On September 15, 2004, Judge Green was appointed the coordinating judge for all Guantanamo Bay habeas corpus cases. On January 31, 2005, Judge Green ruled that: (1) detainees had the fundamental Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law; (2) complaints stated a claim for violation of due process based on Combatant Status Review Tribunal's (\\"CSRT\\") extensive reliance on classified information in its resolution of \\"enemy combatant\\" status of detainees, the detainees' inability to review that information, and the prohibition of assistance by counsel jointly deprived detainees of sufficient notice of the factual bases for their detention and denied them a fair opportunity to challenge their incarceration; (3) due process required that CSRTs sufficiently consider whether the evidence upon which the tribunal relied in making its \\"enemy combatant\\" determinations had been obtained through torture; (4) complaints stated a claim for violation of due process based on the government's employment of an overly broad definition of \\"enemy combatant\\" subject to indefinite detention; and (5) Geneva Conventions applied to the Taliban detainees, but not to members of the al Qaeda terrorist organization.In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases, 355 F.Supp.2d 443 (D.D.C. 2005).

The album was certified Gold status in the U.K. This was the last album with the classic line up of Saxon, as drummer Pete Gill would leave the band due to a hand injury, later joining Mot√∂rhead; this was also seen as the last of their triptych of classic albums (the previous two being Wheels of Steel and Strong Arm of the Law). Song notes The album spawned two of their most successful singles, \\"And the Bands Played On\\" and \\"Princess of the Night\\". There are nine songs on this album, which are noted for lyrics about a wide range of topics. \\"Princess of the Night\\" is a song about a powerful steam locomotive and \\"And the Bands Played On\\" is about 1980 Monsters of Rock Festival - name checking several of the other acts on the bill including Rainbow and Touch. Other themes for the songs include: partying, the spirit of the music, fighting, and, like many of their songs, motorcycles. \\"Midnight Rider\\" is a song about Saxon's 1980 North American tour. The name of the album and song was inspired by the popular attire of metalheads in the early 1980s, defined by either denim jeans and jackets or a leather biker jacket (often worn with a denim cut-off waistcoat). The song is seen as a tribute from the band to their fans while describing the history of the sub-culture and the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). Reception The album peaked at #9 in the UK Albums Chart. The album is regarded as a classic in the band's discography, and has been received positively by critics and fans. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic called the opening track \\"Princess of the Night\\" an \\"infectiously anthemic opening statement\\", whilst praising the title track for also being an \\"unqualified classic\\". He considered \\"Out of Control\\" and \\"Rough and Ready\\" to be strong tracks, whilst regarding \\"Fire in the Sky\\", \\"Midnight Rider\\", and \\"And The Bands Played On\\" as \\"spectacular\\".

Because of the liquid's low boiling point, 39.6¬∞C (103.3¬∞F), the modest heat generated by the lamp causes the liquid to boil and bubble up from the vial's base thus creating a decorative effect. Description Common screw-in bubble light A miniature bubble light designed to operate with 12-volt \\"midget\\" bulbs. The liquid is almost always methylene chloride, a solvent that is toxic and possibly carcinogenic. It is generally sealed in a glass vial or capsule to prevent its release; if it is broken, the area should be evacuated until the fumes have dissipated. Some early bubble lights instead used a lightweight oil or camphor (a white substance used in some moth balls) to create the low boiling point. In these older lamps, one can often see a white piece floating at the top of the vial, until the heat of the lamp dissolves it and it starts to bubble. The light from the lamp illuminates the bubbles from underneath, causing them to shine. Bubble lights of all kinds operate best when the top of the tube is significantly cooler than the bottom, thus increasing the pressure gradient. The tubes must be kept upright, and occasionally may need to be tapped or even shaken to begin bubbling after warming up. Bubble lights have been made in two different lamp base sizes ‚Äî E10 (C6) 15 volt, and E12 (C7). The original design used a miniature screw base (E10), such as those used on C6 cone-shaped Christmas lamps. For 120 V power, these early designs were nominally designed to operate with eight on one string, in series, at 15 volts each. However, they were often packaged with a nine-socket string to extend the life of the bulbs. Bubble lights could also be purchased individually for use in existing light strings. Modern incarnations either use candelabra base (E12) 120-volt bulbs, or push-in wedge base \\"midget\\" size miniature bulbs (most commonly ten 12-volt bulbs wired in series). The clear light bulb is enclosed in a plastic base made up of a \\"bowl\\" and a \\"cap\\", usually of different colors. Bubble lights are manufactured in just about any color, including the liquid in the tube. The plastics used are most commonly semi-opaque red, yellow, blue, and green. Liquids are generally amber, red, blue, green, and rarely, purple or pink. Uncolored liquid is also available, being lit with colored bulbs instead. A candelabra base 120-volt bubble light candle in operation In recent years, bubble lights have become more elaborate in appearance. Glitter is sometimes added to the vials for extra sparkle, most commonly on specialty types such as those used in decorative nightlights. Bases are now often made to look like figures such as Santa Clauses or snowmen, or decorative objects and symbols, rather than the plain ribbed plastic. Like many other Christmas decorations, they have been converted for Halloween use, usually with orange- colored liquid and a base that looks like a jack-o'-lantern, or the head of a black cat or witch, among other Halloween symbols. Less-toxic modern imitations of bubble lights are made from acrylic or other clear plastic rods, with permanent bubbles deliberately manufactured into them, lit with fixed- color or color-changing LEDs. Other bubbling lights are much larger and sit on a table or floor, occasionally with fake fish which \\"swim\\" up and down as they change buoyancy. These tubes are usually filled with distilled water, and have one or more airstones at the bottom, and normally a light, along with an air pump. History Bubble lights for Christmas decoration were first patented in the United States by Carl W. Otis in 1944 and introduced there in 1946 by NOMA, one of the largest American manufacturers of Christmas lights. While NOMA was the largest company to make these lights, other manufacturers included Raylite (Paramount/Sterling), Royal Electric Company, and Good Lite/Peerless. Bubble lights were very popular as Christmas lights from the 1940s through the 1970s, before miniature \\"fairy\\" lights became popular.

Glendale is South of the Rose Park, Fair Park, and Poplar Grove neighborhoods. The neighborhood was originally developed as Glendale Gardens which is where Glendale Middle School derives its name. Mountain View Elementary (next to Glendale Middle School) was originally named Glendale Elementary. Glendale, and neighboring Poplar Grove, Fair Park, & Rose Park enjoy a vibrant multi ethnic environment. Residents of Glendale enjoy the community's diversity, friendliness, pride in community, and authenticity of fellow residents. Those who live in Glendale also cite it as affordable, and conveniently close to local schools, parks, the airport, and downtown Salt Lake City.The Glendale Community Partnership on behalf of University Neighborhood Partners, 2005, Understanding Community Participation in the Glendale Neighborhood, online research report, pg. 7.

Cannon family. The George Q. and Caroline Cannon House is a Victorian-style brick house at 1354 South and 1000 West and was built in 1876.Salt Lake County Assessor, 2012, assessor.slco.org/ Parcel Database - Parcel 15142010010000, online database, accessed, August, 2012. There are maps, photography, property descriptions, and paintings documenting the development of this area. On May 31, 1896, the Latter-day Saint Cannon Ward was established by members of the Cannon family, serving the area between 600 West to the west, Redwood Road to the east, Indiana Avenue to the north, and 2700 South to the south.Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1946, Cannon Ward in Retrospect 1896-1946, online document, accessed, August, 2012. As of December 31, 1900, the Cannon Ward contained 61 families consisting of 331 people, 81 of which were children. In the 1890s several industries were established near the northeast corner of what is now Glendale (950 S and 600 W), including a brickyard, brewery, biscuit factory, salt works, and soup factory.McCormick, John, The Gathering Place - An Illustrated History of Salt Lake City, Signature Books, pgs. 61-63. In the early 20th century, railroad tracks bisected Salt Lake City. Industry and rail works isolated residential areas of the west side of Salt Lake City. The isolation and proximity to industry caused the residential areas to become working-class neighborhoods. Before the 1930s, Salt Lake City was highly polluted, having hazy air, and the Jordan River was used a sewage disposal canal, making it a less desirable place to live near.Alexander, T.G., 2001, Grace and Grandeur: A History of Salt Lake City, Heritage Media Corporation, pg 52. There are several houses on the east side of the Jordan River on present day California Avenue that were built prior to 1930. Between 1930 and 1960 Based on aerial photography, a significant amount of residential development occurred in the Glendale neighborhood from 1937 to 1958, which is coincident with the post- World War II expansion. The first major subdivisions built in Glendale were built in the 1940s and early 1950s.Salt Lake County Assessor, 2012, Parcel Database, online database, accessed, August, 2012.Salt Lake City, 2012, West Salt Lake Master Plan, online document, page 6, accessed, August, 2012. The early subdivisions were part of the Glendale Gardens housing project, built to accommodate a large influx of families moving to Utah for the war effort, associated with the relocation of the Ninth Service Command to Fort Douglas, Utah.Sillitoe, Linda, 1996, Welcoming the World - A History of Salt Lake County, Salt Lake County, pgs. 161-162. The area south of California Avenue, east of 1200 West, and west of the Jordan River, was developed from 1947 to 1952. The area north of California Avenue and south of Glendale Drive was also developed at this time. The main development in the western, industrial part of Glendale was the Utah Ordnance Plant. This area was operated by the Remington Corporation. In 1941, several buildings were constructed within the Utah Ordnance Plant area for the purpose of producing World War II ammunition. The Utah Ordnance Plant was in operation from 1942 to 1943 and was in standby from 1944 to 1946. The area was decommissioned and sold after 1946.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2005,Utah Ordnance Plant - Facts Sheet, online document, Formerly Used Defense Sites Located In The State of Utah, vol. 5, issue 1.

Despite a wide-ranging sound palette, the group was best known for their high impact, industrial-tinged big beat compositions. History Formed in 1996 and composed of Simon \\"sHack\\" Shackleton and Howard \\"Howie\\" Saunders, they released two well received albums, as well as several singles and a wide range of remixes. The two had known each other since an early age, and prior to forming Lunatic Calm, they also played in several bands with Thom Yorke (Radiohead frontman), namely Headless Chickens and Flicker Noise. Metropol (1997) Their debut album Metropol was often compared to the works of The Prodigy and other bands, although it ranged from offbeat and psychedelic trip hop to heavy turbo-charged big beat. Record company MCA failed to support the band and they switched their attentions to the American market where they enjoyed a series of successful tours with other groups including Crystal Method. The most notable track from that album, and the one for which the group remains best known, is \\"Leave You Far Behind\\". This track has appeared on numerous movie soundtracks including The Matrix, Charlie's Angels, and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, also including The Crow in 1998-1999. A number of Lunatic Calm's tracks were used on video games, and the group did numerous remixes for various artists including Bush, DJ Scissorkicks, and Curve. Breaking Point (2002) The group's second album, Breaking Point was released in 2002, after several years of wrangling with record companies, and with little to no promotion. As the album was due to be released, the record label City of Angels went bankrupt. Without label support the band were unable to continue and Lunatic Calm disbanded in 2003.  Aftermath  Simon Shackleton has been highly active as a solo producer and DJ ever since, operating primarily under the name Elite Force, but also under aliases such as Killer Elite, Futurecore, Double Black, pHrack R and Zodiac Cartel. He has run labels such as U&A; Recordings (2006‚Äìpresent) and the Fused & Bruised imprint between 1996‚Äì2002, and is often cited as one of the leading proponents of the emergent Tech-Funk movement, fusing house, breaks, Electro and Techno. Some of his songs (both remixes and new tracks) have appeared on the Crystal Method remix albums, Community Service and Community Service II amongst others. He is currently recording an album as Simon Shackleton which is scheduled for release in early 2016 and has become a regular performer and attendee at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada each summer. Howie is now one half of DoubleDose, a music production and sound design partnership he set up in 2004 with BAFTA award winner Nick Ryan, devising multimedia marketing campaigns, live event productions and sonic branding for companies such as Nokia, Shell, Ernst & Young, Ford, Mazda, Land Rover, Intel and Formula One motor racing across Europe, North America & Asia Pacific.

Gate of T≈çzenji Memorial of the first British legation in Japan T≈çzen-ji (Êù±Á¶ÖÂØ∫) is a temple in Takanawa, Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It belongs to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism which has its headquarters at Myoshin-ji in Kyoto.Cortazzi, Hugh. (2000). Collected Writings of Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Vol. II, pp. 210-211. In 1610, Ryonan-zenji founded it at Akasaka and in 1636 it was relocated to its present location. The temple was located directly on the Tokaido Road to the sea, and for that reason it was named Kaij≈ç Zenrin (literally, \\"the Zen forest above the sea\\"). The words were emblazoned prominently on the Sanmon, or main gate, which disappeared long ago. In the Edo period, T≈çzen-ji was considered the family temple of various clans, including the Date clan of Sendai, the Ikeda clan of Omi province, the Inaba clan of Usuki Domain in Bungo province, the Suwo of Shinshu, the Tamura of Ichinoseki, and the Mori clan of Saeki in Bungo. After the bell of the main bell-tower was swept away by the 2011 tsunami, this bell has been recovered and brought back to its original place.

In 1860, the native interpreter of Rutherford Alcock, Consul-General in Japan, was murdered at the gate of the legation, and in the following year the legation was stormed by a group of r≈çnin from the fiefdom of Mito Han, whose attack was repulsed by Alcock and his staff. Diplomats George Morrison and Laurence Oliphant were both wounded in the attack and returned to England for recuperation shortly thereafter. Sword cuts and bullet marks in the attack of the samurai of the Mito Han remain in the pillar of the Okushoin (the drawing room in the back) and the genkan.Alcock, Rutherford. (1863). The Capital of Tycoon, pp. 146-158. Rutherford Alcock, the first British Minister to Japan, recorded his impressions of T≈çzen-ji in his book, The Capital of the Tycoon (1863). In May 1862, Lieutenant Colonel Edward St. John Neale assumed duties as Charg√© d'affaires in Japan during Alcock's period of extended home leave. A further attack on the legation on the morning of 27 June 1862 which resulted in the death of two British Marines from H.M.S. Renard, prompted the temporary relocation of diplomatic personnel and the establishment of an expanded British Military Garrison at Yamate, in the treaty port of Yokohama.

Because of its low electorate, it has a parish meeting rather than a parish council.\\"Introduction\\" in the Battlesden pages listed under External links. It is in the civil parish of Milton Bryan. Battlesden House was a large manor house situated in parkland, Battlesden Park, close to the hamlet. Former residents of the village include Henry Skynner & John Dunnyng, both husbandman, defending a case of trespass in Badelesden, in 1422.

The history of the county of Bedford mentions the church. The church of ST. PETER AND ALL SAINTS is a small aisleless building set on the south slope of a hill, its earliest part dating apparently from the last quarter of the 13th century. There is a two-light window of this date in the south wall of the nave near the west end, and opposite to it in the north wall a single lancet, their late date being shown by the existence of original glass grooves. The nave is 41 ft. by 21 ft., and in its south-west corner a tower has been built in the 15th century, evidently on insufficient foundations, as it has gone over south-westwards, and is much buttressed and patched in consequence. The chancel is probably of early 14th-century date, though nothing but the chancel arch now remains to show detail of that time; its east window is modern, and its two south windows much restored 16th-century two-light openings. Between them is a plain doorway, and there is a square recess with no sign of a drain below the south-east window. On either side of the east window are 15th- century image brackets carried by angels, whose very modern heads do not agree well with their mediaeval bodies, and in the north wall is a square plastered recess. The chancel arch has good moulded capitals and stops to its chamfered arch, but of the moulded base only a small piece remains. The nave had a rood- stair at the south-east, of which only the lower doorway remains, and next to it a wide two-light 15th-century window. In the north wall is a 17th-century window of three lights with a transom, and west of it a two-light 15th-century window, and there is a squint to the chancel in the north jamb of the chancel arch. The north doorway of the nave is plain 14th-century work under a small and late porch, and west of it is the lancet already mentioned. There is no trace of a south door to the nave, but high in the wall about midway on this side is a plain and late two-light window, intended to serve a gallery east of the tower, now removed. The low-pitched nave roof has late 15th-century moulded tie-beams, purlins, &c.;, and the chancel roof is modern. The tower has simple chamfered arches to the nave on the east and north, and in its west wall is a doorway now blocked by a red brick buttress, but originally opening to a stair turret. The belfry windows are plain two-light openings, and the exterior of the church is very much overgrown with ivy. The font has a rough circular bowl with four pieces of leaf carving, apparently of late 12th- century date, and stands in the eastern tower arch. On the north of the chancel arch is a wall monument to Lady Elizabeth Duncombe undated, on the south another to William Duncombe, 1603, set up about 1640, and on the north wall of the nave a third to Sir John Duncombe, 1687. There are three bells, the treble and the tenor blank and the second of 1813. The plate consists of two communion cups of 1676, two standing patens of 1674, and a large paten given in 1696 by Elizabeth daughter of Nathaniel Reynes, vicar of the parish and of Friern Barnet. The earliest register book contains all entries from 1694 to 1807, but the marriages only till 1753; the second book is of marriages 1754 to 1799, and the third has marriages 1799 to 1812 and baptisms and burials 1807 to 1812.

He is known for ministering to prisoners in France during World War II, and to German prisoners of war in the years following. The cause for his canonization has been accepted by the Holy See.  Early life  Stock was born the first of nine children of a worker family in the village of Neheim-H√ºsten (now part of Arnsberg), in the Province of Westphalia of the German Empire. From 1910 to 1913, he attended a Catholic elementary school. At the age of twelve Franz expressed a wish to become a priest. In 1926, he participated in an international peace meeting in Bierville near Paris, which was organized by Marc Sangnier under the motto \\"Peace via the young!\\" There Franz became friends with Joseph Folliet (1902‚Äì1973), who grew up to become a noted Catholic writer and who greatly influenced him. That same year, he entered the Catholic seminary in Paderborn. In the spring of 1928, Stock went to Paris, France, where he spent three semesters studying at the Institut Catholique. During this period, he became a member of the Compagnons du saint Fran√ßois (Companions of St. Francis), a fellowship committed to living a simple life and working for peace. He was the first German student of theology in France since the Middle Ages. Stock was ordained to the subdiaconate on 15 March 1931. He was then ordained to the priesthood on 12 March 1932 by the Archbishop of Paderborn, Kaspar Klein, and from 1932 to 1934 had his first appointment as priest in Effeln, near Lippstadt, and in Dortmund-Eving. In 1934, he was appointed as rector of the German national parish of St. Boniface in Paris. World War II A few days before the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, he returned to Germany, where he officiated as a priest in Dortmund-Bodelschwingh and in Klein-Wanzleben in central Germany. On 13 August 1940, he was named as priest for Germans residing in Paris during Nazi Germany's occupation of France, and returned in October 1940 to Paris. In 1941, he started to work as a chaplain in the Fresnes Prison, La Sant√© Prison and Cherche-Midi Prison in Paris. He was also a chaplain at the execution site at the Mont Val√©rien during the German occupation of France in World War II, owing him his nickname L'Aum√¥nier de l'Enfer (The chaplain of Hell) and L'archange des prisons (The archangel of the prisons). Often, because of his German nationality, he was the only priest who could freely visit the prisoners without being a part of the Nazi war apparatus. He then met with more than 2,000 prisoners, including the French Navy officer Henri Honor√© d'Estienne d'Orves, the Communist Gabriel P√©ri and the Gaullist Edmond Michelet.L'√©mouvante fresque du S√©minaire des barbel√©s , P√®lerin, 17 June 2004 As part of his pastoral mission, and with great peril to his life, he passed messages from the prisoners to their families and back, sometimes memorizing them. Exploiting every possible avenue to help the prisoners, he delivered German information on them to their families, so as to prepare them when interrogated. The information thus delivered prevented many arrests. This he did under a double threat to his life: besides the obvious peril of arrest, incarceration and/or execution if discovered, Stock suffered severe heart disease (a fact he kept from others) and thus had been ordered to rest. Nevertheless, he went on in his endeavor. On 10 June 1941, he was officially acknowledged as military chaplain with the rank of non-commissioned officer. At the time of the liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944, Stock was in the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, where more than 600 wounded German soldiers together with 200 English and American soldiers were lying, unfit for transport. When the Americans took command of the hospital, Stock became a prisoner of war of the Americans, and was sent to the POW camp of Cherbourg. This he accepted willingly, for it enabled him to help those who now needed most his services ‚Äì the defeated German POWs. The Aum√¥nerie G√©n√©rale in Paris, planning to set up a seminary for captured German Catholic students of theology at the POW Camp Depot 51 at Orl√©ans, contacted him. Shortly thereafter, Stock was asked to head this seminary as managing director, supported in particular by the Gaullist Edmond Michelet. On 24 April 1945, the Abb√© Le Meur accompanied him to Orl√©ans, where already twenty-eight theology students awaited them. On 17 August 1945, the \\"barbed-wire seminary\\", the s√©minaire des barbel√©s, was transferred from Orl√©ans to Camp 501 at Le Coudray, near Chartres. On 19 August 1945, Raoul-Octove-Marie-Jean Harscou√´t, Bishop of Chartres, accompanied by his secretary Abb√© Pierre Andr√©, visited the POW seminary. Later, he visited the camp repeatedly and addressed the seminarians, always calling them \\"Mes chers enfants (My dear children). On 18 September 1945, Nuncio Roncalli (future Pope John XXIII), came for a longer visit at the camp and returned on 16 July 1946, declaring:  Post-war and death  From 1945 till 1947, Stock was managing director of the prisoner of war s√©minaire des barbel√©s of Chartres. On 14 May 1947, Cardinal Suhard of Paris visited the seminary, which was closed on 5 June 1947. While 949 lecturers, priests, brothers and seminarists had been at the seminary. When it was closed, only 369 were still there. On 16 December 1947, Stock received notification about his appointment as honorary doctor of the University of Freiburg, in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. He died unexpectedly on 24 February 1948 at the H√¥pital Cochin in Paris. Since he was still considered a POW, very few people were made aware of his death at the time.Ren√© Closset, L'Aumonier de l'enfer. / Er ging durch die H√∂lle.

The archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, celebrated Pontifical High Mass in the presence of many French and German bishops, and of Ren√© Monory, President of the French Senate and of Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, who, beforehand, had laid down a wreath on Stock's grave.Kohl honours German priest in France, BBC News, March 1, 1998 Information des Elysee: http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/interventions/lettres_et_messages/1998/fevrier/lettre_adressee_a_m_helmut_kohl_a_propos_de_sa_venue_a_chartres_pour_participer_a_la_messe_celebree_a_la_memoire_de_l_abbe_stock.106.html  Cause for canonization There is an ongoing effort to have Franz Stock declared to be a saint. One miracle, usually a permanent and total medically unexplainable cure clearly and directly attributable to his intercession (as judged by a panel of neutral doctors and medical esperts, and by another panel of lay and clerical philosophers and theologians, who give their opinion to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, to be further considered, and forwarded to the Pope), is needed for him to be beatified, and a subsequent second such miracle for his canonization as a Saint. Before he can be beatified, the Church must declare that he lived a holy and virtuous life (a Servant of God), and that he lived it heroically and publicly in a manner worthy of respect and universal veneration (be Venerable). =Commencement of the process= On 14 November 2009 the proceedings for Stock's beatification were opened in the Church St. John the Baptist in Arnsberg-Neheim, his birthplace. He was baptized in this church and celebrated his first Mass there. Many members of the congregation and many of his former companions took part in the service. The ceremony was presided over by the current Archbishop of Paderborn, Hans-Joseph Becker. With this step, Stock could be referred to as a Servant of God within the Catholic Church.

Overview  The amount of this attraction is known as \\"substantivity\\": the higher the substantivity the greater the attraction of the dye for the fiber. Substantive dyes work best on textiles with high contents of cellulose, such as cotton. In contrast to direct dyes, wool and leather goods are dyed by the process of ion exchange, exploiting the cationic nature of proteins near neutral pH. The development of substantive dyes helped make mordant dyes obsolete. Substantive dyes are set in a slightly basic or neutral environment at temperatures close to boiling point. They are set by formation of aggregates of dyes within interstices of the fibres. Aggregation is enhanced by extended aromatic rings.Klaus Hunger, Peter Mischke, Wolfgang Rieper, Roderich Raue, Klaus Kunde, Aloys Engel: \\"Azo Dyes\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim..

The majority built were conversions of the earlier Vickers Victoria. Design and development While the Napier Lion-powered Victoria served successfully with the RAF as a bomber transport, by 1932, the Lion engine was becoming obsolete and it was clear that it could use more power. It was therefore decided to re-engine the aircraft with more powerful Bristol Pegasus engines. It was decided to carry out a two-stage upgrade, with the first, designated the Victoria Mk VI or Configuration I, having a limited maximum weight. This was followed by Configuration 2 which was capable of taking full advantage of the greater power of the Pegasus engine by virtue of a strengthened airframe featuring a strengthened wing, strut rather than wire- braced landing gear, wheel brakes and a tailwheel in place of a skid. This became the Vickers Valentia Mk I which flew for the first time in 1934. Orders were placed for the 28 new build Valentias to Specification 30/34, with a further 54 being converted from Victorias (Type 278 within the company), with production continuing until 1936. In 1938 a version with Pegasus IIM3 engines (which offered improved 'hot and high' performance) was supplied for service with one flight of No. 31 Squadron then based in Lahore. Operational history The Valentia first entered service with No. 70 Squadron RAF at Hinaidi, Iraq in 1934, equipping British forces in India, Persia and Iraq. Like the preceding Vernons and Victorias, the Valentias were extensively used for transport operations in the Middle East, and when necessary used for bombing operations with bomb racks under the wings. Valentias were also experimentally fitted with loudspeakers used to address people being overflown (in this case potentially rebellious tribes during air policing duties). The Valentia was also used for experiments with aerial refuelling by Alan Cobham. Valentias were used for night bombing operations over the Western Desert in 1940 and remained in service with the Iraq and Persia Communications Flight until 1944. The South African Air Force pressed a Valentia into service as a bomber in the East African Campaign in 1940‚Äì41.

Early life James Dowling was born in London, England, the son of Vincent Dowling of Queen's County, Ireland, and brother of Alfred Septimus Dowling. Educated at St Paul's School, he later became a parliamentary reporter, studied law and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in May 1815. He edited the second edition of W. Paley's Law and Practice of Summary Convictions, and was also responsible for several volumes of Reports of Cases. Career Dowling applied to the Colonial Office for an appointment in June 1827 and on 6 August 1827 he was appointed third judge at Sydney, where he arrived in February 1828. He acted with consideration and tact over a question of precedence which immediately arose. Governor Ralph Darling held that the terms of his commission placed Dowling next in precedence to the chief justice, Francis Forbes, while John Stephen, the other judge, pointed out that in England such questions were decided by seniority. Dowling suggested that the matter should be referred to the home authorities, and that in the meantime Stephen should take precedence. The question was settled in favour of Stephen's view, and Dowling cheerfully accepted the position of junior judge. The state of Stephen's health, however, threw a good deal of work on the shoulders of Dowling, who also learned that in Sydney in those days a judge was constantly open to criticism. In June 1832 he found it necessary to defend his judgment in a particular case which had been criticized in letters printed in the Sydney Monitor, and was assured by Viscount Goderich that he would not permit himself \\"to entertain even a momentary impression to his prejudice\\". In December Stephen retired and Dowling became second judge. In January 1834 some remarks of Dowling's on the conduct of a criminal trial led to the three judges drawing up an important memorandum suggesting many possible improvements in dealing with criminal cases. In September 1835 Dowling was appointed acting Chief Justice during the absence of Forbes, who was on leave. William Westbrooke Burton, the third judge, objected to this on the ground that his previous appointment as a judge at the Cape of Good Hope made him senior to Dowling. Dowling was an appointed member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 19 April 1836 until 5 January 1843. In April 1837 Forbes retired from his office, and Dowling was appointed chief justice on 29 August 1837. John Walpole Willis arrived at Sydney in November 1837 to take the position of third judge; conflict between Willis and the Chief Justice reached such a level that for the sake of peace Governor Gipps transferred Willis to Melbourne in January 1841. Following the brutal killing of 28 unarmed Aboriginal Australians in the Myall Creek massacre on 10 June 1838, Dowling presided over the first trial in which a jury acquitted eleven colonists of the murder of one person, referred to as Daddy.R v Kilmeister (No 1) Dowling also sat in the Full Bench which determined questions of law following the conviction of seven colonists of the murder of two children and an adult referred to as Charley.. In June 1843 Dowling expressed his willingness to act as speaker of the new Legislative Council, but Gipps ruled against this as he considered it would not be in the public interest. In August 1844 Dowling was granted 18 months leave of absence due to a breakdown in his health, but he died soon after on 27 September 1844. Personal life He was knighted in 1837. He was married twice and was survived by his second wife, Lady Harriott Dowling, and two sons and two daughters from his first marriage. A pension of ¬£200 a year was granted to Lady Dowling. Lady Dowling was the eldest daughter of John Blaxland. At the time of his death, Dowling was preparing a volume of law reports of the decisions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The volume was eventually published in 2005. Many of these cases are also online. Dowling was regarded as a hard working judge, and rarely took holidays. One of his sons, James Sheen Dowling (1819‚Äì1902), was born in England and came to Australia with his father in 1828, practised as a barrister and was a District Court judge from 1858 to 1889 and an acting judge of the Supreme Court from 1878 to 1881.

The vessel was one of eleven of the . In January 1968, Minerve was lost with all hands in bad weather while returning to her home port of Toulon. Minerve sank two days after the submarine of the Israeli Navy disappeared in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus. Minerve was one of four submarines lost to unknown causes in 1968 along with the , the American , and Israeli submarine INS Dakar. After more than 50 years missing, the location of the wreck was discovered in 2019, south of Toulon. Description The Daphn√© class comprised second-class submarines, intermediate between the larger, ocean-going submarines of the Narval class and the small, specialised antisubmarine vessels of the . The design was a development of the Ar√©thuse class, and were required to keep the low noise levels and high manoeuvrability of the smaller submarines, while also keeping a small crew and being easy to maintain. Minerve had an overall length of , with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was surfaced and submerged. The submarine had diesel-electric propulsion, with two 12-cylinder SEMP Pielstick diesel engines rated at a total of and one electric motor, rated at , which drove two propeller shafts, giving a speed of on the surface and submerged. The ship's machinery and equipment were modular in order to ease maintenance. Range was at . The submarine was designed to dive to a depth of . Minerve was fitted with twelve torpedo tubes, with eight in the bow and four in the stern. No reload torpedoes were carried. The ship had a crew of 45, composed of six officers and 39 enlisted. Service history Minerve was ordered under the 1957 French Naval Estimates, was laid down in May 1958 at the Chantiers Dubigeon shipyard in Nantes, and launched on 31 May 1961. After a shakedown cruise to Londonderry Port, Bergen, and Gothenburg in November 1962, the submarine sailed from Cherbourg to Toulon, arriving on 22 December 1962. She was commissioned into the 1st Submarine Squadron on 10 June 1964. Minerve operated solely in the Mediterranean Sea. She was refitted at Missiessy Quay, Toulon, in 1967. Loss On 27 January 1968, at 07:55 CET, Minerve was travelling just beneath the surface of the Gulf of Lion using her snorkel, roughly from her base in Toulon, when she advised an accompanying Br√©guet Atlantic aircraft that she would be at her berth in about an hour. This proved to be the last time the boat and her crew of 6 officers and 46 enlistees made contact. She disappeared in waters between deep. Commander Philipe Bouillot later said that Minerves new captain, Lieutenant de vaisseau Andr√© Fauve, had spent 7,000 hours submerged over four years on submarines of the same class and never had a problem. The only factor known that could have caused her to sink was the weather, which was extremely bad at the time of her loss. The French Navy launched a search for the missing submarine, mobilizing numerous ships, including the aircraft carrier and the submersible under the supervision of Jacques Cousteau, but found nothing and the operation was called off on 2 February 1968. The search for Minerve, under the name Operation Reminer, continued into 1969 and used the submersible Archim√®de with the U.S. survey ship . Discovery In October 2018, Herv√© Fauve, the son of the last commander of Minerve, led families of the crew to ask for new research through the French media. The submarine was the only Western missing submarine which had not been found since the end of World War II. The French Government started a new search for Minerve on 4 July 2019 in deep waters about south of Toulon. The discovery of the location of the wreck was announced on 22 July 2019 by the company Ocean Infinity using the search ship . The wreck was found at a depth of , broken into three main pieces scattered over along the seabed. Although Minerves sail was destroyed, identifying the wreckage was possible, as the letters \\"MINE\\" and \\"S\\" (from Minerve and S647, respectively) were still readable on the hull. Memorial Admiral Jean-Louis Barbier and Victor Vescovo on Minerve dive 1 February 2020On the day of her discovery, 22 July 2019, Squadron Vice-Admiral Charles-Henri du Ch√©, responsible for the search, declared that the remains of the submarine would be left untouched and would become a maritime sanctuary. A ceremony is to be held in the location where Minerve vanished with the relatives of the submariners in attendance. The Department of Underwater Archaeological Research (DRASSM) is responsible for the study and protection of France's submerged heritage. This office, under the administration of the Ministry of Culture, organized dives on the Minerve wreck for both the French Navy and a memorial ceremony for the families of the crew.

It is commonly referred to as Taoist Breathing. It consists of expanding the abdomen while breathing out through the nose and then compressing it while inhaling through the mouth, which is the opposite of what an abdomen would do during natural, instinctive breathing.  Uses  The technique is also widely practiced in a number of martial arts. Some notable ones include Chinese systems such as Baguazhang, T'ai chi ch'uan and other styles of Kung Fu. Reverse Breathing is believed to activate healing and protective Chi as the practitioner is consciously controlling the breath in a way opposite to normal breathing. By expanding the abdomen while delivering some technique (e.g. punch), the martial artists also protect the inner organs from any received counterattack.  Effects and Benefits  There are many benefits to the practice of Reverse Breathing. The Livestrong article says that it is believed to help strengthen abdominal muscles because the practice requires that one uses their abdominal muscles in order to take in breath while shrinking their stomach. It is also believed to strengthen one's immune system by spreading oxygen throughout the body that creates an energy that can protect the body from viruses and negative bacteria. This Idea is known as Guardian Chi. According to the book, The Tao of Natural Breathing, Reverse Breathing can also improve energy levels by causing a change in pressure between the chest and the abdomen. It is also believed to increase one's lung capacity. Breathing in reverse to how the body naturally would, allows more air to enter one's lungs, which can help to train the lungs to take in more air. Reverse Breathing is also often practiced for the purpose of deepening a meditation or drawing energy into the body.

The study reported major worldwide declines in the number of armed conflicts, genocides, military coups, and international crises, as well as in the number of battle-related deaths per armed conflict. Three years in the making and launched in 2005, the report was produced at the Human Security Centre at the University of British Columbia's Liu Institute for Global Issues by the Human Security Report Project (HSRP), which moved in May 2007 to join Simon Fraser University's School for International Studies. The Human Security Report covers similar ground to the long-running Peace and Conflict series. According to the 2005 Report, the world saw a shift in global security after the end of the Cold War, with a 40% decrease in the number of armed conflicts being waged around the world since the early 1990s, and an 80% decrease of genocides between 1998 and 2001. Some critics have questioned the relevance of this data, noting that conflict and violence are still significant obstacles for human development, worldwide security, and sustainable peace. For example, a recent Human Development Report from the United Nations Development Programme agrees that the number of conflicts has declined in the last decade, but claims that the wars of the past 15 years have exterminated a larger number of human lives. The Human Security Report argues that there is no evidence to support such a contention. The Report claims that the average number of battle-related deaths per conflict has declined from some 38,000 in 1950 to less than 500 in 2007. Individual fatality tolls may well be inaccurate; the trends, however, are indisputable. There are no accurate data on the (much larger) number of people who die from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition, but the Report argues that there are good reasons for believing that these have declined as well. Some critics have argued that there was too much focus on battle-related \\"direct\\" deaths in the Report. However, an entire section discusses the large number of \\"indirect\\" deaths caused by war-exacerbated malnutrition and disease. In some cases, the Report says, the ratio of indirect to direct deaths is higher than 10:1. The Report argues that conflict-driven disease and malnutrition are greater threats to human security than bombs and bullets. But it also argues that indirect deaths have declined over the past 15 years, along with battle-related deaths. Indirect deaths‚Äìthe hidden cost of war‚Äìis one of the two main themes of the later Human Security Report 2009/2010. Indirect deaths are driven by the intensity and scope of political violence. The 2009/2010 Report argues that, since humanitarian assistance has increased on a per capita basis and since recent peacetime health interventions‚Äìprimarily immunization‚Äìreduce death tolls in wartime, it is highly likely that indirect deaths from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition have declined to a greater degree than have \\"direct\\" deaths from violent injuries. Since the 2005 Report appeared, the data on armed conflict trends, which comes from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, indicates that there has been a 25% increase in the overall number of conflicts in which a state is one of the warring parties, but that the number of high-intensity conflicts (those generating 1,000 or more battle deaths in a year) have continued to decline and are now some 68% lower than at the end of the Cold War.

Carbon dioxide usually behaves as a gas in air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), or as a solid called dry ice when cooled and/or pressurised sufficiently. If the temperature and pressure are both increased from STP to be at or above the critical point for carbon dioxide, it can adopt properties midway between a gas and a liquid. More specifically, it behaves as a supercritical fluid above its critical temperature () and critical pressure (), expanding to fill its container like a gas but with a density like that of a liquid. Supercritical is becoming an important commercial and industrial solvent due to its role in chemical extraction in addition to its low toxicity and environmental impact. The relatively low temperature of the process and the stability of also allows most compounds to be extracted with little damage or denaturing. In addition, the solubility of many extracted compounds in varies with pressure,Discovery - Can Chemistry Save The World? - BBC World Service permitting selective extractions. Applications =Solvent= Carbon dioxide is gaining popularity among coffee manufacturers looking to move away from classic decaffeinating solvents. s is forced through the green coffee beans which are then sprayed with water at high pressure to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated for resale (e.g. to the pharmaceutical or beverage manufacturers) by passing the water through activated charcoal filters or by distillation, crystallization or reverse osmosis. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to remove organochloride pesticides and metals from agricultural crops without adulterating the desired constituents from the plant matter in the herbal supplement industry.Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used as a more environmentally friendly solvent for dry cleaning over traditional solvents such as hydrocarbons, including perchloroethylene. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used as the extraction solvent for creation of essential oils and other herbal distillates. Its main advantages over solvents such as hexane and acetone in this process are that it is non-toxic and non- flammable. Furthermore, separation of the reaction components from the starting material is much simpler than with traditional organic solvents. The can evaporate into the air or be recycled by condensation into a cold recovery vessel. Its advantage over steam distillation is that it operates at a lower temperature, which can separate the plant waxes from the oils. In laboratories, s is used as an extraction solvent, for example for determining total recoverable hydrocarbons from soils, sediments, fly-ash and other media,U.S.EPA Method 3560 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Total Recoverable Hydrocarbons and determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil and solid wastes.U.S.EPA Method 3561 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Supercritical fluid extraction has been used in determining hydrocarbon components in water.Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories. TemaNord 2003:516. Processes that use s to produce micro and nano scale particles, often for pharmaceutical uses, are under development. The gas antisolvent process, rapid expansion of supercritical solutions and supercritical antisolvent precipitation (as well as several related methods) process a variety of substances into particles. Due to its ability to selectively dissolve organic compounds and assist the functioning of enzymes, s has been suggested as a potential solvent to support biological activity on Venus- or super-Earth-type planets. =Manufactured products= Environmentally beneficial, low-cost substitutes for rigid thermoplastic and fired ceramic are made using s as a chemical reagent. The s in these processes is reacted with the alkaline components of fully hardened hydraulic cement or gypsum plaster to form various carbonates. The primary byproduct is water. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used in the foaming of polymers. Supercritical carbon dioxide can saturate the polymer with solvent. Upon depressurization and heating the carbon dioxide rapidly expands, causing voids within the polymer matrix, i.e., creating a foam. Research is also ongoing at many universities in the production of microcellular foams using s. An electrochemical carboxylation of a para-isobutylbenzyl chloride to ibuprofen is promoted under s. =Working fluid= Supercritical is chemically stable, reliable, low-cost, non-toxic, non-flammable and readily available, making it a desirable candidate working fluid. Supercritical CO2 is used as the working fluid in high efficiency domestic water heat pumps. Manufactured and widely used, heat pumps are also commercially available for domestic and business heating and cooling. While some of the more common domestic water heat pumps remove heat from the space in which they are located, such as a basement or garage, the CO2 heat pump water heaters are typically located outside, where they remove heat from a building to the outside air. Power generation  The unique properties of s present advantages for closed-loop power generation and can be applied to various power generation applications. Power generation systems that use traditional air Brayton and steam Rankine cycles can be upgraded to s to increase efficiency and power output. The relatively new Allam power cycle uses sCO2 as the working fluid in combination with fuel and pure oxygen. The CO2 produced by combustion mixes with the sCO2 working fluid and a corresponding amount of pure CO2 must be removed from the process (for industrial use or sequestration). This process reduces atmospheric emissions to zero. It presents interesting properties that promise substantial improvements in system efficiency. Due to its high fluid density, s enables extremely compact and highly efficient turbomachinery. It can use simpler, single casing body designs while steam turbines require multiple turbine stages and associated casings, as well as additional inlet and outlet piping. The high density allows for highly compact, microchannel-based heat exchanger technology. In 2016, General Electric announced a super-critical based turbine that enabled a 50% efficiency of converting heat energy to electrical energy. In it the is heated to 700 ¬∞C. It requires less compression and allows heat transfer. It reaches full power in 2 minutes, whereas steam turbines need at least 30 minutes. The prototype generated 10 MW and is approximately 10% the size of a comparable steam turbine. Further, due to its superior thermal stability and non-flammability, direct heat exchange from high temperature sources is possible, permitting higher working fluid temperatures and therefore higher cycle efficiency. Unlike two-phase flow, the single-phase nature of s eliminates the necessity of a heat input for phase change that is required for the water to steam conversion, thereby also eliminating associated thermal fatigue and corrosion. Despite the promise of substantially higher efficiency and lower capital costs, the use of s presents material selection and design issues. Materials in power generation components must display resistance to damage caused by high-temperature, oxidation and creep. Candidate materials that meet these property and performance goals include incumbent alloys in power generation, such as nickel-based superalloys for turbomachinery components and austenitic stainless steels for piping. Components within s Brayton loops suffer from corrosion and erosion, specifically erosion in turbomachinery and recuperative heat exchanger components and intergranular corrosion and pitting in the piping. Testing has been conducted on candidate Ni-based alloys, austenitic steels, ferritic steels and ceramics for corrosion resistance in s cycles. The interest in these materials derive from their formation of protective surface oxide layers in the presence of carbon dioxide, however in most cases further evaluation of the reaction mechanics and corrosion/erosion kinetics and mechanisms is required, as none of the materials meet the necessary goals. Other  Work is underway to develop a s closed-cycle gas turbine to operate at temperatures near 550 ¬∞C. This would have implications for bulk thermal and nuclear generation of electricity, because the supercritical properties of carbon dioxide at above 500 ¬∞C and 20 MPa enable thermal efficiencies approaching 45 percent. This could increase the electrical power produced per unit of fuel required by 40 percent or more. Given the volume of carbon fuels used in producing electricity, the environmental impact of cycle efficiency increases would be significant.V. Dostal, M.J. Driscoll, P.

Supercritical heat pumps are commercially marketed in Asia.

Supercritical does not sterilize the media, because it does not kill the spores of microorganisms. Moreover, this process is gentle, as the morphology, ultrastructure and protein profiles of inactivated microbes are preserved. =Cleaning= Supercritical is used in certain industrial cleaning processes.

Presently he serves as a consultant in the petroleum, mining, airline, and shrimping industries.  Criticism  As Minister of Finance, Fonseca popularized the policy of growth economics, which proposes to develop Belize's economy through privatization of assets and encouraging foreign investments, which in turn is supposed to create jobs for Belizeans. Supporters argue that Growth Economics is behind Belize's consecutive gains in total growth; detractors say any benefits from growth economics only accrues to PUP interests and in reality Fonseca has damaged Belize's international reputation due to high debt and poor economic indicators.http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5484 Amandala editorial on growth economics and Belize's present troubles He has further been accused of practicing official corruption, granting favors to party supporters in return for shares in the profits.

He played Test cricket from 1928 to 1933, playing his last Test at the age of 50. He is the second-oldest Test cricketer. Life and career =Before World War I= Ironmonger was born in Pine Mountain, near Ipswich, Queensland, the youngest of ten children of a farmer. As a child, he lost the forefinger of his left hand (his bowling hand) in an industrial accident. He lived and worked on the family farm at Pine Mountain until he was 25.Max Bonnell, Dainty: The Bert Ironmonger Story, Cricketbooks.com.au, Mount Eliza, 2019, p. 25. He played for the Albert club in Ipswich for 15 years, taking well over 1000 wickets at an average of less than six runs each.Bonnell, p. 41. He only made his first-class debut for Queensland at the age of 27. After a few matches for Queensland he moved to Victoria in 1914, accepting a position offered by Hugh Trumble as professional bowler at the Melbourne Cricket Club.Bonnell, pp. 35‚Äì41. Thinking his age might tell against him ‚Äì he was 31 ‚Äì he gave his birth date as 1886, making him supposedly 27. The new date became his accepted birth date for the rest of his cricket career.Bonnell, p. 43. In his second match for Melbourne he took 9 for 30 against St Kilda, and was immediately selected to play for Victoria.Bonnell, p. 44. In the 1914-15 season he was the outstanding bowler in the Sheffield Shield, taking 32 wickets in Victoria's four matches at an average of 17.12, and Victoria won the competition. He was also the leading wicket-taker that season in the Melbourne competition, which his Melbourne club won in its first year in the competition.Bonnell, p. 48. =After World War I= Ironmonger resumed successfully after World War I but was hampered by injuries to his knees, and by his reputation as a poor batsman and fieldsman.Bonnell, p. 55‚Äì56. He was not selected for the Test team, but he went with the Australian team to New Zealand late in the 1920-21 season, made up of leading players who had not made the Test team. He took 45 wickets on the tour at 13.17, and made his highest first-class score of 36 not out, in less than 20 minutes, against Southland in Invercargill.Bonnell, p. 56‚Äì57. Shortly after the tour, on 14 May 1921, he married Bess Tierney at St Brigid's Church in North Fitzroy. They moved to Sydney, where he ran a pub in Balmain. He played for Balmain in the Sydney competition in 1921-22 and took 51 wickets, more than anyone else in the competition. However, the pub was not a success and late in 1922 the couple returned to Melbourne, where he opened a tobacconist's shop in St Kilda.Bonnell, pp. 59‚Äì61. However, he lost his stock in a burglary in 1923 and could not afford to re-stock and start again, so he took a position with St Kilda City Council maintaining the municipal parks and gardens, where he remained for the rest of his working life.Bonnell, pp. 69‚Äì71. Ironmonger joined the St Kilda club at the start of the 1922-23 season, along with another 40-year-old spin bowler, Don Blackie. They eventually played together for St Kilda for 12 years, during which time St Kilda won six premierships. When they retired, Ironmonger had taken 862 wickets in his grade cricket career in Melbourne, which is still the highest career tally for the competition, and Blackie had taken 802, which is still the second-highest tally.Bonnell, p. 63. After three seasons out of first-class cricket, Ironmonger returned to the Victorian side during the 1924-25 season. In his second match he took a hat-trick against the touring MCC while taking 5 for 93 off 39.5 eight-ball overs. The Victorian team toured New Zealand at the end of the season, but Ironmonger declined his invitation as he could not take the required time off work.Bonnell, p. 69. He did not re-establish his spot in the Victorian team until 1927-28, when he took 25 wickets in the Sheffield Shield at an average of 29.12 (Don Blackie took 31 at 22.22) and Victoria won the Shield. =Test career= Ironmonger's Test debut came in 1928-29 when he was 46. He played Test cricket until the age of 50, and first-class cricket until the age of 53. He is the fourth-oldest Test debutant and the second-oldest Test player. Unsurprisingly because of his age, his Test career spanned only 14 matches, during which he took 74 wickets at an average of 17.97. In that time though he achieved some outstanding results.

He was also the oldest-ever Test cricketer to take five-wicket haul as well as a 6fer in an innings of a Test match at the age of 49 years and 311 days. He, too, set the record for becoming the oldest Test cricketer to take 10 wickets in a Test match at the age of 49 years and 311 days. Ironmonger's contemporary, the Australian Test batsman and captain Vic Richardson, said of him: > I would say unhesitatingly that he stood head and shoulders above any other > left-hander, not even excepting Wilfred Rhodes. His ability to turn the ball > even on the smoothest shirt-front wickets ‚Äì wickets that break the heart and > reputation of most bowlers ‚Äì was amazing.

The release followed a dramatic television appearance in which his son, accompanied by a family lawyer and a priest, accepted the kidnappers' terms unconditionally. At the family's request, the police did not intervene, giving rise to fears that the huge ransom would encourage more kidnappings, and adding to concerns about Mexico's stability. In 1996, authorities claimed to have recovered nearly $10 million of the Harp ransom. In 2008, Harp attended the funeral of Fernando Mart√≠, 14-year-old son of the founder of a chain of sporting goods stores, who had been kidnapped and murdered, despite his family's payment of a ransom.

Design and development The Victoria was a twin-engined biplane transport with a conventional landing gear with a tailskid. The design mated a similar fuselage of the earlier Vernon transport with the wing of the Virginia bomber, which was developed in parallel. It was also powered by two Napier Lion engines. The enclosed cabin had room for 24 troops on collapsible canvas seats arranged along the sides of the fuselage. In April 1921 two prototypes were ordered by the Air Ministry to Specification 5/20. The first prototype, allocated serial number J6860, was built as a Type 56 and designated a Victoria I, the second J6861 was built as a Type 81 Victoria II. The Type 56 had two Napier Lion engines with large frontal radiators and were fitted directly onto the lower mainplanes, the fuel tanks were placed under the inboard section of the bottom mainplane. The prototype J6860 first flew from Brooklands, Surrey on 22 September 1922. The Type 81 flew in January 1923, and initially differed only in having the fuel tanks under the top mainplane. It was later modified by replacing the flat sided engine cowling with more streamlined nacelles with the radiators between the undercarriage legs, as fitted in the Virginia II bomber. In March 1925, it was decided to place an order for 15 production aircraft. By this time, the Virginia design had evolved to incorporate swept-back wings, and the production Victoria IIIs incorporated this change. Another improvement first introduced in the Virginia was the introduction of metal structures instead of the all-wooden airframes of the early aircraft, with an order being placed for a prototype Victoria with a metal structure (serial number J9250) in September 1927, this being delivered in October 1928. The metal airframe proved much more suitable for the hot and humid areas where the Victoria served, with Victoria IV and Vs with metal structures produced by conversion and new production respectively. The final version was the Mark VI, which substituted modern, more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines for the Napier Lions. The Vickers Valentia was a further improved version with a stronger structure, capable of operating at higher weights. 97 Victorias were built, many of which were later converted into Valentias. Operational history Deliveries of the Victoria III started on 23 February 1926, with the type replacing Vernons and Vimys with 70 Squadron in Iraq and 216 Squadron in Egypt that year. Eight Victorias of 70 Squadron played an important part in the Kabul Airlift of November 1928‚ÄìFebruary 1929, when in severe winter conditions, RAF aircraft evacuated diplomatic staff and their dependents together with members of the Afghan royal family endangered by a civil war. Victorias were used to ferry troops to potential trouble spots including both in Iraq and elsewhere, flying reinforcements to Palestine in 1929 and Jordan in 1930 and from Egypt to Cyprus in 1931.. The Victorias of the two operational squadrons also made a number of long range training flights, such as return trips from Cairo to Aden in 1931, and helped to pioneer air routes for Imperial Airways' Handley Page HP.42 airliners. One Victoria was used as a blind flying trainer by the Central Flying School, being fitted with two sets of controls and instruments in a blanked off cabin. The Victoria continued in service until 1935, although many were converted to Valentias, which remained in use until well into the Second World War.

Japan‚ÄìRussia relations (, Rossiysko-yaponskiye otnosheniya; , Nichiro kankeishi) or Japanese‚ÄìRussian relations refers to the bilateral international relations between Japan and the Russian Federation. Relations between Russia and Japan are the continuation of the relationship of Japan with the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991, and with the Russian Empire from 1855 to 1917. Historically, the two countries had cordial relations until a clash of territorial ambitions in the Manchuria region of northeastern China led to the Russo‚ÄìJapanese War in 1904, ending in a Japanese victory which contributed to the weakening of the monarchy in Russia. Japan would later intervene in the Russian Civil War from 1918 until 1922, sending troops to the Russian Far East and Siberia. That was followed by border conflicts between the new Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan throughout the 1930s. The two countries signed a nonaggression pact in 1941, although the Soviet government declared war on Japan anyway in August 1945, invading the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo as well as seizing the Kuril chain of islands just north of Japan. The two countries ended their formal state of war with the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Joint Declaration of 1956, but as of May 2020 have not resolved this territorial dispute over ownership of the Kurils.Majumdar, Dave (12 December 2017). Could Russia and Japan Finally Settle Their Island Dispute?. The National Interest. Retrieved 15 December 2017. A 2018 opinion poll published by the Russian Levada Center shows that 61% of Russians have a favorable view of Japan, with 20% expressing a negative opinion. According to a 2017 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 64% of Japanese people view Russia unfavorably, compared with 26% who viewed it favorably. People ages 50 and older are much less likely to hold a favorable view of Russia (16%) than those 18 to 29 (53%). Nonetheless, the Japanese government sees Russia as an important partner for security and counterbalancing China and North Korea in the region. Because of this, since the start of the Ukrainian Crisis and the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Japan has continued to engage with Russia in spite of sanctions against the country by Japan's Western allies.Brown, James D.

Russian diplomat Nikolai Rezanov was commissioned by Alexander I as Russian ambassador to Japan to conclude a commercial treaty, but his efforts were thwarted by the Japanese government. =Tsarist era (1855‚Äì1917)= Diplomatic and commercial relations between the two empires were established from 1855 onwards. Japan and Russia participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China. Relations were minimal before 1855, mostly friendly from 1855 to the early 1890s, then turned hostile over the status of Korea. The two nations contested control of Manchuria and Korea, leading to Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. Russia began construction of the Trans--Siberian railroad, which for the first time gave it easy access to Siberia and adjacent areas. Meanwhile, Japan's defeat of China in 1894-95 Sino-Japanese war demonstrated Japan's military modernization, and its quest for control of Korea. Russia and Japan both were making inroads into Chinese territories, especially in Manchuria. both were blocked from moving south of Manchuria by the strength of British and American resistance. Relations were good 1905‚Äì1917, as the two countries divided up Manchuria and Outer Mongolia.Victor A.

Dates indicate the year that Japan gained control of the territory. Relations between the Communist takeover in 1917 and the collapse of Communism in 1991 tended to be hostile. Japan had sent troops to counter the Bolshevik presence in Russia's Far East during the Russian Civil War, but left without any gains. The two were in opposite camps during World War II and the Cold War. In addition, territorial conflicts over the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin were a constant source of tension. Harriet L. Moore, Soviet Far Eastern Policy, 1931-1945 (Princeton UP, 1945). online Strains in Japan‚ÄìSoviet Union relations have deep historical roots, going back to the competition of the Japanese and Russian empires for dominance in Northeast Asia. The Soviet government refused to sign the 1951 peace treaty and the state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan technically existed until 1956, when it was ended by the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Joint Declaration of 1956. A formal peace treaty still has not been signed. The main stumbling block to improving relations between the Soviet Union and Japan in the post-war period has been the territorial dispute over the Kurils, which are known as the Northern Territories in Japan.Kimie Hara, Japanese-Soviet/Russian Relations since 1945: A Difficult Peace (1998) online =Early post-Soviet era (1991‚Äì1999)= By the late 1990s, the Russian leadership began to pivot from West to East, considering improving relations with Japan as part of this effort, and viewed Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's position as an opportunity. President Boris Yeltsin met with Prime Minister Hashimoto in Krasnoyarsk on 1 November 1997, where he proposed to solve the territorial problem with a peace treaty by 2000. Yeltsin also asked Hashimoto to consider financial assistance to Russia to the measure of $3 or $4 billion. Hashimoto also promoted the idea of increasing economic cooperation, which was called the Hashimoto‚ÄìYeltsin plan. In mid-April 1998, the Kanawa summit between the two leaders included Hashimoto making a proposal of having the four disputed Kuril islands coming under Japanese sovereignty. Yeltsin made a public statement about it and that he was considering accepting it, which prompted the Russian government and media to unite against this. By the autumn of 1998, the proposal had died after so much opposition in Russia, and Hashimoto was out of office after the July 1998 parliamentary election. Nonetheless about $1.5 billion of the World Bank/IMF loan to Russia came from Japan. A meeting in November 1998 between Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and Yeltsin in Moscow took place, where Russia proposed to give Japan special status over the islands jointly with Russia as transitory legal regime. The Japanese side was cautious to the proposal and by 1999 there was a stalemate on the territorial question, while the economic initiatives stalled in their implementation.Rozman, Gilbert, and Togo, Kazuhiko (2006). Russian Strategic Thought toward Asia. Springer. . pp. 91‚Äì95. On July 30, 1998, the newly elected Japanese prime minister Keiz≈ç Obuchi had focused on major issues: signing a peace treaty with Russia, and renewing the Japanese economy. However, he died soon afterwards. =Current relations (1999‚Äìpresent)= Vladimir Putin and Junichiro Koizumi in 2003 at the APEC Summit In March 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea, Japan imposed several sanctions against Russia, which included halting consultations on easing the visa regulations between the two countries and suspension of talks on investment cooperation, joint space exploration and prevention of dangerous military activity.

Ceylonite, named for the island of Ceylon, is a ferroan spinel with Mg:Fe from 3:1 and 1:1, and little or no ferric iron. Pleonaste is named from the Greek for 'abundant,' for its many crystal forms, and is distinguished chemically by low Mg:Fe ratios of approximately 1:3. It is sometimes used as a gemstone.Precious stones and gems, their history and distinguishing characteristics By Edwin William Streeter, p.33-34 Composition The mineral ceylonite has the chemical composition of (Mg, Fe2+) Al2O4, putting it into a group of minerals known as the spinels, or the oxide spinels. The oxide spinels have a formula of the model [A][B]2O4; where [A] is commonly Fe2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, and [B] is Fe3+, Al3+, or Cr3+. Structure Ceylonite has the structural formula [A]Al2O4, where [A] cation is Mg2+ or Fe2+. This formula creates a face centered cubic Bravais lattice, with a space group of Fd3m. The point symmetry can be three possibilities; 4*3m, 3*m, or mm. Within the oxygen sub-lattice of ceylonite, the Mg2+ ions occupy tetrahedral 4c symmetry positions, and the Al3+ ions occupy octahedral 8f site. This allows for the remaining octahedral site to be open for defects, causing a variety in structure and physical properties. Ceylonite can actually undergo a solid solution series in which the composition changes, but it is still ceylonite. Magnesium rich ceylonite can undergo an increase in iron that will replace the magnesium cation in the A-block, therefore making the new composition Fe2+Al2O4. The chemistry changes, but the mineral technically remains ceylonite. Occurrence The ceylonite first discovered on the island of Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka, was found imbedded in calcareous spar, and accompanied by pyrite and micas. The crystals were located in a low lying dried up river, and were relatively shallow in the soil; 8 to 10 inches. On one side of the bank a mass of gneiss was exposed, on the other, a graphic granite vein. The grains in the first discovered ceylonite looked of compacted soils, leading one to believe they were perhaps sedimentary in formation. This was an early hypothesis, and did not hold true after further analysis. The Mg-ceylonite has a much more reliable study of its geological occurrence. It is found in Mg and Al rich igneous rocks, as well as, metamorphic rock. Like many rocks and mineral, ceylonite is weathered and can be found in sedimentary rocks. History Ceylonite and pleonaste are historical terms in mineralogy. Nevertheless, both terms are used in the current mineralogical literature.

In 1892, missionaries were sent to Togo, a small country in west Africa. The Togo mission was particularly fruitful, for 15 years later the Holy See had appointed an Apostolic prefect. The Society‚Äôs third mission was to German New Guinea, (the northern half of present-day Papua New Guinea). A mission was also opened in Paraguay.\\"The Story of Our Founder, Saint Arnold Janssen\\", Adoration Sisters In the 20th century the Society further expanded, opening communities in Australia,L.

Botswana (Gaborone, Gumare and Ghanzi); Brazil; Canada (Quebec and Ontario); South Africa (Phalaborwa, Polokwane and Pretoria); the United States of America (Appalachia and Illinois); and Zambia (Kabwe, Livingstone, and Lusaka). Additional European communities were established in Austria (Bischofshofen near Salzburg and Vienna); the Netherlands (Tegelen); Rome; the United Kingdom and in the Silesian area in Poland (where Fr. Miros≈Çaw PiƒÖtkowski invented in 1994 a new devotion, the Chaplet of the Holy Spirit and His Seven Gifts). Present day Many religious orders and congregations have certain characteristics or traits that make them known. The Divine Word Missionaries are recognised by what are called the four characteristic dimensions: the Bible, Mission Animation, Communication, Justice and Peace and Integrity of Creation (JPIC).\\"Characteristic Dimensions\\", The Australian Province of the Divine Word Missionaries With regards to the missions, what makes the SVD unique from many missionary institutes is that mission areas or regions are not the sole responsibility of individual provinces, but of the whole Society. The SVD generalate may appoint members from any country to any other country with priority given to those places which are most in need. This also explains why many SVD communities are international in character. The SVD has two sister congregations, also founded by Saint Arnold Janssen. They are the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit (SSpS), otherwise known as the \\"Blue Sisters\\" and a contemplative branch called the Sister Servants of the Holy Spirit of Perpetual Adoration (SSpSAP) or better known as the \\"Pink Sisters\\"; the nicknames allude to the colour of the respective religious habits. Vows As members of a religious institute the Missionaries of the Divine Word embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity means more than abstaining from sexual activity and its purpose is to make the religious totally available for service; it is also a sign that only God can completely fill the human heart. For a member of a religious congregation, obedience is not slavishly doing what one is told by the superior but being attentive to God‚Äôs will by prayerfully listening to the voice of the person in charge. Ultimately, these vows are lived out within a community and bolstered by a relationship with God. Religious formation In the initial stages, those interested in joining the congregation have several meetings with an SVD priest, usually with visits to a community. During this time the members of the congregation share what it is like to be a priest, or a religious brother. Those who are enquiring about entering the congregation are strongly encouraged to attend Mass as often as possible, to read the Sacred Scriptures especially the Gospel accounts and to regularly spend time in prayer in order to better discern their vocation. =Pre-novitiate= This is a yearlong experience of living in an SVD community, sharing in many aspects of the life of the congregation. \\"The goal of the Pre-novitiate is to enable the student to experience religious missionary life in community, deepen his own understanding of vocation and continue the initial learning about the SVD, its charism, its origins, history and mission.\\"Australian Province: Pre-novitiate During this time the candidates participate in the prayer life of a community, share more deeply with others and become involved in one of more of the congregation‚Äôs apostolates. Essentially, it is an extended period of discernment for the postulants and an opportunity for the congregation to assess the strengths of the candidates and possible areas requiring growth. =Novitiate= Next follows the novitiate which is the time for preparing to take the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then ‚Äú‚Ä¶that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.‚ÄùCode of Canon Law 646 > ‚ÄùThe Novitiate provides a special time and environment for the nurturing of > a growing vocation; it does not give birth to the vocation. The Novitiate > builds upon what is already under way in a person's life. It serves to > mature and clarify a vocation in accordance with the religious life style > and the special charism of the Society.‚ÄùAustralian Province: novitiate Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth. A simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Society, for > ‚ÄúBy religious profession, members assume the observance of the three > evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the > ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the > rights and duties defined by law.‚ÄùCode of Canon Law 654 =Post-novitiate= After the novitiate, the new members of the congregation continue their studies. For those preparing for Holy Orders this normally involves a 4-year theology degree. In the United States students attend Catholic Theological Union.US Province: Theologate In Australia, studies are taken at the Melbourne College of Divinity after which students are strongly encouraged to spend a year in a foreign mission before proceeding to ordination. Australian Province: Formation Filipino students attend the Society‚Äôs own Divine Word Seminary in Tagaytay. Final vows are taken immediately before ordination to the diaconate which is followed by ordination to the Priesthood between six months and a year later. In Indonesia students attend St. Paul Major Seminary-Ledalero. Those whose vocation is to the brotherhood pursue studies which are suited to developing their talents and interests. The Society is conscious that some regard brothers as being lower than priests and, in response, it states: > ‚ÄúReligious Brothers, by their life and ministry play a prophetic role in the > Society and in the Church. They remind us all of the common dignity and > fundamental Brotherhood of Christians: \\"You are all Brothers,\\" (Matthew > 23:8.) Furthermore, Brothers keep alive the sense of authentic communion in > our communities and our unity in diversity, which is expressed by their > being consecrated laymen who live together with clerical confreres. (SVD > Constitutions,104) Missionary work is not tied to ordination. Hence, we > should keep in mind that Brothers make a great and equal contribution to > mission through their professional work, social services and pastoral > ministry. As non-ordained missionaries, brothers are able reach out to the > laity, especially to faith-seekers and people of other religious traditions. > Together with ordained confreres they bring fullness to the \\"Missio Dei\\" in > contemporary world.‚ÄùAustralian Province: Brothers Vows are renewed annually; after three years a member may request final vows. According to Canon law, temporary vows may be renewed for a longer period but not exceeding nine years.Canon 657.2  Britain and Ireland  The Society came to Britain in 1931 and to Ireland in 1939. St. Richards College in Birmingham became its seminary and boarding school. In Ireland Donamon Castle, Co. Roscommon became its noviciate and philosophy school, in 1980 its students moved to Maynooth College.

Botswana  In a departure from the traditional sources of income used by many religious congregations which run schools, hospitals and retreat centres, the Divine Word Missionaries who are citizens of Botswana, in collaboration with professional lay people, run \\"Catholic Safaris\\".Catholic Safaris - missionary self-reliance project Botswana - Africa - Catholic Mission The idea was to run a safari with a Catholic perspective and aims to support the local ventures, creating also job opportunities and income for the families.

In 1932 the German SVD missionary Joseph Reiners (1874-1945) founded Nanzan High School in Nagoya. In 1946, the Nanzan College of Foreign Studies was established, which comprised an English Department and Chinese Department, with German and French Departments added in the following year. Nanzan University was formed in 1949. The Faculty of Literature comprised English, French, German and Chinese Departments.Welcome to Nanzan 2012 In addition to the schools run by The Society in Japan, many priests serve as pastors in local Churches in Nagoya, Nagasaki, Akita and Niigata Prefectures, and in Tokyo. The current Archbishop of Tokyo, Bishop Isao Kikuchi, and the Bishop-Elect of the Diocese of Niigata in Northeast Japan, Fr. Daisuke Narui, are members of the Society of the Divine Word. The Philippines In the Philippines, the Divine Word Missionaries arrived in Bangued, Abra, in 1909, founding schools in Bangued, Vigan, in Ilocos Sur and Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, as well as in other parts of the Philippines. Now there are about 500 Filipino SVD priests and brothers and around 150 of them are serving in overseas missions on all continents. In the Philippines, the SVD have three ecclesiastical provinces, namely: the Philippine North (PHN) that comprises missionary works of Pangasinan to Aparri; the Philippine Central (PHC) that covers the National Capital Region, and all the provinces comprising central Luzon, southern Tagalog and the whole Bicol region; and the Philippine South (PHS) whose ministries cover the Visayas and Mindanao Islands. Saint Jude Catholic School, a school in Manila near Malaca√±an Palace, is an SVD school. The congregation opened Christ the King Mission Seminary in 1934 in Quezon City for their Filipino applicants and from then on their numbers continued to increase eventually making the SVD the largest religious institute of men in the country. =Philippine Southern Province= The SVD Philippine Southern Province works on three areas: formation, education and pastoral ministries. In formation, young candidates for the priesthood are trained in the Divine Word Formation Center in Davao City while seminarians for brotherhood are formed in the Freinademetz Formation House in Cebu City. In education, the SVDs run the University of San Carlos in Cebu City; Holy Name University in Tagbilaran City, Bohol; and the defunct Liceo del Verbo Divino (formerly Divine Word University) of Tacloban City, Leyte. In pastoral ministries, the SVDs have one parish in Cebu City, five parishes in Surigao del Norte, six in Agusan del Sur and two in Zamboanga, Sibugay, and Olutanga Island. They manage radio stations, the Steyler Canteen, Catholic Trade Cebu, Inc., and a retreat house. They also work in cooperatives, adopted communities, and depressed areas and dialogue with faith seekers and other religions. Their vision statement is as follows: > \\"We, members of the Society of the Divine Word (SVD), an international > religious-missionary congregation of brothers and priests, founded by Saint > Arnold Janssen and named after the Divine Word, envision a world where > dialogue is possible because people, inspired by the Word of God and > empowered by the Spirit, respect the uniqueness of each person and accept > all nations and peoples.\\"Philippines Southern Province: About us United States In 1905 the Divine Word Missionaries began work in African American parishes in Mississippi and the first seminary for the training of African American men for the Roman Catholic priesthood was opened in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi shortly after. Divine Word Missionary priests have long worked in African American communities in Louisiana, Arkansaw, and Mississippi, in Chicago, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. Numerous African Americans have joined the Society of the Divine Word as priests and brothers and have served as foreign missionaries throughout the world.SVD, Southern Province of St. Augustine The Western USA Province has converted their former seminary into a retreat center.\\"Ministries\\", SVD, Western Province USA SVD Saints * Arnold Janssen (canonized on 5 October 2003) * Joseph Freinademetz (canonized on 5 October 2003) See also * List of SVD Missions * List of SVD Schools * Ralph M.

Design and development Work on the Virginia was started in 1920, as a replacement for the Vimy. Two prototypes were ordered on 13 January 1921 and another two prototypes were ordered in September 1922.Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly May 1993, p. 25. The Virginia was similar to the Vimy but notably had a lowered front gunner's pulpit to allow the pilot a greater field of view, 20 ft (6 m) greater wingspan and a 9 ft (3 m) longer fuselage. The aircraft was powered by twin Napier Lion engines and flew for the first time on 24 November 1922.Andrews and Morgan 1989, p. 131. At the Aircraft Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath, the Virginia prototype underwent type trials. One of the first modifications was to replace the original two-bladed propellers with four-bladed propellers. An unusual set of \\"fighting top\\" turrets were added to the top wings, but these were later deleted from production aircraft.Sturvivant 1985, p. 849. Marks I‚ÄìVI had straight wings and the Mark VII introduced swept outer wings. Starting with the Mark III the Virginia mounted a rear fuselage gunner, who was moved into a tail turret in the Mark VII. The Mark X was introduced in late 1924 and featured a duralumin and steel structure covered in fabric, aluminium, and wood. A total of 124 Virginias were built, of which 50 were Mark Xs. Operational history The first squadron of Virginia Mark Is was formed in 1924. Despite mediocre performance, the aircraft served frontline units until 1938, when it was replaced by the newer Wellingtons, Hampdens and Whitleys. Designs such as the Fairey Hendon and Handley Page Heyford supplemented rather than replaced the Virginia. The final almost all-metal Virginia Mark X was the most numerous RAF bomber until the Heyford in 1934. After its technical obsolescence as a bomber it was used for photography and for parachute training, with jump platforms installed behind the engine nacelles. On 26 June 1940, a committee discussing the need for airborne cannon for use against invading tanks suggested equipping Virginias with the equally antiquated COW 37 mm gun (1.46 in Coventry Ordnance Works gun). This was not acted on. In the 1930s, the Virginias were used in some of the first tests of inflight refueling, although they were never used outside of tests. The Virginia was developed in parallel with the Vickers Victoria freighter and the two aircraft had much in common, sharing the same wing design. The Virginias were highly accident prone, with 81 losses. Despite their obsolescence, Virginias continued to soldier on in support roles with the Parachute Test Flight at Henlow until December 1941.

It initially appeared in a limited numbered edition of 250, all signed by the author and published by Shuman's.Noon Wine : Lot 2279 It later appeared in 1939 as part of Pale Horse, Pale Rider (), a collection of three short novels by the author, including the title story and \\"Old Mortality.\\" A dark tragedy about a farmer's futile act of homicide that leads to his own suicide, the story takes place on a small dairy farm in southern Texas during the 1890s. It has been filmed twice for television, in 1966 and 1985. While Noon Wine and its companion pieces, \\"Old Mortality\\" and \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" have been described as novellas, Porter referred to them as short novels. Porter, in the preface \\"Go Little Book . . \\" to The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter, abjured the word \\"novella,\\" calling it a \\"slack, boneless, affected word that we do not need to describe anything.\\" She went on to say, \\"Please call my works by their right names. We have four that cover every division: short stories, long stories, short novels, novels.\\" Plot summary Royal Earle Thompson owns a dairy farm in southern Texas during the late 1890s. His farm is fairly unproductive, due in part to Thompson's laziness and distaste for most of the required labor on a dairy farm, which he considers \\"women's work.\\" Thompson lives with his wife, Ellie, and two small sons, Arthur and Herbert. Ellie is continually ill, though she does her best to perform her domestic duties around the farm. The two boys, aged about six and eight when the story opens, are generally well-behaved. One day, a man named Olaf Helton presents himself at the farm. The remarkably taciturn Swede asks Farmer Thompson for a job. Thompson agrees to employ Helton, offering him a small monthly wage, plus room and board. It is clear that Thompson views Helton as somewhat beneath him because he is a foreigner. Even though the wage is far below what Helton reports having earned in the wheat fields of North Dakota, he nonetheless sets to work immediately and proves himself to be an efficient farmhand, single-handedly transforming Thompson's run-down dairy farm into a productive, profitable enterprise. Though he is unable to figure out anything about Helton's personal life or origins, Thompson grows to appreciate his mysterious, silent farmhand. He increases his pay and entrusts him with much responsibility. Ellie also values Helton for the prosperity he brings to the farm. She is troubled by him just once, in a bizarre event in which she sees Helton silently shake her two boys in a terrifying manner after they had snatched his harmonica. She asks her husband to tell Helton that in the future he is to leave the discipline of the boys to their parents. The family quickly moves past the event. Nine years go by, and the Thompson dairy farm thrives, thanks to Helton's incomparable work ethic. The Thompsons come to view Helton as one of the family; his traits of rarely speaking, never smiling, and continually playing the same song on his precious harmonica are oddities, once puzzling, that they simply accept. One day, an offensive and irritating stranger named Homer T. Hatch shows up at the farm. Like Helton, he has come to Texas from North Dakota, and says he is there to \\"locate\\" Helton. The man annoys Farmer Thompson immediately with his grating banter and subtle insults. Hatch eventually reveals the reason for his visit: he is a bounty hunter, and Olaf Helton is an escaped mental patient who must be returned to the asylum. Many years earlier, Helton killed his only brother with a pitchfork after he lost one of Helton's harmonicas and refused to replace it. Thompson is stunned by this news and unwilling to give up Helton to Hatch, whom he instinctively feels is an evil man. Thompson has a vision of Hatch driving a knife blade into Helton's stomach. The farmer rushes to Helton's defense, striking Hatch with an axe blade and killing him. Ellie comes on the scene only in time to see Hatch lying on the ground and Helton running away (unaccountably, in view of what Thompson \\"saw\\"), and she faints. The fleeing Helton, in the midst of an apparent \\"mad\\" episode, such as he had never exhibited while with the Thompsons, is killed by the sheriff's men. When found, Helton's body bears no mark of a knife. It appears (though what happened is never explained) that Hatch's attack on Helton was merely Thompson's hallucination. Thompson impresses on Ellie the importance of her swearing that she witnessed Hatch attacking Helton, and she reluctantly agrees. After a perfunctory trial, Thompson is acquitted on the ground of self-defense/defense of another. Thompson continues to relive the killing, at one moment sure that there must have been a way to get Hatch off his farm without harming him, at the next certain that he had no choice and that if the scene were playing before his eyes again, he would instinctively act as he did before. Worse, he is sure that though he is legally \\"not guilty,\\" the community regards him as not innocent, and fears that he has become an outcast. He decides to pay a visit on every household of the small farming community, accompanied by the unwilling Ellie, in an attempt to regain his reputation. His efforts are unsuccessful; both he and Ellie can see that they have lost the esteem of their neighbors and former friends. In a climactic scene at home, Thompson realizes that even his wife is afraid of him and that their now nearly grown sons no longer trust him with her. He decides that he must end his ruined life. Dressed in his best, Thompson leaves the house and walks as far as he can while still on his land. He writes a note of explanation, saying that he never intended to harm Hatch, even though Hatch deserved to die; still, he is sorry that he had to be the one to kill him. Poignantly, Thompson puts no blame on Helton, observing that had Hatch come hunting him instead of Helton, his friend would have done the same for him. Thompson then shoots himself with his shotgun. Major characters in Noon Wine *Royal Earle Thompson *Ellie Thompson *Arthur Thompson *Herbert Thompson *Olaf Eric Helton *Homer T. Hatch  Major themes  Literary scholars view the tragic events in Noon Wine as an allusion to the Greek structure of dramatic tragedy, in which a hero suffers a terrible fate caused by his/her own self [needs citation]. Critics also view the character of Homer T. Hatch as Thompson's doppelganger, interpreting the conflict between them as a psychological battle between warring aspects of Thompson's personality. Hatch seems to reflect darker aspects of Thompson's mind, distorting and accentuating them in a manner that is unbearable to Thompson. Radio and relevision adaptations = Radio, 1948 = An hour long adaptation was produced as one of the first episodes of the 1948 radio series NBC University Theatre. The drama starred Beulah Bondi and John Beal as the Thompsons and was instrumental in the series winning a Peabody Award that year. = Television, 1966 = Sam Peckinpah directed the original adaptation for ABC, and the project became an hour-long presentation for ABC Stage 67, premiering on Nov. 23, 1966. The film featured Jason Robards, Olivia de Havilland and Theodore Bikel. At the time, Peckinpah was a Hollywood outcast following the troubled production Major Dundee (1965) and his firing from the set of The Cincinnati Kid (1965). He caught a lucky break when producer Daniel Melnick needed a writer and director to adapt Porter's short novel for television. Melnick was a big fan of Peckinpah's television series The Westerner and his 1962 film Ride the High Country, and had heard the director had been unfairly fired from The Cincinnati Kid. Against the objections of many within the industry, Melnick hired Peckinpah and gave him free rein. Peckinpah completed the script, which Miss Porter enthusiastically endorsed. The television film was a critical hit, with Peckinpah nominated by the Writers Guild for Best Television Adaptation and the Directors Guild of America for Best Television Direction. Robards would keep a personal copy of the film in his private collection for years as he considered the project to be one of his most satisfying professional experiences. A rare film, which, for almost half a century, could only be viewed at the Library of Congress and the Museum of Broadcasting, Noon Wine finally reached home viewers in the summer of 2014 via limited Blu-ray release on the Twilight Time label.\\"Untitled Document\\". Screen Archives Entertainment.

Peckinpah's adaptation of Noon Wine is today considered one of the director's most intimate works, revealing his dramatic potential and artistic depth. The film's unexpected success laid the groundwork for his professional comeback. Following one additional television assignment, one feature film script sold (for Buzz Kulik's Villa Rides), and a brief teaching engagement at UCLA, Peckinpah was eventually hired by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, shortly thereafter directing his breakthrough film The Wild Bunch (1969). Peckinpah would again work with Daniel Melnick on the 1971 film Straw Dogs. = Television, 1985 = The novel was adapted again in 1985 as a television film for American Playhouse on PBS. The Western-Drama starred Fred Ward, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Pat Hingle, Lise Hilboldt, Jon Cryer and Roberts Blossom. It was written and directed by Michael Fields and produced by James Ivory.

In the traditional meaning of the term, as used in Unix System V and Solaris, a LWP runs in user space on top of a single kernel thread and shares its address space and system resources with other LWPs within the same process. Multiple user-level threads, managed by a thread library, can be placed on top of one or many LWPs - allowing multitasking to be done at the user level, which can have some performance benefits. In some operating systems there is no separate LWP layer between kernel threads and user threads. This means that user threads are implemented directly on top of kernel threads. In those contexts, the term \\"light-weight process\\" typically refers to kernel threads and the term \\"threads\\" can refer to user threads. On Linux, user threads are implemented by allowing certain processes to share resources, which sometimes leads to these processes to be called \\"light weight processes\\". Similarly, in SunOS version 4 onwards (prior to Solaris) \\"light weight process\\" referred to user threads. Kernel threads Kernel threads are handled entirely by the kernel. They need not be associated with a process; a kernel can create them whenever it needs to perform a particular task. Kernel threads cannot execute in user mode. LWPs (in systems where they are a separate layer) bind to kernel threads and provide a user-level context. This includes a link to the shared resources of the process to which the LWP belongs. When a LWP is suspended, it needs to store its user-level registers until it resumes, and the underlying kernel thread must also store its own kernel-level registers. Performance LWPs are slower and more expensive to create than user threads. Whenever an LWP is created a system call must first be made to create a corresponding kernel thread, causing a switch to kernel mode. These mode switches would typically involve copying parameters between kernel and user space, also the kernel may need to have extra steps to verify the parameters to check for invalid behavior. A context switch between LWPs means that the LWP that is being pre-empted has to save its registers, then go into kernel mode for the kernel thread to save its registers, and the LWP that is being scheduled must restore the kernel and user registers separately also. For this reason, some user level thread libraries allow multiple user threads to be implemented on top of LWPs. User threads can be created, destroyed, synchronized and switched between entirely in user space without system calls and switches into kernel mode. This provides a significant performance improvement in thread creation time and context switches. However, there are difficulties in implementing a user level thread scheduler that works well together with the kernel. Scheduler activation While the user threading library will schedule user threads, the kernel will schedule the underlying LWPs. Without coordination between the kernel and the thread library the kernel can make sub-optimal scheduling decisions. Further, it is possible for cases of deadlock to occur when user threads distributed over several LWPs try to acquire the same resources that are used by another user thread that is not currently running. One solution to this problem is scheduler activation. This is a method for the kernel and the thread library to cooperate. The kernel notifies the thread library's scheduler about certain events (such as when a thread is about to block) and the thread library can make a decision on what action to take. The notification call from the kernel is called an \\"upcall\\". A user level library has no control over the underlying mechanism, it only receives notifications from the kernel and schedules user threads onto available LWPs, not processors. The kernel's scheduler then decides how to schedule the LWPs onto the processors. This means that LWPs can be seen by the thread library as \\"virtual processors\\". Supporting operating systems Solaris has implemented a separate LWP layer since version 2.2. Prior to version 9, Solaris allowed a many-to-many mapping between LWPs and user threads. However, this was retired due to the complexities it introduced and performance improvements to the kernel scheduler. UNIX System V and its modern derivatives IRIX, SCO OpenServer, HP-UX and IBM AIX allow a many-to-many mapping between user threads and LWPs.

Siege of Copenhagen (1535-1536), woodcarving by Hermann Hamelmann (1903) Coat of arms of Count Christopher of Oldenburg Biography Christopher was the third son of Count Johan XIV of Oldenburg and Countess Anna of Anhalt- Zerbst. He was the grandson of Gerhard of Oldenburg who was a brother of King Christian I of Denmark. As a young man he was educated a clergyman but probably because of economic problems he later on chose a military career participating in wars in Germany. He stayed in Cologne from 1517 to 1524 with small interruptions, where he closely examined the Reformation leaning of Count Hermann of Wied, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He was described an \\"intellectual condottiere\\" possessing a classic Greek knowledge but apparently no great military talent. As a second cousin of both Christian II and Christian III he took interest in Scandinavian politics. When the civil war broke out in Denmark 1534 after the death of Frederick I Christopher, who had converted to Protestantism, was hired by L√ºbeck as the military leader of the alliance of Danish commoners, L√ºbeck and Protestants against Christian III and the Danish nobility. The formal purpose of this alliance was the restoration of Christian II. Christopher's own zeal seems to have been on behalf of the Danish crown. After a promising start in which he became the master of Zealand and Scania with the title of a regent and conquered Funen, he had severe setbacks and quarrelled with his allies. Furthermore, L√ºbeck involved Albrecht VII of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow in the alliance offering him the Danish crown which created jealousy between the two war lords. Christian III's conquest of both Jutland and Funen and the defection of Scania meant the breakdown of Christopher's position and he was besieged in Copenhagen 1535‚Äì36 together with his rival Albrecht until their capitulation.

Before becoming High Priest, he served as the head of the doctrinal department of Nichiren Shoshu and as such was involved in the compilation of many of the school's publications. As High Priest, Abe affirmed the expulsion of Soka Gakkai on 28 November 1991 and was known for the overall restoration of Head Temple Taisekiji to traditional and orthodox practices that were prevalent up to 1970. He was instrumental in founding new temples and propagation centers outside Japan well into his final years in office. He retired as High Priest on 15 December 2005 and was succeeded by Hayase Nichinyo Shonin. Abe died on 20 September 2019 in his private residence in Nakamachi street, in Setagaya ward of Tokyo, aged 96. Early life Born Shinobu (‰ø°Â§´), Abe was the first son of H≈çun Abe, then the chief priest of J≈çzen-ji in Sumida, Tokyo, and later 60th Nichiren Shoshu High Priest Nichikai. His mother, Myoshuni, was a female priest. He entered the priesthood in 1928 by tonsure, taking the Buddhist name Shinno (‰ø°ÈõÑ). He graduated from Rissho University in 1943, training as a priest. After his return from duty with the Japanese Imperial Navy, he served as chief priest of three temples: # Hongy≈çji (Sumida ward, Tokyo, 1947) # Heianji (Kyoto, 1963) where his mother was a resident priest # J≈çsenji (Sumida ward, Tokyo) He was appointed head of the school's Ky≈çgakubu (office of doctrinal orthodoxy, often rendered Taisekiji Study Department) in 1961. In this position, he was one of the two Nichiren Shoshu priests who traveled overseas to conduct the first initiation rites (Gojukai) for new believers outside Japan in 1961, for which the 66th high priest gave him the name \\"Etsuyo\\" (Ë∂äÊ¥ã: \\"he who crosses the seas\\"). Abe was named Nichiren Shoshu S≈çkan (the school's second-highest ranking priest) in early 1979. Period as High Priest On 22 July 1979, Abe took over as high priest, shortly after the death of the 66th High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi. At that time, he changed his name three times: he initially changed his name to Nichi-g≈ç (the name beginning with Nichi that all priests have but use publicly after certain seniority) from Nichiji (Êó•ÊÖà) to finally Nikken (Êó•È°ï) in deference to a more-senior priest who was father of the current high priest, Nichinyo. A rendered image of the Dai Gohonzon mandala transcribed by Nikken Abe. On 4 December 2005, Abe announced his intention to step down as high priest before the end of the year. He performed the ceremony of transferral of the Heritage of the Law on 12 December 2005, in which he appointed Nichinyo Hayase (1935‚Äî) his successor. He officially retired on 15 December 2005, four days before his 83rd birthday, after 26 years as high priest. Sixty-eighth High Priest Nichinyo Sh≈çnin ascended to the high priest's seat at a ceremony on 16 December 2005. Abe had a wife, Masako Abe, and a son born in 1944, Shinsho Abe. Abe's tenure as high priest was marked by a mixture of progress and controversy. He officiated several milestone celebrations, including: * 1981 ‚ÄîThe 700th anniversary of Nichiren's passing. * 1982 ‚Äî The 650th anniversaries of the passing of Taiseki-ji's founder Nikk≈ç and his successor Nichimoku * 1990 ‚Äî The 700th anniversary of Taiseki-ji's founding * 2004 ‚Äî The 750th anniversary of Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings In addition, Abe oversaw the compilation and publication of several important works, including compilations of previous high priests' letters, treatises, and sermons, and official biographies of Nichiren and his successors. * 1981 ‚Äî Nichiren Daish≈çnin Sh≈çden * 1982 ‚Äî Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin Sh≈çden * 1999 ‚Äî Revision of 1978 Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Y≈çgi (a comprehensive overview of Nichiren Shoshu doctrine) * 1994 ‚Äî Heisei Shimpen Nichiren Daish≈çnin Gosho, a new compilation of Nichiren Daishonin's Gosho based on thorough historical and documentary surveys. Abe also initiated and oversaw the publication of the following important Taisekiji publications: * The annotated edition of 26th High Priest Nichikan's doctrinally definitive work Rokkansh≈ç (\\"The six volume writings\\" in 1996) * A revised edition of the Lotus Sutra with its prologue and epilogue sutras (Shimpen My≈çh≈çrengeky≈ç Narabini Kaiketsu in 1998) * The compilation of Nichikan's Gosho Mondan in 2000 * High Priest Nichikan's exegesis on 14 of Nichiren's most important writings (Nichikan Sh≈çnin Gosho Mondan, 2001) * The publication of Jury≈çhon Sepp≈ç in 2003, a compilation of sermons he delivered over a span of 23 years on the ‚ÄúLife Span of the Thus Come One‚Äù (Jury≈ç) chapter of the Lotus Sutra. In December 1980, Abe's succession to the position of high priest was challenged by a group of Nichiren Shoshu priests belonging to the Shoshinkai after he excommunicated five of them for disobeying repeated admonitions to cancel a massive anti-Soka Gakkai rally (August 1980) and to stop attacking Soka Gakkai, a lay organization formerly chartered by Nichiren Shoshu from their temple pulpits. Ultimately, Abe excommunicated over 200 Nichiren Shoshu priests who had aligned themselves with Shoshinkai, which balked at Abe's policy of reconciliation with Soka Gakkai after a conflict with the group that had surfaced in the early 1970s and lasted through the end of the decade. Abe worked to restore the Nichiren Shoshu faith to what he saw as orthodoxy that he felt had been lost during the school's association with Soka Gakkai. These reforms began with changing back the start of Ushitora Gongyo, a prayer service for the worldwide propagation of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, from 12:00 midnight to its traditional time starting at 2:30 am so the service would span the eponymous \\"hour of the ox (ushi) and tiger (tora)\\". Abe eventually excommunicated Soka Gakkai and its senior leaders in November 1991, citing doctrinal deviations, Soka Gakkai's usurpation of rites such as the Higan-e equinox ceremonies and funerals without Nichiren Shoshu priests officiating, its defiant staging of Ode to Joy concerts that, for their Christian themes, were incongruent with Nichiren Shoshu doctrine, and a speech (which became public when a recording was leaked) by then Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda in which Ikeda made vulgar and demeaning statements about the priesthood. These actions by Soka Gakkai were interpreted by the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood as retaliation for the priesthood's admonitions urging the Soka Gakkai leadership to follow through on earlier commitments to uphold Nichiren Shoshu doctrine and traditions, which many in the priesthood and traditional lay organizations felt Soka Gakkai had been ignoring or furtively undermining since the death of the earlier Soka Gakkai and Hokkeko leader Josei Toda. Since its 1992 excommunication, Soka Gakkai has adopted an accusation leveled by the Shoshinkai that Abe is a pretender to the high priest's position, on grounds that Abe was unable to substantiate proof his predecessor, High Priest Nittatsu Shonin, had transferred the position to him in the traditional ceremonial manner. Abe also left his personal mark on the grounds of Nichiren Shoshu Head Temple Taiseki-ji. He had numerous old lodging temples rebuilt and parts of the compound re-landscaped. In conjunction with some of the anniversary celebrations mentioned above, he had a bare-concrete building removed and a plaza and garden built in its place, as well as several quickly-built concrete lodgings replaced with two modern structures. After Nichiren Shoshu's excommunication of Soka Gakkai, he also had demolished several ferro-concrete edifices donated by Soka Gakkai, replacing them with buildings more in keeping with the atmosphere of a traditional Japanese Buddhist temple. To Soka Gakkai this was highly controversial considering that the buildings were built with donations from Soka Gakkai members. After the excommunication of Soka Gakkai, Abe founded numerous temples overseas (the last temple he founded was the Kaimyo-in Temple in Singapore in December 2005) and minor propagation centers in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America as well as Europe and North America. He also frequently visited them personally despite his advanced age. Expulsion of the Soka Gakkai Soka Gakkai further attributes Abe's motivation for demolishing the Shohondo building (completed in 1972), the Dai Kyakuden (1964), and other buildings in the Taiseki-ji compound donated by Soka Gakkai, to resentment towards and jealousy of Soka Gakkai's leadership and to a desire to usurp the achievements of his predecessor. Abe's demolition of the Shohondo building was particularly controversial. Its construction was completed in 1972 largely through the efforts and financial donations of Soka Gakkai members, and it was regarded as a notable work of contemporary Japanese architecture.Buddhism in America, Seager R H, Columbia University Press, 2000, p.83 In response, Nichiren Shoshu stated that the official petitioner of the Shohondo, Daisaku Ikeda, was no longer a Nichiren Shoshu believer, and that therefore a structure donated by him was no longer worthy of serving as the head temple's high sanctuary, the building housing the Dai-Gohonzon, the school's most sacred object. In addition, Abe personally oversaw the transfer of the Dai-Gohonzon from the Shohondo to Taisekiji's Hoanden, the building that housed it during construction of the Hoando, its new home. Additional views claim that Abe's decision to expel Soka Gakkai was part of a personal vendetta against Ikeda due to the following issues: * The deliberate manufacturing of several wooden Gohonzons that Ikeda had made without the consent of previous High Priest Nittatsu Shonin * The consistent officiation by Soka Gakkai leaders of Nichiren Shoshu ceremonies without the presence of priests * The 35th Soka Gakkai anniversary speech in which Daisaku Ikeda made vulgar statements insulting the dignity of the priesthood However, Nichiren Shoshu insists that the issue behind the demolition of the Shohondo and the subsequent erection on the same site of a new high sanctuary, the Hoando, was a necessary step in establishing a building based on correct orthodox faith in Nichiren Shoshu. Soka Gakkai vehemently rejects these charges, claiming that it is Abe who has deviated from the doctrines of Nichiren Shoshu. It further alleges that Abe himself is personally corrupt and that his motive for excommunicating Soka Gakkai was to bolster his personal power over believers. The Soka Gakkai leadership has been consistently scathing in its criticism of Abe in particular and the priesthood in general, claiming accusations of simony, sexual hedonism, monopolizing the Dai-Gohonzon, and claims based on the extant notes of a senior priest, Jitoku Kawabe (1929‚Äî2002), alleging that Abe was aware that the Dai-Gohonzon was not authentic. Later years Abe was one of the few high priest in Nichiren Shoshu's history, after Nikko shonin (1246-1333), to reach 80 years of age while actively serving in the position. By the time he retired about midway through his 27th year, he had reconfigured Head Temple Taiseki-ji in a manner more congruent with tradition and restored a number of ceremonies to their traditional times and formats. In the view of Hokkeko believers, Nikken Abe ensured that Nichiren Shoshu doctrine would be communicated to believers without reinterpretations of convenience. He also survived attempts against efforts from three breakaway groups, beginning with Kenshokai in 1974, followed by Shoshinkai in 1980, and ultimately by Soka Gakkai, which was expelled in 1991. In later years Abe continued to participate in the Gokaihi ceremonies (direct audiences with the Dai-Gohonzon) in both November and April, the most important months in the Nichiren Shoshu calendar. He died in his private residence in Nakamachi district of Setagaya ward in Tokyo on 20 September 2019, aged 96.ÈòøÈÉ®Êó•È°ïÊ∞èÊ≠ªÂéª(Êó•ËìÆÊ≠£ÂÆóÂâçÊ≥ï‰∏ª„ÄÅÂâçÁÆ°Èï∑) His body was briefly exhibited in the Kyakuden for international believers and thereafter his cremated remains are interred in the Buddhist stupa no. 67 at the burial cemetery grounds of Taisekiji.

They include mitomycin A, mitomycin B, and mitomycin C. When the name mitomycin occurs alone, it usually refers to mitomycin C, its international nonproprietary name. Mitomycin C is used as a medicine for treating various disorders associated with the growth and spread of cells.  Biosynthesis  In general, the biosynthesis of all mitomycins proceeds via combination of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), D-glucosamine, and carbamoyl phosphate, to form the mitosane core, followed by specific tailoring steps. The key intermediate, AHBA, is a common precursor to other anticancer drugs, such as rifamycin and ansamycin. Specifically, the biosynthesis begins with the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) with a yet undiscovered enzyme, which is then ammoniated to give 4-amino-3-deoxy-D-arabino heptulosonic acid-7-phosphate (aminoDHAP). Next, DHQ synthase catalyzes a ring closure to give 4-amino3-dehydroquinate (aminoDHQ), which then undergoes a double oxidation via aminoDHQ dehydratase to give 4-amino-dehydroshikimate (aminoDHS). The key intermediate, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), is made via aromatization by AHBA synthase. 700px Synthesis of the key intermediate, 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid. The mitosane core is synthesized as shown below via condensation of AHBA and D-glucosamine, although no specific enzyme has been characterized that mediates this transformation. Once this condensation has occurred, the mitosane core is tailored by a variety of enzymes. Both the sequence and the identity of these steps are yet to be determined. *Complete reduction of C-6 ‚Äì Likely via F420-dependent tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) reductase and H4MPT:CoM methyltransferase *Hydroxylation of C-5, C-7 (followed by transamination), and C-9a. ‚Äì Likely via cytochrome P450 monooxygenase or benzoate hydroxylase *O-Methylation at C-9a ‚Äì Likely via SAM dependent methyltransferase *Oxidation at C-5 and C8 ‚Äì Unknown *Intramolecular amination to form aziridine ‚Äì Unknown *Carbamoylation at C-10 ‚Äì Carbamoyl transferase, with carbamoyl phosphate (C4P) being derived from L-citrulline or L-arginine 700px Biological effects In the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, mitomycin C induces competence for transformation. Natural transformation is a process of DNA transfer between cells, and is regarded as a form of bacterial sexual interaction. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, exposure to mitomycin C increases recombination during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, mutant strains defective in genes necessary for recombination during meiosis and mitosis are hypersensitive to killing by mitomycin C. Medicinal uses and research Mitomycin C has been shown to have activity against stationary phase persisters caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a factor in lyme disease. Mitomycin C is used to treat symptoms of pancreatic and stomach cancer, and is under clinical research for its potential to treat gastrointestinal strictures, wound healing from glaucoma surgery, corneal excimer laser surgery and endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.

It is 28 miles (45 km) long, rising at Hirst Hill in Lanarkshire near Shotts and running through West Lothian, draining into the Firth of Forth at Cramond, Edinburgh. The name Almond/Amon is simply old Celtic for \\"river\\".History of Livingstone, William F Hendrie The river has a good example of an ox-bow lake near Almondvale West at Livingston. Environment Running through what were, for much of the 20th century, areas dominated by heavy industry and shale and coal mining, the River Almond has been notorious for its high levels of pollution. With the demise of mining and heavy industry in Central Scotland the river is now relatively clean and is being actively repopulated by wildlife, including a healthy population of brown trout and improving runs of both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (Salmo trutta). There is a good array of birds to be seen around the river banks, including dippers, kingfishers and grey herons, with increasing numbers of otters being reported. The river is still the primary means of transporting southern West Lothian's waste water to the sea. While the introduction of a number of water treatment plants have helped to mitigate the effects of pollution, the river still suffers from high levels of detergent pollution along with run-off from agricultural land. This has led to the river often having a distinct \\"chemical odour\\". This is most noticeable within Almondell and Calderwood Country Park, where there is a major outfall from the nearby East Calder treatment plant. River route The river begins its journey in Shotts Lanarkshire and runs towards and through the centre of Livingston before travelling through Almondell and Calderwood Country Park where it picks up the Calder and Murieston Waters. It then passes over a weir which supplies a feeder culvert which carries water into the Union Canal. Due to the height difference where the river passes under the canal, this feeder must run for several miles eastwards before reaching the canal. By following paths through the country park and along private land to the east it is possible to follow the river and feeder all the way to the Union Canal. The river then flows east under the Almond Aqueduct of the Union Canal before turning northwards towards the Firth of Forth. Fishing on the lower Almond is leased from the Crown Estate by Cramond Angling Club, with both Day and Season Tickets available. The mouth of the Almond at Cramond formerly had a small passenger ferry. In 1997 the ferryman discovered the Cramond Lioness, a Roman- era sculpture, in the mud of the river bed. The sculpture is now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Riverside landmarks Illieston Castle is on the river, near the Almond Aqueduct. The Stewart kings James II and James IV are said to have had a hunting lodge at Illieston. The present three-storey house is probably of late 16th century or early 17th century date. It was purchased by John Ellis, an advocate in Edinburgh, around 1663. He added a Renaissance gateway inscribed with his initials and the date 1665. Later it became the property of the Earl of Hopetoun. It is now a private house. The industrial heritage of central Scotland can be observed along the length of the river with numerous weirs, remains of mills and other riverside industries of the past.

The club was established in 1878 and joined the Scottish Football League. They played at several different grounds before making the Royal Gymnasium Ground their long-term home. However, after having to sell it in 1943, the club was dissolved. History =Early years= The club was originally the Third Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers ‚Äîlike Third Lanark, it was a team linked to the territorial movement of the Victorian era‚Äî who had been inspired to set up a football team after watching an exhibition match between Queen's Park and Clydesdale. Buying a ball at Percival King's sports shop in Lothian Street, they formed a club at the British League of Abstainers' office in February 1874. The club took its name from St Bernard's Well, a local landmark on the Water of Leith Originally the club played at The Meadows along with Heart of Midlothian and later also Hibernian, before moving to their own ground, firstly at Powburn Park in Newington and then to John Hope's Park in Stockbridge, where its close proximity to the then playing fields of Edinburgh Academy helped them gain a following. Those in charge of the Third Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers began to see the club as a distraction, and this resulted in the club divorcing itself from the regiment in 1878, as James Dunn and George Heathcote rechristened the club \\"St Bernard's\\" (with an apostrophe) after the famous St Bernard's Well sitting on the banks of the Water of Leith nearby, and which formed the badge of the club. =Joining The Gymmie= In 1880 the club transferred to the grounds of the Royal Patent Gymnasium Grounds, affectionately known as the 'Gymmie'. First built in 1864 to cater for the growing Victorian passion for healthy recreation, the Gymnasium's centrepiece was a giant rotary boat seating up to 60 rowers, although it also provided equipment for stilts, quoits and bowls, and even ice-skating in winter. When one of Saints' founding members, William Lapsley, took over as proprietor of the Gymnasium he opted to allow Saint Bernard's exclusive use of its football pitch. Lapsley was made Honorary President of Saints, and became the driving financial force behind the club. However, the ground proved too cramped for spectators and players alike, and St Bernard's played their games first at Powderhall from 1883 (later the ground for Leith Athletic), and then to nearby New Logie Green in 1889 (which had also been used before by Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian). After a year back at Powderhall in 1900, they returned to the Royal Gymnasium by 1901. =Entry into the Scottish League= The club was involved in the discussions that led to the formation of the Scottish Football League (SFL) in 1890. The club did not play in the 1890‚Äì91 Scottish Football League season, however, as they were not elected into membership by the other clubs. In September 1890, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) expelled St Bernard's from membership for concealed professionalism. Undaunted, the club members immediately formed another club called \\"Edinburgh Saints\\" and arranged to play a friendly against Renton. The SFA refused permission for the match to proceed, but the clubs went ahead regardless. This challenged the authority of the SFA, who expelled the two clubs from membership and suspended their players for the rest of the 1890‚Äì91 season. After a year of playing exhibition matches all over Britain they were allowed to rejoin the SFA in 1892 and played in the non-league Scottish Alliance. A year later, St Bernard's applied to join the SFL and were admitted to the First Division. Remarkably, St Bernard's finished their first season in the SFL in third place, thrashing St Mirren 8‚Äì0 and beating both Hearts and Rangers in their own grounds in the process. =Scottish Cup Winners in 1895's 'Edinburgh Slam'= Come the summer of 1895, all three Edinburgh clubs were enjoying what was at that point their finest hours. Heart of Midlothian won the Scottish League for the first time, the resurrected Hibernian had won the Second Division and promotion, whilst St Bernard's had won the Scottish Cup ‚Äî beating Hearts in the semi-final replay before going on to beat a very young Renton side (only two of their players were over 20 years old) in the final 2‚Äì1 at Ibrox on 20 April 1895. Strangely, it was Honorary President William Lapsley (who'd insisted that the team drank from the St Bernard's Well before going to the match) rather than club captain George Murdoch who collected and lifted the trophy before the 12,000 strong crowd ‚Äî a larger one greeting the team when they returned to Edinburgh's Waverley Station later that day. Their only other cup successes of note thereafter were winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1908 and 1915. =Eclipse= However, despite the excellent facilities the Gymnasium provided for training, the dominance of Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian in the city was already beginning to tell. St Bernard's had a notably smaller band of regular followers, although some Hearts and Hibs fans would elect to go to a St Bernard's match if their own favourites were playing away. Their lower gates meant less money for wages, and so they were unable to prevent English clubs snapping up their best players. When the club reached the cup semi-final in 1896, losing 1‚Äì0 to Hearts, just five of the cup winning team were left in the line-up. Ironically, St Bernard's went on to host the 1896 Scottish Cup Final. With the other finalist being Hibernian, the SFA allowed the match to be played at New Logie Green, the only time the Scottish Cup Final has been held outside Glasgow. In 1900, the club was relegated to the Second Division after losing a test match to St Mirren. Although St Bernard's won the Second Division at the first attempt, they were not elected to the First Division by the other clubs. The decisive disaster for the club came in 1903, when their financial benefactor William Lapsley was killed when his cab crashed after the horse bolted. In 1907 they won the Second Division again, but failed to gain election once again. In 1915, the club finished joint top once more along with Cowdenbeath and Leith Athletic, but again lost out in two test matches (neither of whom were promoted in any case). =The post war years= In 1916, the club was mothballed as the Royal Gymnasium was used by the War Department, when they were given it back the pitch was destroyed and the ground damaged: it took until 1922 and a protracted legal battle for inadequate compensation to be paid, and not until 15 November 1924 that the Royal Gymnasium was fit to play in again. In the meantime, the club took over Old Logie Green from Leith Athletic. Furthermore, the Scottish League refused initially to have them back. Joining the rebel \\"Central League\\" (made up of other debarred sides or those objecting to the lack of automatic promotion/relegation between the two divisions), St Bernard's became part of the new Second Division when the Scottish League capitulated to its rival in 1921. Much of the credit for St Bernard's resurrection during this period must go to Tom \\"Brandon\\" Ross, who doubled as trainer & groundsman, and was the winner of the annual Powderhall New Year Sprint at the remarkable age of 46. But there also came unexpected help from Heart of Midlothian, who allowed St Bernard's to play at Tynecastle during this time. In 1931, a former Hearts player even donated maroon socks for the club's kit! During the Depression, St Bernard's showed remarkable innovation in providing unemployed players with jobs whether in the Royal Gymnasium or with firms owned by the company's directors: resulting in them gaining talent that otherwise may have gone elsewhere or left football altogether. In 1928, they gained the remarkable goalkeeping talent of Edinburgh University Divinity student Leonard Small. Nicknamed \\"The Holy Goalie\\", he was later forced to give up the game by Church authorities: in later years he was appointed an OBE and became Moderator of the Church of Scotland in 1966. =The final years= Just as St Bernard's shared a similar genesis to that of Third Lanark, there were a number of similarities in the years leading up to the clubs' demise. In 1934‚Äì35, although still in the Second Division, St Bernard's had become a force to be reckoned with by bucking against the trend in football and concentrating on attacking football. Although this came at the expense of losing goals, it provided an exciting (and thus crowd drawing) spectacle ‚Äî an idea later used successfully by George \\"Corky\\" Young at Third Lanark in the 1960s. St Bernard's missed promotion by only three points, but scored 100 goals in the process ‚Äî a feat they were to repeat the next two seasons as well. In 1938 they reached the Scottish Cup semi finals, losing to eventual winners East Fife after a second replay. There was a crowd of 35,264 at Tynecastle Park ‚Äî the largest ever attendance to watch a St Bernard's match. When the Second World War began, the Scottish League was reorganised into regional leagues. At first this suited St Bernard's as they were able to enjoy matches with local rivals Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian. However, the league was shut down at the behest of Aberdeen when it was decided to put Hearts and Hibs into the same region as Celtic and Rangers. When the Eastern league was resurrected in 1942, both St Bernard's and Leith Athletic were barred from 1943 after a poor season. Their last match was on 16 May 1942, a 3‚Äì2 home defeat to East Fife. With no league to play in, it was decided to \\"mothball\\" the club until the war's close, as many other Scottish clubs had done at this time. Disaster however stuck when one of the directors ‚Äî a coal merchant called Cooper ‚Äî died later that year, and the Executors of his Will demanded the immediate repayment of a loan he'd given the club. With no means of income, the club was forced to sell the only asset it had ‚Äî the Royal Gymnasium ground ‚Äî leaving St Bernard's destitute. The club was entered for the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1946 ‚Äì a gambit Abercorn had adopted under similar circumstances in 1920 ‚Äì but the game never took place. The club sold their 1,200 seater stand to Leith Athletic. St Bernard's hoped that they would be allowed to play at their ground until they could find themselves a new venue, but once the stand was acquired Leith Athletic promptly refused. The St Bernard's Supporters Club started a successful boys club in 1947, but all other attempts to resurrect the club failed, and in 1951 the St Bernard's Supporters Club voted to disband and its funds to be used to provide an annual competition ‚Äî the St Bernard's Cup ‚Äî for local primary schools in the Edinburgh area. Both the St Bernard's Cup and the St Bernard's Boys Club continue to this day, there has also been forays by St Bernard's into running sides in various local amateur leagues. In the 2017/18 season, the Saturday amateur team won the East of Scotland cup, one of the most prestigious trophies in the amateur game. Colours The team played in a number of kits, including all blue, white with blue shorts, the \\"Rosebery\\" colours (pink and gold hoops), and blue and white hoops. The current boys and amateur club use all four for each of their teams.

Sun believed that the KMT needed to train more Chinese revolutionaries.

These students were elites chosen from the membership of both the CPC and KMT. The main missions of this university were to educate students in Marxism and Leninism, as well as training cadres for mass movement as qualified Bolsheviks. Coursework Students and lecturers of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. Moscow Region, 1926 Most of the instructors came from the Soviet Union. Among them were old Bolsheviks such as Karl Radek, who was the first president of the university. The students came from different classes and backgrounds: some were famous communist revolutionaries or scholars, while others had little education but much experience in communist movements. The university grouped these students into different classes according to their education and experience. The courses given at the university focused on the basic theories of Marxism and Leninism. Students also learned methods of mobilization and propaganda, as well as theoretical and practical military instruction. In addition to courses, there were regular presentations on the international communist movements and the Chinese revolution by prominent members from Comintern, the Soviet Union and the CPC. Those included Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Zhang Guotao and Xiang Zhongfa. Although courses of study only lasted two years, the university had great influence on those trained there. Many who studied there went on to play leadership roles in China, including some of the 28 Bolsheviks, Zuo Quan, Wu Xiuquan, He Zhonghan, Deng Wenyi, Ji Chaoding, and both Deng Xiaoping, future leader of the People's Republic of China and Chiang Ching-kuo, future president of the Republic of China in Taiwan. Political change and closure Students of Sun Yat-sen Communist university of the Toilers of China In 1927, as the CPC-KMT alliance broke up, the students from the KMT were sent back to China. As the power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky reached its peak, Radek was sacked and replaced by his deputy, Pavel Mif, who was too ambitious to be limited to a university campus. Mif himself became the vice director of the Far East Department of the Comintern and played an important role in the major decisions of the CPC. With his 28 Bolsheviks holding senior positions in the CPC, Mif and the university played a major role in China's modern history. Its final rector was Vladimir Veger. The university was closed in the mid-1930s due to the failure of the alliance with the KMT.

He is student of Leo T√∂rnqvist, the creator of the T√∂rnqvist index. Research on Index Numbers Vartia is best known for his 1983 paper in Econometrica, Efficient Methods of Measuring Welfare Change and Compensated Income in Terms of Ordinary Demand Functions. It explains a numerical technique for solving a system of demand equations to derive the underlying utility function, i.e. for \\"calculating exact consumer welfare assuming the consumer faces a linear budget constraint\\". This is important because it greatly facilitates the measurement of changes in welfare, a major part of the work of economists.Applied Welfare Economics, edited by Richard E. Just et al, Edward Elgar Publishing More generally, Vartia's expertise is axiomatic index numbers, where he is known for his \\"consistency in aggregation\\" test and his discovery, along with Kazuo Sato of the \\"ideal log-change index\\", which utilised logarithms and logarithmic mean to define the Sato-Vartia or \\"Vartia II\\" index (both 1976). He proposed also in his dissertation \\"Relative Changes and Index Numbers\\" in 1976 another index known as Montgomery-Vartia (or \\"Vartia I\\") index, which satisfies Time and Factor Reversal Tests and is Consistent in Aggregation. But it satisfies only a weaker form of Proportionality Test WPT along with, say, the factor antithesis FA(T√∂rnqvist) of the T√∂rnqvist index. According to WPT, if both prices and quantities change proportionally, the price index must equal the common factor of proportionality. Montgomery-Vartia index was proposed independently in another notation by Montgomery in 1937.

History  The original concept for the Lead Guitar series, including the name lead came from Dennis Handa, then Marketing director for Fender Guitars. The idea was to have a guitar that was cheaper than the Stratocaster and be attractive to players because of the neck feel as well as the pickup options. The smaller headstock and the neck were both patterned after earlier Fender necks. Originally Steve Morse of the Dixie Dregs was the first endorser of the guitar and premiered it at a NAMM Show show in Atlanta Georgia. The Lead Guitars were manufactured between 1979 and 1982 by the Fender Musical Equipment Co. under the direction of Gregg Wilson and Freddie Tavares. Gregg Wilson was succeeded by John Page, who eventually headed the Fender Custom Shop. The Lead Series have elements of the Stratocaster and Telecaster in their design with a body that is slightly smaller and with a slightly different shape than the Stratocaster, a Stratocaster-like neck (and headstock), and hardtail bridge with Telecaster- like string ferrules on the back of the body.The Fender Lead Series The Unique Guitar Blog - May 27th, 2018. The Lead Series headstock was smaller than that of the then Stratocaster models and similar though not identical to the 1954 Stratocaster design. The Stratocaster models at the time of the Lead Series release in late 1979 were still using the larger headstock design until the introduction of the Dan Smith Stratocaster in 1981. At some point during 1982 the lower bout of the headstock was shifted towards the body giving the headstock a more elongated look. The Lead Series were manufactured at Fender's Fullerton, California plant and priced below the Stratocaster models of the time (approx. $495.00). They were eventually replaced in Fender's line up by the Squier JV model in 1982 as Fender expanded its operations by starting Fender Japan. In January 2020 Fender reintroduced the Lead II and III as a part of their Player series. These Made in Mexico recreations sport an alder body, two slanted AlNiCo III single coils (Lead II), AlNiCo II humbuckers (Lead III) and a modern C-shaped maple neck with maple or pau ferro fretboard, 9.5‚Äù radius, 22 medium jumbo frets.

Technical information  Fender Lead I Wiring Harness Fender Lead II X1 single coil fiber bobbin pickup Fender Lead II X1 single coil plastic bobbin part#016730 Fender Lead I/III Humbucker Pickup Specifications The DC resistance of the Lead I/III Seth Lover designed humbucker pickup is approximately 13 kŒ©. The Lead I/III humbucker pickups have 12 adjustable pole pieces and have a ceramic magnet. Fender Lead II Single Coil Pickup Specifications The DC resistance of the Lead II X-1 single coil pickup is approximately 7.5 kŒ© (9600 coil winds) vrs (7600 coil winds) on a Stratocaster. Lead II single coil pickups have flat ALNICO polepieces. Early Lead II single coil pickups have bobbins formed of green/grey fibreboard and later Lead II single coil pickups have plastic moulded bobbins that are the same as that used on current Stratocasters. Fender Lead Series General Specifications The Lead Series use 250 kŒ© volume and tone potentiometers and use 0.05 ¬µF tone capacitors. The body is usually made of 3 pieces of either alder or ash while the necks are maple with a walnut 'skunk stripe' on their backs and a matching plug on the face of the headstock covering the end of the truss rod. Maple fingerboarded necks are made of one piece of maple (no separate fingerboard) while rosewood fingerboarded necks have a thick veneer of rosewood stuck over the pre-radiused face of the neck. While the lead neck is approximately .04 in narrower at the nut than typical Fender Telecasters and Stratocasters of that era, the neck width at the 21st fret is the same as the Stratocaster and Tele (measuring 2.182 inches). The pickup body routing is the same for the Lead I and the Lead II models (humbucker bridge and single coil neck routing). The grounding system in all three of the series didn't stop with the foiled backing on the pickguard. A ground strap was screwed to the body routing pocket between the bridge pickup and the pickup selector switch cavity. The body pockets were covered with a conductive coating. The bridge ground wire was connected here with a common connection to the pickguard ground. Later year Fender Lead models have a more contoured body and there are two subtle variations in headstock shape, one of which (softer contour) used tooling dating back to the 1950s Stratocaster (as with the Dan Smith Stratocaster). Neck profile and headstock thickness varied slightly throughout the production run for all Fender Lead models of different years. Many instruments used a polyurethane finish which is brittle, chips easily, and develops spider cracks if exposed to extremes of heat or cold. The finish is also prone to clouding.  Serial Numbers  The Fender Lead Series used a modified version of the Fender United States serial number format. The first letter E designated the eighties, and the next two numbers (00, 01, or 02) indicated the year of manufacture. For example, E01XXXX = 1981. Fender Lead Series guitar serial numbers were installed on the headstock, inside body pocket, and back of the pick guard. An all original model may have the same serial number identifier on each of these major parts.

The people of Moshupa are called the Bakgatla-ba-ga Mmanaana, a group also found in Thamaga. Along with the related Bakgatla-ba-ga Kgafela of Mochudi, they arrived to the region from the Transvaal region in South Africa throughout the eighteenth century. Moshupa is characterised by unique and gigantic mountain outcrops which often leave visitors in wonder. The giant rocks (some up to 40 metres in radius) are so balanced on top of each other that even the villagers themselves wonder why they do not fall. They are believed to fall only when the village chief is dying, as an omen. The chief (kgosi) of Moshupa is Kgosi Kgabosetso Mosielele. The chief currently serves in the Customary Court of appeal and his brother, Kgosi Oscar Mosielele is the current chief of the village on his behalf. As is customary in Botswana the salutation 'kgosi' is the title used before the chiefs name. Geography There are three seasonal rivers crossing Moshupa, the Mosope, Hatshelatladi(Gatsalatladi), and Monnaamme, and Kolwane further in the north. The Mosope River is legended as the host of a Kgwanyape (a dragon, called Bushi, Seriri, or Noga ya metsi). The villagers avoid crossing the Mosope River, particularly at night where the river joins the Phuting/Kgosing mountain for fear of the Kgwanyape. This place, called Lefikeng, or just 'hikeng' has a large rock outcrop curiously balanced upon the river banks with a perennial pond underneath it. Although villagers avoid this place, visitors venture there, especially white tourists or Peace Corps volunteers, giving rise to the local belief that the 'Kgwanyape' turns into a white lady and sunbathes during the day. Infrastructure There are six primary schools, three junior secondary schools, and a senior secondary school in Moshupa. In addition there are a few day-care centers and an orphanage. A vocational training center (Moshupa Brigade) offers trade, business, and secretarial courses with some evening classes. Moshupa also has council administration offices to the north, headed by Sub-council Chairman on the political side and a Senior Assistant Council Secretary on the administrative side. The health system consists of three clinics with full-time nurses and visiting physicians to handle childbirth and short time inpatients. The clinic refers major cases to the Kanye hospital or the Thamaga Hospital. There are plans to build a hospital in Moshupa. One of the latest additions to Moshupa has been a detention center for young offenders to the west. Demographics Moshupa is divided into wards or dikgotla, typical of Botswana villages. They are Kgosing, Nakedi, Phuting, Kgope, Maradung, Thupelo, Mmapholana, Mmaditswere, Nkaikela, Mmamohuhumedi, Rungwana, Modimele, Sau, Jerusalem(part of Phuting), Mokakaneng, Mogaung, Maunatlala, Dibotong, Mmaseetsele, Lepapeng, Ntle ga majwe, and other wards emerge with village growth. Each kgotla has its own sub-chief or Kgosana. The settlement into Moshupa was the final settlement of the Bakgatla-ba-Mmanaana after the Battle of Dimawe. The area may have been chosen for its mountainous natural defence or because of the presence of a seasonal water source (Mosope River). In the early 20th century problems with the Bangwaketse chief, Bathoen II, led to a split of the village with the main chief Kgosi Gobuamang (I) Mosielele leaving to live in Thamaga in 1934 under the Kwena territory. The main royal family was hence based in Thamaga, and some of the Moshupa chiefs, such as the late Ramputswa Mosielele and Diratsame Gobuamang II, came from the Thamaga royal family. Religion There are a large number of Christians in Moshupa. The most popular are the United Congregational Church of South Africa, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Assemblies of God, the Apostolic Faith Mission, the Roman Catholic Church, the Zion Christian Church, and the Indian Pentecostal Church of God alongside other Afro-Christian and Charismatic Pentecostal assemblies. One of the oldest churches is the Mothowagae Church, established in 1903.University of London Institute, 1968 Ethnicity Moshupa is occupied predominantly by Bakgatla baga Mmanaana and it has several ethnic groups that melded into the village as it grew. To the south are mostly Bangwaketse people, to the west there are groups with Kgalagadi ancestry while the inhabitants of Phuting are thought to be of a Ngwato ancestry: hence the name 'Phuting', from the animal phuti (African duiker), a Ngwato tribal totem. The people of Mogaung ward are considered Bangwaketse. There are a considerable number of people of Afrikaans ancestry in the Maburung kgotla who can trace their roots to South Africa (Cape Colony) and 17th century the Netherlands. The most well known of them are the Stegling and the Ludick family. They have a strong tradition of ironsmithing, which was at its peak during the times of the wooden ox drawn cart or the . They still speak Afrikaans, a language similar to post medieval Dutch. They are sometimes referred to as 'Maburu', although the use of the word is sometimes considered derogatory. The word comes from the Dutch word 'Boers', meaning 'farmers', from the strong farming culture of the first Cape Colony settlers from the Netherlands. Almost all Nguni (Xhosa, Swati, Zulu) and Sotho-Tswana tribes use the same word. There are also a number of business people of Middle eastern and Indian origin who have become Batswana while living as their own small tight communities. Along with Ramotswa this was one of the first places that Indian residents settled in the 1880s. Prominent businessman and former member of parliament, Satar Dada has roots in Moshupa's Indian community (historically referred to as \\"Arabs\\" for various reasons including their Muslim faith). Industry The area around Moshupa consists of crop and cattle farmland, the latter highly overgrazed, on a path to desertification. There are also a number of poultry farmers clustered in one place who supply the local market. Poultry is a lucrative business in Moshupa. There is also a vegetable farm on a wetland along the river where spinach, tomatoes and other vegetables are raised. Most vegetables are imported into local supermarkets because Moshupa is too arid for productive farming. Moshupa does not have a major shopping center but a cluster of shops around the main road, selling goods from lingerie and food to building materials and furniture. A Local bakery supplies bread to all vendors and schools in Moshupa. There are also a number of hair salons that boom around Christmas time. They all specialise in afro-styles. There are also a few metal-smiths who specialise in welding and supplying local tomb crates (good business). Trade services such as plumbing, bricklaying, and electrical installation are supplied by individuals, in a largely unregulated trade. Like many Botswana villages, development is controlled by a group of volunteers and the local municipality called the Village Development Committee. They usually deal with minor projects that do not require expert consultancy such as government housing and the management of landscaping projects. Politics There are as few as four and as many as seven political parties dominant in Moshupa. The current reigning party is the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP, Domkrag). There is also considerable support for the Botswana Congress Party and The Botswana National Front and the Botswana Alliance Movement. The member of parliament for Moshupa is the Hon Karabo Gare and His excellency Dr Mokgweetsi Keabetswe Eric Masisi, a Moshupa native, is serving in the current cabinet as the President of Botswana. From a political pedigree Hon. Masisi is son to the first MP for Moshupa who won the first elections after independence. Hon Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi also had one of his brothers serving as an MP in Francistown West constituency before his passing in 2013. He has received advanced training at graduate level in the fields of education, economics (social policy and social development) and recently began studying epidemiology. While the village is one of the most picturesque villages in the country it has not capitalised on its tourism potential and is not yet considered a tourist destination. It does have a Bed and Breakfast Guest-House in Jerusalem ward. There are a large number of bars, liquor shops and one newly opened night club. The nearest motel is in Kanye, thirty minutes drive from Moshupa. Workers in the Peace corps and volunteers can have accommodation organised through the Village Development Committee (V.D.C.) housing which is highly subsidised. Moshupa should actually be spelled and pronounced Mosopa, but has the name Moshupa because the first documenters were British, who did not pronounce it faithfully. An extensive history of Moshupa was made by Dr Jeff Ramsay, a historian who now works as press secretary to the office of the President. The information can be accessed at the Botswana National Archives by request. Some research has also been done by the University of Botswana history and geology department about Moshupa and can be accessed at the University Library.

(; literally meaning \\"East\\") is a Russian watchmaker based in Chistopol, Tatarstan, Russia. The company produces mainly rugged military and amfibia mechanical watches. It also makes clocks and watch movements for other watch brands. History The Vostok Komandirskie, marked \\"–ó–ê–ö–ê–ó –ú–û –°–°–°–†\\", meaning \\"Ordered by the Ministry of Defence of the USSR\\" A mechnical watch of the Russian Federation era featuring an insignia of the Russian Airborne Troops The Vostok Watch Makers company was founded in 1942 when one of the Moscow watch-making plants of the First Moscow Watch Factory was evacuated to Chistopol, a small town located on the Kama River in Tatarstan.International Watch magazine, Nov. 2006, pg. 187 Only defence equipment was produced during the war years, but as soon as the war was over the company started making mechanical wrist watches. However, the company did not begin using the \\"Vostok\\" brand name until the 1960s. Presumably, the \\"Vostok\\" brand was named after the Vostok space programme, as were some other soviet watch brands, namely Poljot and Raketa. The Vostok diving watch Amphibia The company was appointed an official supplier of watches for the Ministry of Defence of the Soviet Union in 1965. This year also marks the creation of the well known Komandirskie (\\"Commander's\\") watch. The experience gained through development of the army watch led to the Amphibia, a stainless- steel diving watch able to withstand a 200-metre depth (20atm). By 1980, Vostok Watch Makers was producing 4.5 million timepieces per year. Watches sold to the military were marked \\"–ó–ê–ö–ê–ó –ú–û –°–°–°–†\\", meaning \\"Ordered by the Ministry of Defence of the USSR\\". These models were sold exclusively through Voentorg stores, which catered to military personnel with identification only. Today, these models have become sought-after collectibles. At turn of the 21st century, Vostok launched a line of 1940s-style replicas called the Kirovskie K-43 collection. Vostok also began producing a \\"luxury\\" line of watches called Kremlevskie. Both lines are made of stainless steel, produced in limited quantities, and aimed toward a more affluent consumer. In 2004, Vostok Watch Makers began supplying movements to the Koliz Company of Lithuania, makers of the Vostok Europe brand of timepieces. In 2006, Vostok Watch Makers began marketing another line of watches branded \\"Amphibia\\". This brand, like most other Vostok products, features the familiar 31-jewel automatic (No. 2416B) movement. These watches feature \\"diver\\" styling with polyurethane or stainless steel bands. An updated version of the Komandirskie debuted in summer 2007, and a special anniversary edition of the Amphibia (called the \\"1967\\") appeared in early 2008. Despite the introduction of the new lines of Komandirskie and Amphibia, the \\"classic\\" models (mostly designed in 1960s and 1970s) of these lines were still in production (as of 2014). In early 2010, Vostok Watch Factory filed for bankruptcy and their official website was disabled. The factory went through restructure and resumed the production of watches and movements. List of Vostok movements Vostok produces its own mechanical movements. The company also owns \\"Briolet\\", which specializes in the production of technical ruby-jewels. Vostok supplies models for other watch makers including Vostok Europe, Volmax, Moscow Classic and Poljot International. The models produced are listed in the table below.

In this partnership, bank staff and tellers become the point of sale and point of contact for the customer. Bank staff are advised and supported by the insurance company through wholesale product information, marketing campaigns and sales training. The bank and the insurance company share the commission. Insurance policies are processed and administered by the insurance company. This partnership arrangement can be profitable for both companies. Banks can earn additional revenue by selling the insurance products, while insurance companies are able to expand their customer base without having to expand their sales forces or pay commissions to insurance agents or brokers. Bancassurance has proved to be an effective distribution channel in a number of countries in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia.  Description  BIM differs from classic or Traditional Insurance Model (TIM) in that TIM insurance companies tend to have larger insurance sales teams and generally work with brokers and third party agents. An additional approach, the Hybrid Insurance Model (HIM), is a mix between BIM and TIM. HIM insurance companies may have a sales force, may use brokers and agents and may have a partnership with a bank. BIM is extremely popular in European countries such as Spain, France, and Austria. The use of the term picked up as banks and insurance companies merged and banks sought to provide insurance, especially in markets that have been liberalised recently. It is a controversial idea, and many feel it gives banks too great a control over the financial industry or creates too much competition with existing insurers. In some countries, bank insurance is still largely prohibited, but it was recently legalized in countries such as when the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act was repealed after the passage. But revenues have been modest and flat in recent years, and most insurance sales in U.S. banks are for mortgage insurance, life insurance or property insurance related to loans. But China recently allowed banks to buy insurers and vice versa, stimulating the bancassurance product, and some major global insurers in China have seen the bancassurance product greatly expand sales to individuals across several product lines. Private- bankassurance is a wealth management process pioneered by Lombard International Assurance and now used globally. The concept combines private banking and investment management services with the sophisticated use of life assurance as a financial planning structure to achieve fiscal advantages and security for wealthy investors and their families. The banks are the agent of the insurance companies to sell them more and more policies. Bancassurance is an efficient distribution channel with higher productivity and lower costs than traditional distribution channel. In modern bancassurance module, there has a staff assigned by an insurance company which placed in particular banks to serve banking customers with their insurance solutions. Business models across the world 'Integrated models' is insurance activity deeply integrated with bank's processes. Premium is usually collected by the bank, usually direct debit from customer's account held in that bank. New business data entry is done in the bank branches and workflows between the bank and the insurance companies are automated. In most cases, asset management is done by the bank‚Äôs asset management subsidiary. Insurance products are distributed by branch staff, which is sometimes supported by specialised insurance advisers for more sophisticated products or for certain types of clients. Life insurance products are fully integrated in the bank‚Äôs range of savings and investment products and the trend is for branch staff to sell a growing number of insurance products that are becoming farther removed from its core business, e.g., protection, health, or non-life products. Products are mainly medium- and long-term tax-advantaged investment products. They are designed specifically for bancassurance channels to meet the needs of branch advisers in terms of simplicity and similarity with banking products. In particular, these products often have a low-risk insurance component. Bank branches receive commissions for the sale of life insurance products. Part of the commissions can be paid to branch staff as commissions or bonuses based on the achievement of sales targets. 'Non-integrated Models' ‚Äì The sale of life insurance products by branch staff has been limited by regulatory constraints since most investment-based products can only be sold by authorised financial advisers who have obtained a minimum qualification. Banks have therefore set up networks of financial advisers authorised to sell regulated insurance products. They usually operate as tied agents and sell exclusively the products manufactured by the bank‚Äôs in-house insurance company or its third- party provider(s). A proactive approach is used to generate leads for the financial advisers from the customer base, including through mailings and telesales. There is increasing focus on developing relationships with the large number of customers who rarely or never visit a bank branch. Financial planners are typically employed by the bank or building society rather than the life company and usually receive a basic salary plus a bonus element based on a combination of factors including sales volumes, persistency, and product mix. Following the reform of the polarisation regime, banks will have the possibility to become multi-tied distributors offering a range of products from different providers. This has the potential to strengthen the position of bancassurers by allowing them to meet their customers‚Äô needs. Conclusion Bancassurance plays a major role in worldwide insurance and dominates several major European markets such as France and Italy. Its market share is expected to accrue with the deregulation taking place in several Asian countries and in the UK. Bancassurance encompasses a variety of business models. These business models generally fall into three categories: * Integrated models (where the bancassurance activity is closely tied to the banking business). * Advice- based models (where there is less integration and the distribution is based on using professional insurance advisers to sell to the clients of the bank). * Open architecture models. The business model tends to impact all aspects of the bancassurance activity including the company structure, sales and marketing, product design, and sales remuneration. In most countries, bancassurance has tended to see a gradual evolution in the products offered from protection business closely related to the banks lending activity to general savings business and finally to a wider range of protection products. In many countries, the choice of a business model is influenced by regulatory constraints (e.g., the minimum qualification required to sell insurance products, the type of products that banks are allowed to sell, or the nature of the relationship between banks and insurance companies). Bancassurance can be an efficient distribution mechanism with potentially higher sales and lower costs than traditional, segregated, distribution channels, in other words, in additional cost and revenue synergies. These advantages are positively correlated to the degree of the integration of the banking and insurance products, although there is no evidence showing the precise extent of the relationship between the two. The collapse of Fortis in Belgium, and the withdrawal of other players from the bancassurance market, since the crisis, has led to a reduced level of interest in this area.

Later it was connected with Nicopolis by two highways. Satala is now Sadak, a village of 500 inhabitants, in the Kelkit district of G√ºm√º≈ühane Province in Turkey.  History  This site must have been occupied as early as the annexation of Lesser Armenia under Vespasian. Trajan visited it in 115 and received the homage of the princes of the Caucasus and the Euxine. It was he doubtless who established there the Legio XV Apollinaris and began the construction of the great castra stativa (permanent camp) which it was to occupy till the 5th century. The town must have sprung up around this camp; in the time of Ptolemy it was already important. In 530 the Persians were defeated under its walls. Justinian I constructed more powerful fortifications there, but these did not prevent Satala from being captured in 607-8 by the Persians. In the Middle Ages and Ottoman period an important east-west route between Erzurum and Sivas or Tokat ran past Satala; however by that time Satala had ceased being an important settlement.T. A.

(1857.12.11 ‚Äì 1871.09.22) * Tommaso Teofilo Kulinski (1872.02.23 ‚Äì 1883.03.15) * Lazzaro Mladenoff, Lazarists (C.M.) (1883.06.12 ‚Äì 1918.03.04) In 1933 it was renamed Satala in Armenia. It is vacant, having had as such the following incumbents, so far also all of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank : * Fran√ßois-Joseph Dantin, Missionaries of Our Lady of LaSalette (M.S.) (1918.08.24 ‚Äì 1941.07.05) * Salvador Herrera y Pinto, Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1948.04.05 ‚Äì 1977.01.26)  Its rediscovery  Satala, then called Sadagh or Suddak, was visited by J. G. Taylor in 1868: he copied a damaged Latin inscription mentioning Domitian found on a Roman votive altar; found a large figurative mosaic fragment, a \\"magnificent specimen\\", being reused as the base of a fireplace; found more and larger mosaic fragments scattered about the village (all of them having been dug out of the top of a hill overlooking the village); and reported the existence of Byzantine epitaph inscriptions.Taylor, \\"Journey of a Tour in Armenia\\", Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, volume 38, 1868.Vincent Yorke, \\"A Journey in the Valley of the Upper Euphrates\\" in Geographical Journal, Vol VIII, 1896. Taylor reported that cut stones had been removed from the site to construct government buildings at Erzincan. The first detailed investigation of the site was by Alfred Biliotti, the British vice-consul at Trebizond. He visited Satala in September 1874 as a response to the finding of bronze statue fragments including the piece now known as the Satala Aphrodite, producing a description of the site and a plan of the ruins. Lightfoot considers Biliotti's account to be \\"by far the most accurate and valuable description of the remains at Satala\\". Although Sadagh was assumed by Taylor to be the site of Satala, and indicated as such by Kiepert in his maps,Vincent Yorke, \\"A Journey in the Valley of the Upper Euphrates\\" in Geographical Journal, Vol VIII, 1896, p461. the site's identification as Satala was not conclusively established until 1894 when two British scholars, Vincent Yorke and D. G. Hogarth, found several tiles at the site bearing the stamp of Legio XV Apollinaris.C.S. Lightfoot, \\"Survey work at Satala\\", in R. Matthews (ed.), Ancient Anatolia, pp. 275, Oxford, 1998. Yorke described Satala in 1894 as a Turkish village of about 150 houses, constructed mostly from reused stone blocks. Yorke identified as an aqueduct a 5-arched structure that Biliotti had identified as part of a basilica church and Taylor as part of a bathhouse, a misidentification that continued into the 1990s.  Archaeological remains  Some remains of the walls of the rectangular legionary fortress survive, though much ruined. Their line can be traced in part on all four sides of the fortress that encompassed an area of 15.7 ha (smaller than most legionary fortresses). These walls probably date from the 6th century AD when, according to Procopius, Satala's fortifications were extensively rebuilt by Justinian, but in places they reuse the foundations of earlier walls. Within the walls little remains, and ruined structures noted by Biliotti have been demolished. The legionary base had a civilian settlement to the north of the north wall, but no traces of any substantial buildings survive. A ruinous structure consisting of a row of arches stands at some distance to the southeast of the fortress. Biliotti described it as a basilica, but since then it was frequently regarded as the remains of an aqueduct leading to an as yet unidentified lower city. This theory is now considered obsolete and the ruin has been reconfirmed as that of a basilica church. Lightfoot speculates that it might have been a martyrium church dedicated to the patron saint of Satala, St. Eugenius.C.S. Lightfoot, ‚ÄúSurvey work at Satala,‚Äù in R. Matthews (ed.), Ancient Anatolia, pp. 273-84, Oxford, 1998. The famous Satala Aphrodite, a larger than life-size head from an ancient Hellenistic bronze statue, was found in a field outside Sadak in 1872. It is now on display in the British Museum.British Museum Collection  References  Sources and external links * Livius.org: Satala * GCatholic with titular incumbent bio links * Populated places in Armenia Minor Roman legionary fortresses in Turkey Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Roman towns and cities in Turkey Villages in G√ºm√º≈ühane Province Roman fortifications in Cappadocia Populated places in ancient Cappadocia Catholic titular sees in Asia ","title":"Satala"},{"id":"2951932","text":"This is a list of actresses from Italy, actresses from other countries who mainly worked in the Italian film industry, and actresses in other countries who are of Italian descent.

Argo is most famous for its role in the discovery of the wreck of the RMS Titanic in 1985. Argo would also play the key role in Ballard's discovery of the wreck of the battleship Bismarck in 1989. The towed sled, capable of operating depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), meant 98% of the ocean floor was within reach. The original Argo, used to find Titanic, was 15 feet long, 3.5 feet tall, and 3.5 feet wide and weighed about 4,000 pounds in air. It had an array of cameras looking forward and down, as well as strobes and incandescent lighting to illuminate the ocean floor. It could acquire wide-angle film and television pictures while flying 50 to 100 feet above the sea floor, towed from a surface vessel, and could also zoom in for detailed views.

It was built in the 13th century as a royal castle of the Kingdom of Sicily, and is mostly known for its role in the Sicilian Vespers, when it became the seat of the Sicilian Parliament. The castle is in good condition today, and it is open to the public as a museum. History =Construction= Castello Ursino was built between 1239 and 1250, as one of the royal castles of Emperor Frederick II, King of Sicily, closing a chapter on the turbulent time in Sicily that followed the death of his predessor, William II. Local lords had attempted to assert independence, and in 1220 Frederick II had ordered the destruction of all non-royal castles in Sicily. Castello Ursino was built to stress royal power as well as for the defence of the capital, and was considered impregnable at the time. =Sicilian Vespers= In 1295, during the Sicilian Vespers, the Parliament which declared deposed James II of Aragon as King of Sicily, replacing him with Frederick III, was held here. The following year it was captured by Robert of Anjou but was later again in Aragonese hands. =Royal seat= King Frederick III resided in the castle, as well as his successors Peter II, Louis, Frederick IV and Maria. Here the latter was kidnapped by Guglielmo Raimondo III Moncada to avoid her marriage with Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1392). King Martin I held also his court in the castle. =Decline= After the move of the capital away from Catania and the appearance of powder weapons, the castle lost its military role and was used as a prison. It is one of the few buildings in Catania to have survived the earthquake of 1693. When the castle was first built, it was on a cliff looking out to sea, however as the result of volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes, it is now a kilometre inland. The former moat too in the 17th century was filled with lava from an eruption by Mount Etna. Its present location, surrounded by streets and shops in a typical Catania piazza, may strike some visitors as unusual. =Present day= The castle was acquired by the city of Catania in 1932, and it was restored. The Museo civico opened in the restored castle on 20 October 1934. Today, the museum houses artifacts and artwork from the castle as well as the greater geographical area. These items date from the Classical era onward, representing the diverse influences throughout Sicilian history. Frequently, the castle hosts also temporary exhibitions or artistic events (theatrical representations and concerts). It also possible to use the historical site to celebrate a civilian union. Further restoration work was carried out in November 2009. Layout The castle has a rectangular plan, with a large circular tower at each corner and an open-air inner court Museum layout =Ground Floor=  Salone d'Armi  This houses the museum's ticket office as well as Jewish inscriptions and inscriptions from the medieval senate-house where the decision was taken to expel the city's Jewish population in 1492, including a copy of the Julia Fiorentina inscription from the Louvre.

The Canon T70 was a 35mm FD-mount single-lens reflex camera introduced in April 1984 as the second in Canon's T series. The T70 started with the concepts explored in 1983's T50, took them further, and applied them to a more sophisticated camera. While the Program AE-only T50 was intended as a beginner's camera, the T70 gave the photographer a lot more control over the camera's operation while keeping the T-series philosophy of simplicity in control and operation intact.  Camera features  = Power = All film transport on the T70 was powered‚Äîloading, advance and rewind. The continuous shooting rate, at 0.7 frames per second, was slower than rival motor drives, but the drive was nonetheless faster than most people could manually wind. To load the camera, the photographer simply had to pull the film leader out to an orange mark and close the back‚Äîthe camera did the rest, loading the leader onto the spool, and advancing to the first frame automatically. All powered camera functions drew on two AA batteries in the grip. A built-in lithium battery (BR-1225 or CR-1220) was used to store user settings; the batteries lasted for about five years, and had to be replaced by a technician, since replacing them required partial dismantling of the camera body. = Controls = Top, showing controls. The T70 used an LCD mounted on the top of the right-hand side of the camera as a major component of its user interface. Two buttons above the display labeled 'UP' and 'DOWN' adjusted the selected parameter and the results were shown on the LCD. Buttons on the left- hand top of the camera selected the parameter to be modified. = Metering = Switch to select metering mode. The T70 included two different through-the- lens metering methods; both used a silicon photocell housed above the viewfinder eyepiece. Center-weighted average metering was the standard metering method, averaging over the whole frame with a slight preference towards the center of the frame, where the main subject is most likely to be. With strongly backlit scenes, or ones where the subject is spotlit against a dark background, center-weighted averaging produces underexposure or overexposure, respectively. For such situations, the T70 also supported selective area metering, which metered only the center 11% of the frame. The metering mode was selected by a sliding switch on the top left-hand side of the camera (from the photographer's perspective). This switch also selected self-timer mode and had a Lock position. = Exposure modes = The T70 supported eight different exposure modes. These were: * Program AE (autoexposure). In this standard mode, the camera judges the shutter speed and aperture for average photographic scenes. * Wide Program AE. Here, the camera is biased towards choosing narrow apertures for greater depth of field, most often useful with wide-angle lenses. * Tele Program AE. Here, the camera is biased towards choosing wider apertures for narrow depth of field and fast shutter speeds, most useful with telephoto lenses. * Shutter-priority AE. Here, the user selects the shutter speed and the camera chooses the correct aperture. * Programmed flash AE. This is designed to work with the Speedlite 277T dedicated flash unit. * Electronic flash AE. For flash exposures with non-dedicated flash units. * Manual. Here, the photographer chooses both aperture and shutter speed. * Stopped-down AE. For use with older FL-mount lenses that do not support open-aperture metering. Also for use with macro photography attachments such as extension tubes and bellows, and for using non-Canon lenses with an adaptor. Cannot be selected with an FD lens attached. = Data back = A dedicated Command Back 70 supported date and data imprinting as well as time exposures, to take a photograph at a programmed time, and to take time-lapse photos at programmed intervals. The shutter of the T70 was not battery dependent during bulb exposures, and was one reason why the command back could support timed exposures of several hours duration.  Reception  When it was introduced, the Canon T70 was considered technologically advanced compared to other SLR cameras. Reviewing the camera in Popular Science, Everett Ortner said that the T70 \\"could be...too good for amateurs. It is certainly far removed from those other technological wonders designed for amateurs\\". He praised the high degree of control, coupled with automation, that the T70 allows photographers to use, reducing \\"the role of the camera from that of master to servant.\\"  References   External links  Canon T70.

He is believed to have died in exile around 355. Life Little is known of his early life because of the complete loss of his correspondence and written works. He first appears in Church records as Donatus of Casae Nigrae in October 313 when Pope Miltiades found him guilty of re-baptizing clergy who had lapsed and of forming a schism within the Church. Casae was a settlement located on the extreme southern edge of the plains of Numidia, south of Theveste, an area settled by people predominantly of Berber descent. These events may have taken place before Donatus arrived in Carthage, probably before 311. Donatus was consecrated in 313 AD as Bishop of Carthage and Primate of North Africa, the leader of the Christian sect which came to be known as the Donatist sect, even though Donatus was not the founding leader, but rather followed the founding leader Majorinus. The background to the controversy was the wave of persecutions of Christians by the Roman Emperor Diocletian. At that time some Church leaders - unwilling to endure torture or death and become martyrs - had been ready to take such acts as worshipping the gods of the old pantheon, considered idols by Christians, or surrendering church books and property to the imperial authorities. Such people became known as ‚Äútraditors‚Äù (\\"surrenderers\\"). One of these \\"traditors\\", named Caecilian, had returned to the fold of the Church once the persecutions ended, and was consecrated Bishop of Carthage and Primate of North Africa. Those of the faithful who refused to accept the authority of such a spiritual leader raised Majorinus as a rival bishop; however, Majorinus died shortly after being consecrated, and it fell to Donatus to take his place and continue the struggle. The Schism The schism between the two Christian wings centered on the status of traditore clergy. The Donatists contended that traditores could not be reinstated without being re-baptized and re-ordained to take office. They also contended that church rituals performed by traditores were invalid. Therefore, persons who were baptized, ordained or consecrated should not be recognized by the Church. Donatist thinking was relatively consistent with that of Saint Cyprian, who died a martyr during an earlier wave of persecutions, over half a century earlier. Effectively, the Roman Church believed that lapsed clergy could perform rituals such as baptism as long as they followed church ritual. During his tenure of some 40 years Donatus oversaw the expansion of the Donatist Christian sect but struggled unsuccessfully against the Roman Christian wing to obtain Church recognition as the legitimate Primate of North Africa. This effort failed because the Donatists were unable to prove to a series of the councils that considered the case that Caecilian had been a traditor or that his consecration was invalid because he was consecrated as bishop by a traditor, Bishop Felix of Aptunga. The issue was complicated because there it was not only Catholic bishops who were suspected of being traditores; some Donatist bishops were also suspected of the same, in contradiction to their sect's basic teaching. Further, bishops suspected of being traditores refused to be challenged. Donatus succeeded in expanding the Donatist sect in spite of lack of success in removing Caecilian from office, in large part due to the unpopularity of Caecilian and the Roman administration - particularly amongst the rural population. Donatist priests and bishops were much closer to the rural agricultural population which consisted of Roman farmers and the Berber and Phoenician descendants of the indigenous people who lived there before the Romans conquered North Africa. Most Donatist clergy in rural Numidia spoke the vernacular languages (Libyan or Punic) as well as Latin, whereas the Catholic clergy usually spoke only Latin. During the Diocletianic Persecution in Carthage there had been many who were imprisoned, some of whom were voluntary martyrs. These people claimed falsely to be in possession of Church property which they refused to give up to officials. The Bishop of Carthage, Mensurius, who was very much opposed to what he considered the fanaticism of the voluntary martyrs, sent his Archdeacon, Caecilian, to the prison to disperse by force the militant crowds gathered in support of volunteer martyrs. This action by Caecilian created many enemies in Carthage who were staunchly opposed to him. Donatism after Donatus After a conference held at Arles in which Donatus' appeal failed, he was in 347 exiled to Gaul until his death c. 355. At the time when Donatus' tenure ended, the Donatist Church was the dominant Christian Church in North Africa - but suffered from internal dissensions as well as the actions of the Catholic Church aimed at reincorporating the sect and thus unifying North African Christianity. The Circumcellions were bands of nomadic anti-Roman rebels, Punic-speaking bandits from the lower strata of society, who supported Donatism and were sometimes led by Donatist clergy. However, they broke out of control, attacking Roman landlords and colonists and redistributing goods acquired through the sweat of poor native peasants. Their support for the Donatists caused the Donatists to be identified with them, leading officials to take punitive action against the Donatist Church. Further, the Donatist church splintered into two main groups, reducing its effectiveness as a church. Later theological thought Protestant historians have noted the parallel between the Donatist debates and Reformation debates that broke out in Europe over a millennium later, leading to the formation of Protestant churches.

Other aminocoumarin antibiotics include clorobiocin and coumermycin A1.Alessandra da Silva Eust√°quio (2004) Biosynthesis of aminocoumarin antibiotics in Streptomyces: Generation of structural analogues by genetic engineering and insights into the regulation of antibiotic production. DISSERTATION Novobiocin was first reported in the mid-1950s (then called streptonivicin). Clinical use It is active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and may be used to differentiate it from the other coagulase- negative Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which is resistant to novobiocin, in culture. Novobiocin was licensed for clinical use under the tradename Albamycin (Pharmacia And Upjohn) in the 1960s. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical trials. The oral form of the drug has since been withdrawn from the market due to lack of efficacy. Novobiocin is an effective antistaphylococcal agent used in the treatment of MRSA.  Mechanism of action  The molecular basis of action of novobiocin, and other related drugs clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 has been examined. Aminocoumarins are very potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and work by targeting the GyrB subunit of the enzyme involved in energy transduction. Novobiocin as well as the other aminocoumarin antibiotics act as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase reaction catalysed by GyrB. The potency of novobiocin is considerably higher than that of the fluoroquinolones that also target DNA gyrase, but at a different site on the enzyme. The GyrA subunit is involved in the DNA nicking and ligation activity. Novobiocin has been shown to weakly inhibit the C-terminus of the eukaryotic Hsp90 protein (high micromolar IC50). Modification of the novobiocin scaffold has led to more selective Hsp90 inhibitors. Novobiocin has also been shown to bind and activate the Gram- negative lipopolysaccharide transporter LptBFGC.  Structure  Novobiocin is an aminocoumarin. Novobiocin may be divided up into three entities; a benzoic acid derivative, a coumarin residue, and the sugar novobiose. X-ray crystallographic studies have found that the drug-receptor complex of Novobiocin and DNA Gyrase shows that ATP and Novobiocin have overlapping binding sites on the gyrase molecule. The overlap of the coumarin and ATP- binding sites is consistent with aminocoumarins being competitive inhibitors of the ATPase activity. =Structure‚Äìactivity relationship= In structure activity relationship experiments it was found that removal of the carbamoyl group located on the novobiose sugar lead to a dramatic decrease in inhibitory activity of novobiocin. Biosynthesis This aminocoumarin antibiotic consists of three major substituents. The 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety, known as ring A, is derived from prephenate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The aminocoumarin moiety, known as ring B, is derived from L-tyrosine. The final component of novobiocin is the sugar derivative L-noviose, known as ring C, which is derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The biosynthetic gene cluster for novobiocin was identified by Heide and coworkers in 1999 (published 2000) from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891. They identified 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and more than 11 other ORFs that may play a role in novobiocin biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of ring A (see Fig. 1) begins with prephenate which is a derived from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme NovF catalyzes the decarboxylation of prephenate while simultaneously reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to produce NADPH. Following this NovQ catalyzes the electrophilic substitution of the phenyl ring with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) otherwise known as prenylation. DMAPP can come from either the mevalonic acid pathway or the deoxyxylulose biosynthetic pathway. Next the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate molecule is subjected to two oxidative decarboxylations by NovR and molecular oxygen. NovR is a non-heme iron oxygenase with a unique bifunctional catalysis. In the first stage both oxygens are incorporated from the molecular oxygen while in the second step only one is incorporated as determined by isotope labeling studies. This completes the formation of ring A. thumb The biosynthesis of ring B (see Fig. 2) begins with the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. This is then adenylated and thioesterified onto the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) of NovH by ATP and NovH itself. NovI then further modifies this PCP bound molecule by oxidizing the Œ≤-position using NADPH and molecular oxygen. NovJ and NovK form a heterodimer of J2K2 which is the active form of this benzylic oxygenase. This process uses NADP+ as a hydride acceptor in the oxidation of the Œ≤-alcohol. This ketone will prefer to exist in its enol tautomer in solution. Next a still unidentified protein catalyzes the selective oxidation of the benzene (as shown in Fig. 2). Upon oxidation this intermediate will spontaneously lactonize to form the aromatic ring B and lose NovH in the process. Figure 2. Biosynthesis of 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one component of novobiocin (ring B) The biosynthesis of L-noviose (ring C) is shown in Fig. 3. This process starts from glucose-1-phosphate where NovV takes dTTP and replaces the phosphate group with a dTDP group. NovT then oxidizes the 4-hydroxy group using NAD+. NovT also accomplishes a dehydroxylation of the 6 position of the sugar. NovW then epimerizes the 3 position of the sugar. The methylation of the 5 position is accomplished by NovU and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Finally NovS reduces the 4 position again to achieve epimerization of that position from the starting glucose-1-phosphate using NADH. Figure 3. Biosynthesis of L-noviose component of novobiocin (ring C) Rings A, B, and C are coupled together and modified to give the finished novobiocin molecule. Rings A and B are coupled together by the enzyme NovL using ATP to diphosphorylate the carboxylate group of ring A so that the carbonyl can be attacked by the amine group on ring B. The resulting compound is methylated by NovO and SAM prior to glycosylation. NovM adds ring C (L-noviose) to the hydroxyl group derived from tyrosine with the loss of dTDP. Another methylation is accomplished by NovP and SAM at the 4 position of the L-noviose sugar. This methylation allows NovN to carbamylate the 3 position of the sugar as shown in Fig. 4 completing the biosynthesis of novobiocin. centerthumb600x600pxFigure 4.

It was the first unmanned research vehicle made by WHOI. ANGUS was encased in a large steel frame designed to explore rugged volcanic terrain and able to withstand high impact collisions. It was fitted with three 35 mm color cameras with of film. Together, its three cameras were able to photograph a strip of the sea floor with a width up to . Each camera was equipped with strobe lights allowing them to photograph the ocean floor from above. On the bottom of the body was a downward-facing sonar system to monitor the sled's height above the ocean floor. It was capable of working in depths up to and could therefore reach roughly 98% of the sea floor. ANGUS could remain in the deep ocean for work sessions of 12 to 14 hours at a time, taking up to 16,000 photographs in one session. ANGUS was often used to scout locations of interest to later be explored and sampled by other vehicles such as Argo or Alvin. ANGUS has been used to search for and photograph underground geysers and the creatures living near them, and it was equipped with a heat sensor to alert the tether-ship when it passed over one. It was used on expeditions such as Project FAMOUS (French-American Mid Ocean Undersea Study 1973‚Äì1974), the Discovery expedition with Argo to survey the wreckage of the Titanic. (1985), and again in the return mission to the Titanic (1986). ANGUS was the only ROV used on both dives to the Titanic. On Project FAMOUS, ANGUS helped change scientists views of the ocean floor. It showed them how different geological formations and chemical compositions of sediments can be, disproving previous assumptions of ocean floor uniformity The project also provided new insight to the theory of seafloor spreading by observing and sampling the rock formations around ridges and the horizontal formation of layers parallel to the ridge. In another 1977 expedition with ANGUS, scientists monitored temperatures over the ocean floor for any fluctuation. It was not until late at night the crew noticed temperatures rise drastically. They would review the photograph footage taken after the vehicle's session. ANGUS provided the first photographic evidence for hydrothermal vents and black smokers. It had returned with over 3000 colored photos showing both vents as well as colonies of clams and other organisms. They would later return with Alvin to take samples. Scientists nicknamed ANGUS Dope on a rope due to its durability and lack of fragile sensors. It was also given the motto \\"takes a lickin' but it keeps on clickin'\\". ANGUS was retired in the late 1980s, having completed over 250 voyages.

Vatsa or Vamsa country corresponded with the territory of modern Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. It had a monarchical form of government with its capital at Kaushambi (whose ruins are located at the modern village of Kosam, 38 miles from Allahabad). Udayana was the ruler of Vatsa in the 6th-5th century BCE, the time of the Buddha. His mother, Mrigavati, is notable for being one of the earliest known female rulers in Indian history. The early period The Vatsas were a branch of the Kuru dynasty. During the Rig Vedic period, the Kuru Kingdom comprised the area of Haryana/ Delhi and the Ganga- Jamuna Doab, till Prayag/ Kaushambi, with its capital at Hastinapur. During the late-Vedic period, Hastinapur was destroyed by floods, and the Kuru King shifted his capital with the entire subjects to a newly constructed capital that was called Kosambi or Kaushambi. In the post Vedic period, when Arya Varta consisted of several Mahajanpads, the Kuru Dynasty was split between Kurus and Vatsas. The Kurus controlled the Haryana/ Delhi/ Upper Doab, while the Vatsas controlled the Lower Doab. Later, The Vatsas were further divided into two branches‚ÄîOne at Mathura, and the other at Kaushambi.

Additionally, an overfly ramp from A2-East (Hannover) to A1-South (Cologne) was built, so the interchange had no longer the shape of a classic cloverleaf. The portion of the A1 between the Kamener Kreuz and Dreieck Erfttal is traditionally one of the most congested sections of Autobahn in Germany.

World Publishing Company) Cover art by Laszlo Matulay The Mandarins () is a 1954 roman √† clef by Simone de Beauvoir, for which she won the Prix Goncourt, awarded to the best and most imaginative prose work of the year, in 1954. The Mandarins was first published in English in 1956 (in a translation by Leonard M. Friedman). The book follows the personal lives of a close-knit group of French intellectuals from the end of World War II to the mid-1950s. The title refers to the scholar-bureaucrats of imperial China. The characters at times see themselves as ineffectual \\"mandarins\\" as they attempt to discern what role, if any, intellectuals will have in influencing the political landscape of the world after World War II. As in de Beauvoir's other works, themes of feminism, existentialism, and personal morality are explored as the characters navigate not only the intellectual and political landscape but also their shifting relationships with each other. The Irish novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch (in the Sunday Times) described The Mandarins as \\"a remarkable book, a novel on the grand scale, courageous in its exactitude and endearing because of its persistent seriousness\\".Quote printed on the back cover of The Mandarins (Harper Perennial Modern Classics). Amazon.co.uk. Characters * Henri Perron (considered to be Albert Camus) is the editor of the leftist newspaper L'Espoir. He has been in a relationship with Paula for the past 10 years. Previously in love, he is now unhappily attached. Henri primarily sees himself as a writer and struggles with his increasing involvement in the political arena. * Robert Dubreuilh (considered to be Jean-Paul Sartre) is the founder and leader of the SRL, a liberal, non-Communist political group. He is partly responsible for Henri's literary success, and the two are close personal friends. * Anne Dubreuilh (considered to be Beauvoir herself) is the wife of Robert. She is a practicing psychoanalyst. She has an affair with the American writer Lewis Brogan. Her reflections on the lives of the other characters comprise a large portion of the text. * Paula Mareuil is Henri's girlfriend. She is unrelentingly committed to her relationship with Henri, despite his indifference and, later, loathing and resentment. She develops severe delusions and paranoia regarding this relationship and is forced to seek medical treatment. * Nadine Dubreuilh is Robert and Anne's daughter. Nadine is haunted by the death of her Jewish boyfriend Diego during the French Resistance. She has an affair with Henri early in the course of the novel and later marries him and has a child by him. * Lewis Brogan (considered to be Nelson Algren, to whom the book is dedicated) is an American writer with whom Anne has an extended affair. * Scriassine ‚Äî David Cesarani in the biography Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind, suggests that Scriassine's character is drawn on Arthur Koestler.Cesarani, David, 1998. Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind, p. 278. In her autobiography (vol.3)La Force des Chose [Force of Circumstance] by Simone de Beauvoir, 1963 de Beauvoir denies that The Mandarins is a roman √† clef. She writes: 'I loathe romans √† clef as much as I loathe fictionalized biographies'. However she says that 'Anne was made from me, true, ...but I have made her into a woman in whom I do not recognize myself'. She does admit that 'of all my characters, Lewis is the one who approaches closest to a living model....it so happens that Algren, in his reality, was very representative of what I wanted to represent'. Regarding the other characters, she says: 'Henri, whatever people have said, is not Camus; not at all. He is young, has dark hair, he runs a newspaper; the resemblance stops there.' Furthermore: ' [Henri] in his relations with the Communist Party and in his attitude to Socialism, resembles Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, and not Camus in the slightest'. And as for Dubreuilh, she writes: 'The identification of Sartre with Dubreuilh is no less aberrant; the only similarities between them are their common curiosity, concern with the world and fanaticism in work; but Dubreuilh is twenty years older than Sartre'.

Henning Podebusk or Putbus (before 1350 ‚Äì ) was a German- Slavic statesman, the last drost of Denmark. He served under King Valdemar IV, King Oluf II, and Queen Margaret I, and he was the de facto ruler of Denmark from 1368 to 1370. Podebusk, whose personal character is unknown, is now considered one of the most important Danish statesmen of the Middle Ages. His political views seem to have been just as cynical and power-centred as that of his royal masters, but perhaps he was an even better diplomat. By his death the office of drost was abolished, probably because he had shown how powerful it might be. Biography Podebusk belonged to a German-Slavic family of magnates related to the princes of R√ºgen.. The family was based in Putbus, which had been Danish before 1325. Nothing is known of his youth. He first appeared in Danish history in 1350, as he met Valdemar IV in Northern Germany and was taken into Danish service. During the next 15 years he became one of the king's most important and loyal officials in both foreign and domestic relations. In 1365, he was appointed drost (prime minister) of Denmark, and he showed his diplomatic ability during the war 1367-1370 against the powerful Hanseatic League and its allied Confederation of Cologne. When Valdemar was pressed to leave Denmark in 1368, Podebusk was appointed the de facto ruler, and set about ending the war with the League. He cut his losses in the war, and split the enemy alliance by agreeing an unfavourable separate peace with the Hansa in the Treaty of Stralsund. After the war he took part in the king's legal settlement with the magnate rebellionists in Denmark and during the next years he managed to sabotage much of the Hansa's economic advantages from the peace. After the death of Valdemar in 1375, Podebusk played an important role as the protector of Danish royal interests, as he helped Valdemar's five-year- old grandson Oluf II ascend the throne in favour of candidates from the House of Mecklenburg. He damped the magnates' opposition by temporary concessions and repudiated foreign demands on the throne. Podebusk served as a councillor for Oluf's mother Margaret Valdemarsdaughter, and helped her ascend the throne as Queen Margaret I when Oluf died in 1387. No exact date of death is known, but his wife Gisela Podebusk was described as a widow in October 1388. He married his distant relative Gisela Podebusk, from Denmark, whose mother Eufemia was the daughter of the last Danish count of Halland, according to medieval tales. His descendants played a modest role in Danish politics until 1660, then as magnates in Sweden, hereditary lord marshals of Pomerania, and elevated Princes of Putbus, ultimately in the kingdom of Prussia.

Notable trees A large specimen planted in 1550 stands before the church in the village perch√© of Fox-Amphoux in the Provence region of southern France. The tree was 18 m in height with a circumference at breast height of 5 m in 2013. Cultivation The plant prefers light well-drained (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, including those nutritionally poor; it can tolerate drought but not shade. The Mediterranean climate is especially suitable for the plant but it can tolerate colder climate (USDA Zone 7B). Common names In different countries, Celtis australis is known under the following common names: Trade names are: nettle wood, brimji.Celtis australis (Ulmaceae): Nettle Wood, Brimji. Uses It is often planted as an ornamental as it is long-living and resistant to air pollution. The fruit of this tree is sweet and edible, and can be eaten raw or cooked. The leaves and fruit are astringent, lenitive and stomachic. Decoction of both leaves and fruit is used in the treatment of amenorrhoea, heavy menstrual and inter-menstrual bleeding and colic. The decoction can also be used to astringe the mucous membranes in the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and peptic ulcers. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark. The wood is very tough, pliable, durable and widely used by turners; the flexible thin shoots are used as walking sticks. History Celtis australis is supposed to have been the Lotus of the ancients, whose fruit Herodotus, Dioscorides, and Theophrastus describe as sweet, pleasant, and wholesome. Homer has Ulysses refer to the \\"Lotus-eaters\\" and the \\"lotus\\" in Odyssey, Book IX. The fruit and its effects are described in Tennyson's poem The Lotos-Eaters.  Secondary metabolites  The leaves of Celtis australis are a rich source of flavonoid C-glycosides. Young leaves of Celtis australis from Northern Italy were found to contain the highest amounts of phenolics per gram dry weight. Amounts rapidly decreased until mid-May and after this date the level of phenolics fluctuated but showed no discernible trend. This general trend of high amounts of phenolics in the early growing season and a fast decline affected both caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoids.

They defeated the army of ishaan, the Sultan of Malwa in the battle of Sarangpur on March 29, 1561. All his treasures, elephants and his harem was captured by the victors. Madhav tried to take possession of Maanun Hindu mistress Rani Roopmati also, but she killed herself by consuming poison. According to the historian Badauni, both the commanders, Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan, perpetrated acts of barbaric cruelty, massacring the prisoners and killing even their wives and children. After the victory, Adham Khan sent to the emperor Akbar a report of victory along with only a few elephants, himself appropriating the rest of the spoils. Akbar resented this insolence and personally marched to Sarangpur. He took Adham Khan by surprise. Adham Khan surrendered to Akbar and his spoils were seized.

On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan accompanied by a few ruffians burst in upon him as he sat in the hall of audience and murdered him. Adham Khan then rushed to the inner apartment, where he was caught by Akbar, just roused from sleep by tumult. Akbar replied to Adham Khan's explanation to palliate his crime by striking him down with a heavy blow of his fist. Adham was thrown down twice from the roof of a one storied building whose height was about 10 feet (which was possibly the reason why he had to be thrown down twice) by royal order and put to death. Akbar himself broke this news to Maham Anga, who made a simple but dignified reply that he did well. The sudden demise of Adham Khan made his mother mentally depressed, and after forty days she also died.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007).

According to the Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya, Surasena was one of the solasa (sixteen) Mahajanapadas (powerful realms) in the 6th century BCE. Also, it is mentioned in the Hindu epic poem, the Ramayana. The ancient Greek writers (e.g., Megasthenes) refer to the Sourasenoi and its cities, Methora and Cleisobra. Etymology There are several traditions regarding the etymology of its name. According to one tradition, it was derived from a famed Yadava king, Surasena, while others see it as an extension of Surasen. It was the sacred land of Lord Krishna in which he was born, raised, and ruled. History A silver coin from Mathura, 5th century BCE. Seven punch-marks. Weight: 7.14 gm The Mahabharata and the Puranas refer to the rulers of the Mathura region as the Yadus or Yadavas, divided into a number of septs, which include the Vrishnis. The Buddhist texts refer to Avantiputta, the king of the Surasenas in the time of Maha Kachchana, one of the chief disciples of Gautama Buddha, who spread Buddhism in the Mathura region. Its capital, Mathura, was situated on the bank of the river Yamuna, presently a sacred place for the Hindus. The ancient Greek writers mention another city, named Cleisobora, in this region. Archaeological excavations at Mathura show the gradual growth of a village into an important city. The earliest period belonged to the Painted Grey Ware culture (1100-500 BCE), followed by the Northern Black Polished Ware culture (700-200 BCE).

The schools cater for students from Year 7 to Year 12 (or some smaller range within this).  State education system  Queensland has an extensive state education system, which is free and open to all residents, administered by and funded through a Queensland State Government Department now known as Education Queensland and also responsible for the Arts. The system consists of primary schools, generally called Queensland state schools, high schools, special schools (catering to the needs of those with physical and intellectual handicaps severe enough to preclude mainstreaming) and the Correspondence/Remote support service.  Naming of schools  Secondary schools in the Education Queensland system are normally named Town/District State High School, and often referred to by their acronym e.g. TSHS. Unlike some other schooling systems, State High Schools in Queensland are normally not (re)named to commemorate significant individuals or historic events. A few schools (e.g. Bundamba State Secondary College) have adopted other styles of names. Some schools have been renamed from Town SHS to District SHS, this sometimes occurs when smaller schools in a district are closed, and rural school bus services to the major centre provided instead. Variations In some rural areas, small local State High Schools cater only to years 8 to 10, with students continuing to Year 12 busing to a larger centre for their final two years. There have also been a few schools, usually in extremely remote areas, that provide Years 1 to 10 (Hightop Primary Schools), with those wishing to complete Senior usually moving to a larger centre to complete their schooling. A very small number of State High Schools offer or have offered either dormitories or out-boarding placements, however the majority of boarding schools in Queensland are religiously affiliated, mostly Anglican, Lutheran or Catholic schools. In recent years, some new schools have been built with a clear division between the Junior (years 8 & 9) and Senior (years 10 - 12) facilities, with the Junior sub-campus referred to as the Middle School. Completion The Queensland Certificate of Education is a certificate of completion given to students at the end of Year 12. It is considered a minimum qualification for most employment. A certificate was historically given at the conclusion of grade 10, known as the Junior Certificate, while the final certificate received at the conclusion of grade 12 was the Senior Certificate. It is now Queensland Government policy that student must remain in education, training, or work, until they are 17. This requirement has become known as the earning or learning policy. Under the previous system, apprenticeships and other post (junior) secondary employment and training options, coupled with compulsory attendance only until age 15 saw many students leave to enter the workforce before completing the Junior Certificate. Changes to employment conditions, compulsory education requirements and other factors have seen most students now completing junior and attending through to senior certificate level. Now all students must achieve either a Queensland Certificate of Education or be working full-time. This system has only recently been applied and so the last group of Year 12s to receive the traditional Senior Certificate were those who graduated at the end of 2007. Following this year all students receive a Senior Statement, showing all subjects and results achieved and eligible students will also receive a Queensland Certificate of Education. Students can keep working towards their QCE for up to nine years.

It is a barbican or defended fore-work which stood directly outside the original gate of which no surface trace survives.St. Laurence Gate on askaboutireland.ie It has been described as one of the finest of its kind, and is designated as a national monument.St. Laurence Gate on www.discoverireland.ie The original names for Laurence Street and Saint Laurence Gate were Great East Street and Great East Gate, respectively. In the 14th century, the street and gate were renamed because they led to the hospital of Saint Laurence, which stood close to the Cord church.Archiseek (Irish-architecture.com) Laurence Gate entry (with pictures and notes). Retrieved at 27 March 2008 Structure The structure consists of two towers, each with four floors, joined by a bridge at the top, and an entrance arch at street level. Entry is gained up a flight of stairs in the south tower. There is a slot underneath the arch from where a portcullis originally could be raised and lowered. Historians have wondered why such a large barbican was built in the east of the town, when the main artery through the town has always been north/south. For comparison, a similar barbican in Canterbury is less than half the height of Saint Laurence Gate. However, from the top of the Gate, the estuary of the Boyne and a four-mile stretch of river from there to Drogheda can be observed.St Laurence's Gate This is therefore the only point in the town with a clear view of a potential sea invasion. The earliest pictures of Laurence's Gate show that there was a raised lookout platform at the top of the south tower to provide an even higher vantage point.* Irish Architectural Archive, 'A small but charming place' Ref Francis Place, 1698Willem Van Der Hagen, 1720 (Beaulieu House), Ricardelli, 1782 (Highlanes Gallery) A portion of the town wall remains to the south of Saint Laurence's Gate. North of Laurence's Gate, the wall ran up Palace St/King St where the footpath is today. The depth of the basements of the houses and the Centre for Continuing Education on King Street suggest the presence of a deep trench outside the wall. Over the centuries, as the walls and gates fell into disrepair, the rubble stones were reused in later buildings. For example, the house and walls at the corner of Laurence Street and Palace Street and stone walls in Francis Street. Older pictures show that a toll booth and gate house remained until the early 19th century. The shop beside Laurence's Gate was a bicycle shop in the early 1900s. The green letter box dates from a time when there was a post office there. Gallery File:St Laurences gate (close up).jpgClose up of the gate.

Canon with ornamented cuff A cuff is a layer of fabric at the lower edge of the sleeve of a garment (shirt, coat, jacket, etc.) at the wrist, or at the ankle end of a trouser leg. The function of turned-back cuffs is to protect the cloth of the garment from fraying, and, when frayed, to allow the cuffs to be readily repaired or replaced, without changing the garment. Cuffs are made by turning back (folding) the material, or a separate band of material can be sewn on, or worn separately, attached either by buttons or studs. A cuff may display an ornamental border or have lace or some other trimming. In US usage, the word trouser cuffs refers to the folded, finished bottoms of the legs of a pair of trousers. In the UK, while this usage is now sometimes followed, the traditional term for the turned up trouser hem is 'turnup'.  History  Between the 15th and 18th centuries, rich men often wore sleeve cuffs ornamented with fine lace. Still today, Catholic clergy have the cuffs of their choir dress ornamented with fine lace.  Shirt cuffs  Except on casual attire, shirt cuffs are generally divided down one edge and then fastened together, so they can let a hand through and then fit more snugly around the wrist. Some sweaters and athletic garments (both tops and pants) have cuffs that either contain elastic or are woven so as to stretch around a hand or foot and still fit snugly, accomplishing the same purpose. Divided shirt cuffs are of three kinds, depending on how they fasten: *Button cuffs, also called barrel cuffs, have buttonholes on the one side and buttons on the other (sometimes more than one, so that the fit can be adjusted). *Link cuffs, which have buttonholes on both sides and are meant to be closed with cufflinks or silk knots. They are most commonly fastened in either the \\"kissing\\" style, where the insides of both sides are pressed together, or very unusually with the outer face touching the inner face, as with a button cuff (though this is unorthodox). Link cuffs come in two kinds: **Single cuffs, the original linked cuff, are required for white tie and are the more traditional choice for black tie. Also, some traditionalists may wear this style with lounge suits as well. **French, or double, cuffs, are twice as long and worn folded back on themselves. French cuffs were once considered to be more formal than button cuffs, although they are seeing a resurgence in business wear, particularly in Europe. Even though traditionally French cuffs could only be worn with a lounge suit or more formal clothing (and not a sports jacket), this is now not followed by most, while some even wear these cuffs without a tie or jacket. They remain the preferred choice for formal, semi-formal, occasions. French cuffs should generally be paired with cufflinks. *Convertible cuffs may be closed with buttons or with cufflinks. Anatomy of the single or double cuff: The fabric is folded back onto itself, thus the inside of the shirt sleeve becomes the outside of the cuff and the outside of the shirt sleeve, becomes the inside of the cuff.  Trouser cuffs  Tight-rolled jeans cuffs Most trouser legs are finished by hemming the bottom to prevent fraying. Trousers with turn-ups (\\"cuffs\\" in American English and elsewhere), after hemming, are rolled outward and sometimes pressed or stitched into place. The functional reason for the cuffs is to add weight to the bottom of the leg, to help the drape of the trousers. Parents may also use cuffs to extend the life of children's clothes by buying pants that are too long, cuffing the leg and then unrolling it as the child grows. Originally, however, it started as men rolling up their trousers to avoid getting mud splashed on them when roads were still unpaved. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, young people in some countries would tightly fold or roll the bottoms of their pants. Reportedly, this \\"tight-rolled pants\\" or \\"pegged pants\\" fad made a comeback in the 2010s, beginning in London. This was followed by a trend in tailored trousers for younger wearers no longer being made long enough drape and 'break' over the wearer's instep, but to stop at the top of the shoe, avoiding a break. Jacket cuffs The buttons and buttonholes at the end of suit jacket sleeves are generally decorative and non-functional. \\"Surgeon‚Äôs cuffs\\" can be opened at the wrist, and are traditionally associated with bespoke tailoring.

The Canon T60 was the last manual focus FD-mount 35 mm single-lens reflex (SLR) camera sold by Canon; it was introduced in 1990, three years after the introduction of Canon's incompatible EOS system of autofocus SLRs and their EF lenses. It was the final camera in Canon's T series. It was introduced solely as a cheap SLR system for export. It was never sold in Canon's home Japanese market. In some foreign markets, the higher price of the EOS cameras was a problem, while in others, there was demand for a cheap, largely manual camera for photography students and the like. The T60 shared little with the other T-series models except for a superficial styling resemblance. Unlike them, it had only manual film loading, advance and rewind. Film speed and shutter speed were set with traditional dials. The only auto- exposure mode supported was aperture priority AE. The camera would choose an appropriate shutter speed. Also supported, of course, was full manual exposure, aided by the camera's built-in meter. Shutter speed range was 1/1000 to 1 second, plus bulb. Canon did not manufacture the T60. Like a number of other low-end bodies sold by major camera companies (such as the Nikon FM10 and Olympus OM2000), it was both built by Cosina, and based upon Cosina's own CT-1 chassis.

Antonia's later work has explores decadent and supernatural themes, which led to a novel The Greenwood Faun, as well as the editorship of ‚ÄòIncurable‚Äô- The Haunted Writings of Lionel Johnson, the Decadent Era‚Äôs Dark Angel. Background Antonia is featured in the Sundance nominated documentary New York Doll alongside Morrissey, Mick Jones and Iggy Pop and can be seen in Danny Garcia's poignant documentary Looking For Johnny. Nina also appears in Garcia's 2019 documentary, Stiv ‚Äì No Compromise, No Regrets about Stiv Bators. As well as appearing on Radio One and Radio Six, Nina has performed at spoken word events and enjoyed a retrospective of her work at the Barbican curated by Jay Clifton. Clifton commented 'The special value of Nina's oeuvre lies not so much in her subjects, but in her personal commitment to both the documentation of them and a search for the truth about both their character and their cultural significance. Like the best writers, she begins from personal fascinations. But with a balance of personal feelings and objective contemplation, combined with a fluid literary style, she writes books that resonate beyond the parameters of the surface material.' In 2013, Antonia lectured on Glam at Tate Liverpool. Antonia was born in Liverpool. Her first book Johnny Thunders...In Cold Blood (Jungle Records, 1987) which has been in print for over 25 years, was hailed by the New Musical Express as \\"gorgeously sordid\\". In 2012, the book was optioned to a Hollywood production company. A de luxe Italian translation of the Thunders book appeared in late 2015 from Pipeline Books. In March 2015, Antonia's The One and Only: Peter Perrett, Homme Fatale was re-published by Thin Man Press. The new, expanded edition was hailed as 'a ravishing read' and 'an engrossing account'. Reviewer Gus Ironside, writing in Louder than War' suggested that Nina Antonia merits a far higher media profile but has been 'excluded from the \\"Boys' Club\\" of mainstream rock journalism'. Antonia appeared in conversation with Perrett at the Albert Hall to coincide with the new edition.

He was best known as Elvis Presley's personal physician and was controversial due to the singer's longstanding abuse of prescription drugs. Although Nichopolous retained his medical license after Presley‚Äôs death, the Tennessee Medical Board permanently revoked Nichopolous‚Äô license in light of his practice of overprescribing to many patients over multiple years.  Early life and education Born in Ridgway, Pennsylvania, Nichopoulos moved to Anniston, Alabama, during his infancy where his father, a Greek immigrant, opened a restaurant called Gus' Sanitary Cafe. From 1946 until 1948, he served in the Army Medical Corps in Germany before studying at the University of the South, where he received his B.S. in 1951. Nichopoulos subsequently earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1959. Career Nichopoulos began treating Presley in 1967 for saddle pain, and took it on as a full-time job in 1970 until Presley's death in 1977. His son Dean Nichopoulos served sometimes as an assistant for Presley, taking care of his wardrobe. George Nichopoulos was not present at Graceland the day Elvis died. In fact, he was so hard to contact that he only had the time to jump into the departing ambulance, which had not been called immediately after finding Elvis' lifeless body.At 5:30, Elvis' daytime cook Nancy Rooks tells what happened on August 16, 1977, around 2:00 p.m. (this is from her book and/or an interview): \\"... with the hollering they were doing *they just knew Elvis was gone*. So by then I was trying to get in touch with Dr. Nichopoulos. *I called him on every phone he had, but I didn't get any answer*. So his Auntie was going to get her doctor out there, but he said 'No, he is not my patient'.

There were some revival attempts at the hospital, just in case, during which Nichopoulos was present, but it was clear after 15‚Äì20 minutes that it did not make any sense.Elvis' nurse Marian Cocke in 1975-77, who also worked at the Baptist Hospital, at 1:35: \\"They said that Elvis was in the Emergency Room.\\" \\"So I went down there, they were working on him, and I asked them to stop. *Because it was SO evident he had been gone A LONG TIME*.\\" Commentator:\\"And with that, doctors pronounced Elvis Presley dead at 3:30 p.m. central time in the Baptist Hospital E.R.\\" in the video entitled \\"Elvis' Nurse Says Goodbye\\" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MOxteMFdnM\\"They worked on Elvis a good 15-20 minutes\\" at 20'15\\" of video \\"Elvis August 16, 1977 Defibrillator Baptist Hospital Mac McQueen Story The Spa Guy\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzKNJBIPTRw Nichopoulos was also present at the autopsy, but the contents of Elvis' stomach had been pumped out and thrown away shortly after his arrival at the hospital.At 15:25, 1) Dr Noel Florendo: a) \\"No gross evidence of a heart attack\\", b) \\"Elvis Presley most probably died of the interaction of several drugs, i.e. polypharmacy.\\"; at 17:45 \\"codeine, morphine, qaalude, valium, valmid, placidyl, nembutal, phenobarbital, pentobarbital & butabarbital\\" (\\"all downers, i.e. central nervous system depressants, several of which are addictive\\") were found in Elvis' dead body; and at 18:10 \\"The contents of his stomach were pumped out & destroyed, although they are well-known KEY elements to analyze the cause of death!\\" in \\"The Elvis Cover-Up 1979\\" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyKWLmi3wPo \\" Nichopoulos served as a pallbearer at the funeral. In 1979, the doctor was shot in the chest while watching a football game; he was not seriously injured. No suspect was ever arrested. In a 1993 interview with Dutch radio host Jorrit van der Kooi, Nichopoulos claimed it must have been an angry Elvis fan. In 1985, he started a solo practice called We Care, Inc. He is the father of Dean Nichopoulos, a Memphis car salesman well known in that area. After he was stripped of his credentials in 1995, Nichopoulos worked for a short time as Jerry Lee Lewis' road manager. He later took a job evaluating medical insurance claims by FedEx employees. No longer a doctor and in need of money, Nichopoulos sold many of the items he received from Elvis at auctions, and at one point had a travelling exhibit, showing off his doctor's bag with some of the medications he prescribed for Elvis.  Legal battles  In 1980, Nichopoulos was indicted on 14 counts of overprescribing drugs to Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and twelve other patients. The district attorney ruled out murder charges because of the conflicting medical opinions about the cause of Presley's death. In the first 8 months of 1977 alone, Nichopoulos had prescribed over 10,000 doses of amphetamines, barbiturates, narcotics, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, laxatives, and hormones for Presley. Nichopoulos claimed he had tried in vain to reduce Elvis' dependency, even going so far as to manufacture one thousand placebos for Elvis, but to no avail. The jury concluded that he had tried to act in the best interests of his patients. He was acquitted on all counts. Also in 1980, the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners found him guilty of overprescription, but decided that he was not unethical. They imposed three months' suspension of his licence and three years' probation. In 1993, Nichopoulos had his license permanently revoked by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners, and was branded a Doctor Feelgood in the press, after it was revealed that he had been overprescribing to numerous patients for years. Nichopoulos claimed it was for patients that suffered from inoperable chronic pain, but he was unsuccessful in his defense. During his many appeals, Nichopoulos admitted to the board that he had overprescribed. \\"I cared too much\\", he told them. During his court cases many friends supported him, raising money and holding benefits to pay for court costs.  Death George Nichopoulos died in Memphis, Tennessee on February 24, 2016 after an extended illness, aged 88. He is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

Mike Southon was educated at Papplewick School, Ascot (where he was a contemporary of Richard Curtis) and Wellington College, Crowthorne (where in 1967 he met Chris West, who was to become his co-author). He subsequently attended Imperial College London to read mechanical engineering, but left after a year. He worked at Tate & Lyle Research in Reading for a while and then went on to the University of Bradford to read chemical engineering and management economics. Southon was co-founder of The Instruction Set, a Unix training company, in 1984. Other co-founders were Peter GriffithsPeter Griffiths IMDB. and Mike Banahan. The company grew to 150 people, then was bought out in 1989 by Hoskyns Group (now part of Capgemini). During the 1990s, he was involved with 17 startup companies, including Riversoft and Micromuse, both of which had public floatations. In 2002, he published The Beermat EntrepreneurThe Beermat Entrepreneur. with Chris West. This book criticises the approach to entrepreneurship taught in many business schools as excessively corporate, and instead presents a model whereby customers are found as quickly as possible and where formal business planning is only carried out once the entrepreneur is sure of the product and where it fits in the market. The entrepreneur is presented as a specific kind of individual, with strengths and weaknesses (as opposed to models whereby entrepreneurship is seen as a set of behaviours that anyone can carry out). Such a person needs to work with particular individuals at different times in the business' life ‚Äì with a small group of expert 'cornerstones' at the start, with a 'dream team' of committed, 'can-do' individuals as the company grows to 25 people, then with more conventional employees after that point. Several other books followed, including two 'Beermat Guides' in sales and finance, and a book for intrapreneurs, The Boardroom Entrepreneur. Southon has written regular columns for the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times (weekly, for four years) and Mail on Sunday. He is now one of the most experienced entrepreneur mentors in the UK, having done face-to-face sessions with over 2,000 people in the last fifteen years. He has also spoken at over 1,000 live events, and interviewed many business celebrities on stage, including Sir Richard Branson at the first International Festival of Business in Liverpool, where he was Entrepreneur in Residence for two years In 2018, a thoroughly revised edition of The Beermat Entrepreneur was published. While maintaining the basic outlines of the 'Beermat' model of business growth, the model has been finessed. In the original book, a five-way equity split between entrepreneur and cornerstones was suggested, but this has been changed. The role of the entrepreneur's supporting 'foil' is discussed. The material on business ethics is expanded. Experiences of entrepreneurs who used the original model (or parts of it) are included, and the marketing section has been updated to discuss social media. Mike is Entrepreneur in Residence at Cass Business School, where he and Chris West teach 'Introduction to Entrpeneurship' and 'Marketing Strategy' to undergraduates in Business Management. Mike's alter ego is Mike Fab-Gere, a 60s and 70s rock star.Mike Fab-Gere. The band was started in 1991 and for many years was the top draw on the college circuit, then toured No. 1 theatres and still undertakes corporate events. Band members have included musicians from Deep Purple, Iron Maiden and The Zombies.

Owned by Lotus Communications, KRLV airs a all-sports radio format focused on the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League. The station's studios and offices are in the unincorporated community of Spring Valley in Clark CountyLVSportsNetwork.com/contact The transmitter is off Wild Jan Drive, northwest of downtown Las Vegas. Radio- Locator.com/KRLV History =Early years as KORK= In 1951, the station first signed on as KORK at 1340 kilocycles.Broadcasting Yearbook 1952 page 191 KORK was owned by the Vegas Valley Broadcasting Company, located in the Hotel Thunderbird, and it was powered at only 250 watts. KORK was an NBC Red Network affiliate, broadcasting NBC's schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band remotes. In 1955, it was bought by the Southwestern Broadcasting Company, which put Channel 3, KORK-TV (later KVBC, now KSNV) on the air in that same year. In 1961 KORK got an FM counterpart, 97.1 KORK-FM (now KXPT).Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-91 =Move to AM 920= In 1968, KORK, airing a full service Middle of The Road format, moved to 920 on the AM dial. Going to the 920 spot allowed KORK to increase its daytime power to 5,000 watts and slightly boost its nighttime power to 500 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-128 The 920 facility was first licensed in 1948 as KRAM; that call sign concurrently moved to the 1340 license. During its heyday under the ownership of Donrey Media, KORK was among the most popular stations in Las Vegas for adults. Its lineup included well- known disc jockeys, such as Red McIlvaine, Walt Reno and Ron Murphy. The simulcast morning drive time newscasts of KORK/KORK-FM in the 1970s kept both stations high in the ratings. During the latter part of the decade, the newsroom was led by news director Bill Buckmaster (now a talk show host at KWFM in Tucson) and included reporters Jackie Glass (now a District Court Judge in Las Vegas) and Steven L. Herman, (currently a Voice of America correspondent in Asia). The trio was frequently heard on NBC radio network newscasts. By the early 1980s, KORK became an adult standards station, airing NBC Radio News at the beginning of each hour. =Sports KBAD= Former logo before the station became an NBC Sports affiliate KORK changed its call sign to KBAD on April 4, 1997 and began airing an all-sports format.

Early life and career Born in Dublin, Carroll is a graduate of Blackrock College, Trinity College and Dublin City University. He began his career at The Irish News in Belfast, working as a reporter and diarist from 1995 to 1997, when he was named young journalist of the year in Northern Ireland's media awards. He moved to London to work as a researcher on two Channel 4 documentaries, Getting Away with Murder and The Devil Amongst Us. In November 1997 he joined The Guardian as a reporter, covering stories in Britain and returning to Northern Ireland to cover the peace talks. From 1999, he was deployed as a foreign correspondent in Yemen. and Serbia for the aftermath of the Kosovo war. In late 1999 he was posted to Rome as Southern Europe correspondent for The Guardian, where he wrote on topics such as The Vatican, Silvio Berlusconi, Macedonia, immigration and human trafficking from northern Africa, and the Middle East. After 9/11 he reported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. His report from Qalaye Niazi, where a wedding party was bombed by US planes, fuelled criticism of the Pentagon's air campaign. He broke the news about the UK's first overseas combat deployment since the first Gulf War. Africa correspondent In 2002 Carroll was posted to Johannesburg as Africa correspondent for The Guardian. He wrote about the massive problems facing Zimbabwe and South Africa, as well as the continent's food and public health problems. His interview with a Liberian female rebel commander (nicknamed \\"Black Diamond\\"), prompted Hollywood interest in making a film about her life, but it has not materialised. His article about rape in Congo provided the introduction to an essay by Cherie Blair for a Human Rights Watch volume on torture. Carroll's article about Hamilton Naki that appeared in The Guardian in 2003 was cited by The New York Times as the original source of their erroneous reporting in 2005 about the role Hamilton Naki played when the first heart transplant was performed at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa in 1967. Iraq correspondent Carroll took over The Guardian's Baghdad bureau in January 2005. He covered the US occupation, suicide bombings, the formation of Iraqi military and police units, growing sectarian tension, and the death of several friends, including Marla Ruzicka. On 19 October 2005 he was abducted in Baghdad after carrying out an interview with a victim of Saddam Hussein's regime in Sadr City. The interview had been arranged with the assistance of the Baghdad office of Moqtada al-Sadr. The kidnapping resulted in the Irish government deploying the Army Ranger Wing special forces unit and Arabic-speaking intelligence officers from G2. Carroll was released unharmed by his captors a day later after the British, Irish and Iranian governments, among others, lobbied for his release.

It lies on the European route E70, in the Cerna River valley. The town is located on the site of the ancient Roman colony Ad Mediam and was noted for its Hercules baths. It had a population of 2,492 in 1900, and of 4,474 in 2002. The commune is prone to major recurring flooding. The 1838 floods destroyed some 2000 houses in the valley and the 1841 floods in Mehadia were also devastating. It experienced major flooding more recently in May 2005. The commune is composed of four villages: GloburƒÉu (Golbor), Mehadia, Plugova (Ek√©s) and Valea Bolva»ôni»õa (Bolv√°sv√∂lgy). Etymology The Romanian historian, Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, stated that the name of the town had been derived from the ancient Roman name Ad Mediam. Linguist Cicerone Poghirc proposed that the Romans had adopted a hypotethical (non-attested) native *Mehedia or *Mehadia form. Most linguists agree that the Romanians adopted the medieval Hungarian name of the town which was first recorded as Michald in 1323. History During Roman period, Mehadia was the known by the name \\"Ad Medium\\"; the ruins of a fortress and other Roman antiquaries testify this fact. The Hercules baths also are of Roman vintage known in that period as Thermae Herculis or Ponies Herculis. Subsequent to the fall of the Roman Empire, the place was deserted till it was restored in recent times (after 1735) and the springs are most visited (June to September are the best months for visiting the baths). The Roman road from the Danube to Dacia was close to this village. Recent archaeological excavations have further substantiated the Roman period rule in the region. Many inscriptions dedicated to Hercules which testify the Hadrian reign of the Romans are seen at the baths. During the continent floods of 1910, Mehadia suffered serious loss to farms and property and several hundred lives were lost; 600 houses were destroyed. 1788 Battle in Mehadia valley Geography Mehadia in 1835 Postcard of Mehadia in 1918 Mehadia is located in southwestern Romania in the Cerna valley at an elevation of 287 m. It is located along European route E70, south of the village of Plugova and north of Tople≈£. Beyond Toplet to the south is Or»ôova, which was for many years the residence of a Pasha and contained a prominent Turkish fortress. The town of BƒÉile Herculane lies nearby to the east. Different parts of the river valley in the commune have different names such as the Shupanek valley and Coramnic. To the northeast of the main town is an elongated lake named Lacul Prisaca. A suspension bridge crosses the river near Mehadia in an area which is said to smell strongly of sulphur. The road to Mehadia passes through a broad forested scenic valley and crosses a Roman Aqueduct. The aqueduct has only 11 arches remaining in an otherwise well preserved state. They are made of large field stones and red bricks placed over a four layered field stones. Geologically the Plugova Fault exists between the V√¢rciorova and Bolva»ôni»õa valleys on the eastern boundary of the river basin and the Belibuc Fault also lies in the Plugova vicinity. ;Wild life Wild life found in the vicinity of Mehadia are mainly wolves and bears. In the mild climate of Mehadia, fig trees grow in profusion. Culture The famous baths of Mehadia were known to the Romans as \\"The Baths of Hercules\\". It is a celebrated place for its mineral springs, which are located in a narrow rocky gorge. The springs rise in Banat in the Cerna valley, about a mile from the Mehadia town. Originally, 22 hot springs existed. However, now only nine springs are known of which the popular one is Hercules spring, which emanates from fissures. The temperature of the water, on an average, remains in the range of 70 to 145 0 F. The nine different springs in use have varying degree of chemical content with the usual sulphurated hydrogen gas, lime sulphate, soda and lime, nitrogen gas, carbonic acid gas. However, the Hercules bath does not contain sulphurated hydrogen. The temperature is controlled through a cooling apparatus. Eye treatment is also arranged with the spring water, apart from the therapeutic healing powers for scrofula, joint pains, chronic rheumatism, gout, indolent skin diseases, complicated mercurial afflictions, hysteria, hypochondria ad many other ‚Äúopprobria medica‚Äù. The spring waters which are rich in hydrogen in particular, are popular for cures of cutaneous disorders, paralysis and apoplexy. The yield of these springs have been estimated as of water even during the dry season. The water temperature of some of the springs reported in a German publication in degrees on the R√©aumur scale (¬∞C = ¬∞R√© √ó 1.25) are: The Kalkabad 30 ¬∞R√©, the Rauber bad or Hercules Spring 35.5 ¬∞R√©, the Old Gliederbad 30.5 ¬∞R√©; the Augenbader 42 ¬∞R√© the new Giledarbad 20 ¬∞R√©; the Spring Brunnon 47.5 ¬∞R√©; The Schindel or Ledwige bad 36.5 ¬∞R√©; the Schwitzhloch 30 v; the Fiedrabad 30.5 ¬∞R√©; and Franciscilbad 25 ¬∞R√©. There are ruins of a Praetorium and civilian settlement about 3 km northwest of Mehadia and about 2 km south of Plugova on the left side of the E 70 at . The Koramnik part of the commune historically contained a gypsy encampment along the river bank. Traditionally the locals grew peaches and Muscat grapes and produced wine. Gypsies in the area were known for their vibrant music and Germanic theatrical influences. ;Houses There are no small houses in Mehadia. They are built in narrow ‚ÄúPlatz‚Äù with a statue of Hercules in the middle, placed over spout shaped like a crocodile from which the clear spring water emerges. The houses are painted in pale green or yellow colour, have high roofs with overhanging eves and with brownish tiles in the backdrop of the rocky mountains. ;Costumes Women of Mehadia in traditional dress The peasants of Mehadia wear picturesque costumes and walk with a graceful bearing. The comely women wear braided hair, which is braided in bands and twisted round the head and bedecked with flowers. The hair seen in different colours is attributed to the traditional custom, followed by women even today, of wearing the hair of several generations of women as natural inheritance from mother, grandmother and great grand mother, along with their own. The native colourful dresses which the women wear is described as ‚ÄúThe Obrescha, a broad girdle with red fringe hanging to the instep and worn over the white shift, gives them occasionally, as they walk along the road with the long disheveled web flaunting in the wind, a wild witch like air‚Äù. Economic development Mehadia forest resources are proposed to be exploited by new company known as Woodex Industries. The project started in 2001 envisaged manufacture of large wood laminated boards. The road networks in and around Mehadia are also under a major expansion and rehabilitation programme. The upgrading of the roads to international standards is aimed at meeting the increased traffic in the region and to minimise occurrence of accidents, to improving traffic safety and create new parking lots. The baths in Mehadia are now provided with elegant accommodation to stay and are provided with modern amenities. Archaeological excavations Roman Castra of Mehadia (also known as Praetorium), published in the 1726 work Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus, Vol. 2 by the Italian naturalist and soldier Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli (1658‚Äì1730). The Mehadia archaeological site is spread over an area of 7 ha. The \\"Roman champ\\" is the site where excavations were initiated since 1942. The Roman champ has been investigated in two stages ‚Äì the first stage excavation was in earth while the second stage was in stone formations in pits of 116√ó142.6 m size. These have unearthed many Roman antiquaries buried under agricultural fields of corn and private orchards. A defence system dated to 101 has been discovered near the confluence of the Bolva»ôni»õa stream with the Bela Reka River. It has been inferred that the Emperor Trajan had set up his army establishment here during the first phase of the war with the Dacians. A relic of a military diploma was found. This diploma is stated to belong to a soldier of the Cohors I Ulpia Brittonum, a personal guard of the emperor. Epigraphical information read at the base of the Roman champ provides link to the Cohors III Delmatarum. In addition, temporary military establishments of \\"Cohors VII Raetorum, detachments from Legio XIII Gemina, Legio V Macedonica and from Legio III Flavia Felix and Legio VII Claudia\\" have also been identified. The defense system was created to protect the Dierna city from northern invasions. In the constricted area of the Roman champ, \\"a circular military vicus\\", which extends along the Bela Reka River up to the thermae has also been identified. A graveyard of the Roman period has also been discovered on the bank of the Bolva»ôni»õa stream, in the northern part the Roman champ. Further, excavations have also revealed \\"the Capitolium of the civilian settlement at Praetorium ‚Äì Mehadia\\", which has a temple built by the soldiers of the Cohors III Delmatarum ¬•.

It is a community school, which takes children from the age of 11 through to the age of 18. The school has approximately 1550 pupils. In September 2004, the Department for Education and Skills designated the school as a specialist Sports College. The school also holds Investors in People status. The school has seven houses, which are named after sporting figures. They are Daley, Simmonds, Rutherford, Ennis, Farah, Murray, and Button. Previously, the seven houses were Holmes, Phillips, Adlington, Hamilton, Pietersen, Beckham and Thompson. Before that, there were four houses named after famous sporting venues. They were Lords, Silverstone, Twickenham and Wembley. Following several poor inspections by Ofsted, the school was placed on special measures. The Headteacher Christine Jones resigned and Peter Rowe, Headteacher of Princes Risborough School was on secondment to the school for a term whilst a new headteacher was recruited. Peter Rowe was brought into Princes Risborough School after an unsatisfactory inspection in 2004. In July 2008, Angela Wells was appointed as acting Headteacher and she was later confirmed as the new Headteacher.. On the 3 October 2008 Ofsted published its findings from a monitoring visit and found that progress since being subject to special measures was inadequate. However, a subsequent monitoring visit conducted by Ofsted in January 2009 found that the school had made satisfactory progress. A full inspection was carried out in June 2009 which saw the school removed from special measures and awarded an overall grade of satisfactory with some good areas. In February 2016, the school was recognised as 'good' in all areas by Ofsted.

He set five poems by Mathilde Wesendonck while he was working on his opera Tristan und Isolde. The songs, together with the Siegfried Idyll, are the two non-operatic works by Wagner most regularly performed.  History  Villa Wesendonck, Z√ºrich The songs are settings of poems by Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of one of Richard Wagner's patrons. Wagner had become acquainted with Otto Wesendonck in Z√ºrich, where he had fled on his escape from Saxony after the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. For a time Wagner and his wife Minna lived together in the (German for Asylum in the sense of \\"sanctuary\\"), a small cottage on the Wesendonck estate. It is sometimes claimed that Wagner and Mathilde had a love affair; in any case, the situation and mutual infatuation certainly contributed to the intensity in the conception of Tristan und Isolde.Newman (1976a), pp. 530‚Äì2; 540‚Äì557 Wagner sold the settings to the publisher Schott in 1860 for 1000 francs.Newman (1976b). p. 192 The first published version (1862) was titled F√ºnf Gedichte f√ºr eine Frauenstimme (Five poems for a female voice), and the first performance was given at the publisher's residence in Mainz, by the soprano Emilie Genast, accompanied by Hans von B√ºlow.Millington (2001), p. 318. No name was given for the author of the texts at the first publication; it was not publicly revealed until after Mathilde's death (1902). The present order of the songs appears for the first time in the published version, and this has raised doubts as to whether the sequence is a genuine song cycle, or should be regarded simply as a collection of individual pieces.Vazsonyi (2013), p. 715.  The songs  # \\"\\" (\\"The Angel\\"), composed November 1857 # \\"\\" (\\"Be still!\\"), composed February 1858 # \\"\\" (\\"In the Greenhouse\\"), composed May 1858 # \\"\\" (\\"Sorrows\\"), composed December 1857 # \\"\\" (\\"Dreams\\"), composed December 1857 Wagner himself called two of the songs \\"studies\\" for Tristan und Isolde, using for the first time certain musical ideas that are later developed in the opera. In \\"\\" can be heard the roots of the love duet in Act 2, while \\"\\" (the last of the five to be composed) uses music later developed extensively for the prelude to Act 3.  Versions  Wagner initially wrote the songs for female voice and piano alone, but produced an orchestrated version of \\"Tr√§ume\\", to be performed by chamber orchestra (with violin playing the voice part) beneath Mathilde's window on the occasion of her birthday, 23 December 1857. Some male singers have sung some of the songs: Lauritz Melchior recorded \\"\\" and \\"Tr√§ume\\" for HMV in 1923, \\"\\" has been recorded by tenors Franco Corelli (in French), Pl√°cido Domingo, Jonas Kaufmann, Andrea Bocelli, and the bass Paata Burchuladze. A few have attempted the whole cycle in performance, including Ren√© Kollo. Tenor Stuart Skelton recorded the entire cycle in 2018,, as did Christoph Pr√©gardien in 2019. The orchestration of all five songs was completed for large orchestra by Felix Mottl, the Wagner conductor. In 1972 the Italian composer Vieri Tosatti entirely re-orchestrated the songs. In 1976 the German composer Hans Werner Henze produced a chamber version for the songs. Each of the players has a separate part, with some very unusual wind registration. French composer Christophe Looten wrote a transcription for voice and string quartet (Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, March 2015). In 2013 (the bicentennial of Wagner's birth) the French composer Alain Bonardi released a new version for voice, piano, clarinet and cello, including instrumental interludes with oriental resonant percussions. In the same year, the Chinese-British composer Jeffrey Ching premiered his Wesendonck Sonata, for voice, viola (or cello), and piano. Ching transposed Wagner's original songs so as to form a closed palindromic tonal sequence in the manner of a five-movement sonata, and also added an elaborate obbligato part for viola (or cello), which comments on the poems and adds harmonic and contrapuntal detail to Wagner's accompaniment. Clytus Gottwald arranged \\"Im Treibhaus\\" and \\"Tr√§ume\\" for 16-voice choir a cappella in 2004 as Zwei Studien zu \\"Tristan und Isolde\\". References Notes Sources * Millington, Barry (ed.)

He was born in Palermo, Sicily and began his career in the 1950s, although his career only really took off in the 1960s. He starred in many comedies, mainly appearing together with Franco Franchi as the comedy duo Franco and Ciccio. During the 1980s he also did television work. On the 1966 film Due Marines e un Generale he worked with Buster Keaton and Franco Franchi. The comedy duo Franco & Ciccio In 1959, Franco Franchi finally settled a contract with his friend Ciccio Ingrassia to start a brilliant career in the theater. From 1961 until the end in 1992, the two friends will be the most famous comedy duo in Italy. In fact, the secret of their success is the creation of two Sicilian buffoons characters, charlatans and extremely messy, very similar to those of Tot√≤ and Peppino De Filippo, or Laurel and Hardy. Franco Franchi becomes the funny \\"Franco\\", a young man completely out of his mind which expresses itself only with the facial expressions and the movements of the rest of the body. Turns into Ciccio Ingrassia, the skeletal and mustachioed bully which believe him best of friend, but in reality he is much more stupid than him when the two characters have to resolve a difficult situation. Another feature of the commercial success and popular of the two characters is the use of the body as a means of communication and simple lines, sharp and not at all vulgar. With these tricks up its sleeve, as both actors will be challenged in youth theater, Franco and Ciccio thanks to their friend Domenico Modugno began to pursue a film career as extras. Then they are noticed by directors of small comedy and so their film career begins. In all years, the two actors churn out at least ten films, working at a pace unimaginable today. In fact, because these days very fast film products are among the best. And unfortunately the criticism then he cut down every film of Franco and Ciccio coming out to the movies, calling it useless and meaningless pecoreccio comedian. However, the popular success of films of Franco and Ciccio was huge and always has been until now in Italy and also in foreign countries. The specialty of the many films of Franco and Ciccio is improvisation during the scenes, as did Toto and De Filippo, but also the use of parody. In fact there are many foreign films chosen by the two above you to pluck a fun comedy, as the saga of James Bond and that of the great adventure films.

In a wavelength region where the light is absorbed, the absolute magnitude of the optical rotation at first varies rapidly with wavelength, crosses zero at absorption maxima and then again varies rapidly with wavelength but in the opposite direction. This phenomenon was discovered in 1895 by the French physicist Aim√© Cotton (1869-1951).

To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output and real interest rates can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that real GDP and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal money supply or the rate of inflation. An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is neutral, affecting only the price level, not real variables. As such, if the classical dichotomy holds, money only affects absolute rather than the relative prices between goods. The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre- Keynesian economists (\\"money as a veil\\") as a long-run proposition and is found today in new classical theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run Phillips curve which can shift vertically according to the rational expectations being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy. Keynesians and monetarists reject the classical dichotomy, because they argue that prices are sticky. That is, they think prices fail to adjust in the short run, so that an increase in the money supply raises aggregate demand and thus alters real macroeconomic variables. Post-Keynesians reject the classic dichotomy as well, for different reasons, emphasizing the role of banks in creating money, as in monetary circuit theory.

Dunces are often comedically shown wearing paper cone hats, known as dunce caps with the word \\"dunce\\" or \\"dumb\\", or simply a capital D, on them. Schoolchildren were sometimes compelled to wear a dunce cap and to stand or sit on a stool in the corner as a form of punishment for misbehaving or for failing to demonstrate that they had properly performed their studies. Origins The word is derived from the name of the Scottish Scholastic theologian and philosopher John Duns Scotus. Along with Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham, he was one of the leading Scholastic philosopher-theologians of the High Middle Ages. Duns Scotus wrote treatises on theology, grammar, logic and metaphysics, which were widely influential throughout Western Europe, earning Duns the papal accolade Doctor Subtilis (Subtle Teacher). Duns remains highly esteemed in the Roman Catholic Church, and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993. The followers of Duns Scotus were called the Dunses, Dunsmen, or Scotists.\\"dunce, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. When in the sixteenth century the Scotists argued against Renaissance humanism, the term duns or dunce became, in the mouths of the Protestants, a term of abuse and a synonym for one incapable of scholarship. This was the etymology given by Richard Stanyhurst. Samuel Johnson, on the other hand, maintained that the source of the word was unknown. Dunce cap A young boy wearing a dunce cap in class, from a staged photo A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's cap or dunce's hat, is a pointed hat, formerly used as an article of discipline in schools in Europe and the United States. In popular culture, it is typically made of paper and often marked with a D or the word \\"dunce\\", and given to unruly schoolchildren to wear. Frequently the \\"dunce\\" was made to stand in the corner, facing the wall. The hope was that no one would want to be labelled the \\"dunce\\" in the class, even for a short period of time, and thus students would avoid misbehaviour. Examples of behaviour which could warrant the dunce cap included throwing spitballs, passing notes, or pulling of hair. Class clowns were frequently admonished with the dunce cap. In modern pedagogy, punishments like dunce caps have fallen out of favor. According to The Straight Dope, Duns Scotus recommended the wearing of conical hats to stimulate the brain ‚Äì so-called \\"thinking caps\\". (This notion is the likely source of the pointed hats traditionally worn by wizards, etc.) However, the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition) records that the term \\"dunce cap\\" itself did not enter the English language until after the term \\"dunce\\" had become a synonym for \\"fool\\" or \\"dimwit\\". In fact, \\"dunce cap\\" is not recorded before the 1833 travel book America, and the Americans by James Boardman. John Ford's 1624 play The Sun's Darling is the first recorded mention of the related term \\"dunce table,\\" a table provided for duller or poorer students. On the TV game show Win Ben Stein's Money, a player who answered in the form of a question (as required on the game show Jeopardy!) was required to wear a dunce cap. Literary dunce A literary dunce is a person, either real or fictional, who is used in literature as a target of satire. This usage of the term derives from Alexander Pope's landmark poetic satire The Dunciad. Dunces are not villains, although they can be villainous, as much as they are held up as the epitome of stupidity, imposture, and connivance.

Early years Wong grew up in a small flat in Tai Wong Street East (Â§ßÁéãÊù±Ë°ó) in Wan Chai. He sold ice cream with his father for a monthly income of HK$300-HK$400. Wong graduated from secondary school at Queen's College in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. His top marks meant that he secured scholarships every year while studying at the College. In the 1980s, the family moved to Wah Fu Estate in Aberdeen. However, his father continued selling ice cream until Wong returned from studying in England. He read law at Magdalene College, Cambridge while on a Prince Philip Scholarship. Career Wong undertook pupillage with Andrew Li, and was the latter's last ever pupil. In 1987, he was called to both the Bar of England & Wales and the Bar of Hong Kong. He was appointed a Senior Counsel in 2002. He sat as a Deputy High Court Judge of the Court of First Instance in July 2003,\\"G.N. 4195\\" Hong Kong Government Gazette (No. 26, Vol. 7, 27 June 2003) and was a Council member of the Hong Kong Bar Association from 1989 to 1990, from 1997 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2005. He was also Chairman of the Special Committee on Legal Education of the Association from 2003 to 2005. He then served as the second Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong between 20 October 2005 and 30 June 2012, under Donald Tsang Yam-kuen. Since his retirement from governmental office, Wong has resumed private practice as a barrister at Temple Chambers, with a broad civil and commercial practice. Wong has served as Chairman of the Buildings Appeal Tribunal, of the Criminal and Law Enforcement Injuries Compensation Boards, and of the Non-local Higher and Professional Education Appeal Board.Biodata On the Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy, Wong described the National People's Congress Standing Committee interpretation of the Basic Law as a \\"pity\\" and \\"avoidable\\". He added that ‚Äúfrom the constitutional and legal perspective, the National People‚Äôs Congress Standing Committee undoubtedly has the power to interpret every single clause of the Basic Law ... but at the same time, there is no doubt that such power must be exercised with extreme restraint and only when it is unavoidable‚Äù. When former Chief Executive Donald Tsang was found guilty of one count of misconduct in public office in 2017, Wong personally wrote a ten-page letter of mitigation, stating that \\"[Tsang's] significant contributions to Hong Kong in the past over 4 decades should be properly recognized.\\" Donald truly a 'son of Hong Kong,' Wong Yan-lung says Personal life Wong has three daughters with his wife, Esther Chan. He met his wife while doing charity work between 1991 and 1996, and married in 1996. He received several hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars as a wedding gift from his wife's wealthy family, which he, in turn, gave to organisations for the homeless. He is a devout Christian. He has also served as Vice-Chairman of the CEDAR Fund and Member of the Steering Committee and Volunteer of the Hong Kong Christian Concern for the Homeless. Awards and Honours Wong was elected as a Master of the Bench of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in 2007. He was made an Honorary Fellow of Magdalene College, University of Cambridge in 2009. He has also received honorary degrees from Lingnan University, Shue Yan University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the Open University of Hong Kong, and the University of Hong Kong.

While humanity does not yet possess the technological ability to perform stellar engineering of any kind, stellar manipulation (or husbandry), requiring substantially less technological advancement than would be needed to create a new star, could eventually be performed in order to stabilize or prolong the lifetime of a star, mine it for useful material (known as star lifting) or use it as a direct energy source. Since a civilization advanced enough to be capable of manufacturing a new star would likely have vast material and energy resources at its disposal, it almost certainly wouldn't need to do so. In science fiction Many science fiction authors have explored the possible applications of stellar engineering, among them Iain M Banks, Larry Niven and Arthur C. Clarke. In the novel series Star Carrier by Ian Douglas the Sh‚Äôdaar species merge many stars to make blue giants, which then explode to become black holes. These perfectly synchronized black holes form a Tipler cylinder called the Texagu Resh gravitational anomaly. In the novel series The Book of The New Sun by Gene Wolfe, the brightness of Urth's sun seems to have been reduced by artificial means. In the season 3 (1989) episode \\"Take Me to Your Leader\\" of the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon, Krang, Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady use a Solar Siphon to aim towards the Sun, and store the solar energy into compact batteries, freezing the Earth making it too cold for people to resist them.Ninjaturtles - Take Me to Your Leader In episode 12 of Stargate Universe, Destiny was dropped prematurely out of FTL by an uncharted star that the crew determines to be artificially created and younger than 200 million years old with an Earth- sized planet containing a biosphere exactly like Earth's being the only planet in the system. In Firefly (TV series), set 500 years in the future, several gas giants are \\"Helioformed\\" to create viable suns for the surrounding planets and moons. In the Space Empires series the last available technology for research is called Stellar Manipulation. In addition to the ability to create and destroy stars, this branch also gives a race the ability to create and destroy black holes, wormholes, nebulae, planets, ringworlds and sphereworlds. Just as described above, this technology is so advanced that once the player has the ability to use them, they usually don't need them anymore. This is even more the case with the last two; once one of these megastructures is complete, the race controlling the ringworld or sphereworld has almost unlimited resources, usually leading to defeat of the others.Stellar Manipulation (SEIV) In The Saga of the Seven Suns, by Kevin J.

Optical rotatory dispersion can be used to find the absolute configuration of metal complexes. For example, when plane-polarized white light from an overhead projector is passed through a cylinder of sucrose solution, a spiral rainbow is observed perpendicular to the cylinder.  Principles of operation  When white light passes through a polarizer, the extent of rotation of light depends on its wavelength. Short wavelengths are rotated more than longer wavelengths, per unit of distance. Because the wavelength of light determines its color, the variation of color with distance through the tube is observed. This dependence of specific rotation on wavelength is called optical rotatory dispersion. In all materials the rotation varies with wavelength. The variation is caused by two quite different phenomena. The first accounts in most cases for the majority of the variation in rotation and should not strictly be termed rotatory dispersion. It depends on the fact that optical activity is actually circular birefringence. In other words, a substance which is optically active transmits right circularly polarized light with a different velocity from left circularly polarized light. In addition to this pseudodispersion which depends on the material thickness, there is a true rotatory dispersion which depends on the variation with wavelength of the indices of refraction for right and left circularly polarized light. For wavelengths that are absorbed by the optically active sample, the two circularly polarized components will be absorbed to differing extents. This unequal absorption is known as circular dichroism. Circular dichroism causes incident linearly polarized light to become elliptically polarized. The two phenomena are closely related, just as are ordinary absorption and dispersion. If the entire optical rotatory dispersion spectrum is known, the circular dichroism spectrum can be calculated, and vice versa. = Chirality = In order for a molecule (or crystal) to exhibit circular birefringence and circular dichroism, it must be distinguishable from its mirror image. An object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image is said to be chiral, and optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism are known as chiroptical properties. Most biological molecules have one or more chiral centers and undergo enzyme-catalyzed transformations that either maintain or invert the chirality at one or more of these centers. Still other enzymes produce new chiral centers, always with a high specificity. These properties account for the fact that optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism are widely used in organic and inorganic chemistry and in biochemistry. In the absence of magnetic fields, only chiral substances exhibit optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. In a magnetic field, even substances that lack chirality rotate the plane of polarized light, as shown by Michael Faraday. Magnetic optical rotation is known as the Faraday effect, and its wavelength dependence is known as magnetic optical rotatory dispersion. In regions of absorption, magnetic circular dichroism is observable.

Biography K√ºhne was born at Hamburg on 28 March 1837. After attending the gymnasium in L√ºneburg, he went to G√∂ttingen, where his master in chemistry was Friedrich W√∂hler and in physiology Rudolph Wagner. Having graduated in 1856, he studied under various famous physiologists, including Emil du Bois-Reymond at Berlin, Claude Bernard in Paris, and KFW Ludwig and EW von Br√ºcke in Vienna. At the end of 1863 he was put in charge of the chemical department of the pathological laboratory at Berlin, under Rudolf Virchow; in 1868 he was appointed professor of physiology at Amsterdam; and in 1871 he was chosen to succeed Hermann von Helmholtz in the same capacity at Heidelberg, where he died on 10 June 1900. Works K√ºhne's original work falls into two main groups, the physiology of muscle and nerve, which occupied the earlier years of his life, and the chemistry of digestion, which he began to investigate while at Berlin with Virchow. In 1876, he discovered the protein-digesting enzyme trypsin. He was also known for his research on vision and the chemical changes occurring in the retina under the influence of light. Using the \\"visual purple\\" (or rhodopsin), described by Franz Christian Boll in 1876, he attempted to make the basis of a photochemical theory of vision, but though he was able to establish its importance in connection with vision in light of low intensity, its absence from the retinal area of most distinct vision detracted from the completeness of the theory and precluded its general acceptance. K√ºhne also pioneered the process of optography, the generation of an image from the retina of a rabbit by applying a chemical process to fix the state of the rhodopsin in the eye.Daintith, John (2010): Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists, Third Edition Later, K√ºhne attempted his technique on the eye of a convicted murderer from Bruchsal, Germany with inconclusive results.Lanska DJ: Optograms and criminology: science, news reporting, and fanciful novels.

He was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1898. Some notable students Jos√© Rizal (1861‚Äì1896), martyr and national hero of the Philippines, learned physiology under Professor K√ºhne at the Heidelberg University in 1886. Ida Henrietta Hyde (1857‚Äì1945) wanted to study physiology under K√ºhne at the University of Heidelberg on the recommendation of Professor Alexander Goette at Strasbourg. The University accepted her, but Willhelm K√ºhne refused to allow her in lectures and laboratories. He is reported to have said that he would never allow \\"skirts\\" in his classes. However, when a colleague asked him whether, if at the end of the course she could pass the examination, he would grant her the degree, he jokingly replied that he would. And so for six semesters, she had to study physiology independent of the classroom and of hands-on laboratory projects, using only his assistants' notes and lab sketches. Finally, a four-hour oral examination by K√ºhne's academic committee, proved her worthiness. The \\"summa cum laude\\" degree, the highest honors, could not go to a woman, so K√ºhne invented a new phrase: \\"Multa Cum Laude Superavit\\" in English meaning \\"she overcame with much praise.\\" Hyde completed the PhD at Heidelberg in 1896, the first woman to receive one for this type of work. K√ºhne recommended her for a position at the Heidelberg-supported research program at the Naples Marine Biological Laboratory in Naples Italy, where she studied the nature and function of salivary glands. She was a life member of this organization, and its secretary from 1897 to 1900.

It occupies a large rural site with views of the countryside in one direction and overlooking Wing village and its Saxon church in the other. The school takes children from the age of eleven through to the age of eighteen. The school has 1300 students, of which over 170 are in the Sixth Form. The school serves a large rural catchment in the north of Buckinghamshire, as well as parts of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Since 2009 the school has been oversubscribed at Year 7. The last Ofsted report in 2009 stated; ‚ÄúA high proportion of parents responded to the parental questionnaire. The majority are positive about the work of the school, in particular the recent improvements. Parents value the support provided by the school for students.‚Äù History The Cottesloe School has grown rapidly over the last ten years with the building of three teaching blocks. The latest build is that of a dining room. Work on the dining room and its kitchens were completed in February 2011. A ¬£3m Sports Hall was expected to be finished in mid-2014. Sixth Form In 2005 fewer than 70 students attended the Sixth Form but in 2010 there were over 170 on roll. This has impacted on facilities but with the new dining hall in place as of February 2011, more space has been freed up. Each year there is a Head Boy, Head Girl and Deputies appointed and these help constitute the Sixth Form Committee. Other members include the Head Boy and Head Girl, plus two deputies, from each of the four Houses (Austen, Churchill, Nightingale and Shakespeare). Houses There are four main Houses, Austen; Churchill; Nightingale and Shakespeare, each led by a member of staff and a Head Boy, Head Girl and two deputies. In 2010 Churchill won the overall house competition. These houses are, however, no longer in use at the school. Specialism In September 2006 the school was awarded Specialist Status as an arts college, by the Department for Education and Skills. The specialism is in the Arts, made up of Art and Photography, Drama and English. This was re-designated in July 2010. The specialist schools programme has now ended, however the school continues to offer the Arts as a specialism. Developments In January 2008, the school was awarded Sports mark status by the English Sports Council. During the last academic year (2009‚Äì10), the school was presented with a Healthy Schools award The school has received funding from the local council to build a dining hall. This was completed and opened in February 2011. The dining hall seats 250 students at any one time. In addition to this, the kitchen operates as a satellite kitchen to feeder schools in the area. Working with the local community The school has worked closely with feeder schools, providing support through its Arts Specialism. Two local feeder schools were involved in the productions of ‚ÄòJoseph' and the performance of ‚ÄòOliver' (Dec 2010). As part of their Sixth Form study, students participate in an Enrichment Programme. For the last three years, this has involved students working with MacIntyre School and Carey Lodge, Wing. MacIntyre School, Wingrave, is an independent special boarding school which meets the needs of 36 young people who are described as having complex learning difficulties. Many of the students have autism, severe learning disabilities, epilepsy, behavioural problems, communication difficulties, sensory impairments, and may exhibit challenging behaviour if frightened or confused. The Cottesloe School students support them in the classrooms when their enrichment programme. Carey Lodge is a 75-room residential and dementia care home built on the site of the old ‚ÄòWing Lodge'. The students have been involved in projects, such as designing a sensory garden for the residents, as well as visiting on a weekly basis and reading to the residents, playing cards and board games and just communicating with the residents.

Background The word drots/drost seems to be of German origin (Truchsess) and means a steward or a leader of the household; in Dutch language however, a drost or drossaard was a historical kind of bailiff in parts of the Low Countries. During the Scandinavian Early Middle Age it developed into an even more powerful political position. The drots was responsible of administering royal justice. Other powers easily became added to the position. The Lord High Constable (marsk) and Lord High Chancellor were the other officers that sometimes held the premiership. The Drots held the privilege to be the Regent during a minority or absence of the king. Quite often, the drots acted as a kind of governor who was the king‚Äôs representative and at least officially had precedence over other officials. Less powerful holders of the office of drots often went into the background in favour of the chancellors or other high officers of state. The office seems to have appeared in Denmark in the 13th century and a bit later in Sweden and Norway. In Sweden, it acquired the official role of \\"second-in-command\\" and the regentship at the disappearance of the ancient office of Riksjarl with Birger jarl as the last holder of that office. It was not quite unusual that also mighty princes like Dukes, as well as royal consorts, had their own drost. In all three countries the post was abolished in the 1380s. In Denmark it was replaced in importance by the pre- existing title of Steward of the Realm. In Sweden it was soon revived before the mid-15th century and in the 17th century in a new version as Riksdrots, \\"Drots of the Realm\\" or \\"Imperial Drost\\", which was also used in Denmark for a short while after 1660. In North Western Germany the word ‚ÄúLanddrost‚Äù was used for noble district caretakers until the 19th century. In Hanover the heads of the governmental regions, Landdrosteien, were called Landdroste until 1885.

Based on the non-fiction book The Honest Courtesan by Margaret Rosenthal, the film is about Veronica Franco, a courtesan in sixteenth-century Venice who becomes a hero to her city, but later becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft. The film features a supporting cast that includes Fred Ward, Naomi Watts, Moira Kelly and Jacqueline Bisset. The film was released as A Destiny of Her Own in some regions, and was retitled The Honest Courtesan for its UK video release. Plot Veronica Franco is an adventurous, curious, slightly tomboyish young woman in Venice. Her lover Marco, who will be a Senator like his father, cannot marry her because her family is too poor; he marries a foreign noblewoman instead. Veronica's mother plans for her family's financial security, as she still requires dowries for her younger daughters and money for her son's commission. Rather than go to a convent, Veronica's mother suggests she become a courtesan, a highly paid, cultured prostitute like her mother and grandmother before her. At first Veronica is repelled by the idea, but once she discovers that courtesans are allowed access to libraries and education, she tentatively embraces the idea. Veronica quickly gains a reputation as a top courtesan, impressing the powerful men of Venice with her beauty, wit, and compassion. Marco finds it difficult to adjust to his new wife, who is nothing like Veronica, and becomes jealous as she takes his friends and relatives as lovers. After Marco's cousin Maffio, a poor bard who was once publicly upstaged by Veronica, attacks her, Marco rushes to her aid. They rekindle their romance, but Veronica refuses to stop seeing clients and accept his support. Nevertheless, she spends a great deal of time with Marco, neglecting her business and ignoring her mother's warnings that such a relationship is dangerous for her. The Fourth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì73) breaks out, and the city appeals to France for aid. Veronica is encouraged to seduce the King of France and secures a military alliance. Marco accuses her of enjoying being a courtesan, implying she ought to have rejected the King despite the risk to Venice. Veronica points out that she sacrificed their love for the good of the city, while he only did it to protect his family's political standing, and Marco leaves for war angry. While the Venetians are fighting at sea, a plague hits the city. Religious zealots take the war and plague as punishment for the city's moral degradation, and Veronica's home is quarantined and almost ransacked by a mob. Veronica is summoned to appear before the Inquisition on charges of witchcraft and refuses to name her clients. When it appears that she will be executed, Marco publicly shames the Venetian ministers and senators into admitting their own adulteries and sins by standing up in the assembly. Bewildered by the extent of sin in the city, the Inquisitor drops the charges of witchcraft, and Marco and Veronica reconcile.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gives it 3 1/2 stars and lauds the writers, noting that \\"few movies have been so deliberately told from a woman's point of view....Most movies are made by males and show women enthralled by men. This movie knows better.\\" Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"both blessed and cursed with inspiration.\\" In its initial release, Dangerous Beauty played in only 10 theatres, although it did well, earning $105,989 (a per theater average of $10,599 across ten theaters). Dangerous Beauty eventually opened across 313 theaters, but earned only $4.5 million in the United States. Stage versions A stage musical version of the film premiered on July 25, 2008 at Northwestern University's Ethel M. Barber Theatre. The musical features book and verse by Jeannine Dominy (the screenwriter of the film), lyrics by Amanda McBroom, and music by Michele Brourman under the direction of Sheryl Kaller. Another musical version of Dangerous Beauty premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in February 2011, starring Jenny Powers as Veronica Franco and James Snyder (actor) as Marco Venier.

It is given intravenously to treat upper gastro- intestinal cancers (e.g. esophageal carcinoma), anal cancers, and breast cancers, as well as by bladder instillation for superficial bladder tumours. It causes delayed bone marrow toxicity and therefore it is usually administered at 6-weekly intervals. Prolonged use may result in permanent bone-marrow damage. It may also cause lung fibrosis and renal damage. Mitomycin C has also been used topically rather than intravenously in several areas. The first is cancers, particularly bladder cancers and intraperitoneal tumours. It is now well known that a single instillation of this agent within 6 hours of bladder tumor resection can prevent recurrence. The second is in eye surgery where mitomycin C 0.02% is applied topically to prevent scarring during glaucoma filtering surgery and to prevent haze after PRK or LASIK; mitomycin C has also been shown to reduce fibrosis in strabismus surgery. The third is in esophageal and tracheal stenosis where application of mitomycin C onto the mucosa immediately following dilatation will decrease re-stenosis by decreasing the production of fibroblasts and scar tissue. Mitomycin C is a potent DNA crosslinker. A single crosslink per genome has shown to be effective in killing bacteria. This is accomplished by reductive activation of mitomycin to form a mitosene, which reacts successively via N-alkylation of two DNA bases. Both alkylations are sequence specific for a guanine nucleoside in the sequence 5'-CpG-3'. Potential bis-alkylating heterocylic quinones were synthetised in order to explore their antitumoral activities by bioreductive alkylation. Mitomycin is also used as a chemotherapeutic agent in glaucoma surgery. In the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, mitomycin C induces competence, a condition necessary for the process of natural transformation that transfers DNA and promotes recombination between cells. Exposure of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to mitomycin C increases recombination during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle. It has been suggested that during sexual process in prokaryotes (transformation) and eukaryotes (meiosis) DNA cross-links and other damages introduced by mitomycin C may be removed by recombinational repair.Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012). DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes. Chapter 1: pp.1-49 in: DNA Repair: New Research, Sakura Kimura and Sora Shimizu editors. Nova Sci. Publ., Hauppauge, N.Y. https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 Anticancer treatments with chemotherapeutic agents often impair brain cell function leading to memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. In order to understand the basis of these impairments, mice were treated with mitomycin C, a chemotherapeutic agent, and cells of the prefrontal cortex were examined. This treatment resulted in an increase of the oxidative DNA damage 8-oxo-dG, a decrease in the enzyme OGG1 that ordinarily repairs such damage and epigenetic alterations. These alterations at the DNA level may explain, at least in part, the impairments of cognitive function after chemotherapy. Mitomycin was discovered in the 1950s by Japanese scientists in cultures of the microorganism Streptomyces caespitosus. Mitomycin gel In April 2020, mitomycin gel, sold under the brand name Jelmyto, was approved in the United States for the treatment of low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). Urothelial cancer is a cancer of the lining of the urinary system. Common side effects are ureteric obstruction (narrowing or blockage of the ureter that may lead to excess fluid in the kidney due to a backup of urine), flank pain (pain occurring on the side of the body), urinary tract infection, hematuria (blood in the urine), renal dysfunction (inability of the kidney to function in its designed capacity), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, dysuria (painful or difficult urination) and vomiting. Pregnant women should not take mitomycin gel because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Mitomycin gel is an alkylating drug, meaning it inhibits the transcription of DNA into RNA, stopping protein synthesis and taking away the cancer cell's ability to multiply. It was approved based on the results of the OLYMPUS (NCT02793128) multicenter trial involving 71 subjects with low-grade UTUC. These subjects had never undergone treatment (treatment-na√Øve) or had recurrent low-grade non-invasive UTUC with at least one measurable papillary tumor (a tumor shaped like a small mushroom with its stem attached to the inner lining of an organ) located above the ureteropelvic junction. Subjects received mitomycin gel once a week (mitomycin gel 4 mg per mL instillations via ureteral catheter or nephrostomy tube) for six weeks and, if assessed as a complete response (complete disappearance of the papillary tumor), monthly for up to eleven additional months. Efficacy of mitomycin gel was evaluated using urine cytology (a test to look for abnormal cells in a subjects's urine), ureteroscopy (an examination of the upper urinary tract) and biopsy (if warranted) three months following the initiation of therapy. The primary endpoint was complete response at three months following initiation of therapy. A complete response was found in 41 of the 71 subjects (58%) following six treatments of mitomycin gel administered weekly. Durability of the effect of mitomycin gel in subjects with a complete response was also evaluated using urine cytology, ureteroscopy and biopsy (if warranted) every three months for a year following the initiation of therapy. Nineteen subjects (46%) who achieved a complete response continued to have a complete response at the twelve-month mark. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for mitomycin gel priority review along with breakthrough therapy, fast track, and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted approval of Jelmyto to UroGen Pharma, Inc.

It conducted applied research focusing on a number of application domains, such as government, defence and health care. It was a centre of excellence in distributed systems technologies and had an international reputation as one of the most effective and influential IT research organisations in Australia. DSTC was supported by the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) program and participants included universities, government, and industry players. The company DSTC Pty Ltd was created in 1992 to manage the CRC for Distributed Systems Technology. It completed its research program in June 2000. A second CRC was established in July 2000: the CRC for Enterprise Distributed System Technology which was also managed by DSTC Pty Ltd. This CRC completed its operations on 30 June 2006. DSTC was one of the most successful CRCs in Australia, and was a leading centre for expertise in distributed systems and information technology. It was a major contributor to the Australian information technology industry through its research, projects with industry, support for training and education. It organised the annual Evolve Conference, which brought leading international experts to Australia. It was a strong participant in international standards organisations such as the Object Management Group (OMG), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). The DSTC started and hosted the Australian W3C Office.  Spin-offs  Several spin-off companies were created from DSTC projects : * In 1997, Active Tools commercialised Nimrod, a tool for performing parameterised computations in a grid, as EnFuzion. EnFuzion is now owned and distributed by Axceleon. * In 2001, Wedgetail Communications commercialised several security products including ŒºPKI, a PKI library for small devices, and a Java Crypto and Security Implementation (JCSI) Single Sign-On product. In 2004, the company was bought by Vintela, which in 2005 was in turn bought by Quest Software. * In 2003, Mantara commercialised Elvin, a light-weight event notification service. In 2013, Mantara was effectively acquired by Deutsche Bank. * In 2004, Extensia Solutions commercialised the RecordPoint shared electronic health record system. * In 2006, distIP purchased some of the remaining intellectual property assets of DSTC. Trading as Veriluma, it commercialised the Sheba modeling system for intelligence assessment. In addition to these commercial ventures, one of DSTC's greatest legacies is its alumni, some of whom have taken on prominent positions in academia, whilst others have found employment in some of the world's leading ICT companies. DSTC also made a massive contribution to computer science education, playing a major role in the education of many computer science students (including a large number of PhDs) in Australia, and particularly in Brisbane. The CEO of DSTC in the early years had a prominent position in Queensland politics, which led to DSTC getting a few mentions in the Queensland parliament. Queensland premier Rob Borbidge dismissively referred to DSTC as \\"a sort of gigabyte playpen for a few propeller heads\\" (Hansard 1996), which DSTC staff adopted as an informal motto.

Life and career Butt graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering from MIT in 1941, where he was involved in varsity rowing. After graduation he moved to Northern Virginia. In 1949, he approached the administration at Washington-Lee High School, offering to start a rowing team. In their first season the team won the three most prestigious championships in the area: the Northern Virginia Championships, the Stotesbury Cup, and the National Schoolboy Championships held in Detroit, Michigan. Butt was head coach of Washington-Lee High School's Crew program in Arlington, Virginia for 41 years. He organised numerous rowing programs in the area, both scholastic and collegiate, and coached while working full-time for the Department of Defense as an Aeronautical Engineer. He coached the W-L Varsity Eight to win the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, England, in 1964, the first year the regatta was opened to foreign crews.http://www.hrr.co.uk/history-organisation/trophies/ Two years earlier, the crew had made the semi-finals of the regatta's Thames Challenge Cup against an international field. Since rowing was only a club sport at Washington-Lee, a public high school, most of the money was raised locally to take the crew and equipment to England. In 1969 the school won the Princess Elizabeth Cup a second time. Over the years, Washington-Lee also won 19 scholastic National titles and numerous Stotesbury Cup and Northern Virginia Championships. Butt coached several Olympians, including Tony Johnson, Sean Hall, E. Fredrick Borchelt (1984), and Walter Lubsen (1984). On six occasions (1967, 1971, 1977, 1978, 1980, and 1981), Butt was the coach of the US Junior World Championship team, reaching a high place of 8th in 1980 in Hazewinkel, Belgium. Butt also spent many summers and falls coaching rowers at Potomac Boat Club (PBC). Between 1961 and 1980 Charlie hosted and coached boats comprising parts of the Junior Men's National Team, rowing out of PBC. He also helped create the Sandy Run Regional Park rowing facility on the Occoquan River in Fairfax Station, Virginia, and consulted on the development of Thompson Boat Center, a public rowing facility in Washington, DC, located near the Kennedy Center. Personal life Charlie was married to Mildred Martin, a gym teacher at Washington-Lee from North Carolina. They lived in McLean, Virginia, and had five children: Susan, Sarah, Janie, Nancy and Charles III. In 1990, Butt was diagnosed with acute leukemia. He continued to coach into the fall of 1991, and died in Spring of 1992. A Charlie Butt Trophy is awarded to Boys JV8 at the Stotesbury Cup Regatta in May. A Charlie Butt Regatta is held each spring on the Potomac River for scholastic crews.

It was awarded a Green Flag Award in 2008Green Flag Awards - Belle Vue Park, Newport and has maintained the status for over a decade since. The Pavilion The Tea House Belle Vue Park gates, Cardiff Road, Newport History The land on which the park stands was a gift to Newport from Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar in 1891 to provide a public park for its citizens. An open competition to design and construct the park was won by the Cumbrian landscape architect T. H. Mawson. Mawson's winning design was initially designed incorrectly for the neighbouring field, the site of the then Newport and Monmouthshire Hospital, after Mawson misunderstood directions on his first visit to Newport. The mistake was not realised until the first site visit, after the contract had been awarded. As a result, the designer had to promptly re-evaluate his plans for the present site. The park was Mawson's first win in an open competition. He went on to become one of the foremost landscape architects of his time, responsible for the design of many gardens in his adopted Lake District, including Holker Hall and Rydal Hall as well as Dyffryn Gardens near Cardiff. In November 1892 Lord Tredegar performed the ceremony of cutting the first sod; construction began and the park opened on 8 September 1894. The final cost of the park is recorded as ¬£19,500. Features Belle Vue Park has many features typical of a Victorian public park, including the conservatories and pavilion, bandstand and rockeries. Additional features were added to the park throughout the years. The Gorsedd Stone Circle was erected in 1896, for the National Eisteddfod, held in Belle Vue Park in 1897. The bowling greens were opened in 1904 and a Tea House added in 1910. The bandstand and original series of cascades were restored in 2006. Tearooms Belle Vue Tearooms is a social enterprise caf√© located near the Pavilion. It is run by Cotyledon BMCIC, a Machen-based community interest company who also operate rural markets across South East Wales, including a monthly food and craft market which is held on the first Sunday of every month throughout 2020 starting from Sunday 1st March 2020. The tea rooms are open daily (including Christmas Day) from 9am - 4pm serving drinks and meals showcasing produce from the market traders. Weddings can be held at the conservatories and the bandstand, the function room can also be hired for parties, baby showers, meetings, birthdays etc. The caf√© was initially refurbished and opened by the Malpas based small business Parc Pantry, who handed back the premises to Newport City Council in 2018. Flora Belle Vue Park contains a number of rare specimens. In early Spring the Himalayan Magnolias produce huge goblet-shaped pink flowers and the branches of the Judas Trees can be seen covered with clusters of rose-lilac flowers in May. In June and July the Tulip Tree produces its distinctive orange tulip-shaped flowers. Autumn brings glorious leaf colour to many of the trees and shrubs. Of particular note are the clear yellow leaves of Ginkgo biloba, one of only four deciduous conifers that can be seen growing in the British Isles today, and the glorious crimson leaves of the Liquidambar, a native of the eastern United States.

Following that, he wrote the four crime novels featuring Wang Anzhuang, a mid-ranking detective in the Beijing Xing Zhen Ke (Criminal Investigation Department) and his wife, Rosina Lin, a nurse at the Capital Hospital. These are now being reissued as ebooks, with Wang's name changed to Bao Zheng (a reference to a hero of traditional Chinese detective stories from the Song Dynasty). On completing this series, West concentrated on co-authoring books aimed at entrepreneurs and small businesses, the first of which was The Beermat Entrepreneur,Sydney Hazelton, Review: The Beermat Entrepreneur by Mike Southon and Chris West, ReviewStream.com. co-authored with entrepreneur and speaker Mike Southon Mike Southon ‚Äî Life Story , Beermat.biz.

The islands belong to the Kalangala District and lie in the north-western section of Lake Victoria. Many of the 84 islands are uninhabited except for a few fishermen, and the forests and swamps around some of the coasts make the islands a good habitat for birds, including whale-headed stork, herons, geese, grey parrot, kingfishers, and fish eagles. The virtually virgin land is rich in plant life, and many, of the species are reportedly new to botanists. Culture In the religion of the Buganda people, Bubembe Island is the home of the temple of Mukasa. Wildlife The wildlife on the islands includes hippopotamus and crocodile, found near the shores. Waterbuck roam freely, as does the shy sitatunga antelope. In the forested areas, chimpanzees and monkeys swing from the trees. Vervet monkey, colobus monkey, a prolific variety of water and forest birds including hornbill, touraco, flycatcher, weaver, fish eagle, paradise flycatcher, colourful butterflies are common. Environmental destruction Recently, the vegetable oil producer Bidco has started to bulldoze parts of the island to set up monocultures of oil palm, used for cosmetics and biofuels.

Ivan Ivanovich was made to look as lifelike as possible, with eyes, eyebrows, eyelashes, and a mouth. He was dressed in a cosmonaut suit and strongly resembled a dead person due to the effect later named uncanny valley. For this reason a sign reading \\"–ú–ê–ö–ï–¢\\" (Russian for \\"dummy\\") was placed under his visor so that anyone who found him after his missions would not think he was a dead cosmonaut or an alien.  First Spaceflight  He first flew into space on Korabl-Sputnik 4 on 9 March 1961, accompanied by a dog named Chernushka, various reptiles, and 80 mice and guinea pigs, some of which were placed inside his body. To test the spacecraft's communication systems, an automatic recording of a choir was placed in Ivanovich's body - this way, any radio stations who heard the recording would understand it was not a real person. Ivan was also used to test the landing system upon return to Earth, when he was successfully ejected from the capsule and parachuted to the ground. His second space flight, Korabl-Sputnik 5, on 26 March 1961, was similar - he was again accompanied by a dog, Zvyozdochka, and other animals, he had a recording of a choir (and also a recipe for cabbage soup to confuse any listeners) inside him, and he safely returned to Earth. These flights paved the way for Vostok 1, the first manned flight into space on 12 April 1961.  Other Uses  In 1993, Ivan was auctioned at Sotheby's, with the winning bid coming from a foundation belonging to US businessman Ross Perot. He fetched $189,500. Since 1997, he has been on loan to the National Air and Space Museum, where he was on display, still in his spacesuit, until 2017 when he was moved back into the private collection of Ross Perot. In 2006, the name Ivan Ivanovich was used as a nickname for SuitSat-1, a satellite made from a disused spacesuit, ejected from the International Space Station.

The book chronicles his enlistment, flight training, deployment to and experiences in Vietnam, and his experiences after returning from the war.  Writing, publishing, and reaction  Mason was encouraged to write his Vietnam memoir by Knox Burger, the editor of an author-friend of Mason (Bill Smith, better known as Martin Cruz Smith). He began writing Chickenhawk on May 17, 1979 while living in Florida. The first chapter written became the fifth chapter in the finished book. By February 1980, Mason had a 200-page partial manuscript (about one-third), and an outline of the rest of his memoir. Knox agreed to offer the book to publishers. While waiting to see whether Burger could sell the book, after several rejections (i.e. \\"it is good but no one wants to read about Vietnam\\"), Mason was running a paper route each night, 100 miles on back roads, and his car blew up. He decided to take a job sailing as a deckhand on a 30-foot boat to Colombia. As he puts it \\"I found out I could be bought.\\" In January 1981 he was arrested with a boatload of marijuana from Colombia in a creek in South Carolina.Chickenhawk:Back in the World In early 1981, while awaiting trial on the criminal charges, Mason learned that Viking Press had purchased Chickenhawk and started work on finishing the book. He didn't tell Viking about the bust. He wrote steadily submitting each third of the manuscript on time.Chickenhawk:Back in the World By Christmas of that year, the manuscript was finished. Editing was completed by June 1982. In the meantime, in March 1982, Mason was convicted on the smuggling charges. In August 1982, he was sentenced to five years in a minimum-security prison, but was allowed to remain free on bail pending an appeal of his conviction. In early August 1983, Chickenhawk was published. Early reviews were positive, including a glowing review in The New York Times. He was booked for an appearance on The Today Show and was interviewed several times. A film version directed by John Carpenter was announced but never made.Prendergast, Mark The Redemption Of Robert Mason',' South Florida Sun-Sentinel June 23, 1985 In the midst of this, Mason's appeals were exhausted and he learned that his incarceration was set to begin on August 19, 1983. The Today Show appearance took place August 15, and sales of the book benefited from the author's own ongoing drama as well as his widely praised writing. Mason was released on May 17, 1985. While he was imprisoned, Chickenhawk had become a hardcover and paperback best-seller. He was unable to write while in prison. Mason has subsequently published two novels, Solo and Weapon, as well as a second memoir, Chickenhawk: Back in the World.  Synopsis  Chickenhawk deals chronologically with Mason's training and his experiences in, and immediately after, Vietnam. The book begins with Mason's training at the Army's Primary Helicopter School at Fort Wolters, Texas. After graduation in May 1965, he eventually learns he will be sent to Vietnam, making the trip in August with the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) aboard the . The Cavalry is initially posted to An Khe, in central South Vietnam, where Mason first experiences combat. The book then details his year- long posting, including the Battle of Ia Drang, R&R; periods in Saigon and Taiwan, his encounters with soldiers of the South Vietnamese army, and his experiences piloting the UH-1 \\"Huey\\". Mason eventually transfers to another unit, which is engaged in an unofficial side-business of delivering ice in return for favours and various commodities. In August 1966, as Mason approaches the end of his posting, he develops some signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, which grew worse after his return. In an epilogue, Mason sketches out his activities upon returning to the US, including his incarceration for smuggling.  Sequel  Mason's post-Vietnam activities were expanded upon in Mason's sequel, Chickenhawk: Back in the World, which was published in 1993.

Free People's Concert. South Africa Ian Fraser (born 18 April 1962) is a South African playwright, writer, comedian, anti-Apartheid activist, artist, anarchist, and social agitator, now living in the USA. He began as South Africa's first street-level comedian, \\"ranting-verse\\" poet, and acerbic anti-government satirist. He has consistently been a pro-democracy, anti-establishment voice, both under Apartheid and under the new dispensation in South Africa. Fraser has won many awards for his plays, including the 1992 Amstel Playwright of the Year Award and the 1992 Tonight-AA Life Vita Award for Comedy. His comedic work has been compared with that of Americans Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks, and his dramatic writing to that of Charles Bukowski, William Burroughs, and Tom Stoppard. Critics characterised Fraser's work as alternatively swinging between brutality and violence, and delicacy, sensitivity and grace. Alongside his plays, Fraser also performed eight \\"one- man\\" satire shows, primarily at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival in South Africa, Africa's largest Arts Festival. His works repeatedly won the coveted \\"Pick of the Fringe\\" award. Biography Born Brent Haupt, Fraser did not finish high school or complete any formal training. After being conscripted in the then South African Defence Force, for a two-year period (1981‚Äì82), he began to write and perform his own material from 1985 onwards. Fraser's experiences in the South African Defence Force provided much of the background for his first novel, published by Penguin Books (My Own Private Orchestra, ). In 1994, he began writing as an Internet technology columnist for the Johannesburg daily newspaper, The Star. He later wrote a weekly \\"Fraser's Razor\\" column for the Mail and Guardian newspaper. From 1994, he gradually became regarded as one of the leading voice-over talents in South Africa. He was an official on-air \\"voice\\" for the South African Broadcasting Corporation and their TV 2 channel. One of his popular TV ads for a hotel chain in South Africa (City Lodge) has emerged on YouTube.\\"Lessons from the Boot of a Car by Reg Lascaris: City Lodge (Soggy pants) TV advert\\". YouTube. Fraser was threatened with police and legal action because of one of his fictional blog postings, Killing the President. This short work stands as one of the harshest satiric attacks ever on the ruling African National Congress government and Deputy President Jacob Zuma. The government was not amused, and only timely intervention by the Freedom of Expression Institute on Fraser's behalf prevented charges of treason and sedition. In April 2006, Fraser relocated to the United States, where he is now a legal resident. He is writing novels and raising children. The University of Wisconsin's Oshkosh Theater, staged Dogs of the Blue Godshttp://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/history and The Sugar Plum Fairyhttp://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/history in early 2008. He won the AcidTheatre's Freedom of Speech Monologue Competition 2007, in the UK, for Putting the Fun Back into School Shootings. It was staged in Scotland in 2008, retitled for legal reasons, The Normal Sound of Architecture. The National English Literary Museum in Grahamstown, South Africa, contains a large collection of Fraser's papers and writings, as part of their collection of South African writers and playwrights. In July 2009, his Dogs of the Blue Gods play was staged at Brown University at Brown/Trinity Playwrights Repertory Theatre.

About Dr. Christopher West has been delivering lectures since 1997, mostly on topics such as Christian anthropology, the Creed, morality, sacraments, marriage, sexuality, and family life. He has also spoken on national radio and on television. He is a cofounder of the Theology of the Body Institute, which offers graduate level courses and other training programs on the Theology of the Body. He is currently Senior Lecturer of Theology and Christian Anthropology at the Institute, and his week-long courses there draw students from around the world. He and his wife, Wendy, reside in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (USA),About Christopher West and have five children. Education Dr. Christopher West graduated from Lancaster Catholic High School in 1988. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology in 1992 from the University of Maryland. In 1996 he was certified as an Instructor of Marriage Preparation from the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. In 1997, he obtained a Master of Theological Studies at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family at The Catholic University of America, and became a Certified Catechist by the Archdiocese of Denver Catechetical School. He has also received an honorary doctorate from DeSales University. In December 2019 West received a Doctor of Theology degree from Pontifex University, which is based in Atlanta, GA. Commentaries Cecilia LeChevallier, Coordinator, Marriage Preparation and Natural Family Planning, Diocese of Camden, NJ commented that \\"Christopher West is able to synthesize the Theology of the Body in an understandable and exciting way that gets people excited about it and excited about living it.\\" Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap. Archbishop of Philadelphia says that \\"Christopher West‚Äôs keen grasp of John Paul II‚Äôs Theology of the Body and his ability to make it accessible to others is changing lives, strengthening marriages, and renewing people‚Äôs faith in the Church across the country and internationally.\\" More recently, he said: \\"I‚Äôve known and respected Christopher for many years. He served with good effect on my staff in Denver early in my tenure there. He‚Äôs done a wonderful job translating John Paul II‚Äôs Theology of the Body into popular practice.\\"Christopher West ‚Äî Endorsements. Theologian David L. Schindler charged that West promotes a \\"pansexualist tendency\\" that ties all important human and supernatural activity back to sex without making necessary distinctions. Moral theologian Dr. Janet Smith defended West, saying his work is \\"completely sound\\" and that she found Schindler's response \\"puzzling.\\" Smith, in her response to Schindler's critique, says that Schindler \\"provides a list of his objections to West‚Äôs theology without citing one text to substantiate his charges...As it stands, I do not find that his concerns correspond with what I have read in West‚Äôs work or heard in his lectures.\\" Dr. Alice von Hildebrand, widow of Catholic theologian Dietrich von Hildebrand, has said West's approach has become too self-assured. She criticized his presentations as irreverent and insensitive to the \\"tremendous dangers\\" of concupiscence. Theologian Michael Waldstein, who wrote the definitive translation of The Theology of the Body, addressed Schindler‚Äôs remarks in an essay published on InsideCatholic.com. Waldstein said that Schindler‚Äôs essay was a \\"blanket negative statement\\" that made \\"sweeping accusations\\" against a position he did not recognize as West‚Äôs. Justin Cardinal Rigali, Archbishop Emeritus of Philadelphia, and Kevin Rhoades, Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend, issued a joint statement in support of West's work. They said, :\\"We are convinced that John Paul II's Theology of the Body is a treasure for the Church, indeed a gift of the Holy Spirit for our time. Yet, its scholarly language needs to be 'translated' into more accessible categories if the average person is to benefit from it. To do this is the specific mission of the Theology of the Body Institute, and we believe that Christopher West, the Institute's popular lecturer and spokesman, has been given a particular charism to carry out this mission. With great skill as a presenter, with keen insight as a thinker, and with profound reverence for the mystery of human sexuality, he has been able to reach thousands in our sexually wounded culture with the Gospel of salvation in Christ.\\" Bishop Ronald Gainer of West's hometown Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg, wrote, in his Letter of Good Standing: :\\"Through his careful and thorough study of the teachings of Saint John Paul, Mr. West makes a unique contribution by his amazing gift of translating the profound truths of the Theology of the Body into language that is precise, compelling and clearly understandable to every reader and listener. His gift of teaching is totally faithful to the theological and spiritual legacy of our late Holy Father, now a canonized saint. :\\"As his Diocesan Bishop, I eagerly express my deep respect for Mr. West and I recommend him as one who lives faithfully the message he so effectively communicates. I am confident that, as countless others have, you will discover rich catechetical treasures through his ministry, The Cor Project, which exists to help men and women across the globe learn, live, and share the teachings of Saint John Paul Il‚Äôs Theology of the Body.\\" West also responded to many of the critiques, acknowledging that \\"so long as we are on earth, we will always have to battle with concupiscence\\" and conceding \\"In some of my earliest lectures and tapes, I confess that I did not emphasize this important point clearly enough.\\" However, he continues with the rhetorical question, taken from Veritatis Splendor 103, \\"Of which man are we speaking?\\" and discusses the teaching of John Paul IITOB 43:6, 45:3, 46:4, 46:6, 47:5, 48:1, 48:4, 49:4, 49:6, 58:7, 86:6-7, 101:3-5, 107:1-3, 128:3, 129:5 that \\"[Christ] has given us the possibility of realizing the entire truth of our being; he has set our freedom free from the domination of concupiscence.\\" On January 31, 2012, West released a book entitled At the Heart of the Gospel: Reclaiming the Body for the New Evangelization. Christoph Cardinal Sch√∂nborn, Cardinal Archbishop Of Vienna; General Editor, Catechism of the Catholic Church and Grand Chancellor, International Theological Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, gave the following endorsement for the book: :\\"The light of the Gospel, which is a clear but at times painful light, can illumine human sexuality to its very depth in order to transform it and bring it to its full beauty. Here lies the great strength of Blessed John Paul II‚Äôs Theology of the Body. In this peaceful and positive response to critics, Christopher West proves once again that he is a faithful and inspiring interpreter and communicator of this great pope‚Äôs teaching, a teaching so urgently needed for an effective proclamation of the Gospel.\\" In 2013, West released Fill These Hearts, which addresses the idea of Christianity as a repressive, anti-sex religion and presents that the restless yearnings felt in one's bodies and spirits are the cry of one's heart for God. The book's release was followed by a series of cultural events around the United States featuring West and musical act Mike Mangione and the Union that combined art, music and theological reflection. Colleen Carroll Campbell, author of My Sisters the Saints: A Spiritual Memoir, said Christopher West \\"is a gifted and effective evangelist with a passion for tackling one of the greatest obstacles to belief today: the heresy that Christianity is a joyless, rule-bound religion. Not so, argues West, in this timely, powerful book. Drawing upon Scripture, the saints and the glimmers of truth in pop culture, West reminds us that Christianity is essentially a love story, and Christian sexual ethics exist to help us fulfill, not repress, our deepest desires. For anyone who has ever doubted that Christ‚Äôs call to purity of heart is good news, Fill These Hearts will prove a surprising and consoling read, one with the potential to change your life as well as your mind.\\" On April 15, 2015, West released his first eBook and first paperback under The Cor Project imprint, Pope Francis to Go: Bite- Sized Morsels from The Joy of the Gospel. Using Pope Francis‚Äôs apostolic exhortation The Joy of the Gospel, Scripture, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the writings of saints and other popes, and the lens of John Paul II's Theology of the Body, West presents 150 quotes from Pope Francis that map out the \\"Way of Beauty\\" that is at the heart of the New Evangelization. \\"Thanks to Christopher West‚Äôs new book, Pope Francis to Go, we can draw deeply from the well of the great heart of Pope Francis. Christopher‚Äôs prayerful and powerful commentary on The Joy of the Gospel offers practical insights on not only how to share the good news, but more importantly, how to live it,\\" said Jason Evert, author, speaker and cofounder of The Chastity Project.

In narratives In narratives (primarily fiction), composition includes, but is not limited to, *Outline, the organisations of thoughts and/or ideas which is used to determine organisational technique *Plot, the course or arrangement of events *Theme, the unifying subject or idea *Dialogue, a reciprocal conversation between two or more persons *Characterisation, the process of creating characters *Setting, the time and location in which the composition takes place *Description, definitions of things in the composition *Style, specifically, the linguistic style of the composition *Setting tone or mood, conveying one or more emotions or feelings through words *Voice, the individual writing style of the author *Tone, which encompasses the attitudes toward the subject and toward the audience In rhetoric In rhetoric (primarily non-fiction), composition is the arrangement and strategic use of written, oral, visual and/or digital in order to inform, persuade, or motivate an audience in a given situation. Oral discourse Traditionally, oratory, or classical rhetoric, is composed of five stages, or canons: *Invention, \\"the search of persuasive ways to present information and formulate arguments\\" *Arrangement, \\"the organization of the parts of speech to ensure that all means of persuasion are present and properly disposed\\" *Style, \\"the use of correct, appropriate, and striking language throughout the speech\\" *Memory, \\"the use of mnemonics and practice of speech\\" *Delivery, \\"the use of effective gestures and vocal modulation to present the speech\\" Typically, in any speech classroom, these stages are still prevalent in the composing process. Other such qualities to be included, especially when considering ones' audience and methods of persuasion, would be the rhetorical appeals: *Logos, appeals to logic and reason, evidence and support *Ethos, appeals to ethics, the speaker's credibility, trustworthiness, and morals *Pathos, appeals to emotion, connecting with audience through shared feelings Written discourse As oral discourse shifted to more written discourse, the stage of memory and delivery began to fade, yet the first three stages hold its rank in the writing process of most composition classrooms. The rhetorical appeals also prove important in written texts, as the strategies of using these appeals become more complex as writers understand their audience's needs when not in physical view. Visual Composition, which includes the language of visuals is a recent development in composition studies. Sonja K. Foss argues that visuals are a valued component of rhetorical study, and to only focus on verbal discourse, limits the opportunity to engage in multiple symbols that create meaning and speak rhetorically. In thinking about how visuals are used to communicate, and how they are composed or analyzed in a rhetorical work, she argues that one considers the focus: *Nature, the present elements/physical features and suggested elements/concepts and ideas *Function, the action it communicates *Evaluation, assessed rhetorically Foss, who acknowledges visual rhetoric, demonstrates that composition studies has to consider other definitions and incorporations of language. Digital This composition refers to work produced in digital spaces. The writer or speaker must not only consider all the composing processes of the above-mentioned discourse (like purpose, arrangement, etc.), but the relationship medium plays in the composing and decision process of that work. In digital discourse, the fifth canon of delivery takes on new meaning, and digital spaces change how traditional views of authority, circulation, and context are understood, like composing in a Wikipedia. Thus digital rhetoric, or eRhetoric offers new ways of composing.

Being unusually large and intense, Gafilo was the deadliest and most destructive cyclone of the 2003‚Äì04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. According to the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, Gafilo killed at least 363 people. Gafilo also caused about $250 million (2004 USD) damages in Madagascar, which makes it one of most devastating storms to hit the country on reliable record. Forming south of Diego Garcia, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm on 3 March. One day later, Gafilo became a tropical cyclone, and it ultimately intensified into a very intense tropical cyclone on 6 March, prior to making landfall over Madagascar early on the next day. After crossing the island, Gafilo emerged into the Mozambique Channel and made landfall over Madagascar again on 9 March. After a three-day loop overland, the system arrived at the Indian Ocean on 13 March, and it transitioned into a subtropical depression on 14 March. Gafilo then became extratropical on the next day and weakened, before dissipating on 18 March. Meteorological history A disturbance formed south of Diego Garcia on 29 February, and M√©t√©o-France La R√©union (MFR) upgraded the identified system within the monsoon trough to a tropical disturbance on the next day. On 2 March, although the centre was exposed due to moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system which was situated north of a subtropical ridge, based on improved organisation of deep convection and moderate poleward outflow. However, its temporary acceleration on that day lessened vertical wind shear. As the centre became under organised deep convection on 3 March, the system intensified into a tropical depression, then a moderate tropical storm named Gafilo by the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius, shortly before MFR even upgraded Gafilo to a severe tropical storm later. When the system slowed and tracked west- northwestwards along the northern periphery of a building subtropical ridge, it reached category 1 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale late on 3 March. The complete pattern of the cyclone from 4 to 8 March as it moved through the south western Indian Ocean has been recorded by the TRMM through its satellite imagery. TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA. Tropical Cyclone Gafilo on 3 March Although dry air significantly reduced deep convection on 4 March, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a tropical cyclone due to a banding eye, when the system began to expand its clockwise circulation and track west- southwestwards. By dual outflow channels, Gafilo underwent rapid deepening and reached category 4 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale on 5 March, as MFR also upgraded Gafilo to an intense tropical cyclone late on the same day. On 6 March, besides warm sea surface temperature above 29 ¬∞C, the atypical third outflow channel from the west made conditions for the cyclone more favourable. Therefore, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a very intense tropical cyclone with a very well-defined circular and warm diameter eye at 06Z, when it also reached category 5 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. At 12Z, Gafilo attained its peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 125 knots (230 km/h, 145 mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to , although microwave imagery showed that the eyewall replacement cycle had begun. Shortly after slightly weakening due to land interaction, Gafilo made landfall in the vicinity of Antalaha, Madagascar early on 7 March. Unlike other storms, the overland depression just weakened gradually, because of its unusually large circulation making the outer part still at sea. On that day, Gafilo tracked more southwestwards along the northwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the southeast. Before noon on 8 March, Gafilo arrived at the Mozambique Channel as a moderate tropical storm whose strongest winds were located in the northern sector. On 9 March, Gafilo became almost stationary and then tracked southeastwards along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the east. MFR upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm supported by observed data from Malagasy stations at noon; however, JTWC analysed that the storm became below category 1 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale at the same time in their best track data. Late on 9 March, Gafilo made landfall north of Morombe, Madagascar, and the system started to make a three-day clockwise loop over the south part of Madagascar. For the system further weakened after landfall, JTWC analysed that Gafilo dissipated overland late on 11 March, as well as MFR issued a final warning on the overland depression which began to track southeastwards early on 12 March. Surprisingly, MFR began to issue warnings again on the completely disorganised system at noon on 12 March, as the residual centre was expected to go back overseas. Late on the same day, JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the overland remnants, because of improved deep convection over the low-level circulation centre, poleward outflow and weak vertical wind shear. Early on 13 March, Gafilo arrived at the Indian Ocean as a tropical disturbance; JTWC cancelled a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system because of the less organised low-level circulation centre and moderate vertical wind shear. Gafilo transferred into a subtropical depression south of La R√©union on 14 March, when the deep convective activity was intensifying with better organisation of a small cluster above the low-level circulation centre due to good upper-level divergence and a warm sea surface temperature of 26 ¬∞C to 29 ¬∞C. After attaining minor peak intensity in its subtropical period late on 14 March, Gafilo began to track eastward and transitioned into an extratropical depression on 15 March. Owing to a building subtropical ridge located to the southwest, the extratropical depression slowed and turned northwestwards on 16 March. After slowly weakening, the system completely dissipated on 18 March. Impact =Madagascar= Destroyed coastline of Mahajanga, Madagascar Gafilo caused strong winds and torrential rainfall over Madagascar. A half-day after the first landfall, hurricane-force winds were still observed near Mahajanga late on 7 March. When Gafilo was reorganising in the Mozambique Channel, of precipitation was recorded at Maintirano on 9 March, as well as was recorded at T√¥lanaro on the same day. During its three-day loop overland, Gafilo brought at Morondava on 11 March. As Elita had already struck Madagascar one month ago, damage from Gafilo created extreme devastation in the country. The National Rescue Council in Antananarivo reported 237 dead, 181 missing, 879 injured, and 304,000 homeless (174,000 in Antalaha alone). More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, as well as 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged, including 1,400 schools completely destroyed. The United Nations estimated that there were 700,000 disaster-stricken people, 280,000 of which needed urgent assistance. Despite being located north of Gafilo's centre, the wreck of the ferry 'Samson' still happened on the night of 7 March, offshore the northwestern port of Mahajanga. A narrow but strong band of Gafilo caused very rough conditions at sea, causing the ferry to experience engine failure and capsize immediately after. While the number of fatalities remains undetermined, 120 people were officially on board, and only three people reached shore, surviving the shipwreck. The ferry had been heading to Madagascar from the Comoros Islands at the time of its sinking. In Antalaha, food prices shot up by 35%, and the harbour was badly damaged and non-operational. Roads and bridges connecting the city to outlying villages were inaccessible, and electricity, water and telephone lines were cut. Overall in Madagascar, the main damage caused by Gafilo was the subsequent flooding of vast areas in the north, northwest and southwest; Where extensive, the flooding caused serious damage to vanilla, rice and banana crops. In many places, the crops were expected to be totally lost. Moreover, shrimp harvesting also suffered. Some of the affected areas coincided with those affected by Elita, and stocks and resources were already depleted in many areas. In the absence of immediate response, an increase in water-borne diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea could have occurred immediately, while outbreaks of cholera were expected to be seen within the coming 6‚Äì8 weeks. =Other islands= Damage was minimal to other islands in the South-west Indian Ocean, but precipitation was very heavy. Far from the centre of Gafilo, was recorded at La R√©union within 48 hours, and was recorded at the Seychelles on 4 March. At a point south of Gafilo, ten-minute maximum sustained winds were 49 knots with a peak gust of 66 knots recorded at Tromelin Island. During 7 and 8 March, precipitation at Mayotte was recorded between . Aftermath Following the passage of Gafilo, the Malagasy government passed Inter- ministerial Order 17939/2004 in September 2004, which cleared the way for export of new and existing stocks of rosewood as 'salvage'. This created anarchy in the national parks in the Sava Region, with loggers extracting a large quantity of rosewood and ebony, grossly disproportionate to the amount of damage caused by the storm. During this time, Marojejy National Park reported that with the granting of export rights, logging in the park had resumed. It was not until 2006, with the passing of Inter-ministerial Order 16030/2006, that the export ban was reinstated, nearly two years after the storm, but not before the exporters lobbied the government for an extension 'following the grievances expressed by operators' in October 2005, per Memorandum 923/05. Exports were also authorized following cyclones in 2006 and 2007, encouraging the stockpiling of large quantities of lumber in both legal depots and hidden caches around the ports of Voh√©mar and Antalaha. Records With ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 125 knots (230 km/h, 145 mph) (later equaled by Hellen in 2014 and Eunice in 2015, and surpassed by Fantala in 2016, with 10-min sustained winds of 135 knots (250 km/h, 155 mph)) and an atmospheric pressure of , Gafilo became the most intense tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean since reliable records began to be kept. In addition, Gafilo was the only tropical cyclone in the basin having an atmospheric pressure below since Chris-Damia in 1982. Gafilo made landfall over Madagascar early on 7 March as a very intense tropical cyclone with ten- minute maximum sustained winds of 120 knots (220 km/h, 140 mph) and an atmospheric pressure of , becoming the strongest storm to make landfall over Madagascar, and even Africa, on record, tied with Hary for both of those records in 2002.

It is based on the film of the same name by Tim Burton. The game was released in the middle of the year to coincide with the release of the film in theatres. Most of the main cast from the film provided their voices for the game except for Johnny Depp as James Arnold Taylor was used in his place as the voice of Willy Wonka. Original music for the video game was created by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron. Overview The first objective of the game is to help Charlie find money to buy a Wonka Bar to win a Golden Ticket. This is done at the beginning of the game while giving a tutorial of what controls will be needed during future stages. The main part of the game takes place in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory where the Oompa Loompas help the player through each level. By giving them commands Charlie finishes each challenge and progresses through the game. Each Oompa Loompa specialises in different tasks, such as harvesting, welding, and electrical work. Candy is scattered throughout the levels and when collected it boosts Charlie's energy. Each level has the following goals: Charlie must help Willy Wonka remove Augustus Gloop from the pipe above the chocolate river, roll Violet Beauregarde to the Juicing Room and juice her, follow Veruca Salt down the chute and save her from the incinerator, and free Mike Teavee after shrinks himself by repairing the television-chocolate machine. Throughout the game the Oompa Loompas must help Charlie return the chocolate factory back to normal by fixing the mistakes that the self-indulgent children made, as well as deal with rogue robots. Reception The game received generally negative reviews from critics. Although reviewers praised the game's enjoyable storyline, music and presentation, most felt that the control of the characters on screen was awkward at best and the game was too short. The video game site IGN gave the game an overall rating of 4.5 out of 10 and GameSpot gave it the \\"poor\\" rating of 4 out of 10. PC Gamer rated the game a 22%. G4's X-Play gave the Xbox version a 1 out of 5. Nintendo Power also gave the GameCube version a 2.5 out of 10 because of clunky camera control and the reversal of roles. Detroit Free Press gave the Game Boy Advance version one star out of four and stated, \\"I like games that involve strategy, but this game has none. You do what the game wants you to do with a just a bit of brain power involved, but no strategy.\\" USA Today gave the game four stars out of ten and stated that \\"Overall, the game is beautifully created and the environments are bright and lush with color. The voice acting and the musical score are done well but not overdone and there is just enough charm to give this game potential. But design glitches and annoying camera perspectives sabotage the gameplay, which is the most important part of a game and the entire experience ultimately becomes more of a frustration rather than an enjoyment.\\" Soundtrack The original musical soundtrack of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory video game was composed by Winifred Phillips. In his review of the game for IGN, Juan Castro called the music from the game \\"a really good soundtrack\\" and elaborated later in the article by writing, \\"Music sounds moody and atmospheric where it should. Same goes for the oddball tunes within the factory.\\" References External links 2005 video games Game Boy Advance games GameCube games PlayStation 2 games Video games developed in the United States Warner Bros.

History  Beechwood House was built in 1877-78 as a private residence by George Fothergill, a former Mayor of Newport. It was designed in a classical style using Bath stone, by architects Habershon, Pite & Fawckner. In 1900 the Beechwood estate was purchased by Newport Corporation and opened as a public park. During World War II the park was used by US military personnel stationed in the city and was later used as a tuberculosis clinic, model railway club, and open air school.  Community  The Park is protected by a group of local volunteers in the Beechwood Park Group, who set up in 2014 with the purpose of organising events for local people and improving the facilities available to visitors, including raising ¬£1,850 for new parasols for outdoor seating. The Park's historical interests are also preserved by Friends of Newport's Ornamental Parks, who were established in 2006 to improve the management of Victorian era parks in the city.  Facilities  Current facilities include two children's play areas, a paddling pool (summer only), a bowling green, a pavilion, and two tennis courts. In 2013 a caf√© was opened and named Mrs T's. It is open between 9.30am and 4.30pm Monday to Friday, and 9am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. The caf√© was extended in 2018 and owner Jayne Thorley has described the new space as suited for afternoon tea, Sunday lunches and special events. In 2019 the park hosted a weekend of free musical entertainment organised by the Beechwood Parks Events Group in conjunction with Newport City Radio with a range of musical guests, a raffle, food from The Caf√©, and more.  Renovation  In 2006, work began on the renovation and conversion of Beechwood House to become the Beechwood House Entrepreneurship Centre.

The film stars Jack Lemmon, Juliet Mills, and Clive Revill, with supporting roles by Edward Andrews, Gianfranco Barra, Franco Angrisano, and Pippo Franco. The screenplay by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is based on the play of the same name by Samuel Taylor, which had a short run on Broadway in 1968. The film was shot on-location on the Italian island of Ischia and in the city of Sorrento. The film was released by United Artists on December 17, 1972 to critical acclaim. Lemmon won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and the film was nominated in six other categories, including Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (for Mills), and Best Screenplay. Plot For the past ten years, Baltimore industrialist Wendell Armbruster, Sr. has been spending a month at the Grand Hotel Excelsior in the Island of Ischia on the Bay of Naples, in Italy allegedly to soak in the therapeutic mud baths for which the resort island is known. When he is killed in an automobile accident, his straitlaced son Wendell Armbruster, Jr. journeys to Italy to claim his father's body. Upon arrival he discovers his father was not alone in the Fiat he was driving; with him was his British mistress, whose daughter, free- spirited London shop girl Pamela Piggott, is also on the scene, though she clearly knew of their parents' clandestine romance beforehand. Hotel manager Carlo Carlucci attempts to smooth things over, taking on all the arrangements for the body to be taken back to Baltimore in time for burial in just three days' time. Complications arise when the bodies disappear from the morgue. Wendell suspects Pamela, who has expressed a wish that they be buried in Ischia; however, it is revealed that the actual bodysnatchers are the Trotta family, whose vineyard was damaged when the elder Armbruster's car drove into it during the fatal automobile accident. The Trotta brothers have stolen the bodies from the morgue, holding them for a two million lire ransom. This is not Wendell's only problem. Bruno, the hotel valet, is determined to get back to America after being deported and has compromising photographs of Wendell's father and Pamela's mother swimming nude in the bay. As the Italian atmosphere begins to affect both Wendell and Pamela and animosity gives way to friendship, Bruno manages to get pictures of them swimming naked as well, and tries to blackmail his way to an American visa. This displeases the maid Anna, pregnant with Bruno's child, and in a fit of rage she lures Bruno to Pamela's room, kills him, and then runs off. Carlucci moves Pamela's belongings into Wendell's room to prevent an international incident, and the two are thrown together. Appearing in a U.S. Navy helicopter to speed the repatriation is State Department official J.J. Blodgett who, by posthumously appointing the deceased man to an embassy post, allows the U.S. government to recover his body. Finally, Carlucci, Wendell and Pamela find the perfect solution - their parents are buried side by side in Ischia (in the Carlucci family plot) whilst Bruno takes his place in the repatriated coffin, finding his way back to America after all. Wendell and Pamela part, with a vow to return next year, just as their parents did. Cast Production = Development = Although Samuel Taylor's play had closed on Broadway after only twenty-one performances in early 1968,Avanti! at the Internet Broadway Database (it was profiled in the William Goldman book The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway) talent agent Charles Feldman, who previously had interested Billy Wilder in filming The Seven Year Itch, had purchased the screen rights and offered the property to Wilder. The director had begun working on The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, and it wasn't until that project was completed that he was able to concentrate on Avanti! When longtime screenwriting partner I.A.L. Diamond proved to be unavailable, Wilder collaborated first with Julius J. Epstein and then Norman Krasna, but he was unhappy with the results. Then Diamond became free, and with the ultimately uncredited assistance of Luciano Vincenzoni, he and Wilder began adapting the Taylor play. Wilder was determined to create \\"a bittersweet love story, a little like Brief Encounter, which I always admired,\\" he later recalled.Chandler, Charlotte, Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, A Personal Biography. New York: Simon & Schuster 2002. , pp. 274-277 After viewing a number of Italian films, Wilder selected Luigi Kuveiller as his cinematographer, based on his work on the Elio Petri film A Quiet Place in the Country (1969). = Casting = Early in the writing period, Wilder showed Jack Lemmon some of the completed script, and he agreed to play Wendell Armbruster, Jr. \\"Knowing pretty early on Jack was going to be in our film made it more comfortable writing his dialogue,\\" said Diamond, who preferred to tailor a screenplay to a specific actor. Wilder was a fan of Juliet Mills from the television sitcom Nanny and the Professor. He was unimpressed with the series, but he enjoyed watching the show to see her, for he considered her a good actress with a lot of appeal. He contacted her and personally offered her the role of Pamela Piggott. \\"I loved Billy Wilder just calling me and asking me to be in his film,\\" the actress recalled, \\"no lawyer or agent, his voice, not asking for an audition or a screen test.\\" Wilder told her the role required her to gain twenty-five pounds, and Mills readily agreed. She also agreed to a nude scene, although Diamond was opposed to including one in the film. \\"I think nudity hurts laughs\\", he stated. \\"I mean if you're watching somebody's boobs, you're not listening to the dialogue.\\" = Filming = The story of Avanti is set on the island of Ischia, where some of the exterior scenes were shot, including a brief scene outside the morgue (the interior of which, as with all the interior sets, was designed by Italian production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti), at and around the port of Ischia, where Lemmon and Mills arrive on the island, and on a small rock jutting out of the water just off the shore of Ischia, where Mills' nude scene takes place. But most of the exteriors were shot in Sorrento, including the exterior of Lemmon's hotel,Movieloci - Filming locations on Capri, notably the hilltop heliport overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, and along the Amalfi Coast, and interiors were filmed on Scarfiotti's sets (including the interior lobby and rooms of Lemmon's hotel) at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome following location shooting during the summer of 1972. Principal photography was completed on schedule and $100,000 under budget. Wilder was disappointed with the completed film. \\"Maybe we went overboard with some of the comic relief, because Avanti! is not a comedy\\", he stated. \\"If this film had worked the way we wanted it to, it would have had more of the quality of The Apartment. I always feel sorry for the disappointment of the actors, and all those dear technical people who do so much, when the picture doesn't make it the way they hoped . . . I went much farther with forbidden themes than I had with Kiss Me, Stupid, but nobody cared. Audiences thought it was too long and too bland. I guess they would have liked it better if it turned out the father was having the affair with one of the bellboys at the hotel.\\" = Music = The film's musical score was composed and arranged by veteran Italian film composer Carlo Rustichelli, and conducted by Gianfranco Plenizio. The score incorporates and adapted several classic Italian songs, including ‚ÄúPalcoscenico,‚Äù ‚ÄúSenza Fine‚Äù and ‚ÄúUn‚Äôora sola ti vorrei.‚Äù Critical reception A.H. Weiler of The New York Times thought the film was \\"intermittently funny, charming, cute and, unfortunately, over-long.\\" He continued, \\"Wilder, Lemmon and I.A.L. Diamond . . . fitfully charm us but they haven't moved forward at any great comic clip. They have warped some parts of the playwright's plot to give us a fairly reasonable flow of giggles and an occasional guffaw.\\" He also cited \\"a fine job turned in by Clive Revill.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"a pleasant, civilized comedy\\" and added, \\"Avanti! isn't a laugh-a-minute kind of a movie, and it's too long by maybe half an hour. It also suffers from the problem that the audience has everything figured out several minutes before Jack Lemmon does. Still, the movie has a certain charm, some of which seeps in along with the locations, and there is in most of the many Wilder/Lemmon collaborations a cheerful insouciance, as if life is best approached with a cheerful, if puzzled, grin.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Jay Cocks of Time observed, \\"The topical dialogue by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond ‚Äî Kissinger jokes, Billy Graham jokes, etc. ‚Äî gives this passingly pleasant movie the sound of a Bob Hope TV special. But Miss Mills is fresh and winning, and there is a deft performance by Clive Revill.\\"Time review The British television network Channel 4 has called the film \\"a rare instance of the travel comedy - never an easy thing to pull off - succeeding without recourse to old racial stereotypes . . . As a love story, it's full of Wilder's biting satire . . . Taken at face value, it's simply a travel comedy about funny foreigners and love in the Mediterranean. Yet what stands out is how uncomfortable Wilder seems to be with making a sex comedy in the 1970s. Forced to take on board the aftershocks of the summer of love but saddled with an old man's attitude and an old man's cast, Wilder seems perilously out of his depth. As Lemmon and Mills strip off to reveal pale white skin and flabby fat, you can't help feeling that the resolutely misanthropic director is somewhat appalled by the realities of his characters' bedroom antics.\\"Channel 4 review Awards and honors Jack Lemmon won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and nominations went to Billy Wilder for Best Director, Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond for Best Screenplay, Juliet Mills for Best Actress, Clive Revill for Best Supporting Actor, and the film itself for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy).

Founded in 1874 and developed by five generations of one family, it was gifted to the National Trust in 1949. The garden spans 80 acres of hillside and includes formal Italianate terraces, informal shrub borders stocked with plants from around the world, The Dell, a gorge garden, a number of notable trees and a waterfall. Since 2012, new areas have opened including the Winter garden, Old Park Meadow, Yew Dell and The Far End, a riverside garden. Furnace Wood and Meadow opened in 2017. There are plans to open more new areas, including Heather Hill and Cae Poeth Meadow. Bodnant Garden was visited by over 250,000 people in 2018 and is famous for its Laburnum arch, the longest in the UK, which flowers in May and June. The garden is also celebrated for its link to the plant hunters of the early 1900s whose expeditions formed the base of the garden's four National Collections of plants ‚Äì Magnolia, Embothrium, Eucryphia and Rhododendron forrestii. Laburnum Arch View of mountains from The Terraces The Poem Rhododendrons Boat House and Skating Pond Daffodils Bodnant Hall overlooking the Lily Terrace The Pin Mill and Lily Pond  History  The garden's founder, Henry Davis Pochin, was a Leicestershire-born Victorian industrial chemist who acquired fame and fortune inventing a process for clarifying rosin used in soap, turning it from the traditional brown to white. He became a successful businessman, mayor and JP. Pochin bought the Bodnant estate in 1874 and employed Edward Milner, apprentice to Joseph Paxton, to redesign the land around the existing Georgian mansion house, then just lawns and pasture. Together Pochin and Milner relandscaped the hillside and valley, planting American and Asian conifers on the banks of the River Hiraethlyn to create a Pinetum, and reinforcing stream banks to create a woodland and water garden in the valley, in the style of the garden designer of the day William Robinson in his book The Wild Garden. In the upper garden, Pochin and Milner created the Laburnum Arch and glasshouses, to house exotics. Pochin also built \\"The Poem\\", the family mausoleum in an area of the Shrub Borders. The development of the garden was continued by Henry and Agnes Pochin‚Äôs daughter Laura McLaren, Baroness Aberconway, who married Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway. Laura, like her mother, was a campaigner for women's suffrage and founded the Liberal Women's Suffrage Union. She was also a passionate gardener and inspired her son Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway, to whom she entrusted the care of the garden in 1901. Together they created the Skating Pond at the Far End and began work on the Italianate Terraces. Henry McLaren oversaw the major developments of the garden. He sponsored plant hunting expeditions of the day by explorers such as Ernest Wilson, George Forrest and Frank Kingdon-Ward who brought back plants from the China and the Himalayas including magnolias, camellias and rhododendrons. He also invested in a plant breeding programme producing Bodnant hybrid rhododendrons. From 1905 to 1914 Henry oversaw the completion of the five terraces. This was a massive earth-moving project done by men without machinery, which involved levelling the hillside and building granite buttress walls which provided protection for tender plants being introduced to the garden from overseas. The Pin Mill building on the Canal Terrace was added in 1938. Originally built in 1730 in Gloucestershire, it was rescued from decay by Henry, who dismantled it, brought to Bodnant and rebuilt it brick by brick. Henry went on to become president of the Royal Horticultural Society for 22 years. He persuaded the National Trust to accept gardens on their own merit and in 1949 he handed over Bodnant Garden to the National Trust, the second garden after Hidcote. On August 18th 1952 Vita Sackville-West and husband Harold Nicolson were given a day long conducted tour by Henry. Nicolson commented in his diary \\"the Dell, is the most extensive, most varied and most tasteful piece of planting I have ever seen\\". He further commented \\"I have no doubt at all that this is the richest garden I have ever seen. Knowledge and taste are combined with enormous expenditure to render it one of the wonders of the world\\".Harold Nicolson, Diaries and Letters, 1945-62, Fontana Books 1971 Throughout the 1900s the continued development of the garden was a partnership between three generations of the McLaren family ‚Äì Henry, Charles and Michael ‚Äì and three generations of head gardeners Frederick, Charles and Martin Puddle. Like his father, Charles McLaren became president of the RHS in 1961. As was his father and grandmother, he was also awarded the highest accolade of the RHS, the Victoria Medal of Honour. Charles‚Äô sister Dr Anne McLaren was one of Britain's leading scientists. She pioneered techniques of reproductive biology which led to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and cancer research. Charles‚Äô son Michael McLaren inherited the property in 2003. He is a practising barrister and continues to act as garden manager. Troy Scott Smith took over as head gardener in 2006 and the position of head gardener was taken over in 2015 by John Rippin.  Plants and plant hunters  Bodnant Garden has an illustrious connection with 19th and early 20th century explorers, who brought back plants for which the garden is now world-famous, including four National Collections, of Rhododendron forrestii, Magnolia,Eucryphia and Embothrium species. Today the garden also has twenty two Champion Trees, noted for their age, height and horticultural merit. Henry Pochin's legacy to Bodnant was planting the garden's great conifers; the cedars on the Lily Terrace (from Africa and Middle East) and the Pinetum in the Dell which includes American and Asian conifers including Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas Fir) Pinus radiata, Sciadopitys verticella (Japanese Umbrella Pine), Chamaecyparis pisifera (Japanese false cypress and Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Redwood). The next phase of plant hunting was under Pochin's grandson Henry McLaren, 2nd Lord Aberconway who sponsored expeditions from the Edwardian period which brought in large numbers of rhododendrons, camellias and magnolias to Britain. Notable plant hunters connected to Bodnant Garden included Ernest Wilson, who travelled extensively in China. He was first engaged by famous Veitch Nursery with the specific task of bringing back seeds of the Handkerchief Tree (Davidia involucrata), one of which still grows in Bodnant Garden's Shrub Borders. He also brought back many magnolias for which the garden is famous, and other trees including the Acer griseum, Meliosma beaniana and Sorbus meliosmifolia. Wilson also discovered and brought back the Lilium regale which now grow on the rose terraces. In 1917 the recently formed Rhododendron Society, of which Lord Aberconway was a prominent member, employed plant hunter George Forrest to source rhododendrons. Forrest was a seasoned explorer who collected plants in western China and Tibet for nursery owner Arthur Bulley. His expeditions brought back seed of many new rhododendrons and Bodnant's gardeners were able to raise the plants in great numbers. Lord Aberconway and his head gardener Frederick Puddle set about hybridising the new rhododendron species they had raised, to create the Bodnant Hybrid Rhododendrons, of which the garden has around 350. Forrest also brought back to Bodnant Garden seed of Primula bulleyana still seen around the garden. Frank Kingdon-Ward conducted numerous expeditions to the Himalayas during the 1920s and 1930s which resulted in the introduction of a prolific number of new species to Bodnant Garden including the Himalayan Blue Poppy (Meconopsis betonicifolia). He also collected and introduced rhododendron including Rhododendron cinnabarinum ‚ÄòOrange Bill‚Äô. In 1925 Harold Comber was sponsored by garden owners calling themselves the Andes Syndicate, headed by Lord Aberconway, to travel in South America. This gave Bodnant the basis of two of its national collections, the Chilean Flame Tree (Embothrium coccineum) and Eucryphia. Great care was taken to protect some of Harold Comber's other introductions from South America, many of them were planted against a sheltered wall behind the Laburnum Arch. Some of Comber's plants still grow there today, such as the Crinodendron patagua and Desfontania spinosa. In media During the summer of 2018, filming took place at Bodnant for the film The Secret Garden directed by Marc Munden.

In the United Kingdom, the term is unambiguous. In the United States, due to the widespread use of \\"gas\\" as an abbreviation for gasoline (petrol), such an engine might also be called a gaseous-fueled engine or natural gas engine or spark ignited. Generally in modern usage, the term gas engine refers to a heavy-duty industrial engine capable of running continuously at full load for periods approaching a high fraction of 8,760 hours per year, unlike a gasoline automobile engine, which is lightweight, high-revving and typically runs for no more than 4,000 hours in its entire life. Typical power ranges from to .  History  Lenoir gas engine 1860. Langen gas engine 1867. 3 bhp gas fired Crossley atmospheric engine in action at Anson Engine Museum. = Lenoir = There were many experiments with gas engines in the 19th century, but the first practical gas-fuelled internal combustion engine was built by the Belgian engineer √âtienne Lenoir in 1860. However, the Lenoir engine suffered from a low power output and high fuel consumption. = Otto and Langen = Lenoir's work was further researched and improved by a German engineer Nicolaus August Otto, who was later to invent the first four-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber. In August 1864 Otto met Eugen Langen who, being technically trained, glimpsed the potential of Otto's development, and one month after the meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto & Cie, in Cologne. In 1867 Otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1867 Paris World Exhibition. This atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder. When the piston has risen about eight inches, the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside, which forces the piston (which is connected to a toothed rack) upwards, creating a partial vacuum beneath it. No work is done on the upward stroke. The work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight, turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall. Its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand, making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading. = Four-stroke engine = The atmospheric gas engine was in turn replaced by Otto's four-stroke engine. The changeover to four-stroke engines was remarkably rapid, with the last atmospheric engines being made in 1877. Liquid-fuelled engines soon followed using Diesel (around 1898) or gasoline (around 1900). = Crossley = The best-known builder of gas engines in the United Kingdom was Crossley of Manchester, who in 1869 acquired the United Kingdom and world (except German) rights to the patents of Otto and Langden for the new gas-fuelled atmospheric engine. In 1876 they acquired the rights to the more efficient Otto four-stroke cycle engine. = Tangye = There were several other firms based in the Manchester area as well. Tangye Ltd., of Smethwick, near Birmingham, sold its first gas engine, a 1 nominal horsepower two-cycle type, in 1881, and in 1890 the firm commenced manufacture of the four-cycle gas engine. = Preservation = The Anson Engine Museum in Poynton, near Stockport, England, has a collection of engines that includes several working gas engines, including the largest running Crossley atmospheric engine ever made.  Current manufacturers  Manufacturers of gas engines include Hyundai Heavy Industries, Rolls-Royce with the Bergen-Engines AS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Liebherr, MTU Friedrichshafen, GE Jenbacher, Caterpillar Inc., Perkins Engines, MWM, Cummins, W√§rtsil√§, GE Energy Waukesha, Guascor Power, Deutz, MTU, MAN, Fairbanks-Morse, Doosan, and Yanmar. Output ranges from about micro combined heat and power (CHP) to . Generally speaking, the modern high-speed gas engine is very competitive with gas turbines up to about depending on circumstances, and the best ones are much more fuel efficient than the gas turbines. Rolls-Royce with the Bergen Engines, Caterpillar and many other manufacturers base their products on a Diesel engine block and crankshaft. GE Jenbacher and Waukesha are the only two companies whose engines are designed and dedicated to gas alone.  Typical applications  = Stationary = Typical applications are base load or high- hour generation schemes, including combined heat and power (for typical performance figures see), landfill gas, mines gas, well-head gas and biogas, where the waste heat from the engine may be used to warm the digesters. For typical biogas engine installation parameters see. For parameters of a large gas engine CHP system, as fitted in a factory, see. Gas engines are rarely used for standby applications, which remain largely the province of Diesel engines. One exception to this is the small (<150 kW) emergency generator often installed by farms, museums, small businesses, and residences. Connected to either natural gas from the public utility or propane from on-site storage tanks, these generators can be arranged for automatic starting upon power failure. = Transport = Liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines are expanding into the marine market, as the lean-burn gas engine can meet the new emission requirements without any extra fuel treatment or exhaust cleaning systems. Use of engines running on compressed natural gas (CNG) is also growing in the bus sector. Users in the United Kingdom include Reading Buses. Use of gas buses is supported by the Gas Bus Alliance and manufacturers include Scania AB.  Use of gaseous methane or propane  Since natural gas, chiefly methane, has long been a clean, economical, and readily available fuel, many industrial engines are either designed or modified to use gas, as distinguished from gasoline. Their operation produces less complex-hydrocarbon pollution, and the engines have fewer internal problems. One example is the liquefied petroleum gas, chiefly propane. engine used in vast numbers of forklift trucks. Common United States usage of \\"gas\\" to mean \\"gasoline\\" requires the explicit identification of a natural gas engine. There is also such a thing as \\"natural gasoline\\", but this term, which refers to a subset of natural gas liquids, is very rarely observed outside the refining industry.  Technical details  = Fuel-air mixing = A gas engine differs from a petrol engine in the way the fuel and air are mixed. A petrol engine uses a carburetor or fuel injection. but a gas engine often uses a simple venturi system to introduce gas into the air flow. Early gas engines used a three-valve system, with separate inlet valves for air and gas. = Exhaust valves = The weak point of a gas engine compared to a Diesel engine is the exhaust valves, since the gas engine exhaust gases are much hotter for a given output, and this limits the power output. Thus, a Diesel engine from a given manufacturer will usually have a higher maximum output than the same engine block size in the gas engine version. The Diesel engine will generally have three different ratings ‚Äî standby, prime, and continuous, a.k.a. 1-hour rating, 12-hour rating and continuous rating in the United Kingdom, whereas the gas engine will generally only have a continuous rating, which will be less than the Diesel continuous rating. = Ignition = Various ignition systems have been used, including hot-tube ignitors and spark ignition. Most modern gas engines are essentially dual-fuel engines. The main source of energy is the gas-air mixture but it is ignited by the injection of a small volume of Diesel fuel.  Energy balance  = Thermal efficiency = Gas engines that run on natural gas typically have a thermal efficiency between 35-45% (LHV basis)., As of year 2018, the best engines can achieve a thermal efficiency up to 50% (LHV basis). These gas engines are usually medium-speed engines Bergen Engines Fuel energy arises at the output shaft, the remainder appears as waste heat. Large engines are more efficient than small engines. Gas engines running on biogas typically have a slightly lower efficiency (~1-2%) and syngas reduces the efficiency further still. GE Jenbacher's recent J624 engine is the world's first high efficiency methane- fueled 24-cylinder gas engine. When considering engine efficiency one should consider whether this is based on the lower heating value (LHV) or higher heating value (HHV) of the gas. Engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas, i.e. the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself. Gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas. i.e., total energy content. A quoted engine efficiency based on LHV might be say 44% whereas the same engine might have an efficiency of 39.6% based on HHV on natural gas. It is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like-for-like basis. For example, some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive engine cooling water, and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high apparent efficiency compared to the direct drive engines. = Combined heat and power = Engine reject heat can be used for building heating or heating a process. In an engine, roughly half the waste heat arises (from the engine jacket, oil cooler and after-cooler circuits) as hot water, which can be at up to 110 ¬∞C. The remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas heat exchanger. = Engine cooling = Two most common engine types are an air-cooled engine or water cooled engine. Water cooled nowadays use antifreeze in the internal combustion engine Some engines (air or water) have an added oil cooler. Cooling is required to remove excessive heat, as overheating can cause engine failure, usually from wear, cracking or warping. = Gas consumption calculation = The formula shows the gas flow requirement of a gas engine in norm conditions at full load. Q = \\\\frac{P}{\\\\eta} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{LHV_{gas}} where: * Q is the gas flow in norm conditions * {P} is the engine power * {\\\\eta} is the mechanical efficiency * LHV is the Low Heating Value of the gas  Gallery of historic gas engines  File:National gas engine (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol II).jpg1905 National company's ordinary gas engine of 36 hp File:K√∂rting gas engine (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg1903 K√∂rting gas engine File:Backus upright gas engine (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpgBackus upright gas engine File:Otto horizontal gas engine (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpgOtto horizontal gas engine File:Otto vertical gas engine (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpgOtto vertical gas engine File:Westinghouse gas engine, section (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpgWestinghouse gas engine File:Crossley gas engine and dynamo (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpgCrossley gas engine and dynamo File:Premier twin gas engine electric generating plant (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III).jpgPremier twin gas engine electric generating plant File:125hp gas engine and dynamo (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg125 hp gas engine and dynamo File:Crossley engine.jpgCrossley Brothers Ltd., 1886 No. 1 Engine, 4.5 hp single cylinder, 4-stroke gas engine, 160 rpm.

The company is an independent brand of Assa Abloy, a Swedish door and access control conglomerate.. Bj√∂rn Lidefelt was appointed CEO on January 27, 2020. Bj√∂rn holds an MSc in Industrial Engineering and Management from the University of Link√∂ping, Sweden. He succeeded Stefan Widing, who led HID Global for over four years.  History  Originally formed to develop radio frequency identification technologies, HID Global was formed in 1991 as Hughes Identification Devices, a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Company with offices in California and Scotland. The original 125-kilohertz and 400-kilohertz proximity technology had been pioneered by Destron/IDI (formerly Identification Devices Inc.), in Boulder, Colorado, and used primarily for Animal Identification and Proximity Access Control, and to a lesser degree in Manufacturing Processes, Tyre tracking and a few other Asset Identification applications. Already a supplier to Destron/ID of low-frequency microchips, Hughes Aircraft Company acquired exclusive rights to the Access Control and Industrial markets, leading to the formation of Hughes Identification Devices. In 1994 the office in Scotland was closed and the European business passed to a UK based independent distributor, ID Plus Ltd who were later acquired by HID Corporation Ltd in August 1999. In October 1995, Hughes management, with help from Citibank Venture Capital, combined its military communications and display products groups with its AML Wireless Systems organization and Hughes Identification Devices (HID) to form Palomar Technologies Corporation.http://www.esterline.com/Overview/PalomarHistory/tabid/1544/Default.aspx. It was at that point that the decision was made to focus efforts on RFID for physical access control, and five years later, the company was acquired by the world's largest lock-maker, Swedish conglomerate Assa Abloy AB.  Products  The company sells physical access control products, logical access control products, and secure issuance products that comprise cards, readers, smart card readers (OMNIKEY), networked access products, card printer/encoders (FARGO) and software. Its other business segment includes virtualization technology, cashless payment, government ID, RFID for industry and logistics and Animal ID solutions and professional services.Security Stock Watch http://www.securitystockwatch.com/Interviews/in_Boardroom_HID1.html HID manufactures and licenses several types of technologies, from Wiegand products to 13.56 MHz iCLASS, MIFARE, and DESFire, as well as the 125 kHz Indala and Prox cards. Migration readers from various 125 kHz Prox technologies to 13.56 MHz iCLASS were introduced in 2007. Manufacturing The company is based in Austin, Texas with other production facilities in Asia and Europe. Some of these facilities are located in Hong Kong, China and Galway, Ireland. It also has research and development centers in Cardiff, UK, Denver, Colorado as well as Fremont and Mountain View in Northern California. The company also has a design facility in Chennai, India. Partners HID Global serves a variety of partner such as OEMs, system integrators, application developers and channel partners in domestic and international markets. Some OEM partners include Siemens, Honeywell, Lenel (UTC Fire & Security), and Tyco. The company also partners with computer manufacturers to create new products. HID worked with Dell to develop HID on the Desktop, a three-component PC logon application that won the 2009 Smart Card Alliance Award for Outstanding Technology.Dell partnership: http://www.smartcardalliance.org/pages/activities-osca- awards-2009 HID later partnered with Panasonic to integrate an HID Global RFID module into Panasonic's Personal Identification Mini Dock to support reading biometric passports. HID Global also worked with Inside Secure (formally known as Inside Contactless) and US Bank to supply HID iCLASS contactless smart card technology in the US Bank PayID card program that was the 2010 Paybefore Award Winner for Best Innovative Program.http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/3809982 The PayID card program uses an all-purpose card to provide contactless physical access to U.S. Bank facilities, along with contactless payment and traditional magnetic stripe cards for purchases made by U.S. Bank employees.

He is also known as Mahari Bruna, the Hebrew acronym for \\"Our Teacher, the Rabbi, Israel Bruna\\". Rabbi Bruna is best known as one of the primary Ashkenazi authorities quoted by Moses Isserles in the Shulkhan Arukh. Biography Rabbi Bruna was born in Germany. He studied under the leading Ashkenazi rabbis of his time: Jacob Weil and Israel Isserlin, who ordained him and spoke very highly of him. \\"He was a brilliant student, who devoted himself, body and soul, to the study of the Talmud.\\" He was then elected rabbi of Bruna. After the expulsion of the Jews from that city (1454) he settled at Ratisbon, Bavaria, where he opened a yeshivah. His later life has been described as \\"eventful and troublesome\\". *His position in Ratisbon caused some controversy, dividing the community. Rabbi Anschel Segal, who already was operating a yeshivah there, felt Rabbi Bruna should have opened his yeshivah elsewhere. Among Rabbi Anschel's followers there were some who resorted to painting the word \\"heretic\\" on Rabbi Bruna's seat in the synagogue, and when he preached, they would stage a walkout. Rabbi Bruna, however, bore the attacks and insults with humility, and on the death of Rabbi Segal, he was accepted by the whole community. *In 1474, following a dispute between Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor and Duke Ludwig of Landsberg over a tax placed on the Jewish community, Bruna was imprisoned by the Emperor to compel him to use his authority in the Emperor's favor; he was released after thirteen days in prison. *Rabbi Bruna was later threatened with execution based on a charge of Blood libel, brought by a convert to Christianity, Hans Vagol. The community appealed to Frederick III, as well as to King Ladislav of Bohemia, both of whom declared Rabbi Bruna innocent. Works Rabbi Bruna was one of the greatest Talmudic authorities of his time: rabbis and scholars from various cities and countries sent him their queries on all matters relating to Jewish law. These responsa, Teshuvot Mahari Bruna, are his best known work. Importantly, they served as a source of Halakha for Moses Isserles' HaMapah - the gloss on the Shulkhan Arukh describing differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardi practice.

This lemur is endemic to eastern Madagascan rainforests and is distinguished by patches of white skin below the eyes, giving rise to a \\"teardrop\\" effect, particularly conspicuous in the male.Russell Mittermeier et al., Lemurs of Madagascar, Conservation Press (2006) The species, first identified in 1850, exhibits diurnal behaviour and marked sexual dimorphism. The red-bellied lemur has been studied extensively since the mid-1980s, primarily in Ranomafana National Park.B. Meier, Preliminary report of a field study of Lemur rubriventer and Hapalemar simus (nov. species) in Ranomafana-Itandiana (1986-87) Report to Ministry of Scientific Research, 312 Faritany Fianaransoa, Antananarivo, MadagascarC.

Rakotovao, L‚ÄôEquilibre des Ecosystems Forestiers a Madagascar: Actes d‚Äôun seminaire international IUCN, Gland Switz and Cambridge (1988) This lemur species is designated as vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List, due to threats endangering habitats from slash-and-burn agriculture in Madagascar. Etymology The various Malagasy tribal names for the red- bellied lemur include tongo, tagona, halomena, kirioka, and soamiera. In the French scientific literature (Madagascar‚Äôs second official language is French, due to prior colonisation by France), the species is called l√©mur √† ventre rouge. Description Being sexually dimorphic, the male of the species exhibits a medium-long, dense dorsal coat of intense chestnut brown. Ventrally, he is lighter and redder in hue, while his tail, muzzle and head are black. For the female, the dorsal area and tail resemble the male, whereas the ventral fur is a contrasting white-cream colour. Facial markings are similar to the male, except that \\"tear drops\\" are less exaggerated and spiry thick cheek hairs of the male are absent. Whereas the genus Eulemur relatives may exhibit ear tufts or a furry beard, these features are absent for E. rubriventer, which has thickened fur around its ears, lending a fuller facial appearance. The adult red-bellied lemur has a length of (excluding tail) and a tail length which is almost twenty percent longer than the body itself; that is, body plus tail length may attain a total length of almost 1 m. Typical body mass of a mature individual ranges from .K.E. Glander et al., \\"Morphometrics and testicle size of rainforest lemur species from southeastern Madagascar\\", Journal of Human Evolution 22:1-17 (1992) The male has scent glands atop his head. Lifespans may easily exceed 20 years for both sexes. Range and distribution Mid-height view of arboreal habitat in Mantadia National Park E. rubriventer occurs as far north as the Tsaratanana Massif at an elevation of , then southerly to the Manampatrana River in a narrow strip of eastern Madagascar rainforest. In previous eras, its range extended further south to the Mananara River. This species is distributed thinly and is restricted only to intact rainforest; it does not occur at all on the Masolala Peninsula. The red-bellied lemur is sympatric with four other Eulemur species: in the extreme north of its range, the white-headed lemur E. albifrons; at mid-range, the common brown lemur E. fulvus; and in its southern range, the red-fronted brown lemur E. rufus and the gray-headed lemur E. cinereiceps. E. rubriventer is, however, easily distinguished from these relatives by the male's distinctive white eye \\"tear drops\\" and the rich darkness of the fur of both sexes. A distinction of appearance occurs within E. rubriventer in that northern range males (e.g. Mantadia National Park north) have a more distinctive reddish belly than the southern range counterparts, as in Ranomafana National Park.Lumina Technologies, Observations, behavior and marking of Eulemur rubriventer, Letter report to the Ministry of Scientific Research. Antananarivo, Madagascar, 19 April 2006 The forest type within the red-bellied lemur's range is characterized by dense evergreen vegetation, with a canopy of . Typical canopy genera include Dalbergia, Diospyros, Ocotea, Symphonia, and Tambourissa; emergents of Canarium, Albizia and Brochoneura acuminata are also present. The eastern lowland forests also have a rich diversity of Pandanus, bamboo, and epiphytic orchid species. Behaviour The red-bellied lemur aggregates in monogamous groups ranging from two to 10 individuals. It is one of the few lemurs to be recognized as cathemeral, having both diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns. The home range is estimated to be 25 to 35 acres (10 to 14 ha) with a typical density of five animals per acre. Groups are typically cohesive as they move within their home range, foraging on over 30 species of plants. Considered by some to be a frugivore, it also feeds on leaves, nectar, and flowers of many plant species; this lemur is believed to be a useful and efficient seed disperser. Lower story of Montadia rainforest habitat at a clearing A typical and maximum frequency of births is one offspring per female per year, with initial year infant mortality around 50%. Births normally occur in October and November (early summer in this Southern Hemisphere habitat). The young use their prehensile instincts to attach to the mother and father alternately for the first 33 to 37 days of life. At this point, the mother often refuses further transport services, whilst the father may continue to provide such for another 9 weeks. Conservation Modern feeding habits have expanded the species' diet to the introduced \\"Chinese\\" (actually Brazilian) guava (Psidium cattleyanum). Groups of the red-bellied lemur have become somewhat habituated to humans along certain trail areas in Ramomafana National Park (around Belle Vue) starting in May and June, and much rarer in some lower trail areas of Montadia National Park starting in April. In both instances, the species exhibits a tame behaviour to approaching humans who are silent and walk softly. The animals will descend from the trees to within 2-3 m, staring back at the humans with equal curiosity allowing themselves to be photographed as they cling to vertical trunks of saplings, and occasionally engaging in a terrestrial scamper. E. rubriventer occurs in five national parks and seven special reserves in eastern Madagascar, but is classified as vulnerable (IUCN Red List) due to ongoing habitat reduction from slash-and-burn farming, illegal logging, and even hunting. The species is the subject of current study in its natural habitat as well as in captivity in research centers such as the Duke Lemur Center.

It is located near the lake Melchsee, in the municipality of Kerns, canton Obwalden. Overview Aerial view (1958) The village is located at above sea level and is the heart of the resort. The main attractions of this resort are alpine skiing, snowboarding, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, sledding, hiking, biking, rock climbing, paragliding and fishing. The village is accessible by car during the summer, but with some time restrictions. It can also be reached by use of a gondola lift. =Ski Resort= From early December until early April, the ski resort is open to the public. The four chairlifts, four T-bar lifts and two gondola lifts service the 32 acres of lift-accessible terrain. The base station, St√∂ckalp, is located at 1080 meters above sea level. The three peaks, Erzegg, Balmeregg and Bonistock are at 2150, 2255 and 2160 meters, respectively. History Tourism began in 1936 when Otto Reinhart organized the installation of the first gondola that connected St√∂ckalp with Melchsee-Frutt. There were two cabins with a capacity of four passengers apiece. By 1945, the gondola was upgraded to two cabins with a capacity of eight passengers apiece. Over the next decade, tourism increased, and in 1956, Habegger AG was commissioned to build a new Gondola with two 33 passenger cabins and a maximum capacity of 156 passengers per hour. In 1976 the gondola was once again replaced and capacity was increased to 750 passengers per hour to meet the ever growing demands, especially during the winter ski season. This lift was decommissioned in the fall of 2012, and the current gondola entered service on December 15, 2012. It nearly doubled the capacity to 1325 passengers per hour and also reduced the travel time from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. Just as the gondola has been upgraded over the past 60 years, so have the other ski lifts. Modern high-speed detachable chair lifts have been installed for the ascent between St√∂ckalp and the Bonist√∂ck and the Erzegg lift. Only the Balmeregg summit and the V√∂gelbuel beginners' area are still serviced with t-bars.

Located southwest of Cirencester, it was built as a Royal Air Force (RAF) station and was known as RAF Kemble. The Red Arrows aerobatics team was based there until 1983, and it is used for the storage and recycling of retired airliners, as well as flying schools, clubs and industry. Cotswold Airport is located clear of controlled airspace, allowing free movement for training aircraft. It is also centrally positioned between Cheltenham and Gloucester and Swindon. The nearest railway station is at Kemble. History =RAF Kemble= Construction work for RAF Kemble began in 1936, and the first operational unit to arrive at the station was No. 5 Maintenance Unit on 22 June 1938. In 1940, No. 4 Service Ferry Pool moved to the station from Cardiff, and Kemble became one of the main bases for the aircraft ferrying operations of the Air Transport Auxiliary in this region of the British Isles. Around the same time, Kemble was also the home of No. 1 Overseas Aircraft Preparation Unit (OAPU). The RAF Kemble main entrance area in 1967 with a pre-war hangar in the left background and a Spitfire as gate guardian From 1966 until 1983, Kemble housed the Red Arrows, the RAF's aerobatic display team, which operated Folland Gnats and BAe Hawks. After the Red Arrows moved to RAF Scampton, the station was used by the US Air Force as a maintenance facility, initially for A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft, followed by Northrop F-5s, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. Following the end of the Cold War, the US Air Force left the station and it was returned to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The British Army made use of the site to store surplus vehicles and equipment, and military flights ended at the station in March 1993. =Civilian use= The MoD initially leased buildings on the former station before selling the site to Ronan Harvey, a local businessman, in March 2001. In 2009 Kemble Airport was renamed Cotswold Airport. This view looks east. There was a threat of closure because of a mistake which the Cotswold District Council made relating to planning permission when it was sold by the MoD. However, this is no longer the case, and the planning status of the airfield has been changed to that of airport. In July 2007, the airfield was again threatened by the council after local residents filed noise-pollution complaints. In June 2008, the threat of closure eased after the Cotswold District Council allowed flying to continue, but in September 2008, North Wiltshire District Council sought to overturn this decision in the High Court as they said the original decision was flawed. In August 2009, the airport was awarded a CLEUD (Certificate of Lawful Use) as a commercial airport so the future is assured as an airport and development to that end can occur. Resource Group (Formerly Lufthansa Resource Technical Training) have relocated their EASA Part 147 Approved Basic Training facility to Cotswold Airport with a purpose-built facility opened in spring 2010. This has the effect of bringing numerous jobs to the local area as well as supporting local infrastructure, such as shops and hotels. There are around 50 engineering students stationed there year-round. The central area of the airport, looking east. An air show is in progress; some Boeing 747s kept in storage at the airport can also be seen. The site was renamed Cotswold Airport in 2009, having previously operated as Kemble Airport or Kemble Airfield. The airport has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P863), which allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Kemble Air Services Limited). The airfield has a tarmacadam runway which accommodates large aircraft such as the Boeing 747. Aston Down airfield lies to the northwest and has sometimes been mistaken for Cotswold Airport by visiting pilots. It formerly belonged to the RAF but is now used for gliding by the Cotswold Gliding Club. Hangars for light aircraft and helicopters Other uses The airport is home to Chevron Aircraft Maintenance, an EASA part 145 approved aircraft maintenance facility and has been based at the airport since January 2004, carrying out maintenance, storage and dismantling of aircraft. It is also the operating base of Air Salvage International, who describe themselves as Europe's leading aircraft decommissioning company. Air Salvage moved from Alton, Hampshire in late 2009 to Cotswold Airport, setting up base in Hangar J1. During 2010, the company took over of hangar space formerly used by Aeronautic and Delta Jets, and has grown substantially thereafter. In 2017, the airport was described as \\"Europe's Leading Airliner Recycling Location.\\"Howarth, Nigel. Kemble-Cotswold Airport: Europe's Leading Airliner Recycling Location, Aviation Week & Space Technology (7 March 2017) Between 1996 and 2012, hangars at the airport housed the exhibits of the Bristol Aero Collection. The airport is also used for Formula One straight line testing, and has one of the largest race tracks for radio-controlled cars in the UK. A Countryfile segment being filmed with Matt Baker at Cotswold Airport When the airport was used by the RAF it boasted two hard-surface runways (13/31 and 08/26). However, the north-south runway has been closed off. it is used only as a taxiway and for aircraft parking. Future A proposal was put forward in 2015 for a \\"sustainable village\\" with shops and leisure facilities to be built on the site. However, this development did not occur. , the recently appointed Airport Manager, Christian Ackroyd (a former Army Colonel and pilot) intends to increase and diversify aviation business. This includes plans for new hangars, a new GNSS (GPS) approach to enable more corporate jet use and a Part 145 maintenance organisation based at the airport. In popular culture The airport has been used as a film location for a number of television programmes and series, including: Top Gear, Casualty, Ultimate Force, Car of the Year Show, Wheeler Dealers, Classic Car Club, Drop the Celebrity and Fifth Gear.

Commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de Medici, the later Pope Clement VII (1523‚Äì1534), and conceived as an altarpiece for the Narbonne Cathedral in France, Raphael worked on it until his death in 1520. The painting exemplifies Raphael's development as an artist and the culmination of his career. Unusually for a depiction of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art, the subject is combined with the next episode from the Gospels (the healing of a possessed boy) in the lower part of the painting. The Transfiguration stands as an allegory of the transformative nature of representation. It is now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Vatican City. From the late 16th century until the early 20th century, it was said to be the most famous oil painting in the world. History of the painting By December 1516, the latest date of commission, Cardinal Giulio de Medici, cousin to Pope Leo X (1513‚Äì1521), was also the Pope's vice-chancellor and chief advisor. He had been endowed with the legation of Bologna, the bishoprics of Albi, Ascoli, Worcester, Eger and others. From February 1515, this included the archbishopric of Narbonne. He commissioned two paintings for the cathedral of Narbonne, The Transfiguration of Christ from Raphael and The Raising of Lazarus from Sebastiano del Piombo. With Michelangelo providing drawings for the latter work, Medici was rekindling the rivalry initiated a decade earlier between Michelangelo and Raphael, in the Stanze and Sistine Chapel. From 11 to 12 December 1516, Michelangelo was in Rome to discuss with Pope Leo X and Cardinal Medici the facade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. During this meeting, he was confronted with the commission of The Raising of Lazarus and it was here that he agreed to provide drawings for the endeavour, but not to execute the painting himself. The commission went to Michelangelo's friend Sebastiano del Piombo. As of this meeting the paintings would become emblematic of a paragone between two approaches to painting, and between painting and sculpture in Italian art. An early modello for the painting, done in Raphael's studio by Giulio Romano, depicted a 1:10 scale drawing for The Transfiguration. Here Christ is shown on Mount Tabor. Moses and Eljah float towards him; John and James are kneeling to the right; Peter is to the left. The top of the model depicts God the Father and a throng of angels. A second modello, done by Gianfrancesco Penni, shows a design with two scenes, as the painting was to develop. This modello is held by the Louvre. The Raising of Lazarus was unofficially on view by October 1518. By this time Raphael had barely started on his altarpiece. By the time Sebastiano del Piombo's work was officially inspected in the Vatican by Leo X on Sunday, 11 December 1519, the third Sunday of Advent, The Transfiguration was still unfinished. Raphael would have been familiar with the final form of The Raising of Lazarus as early as the autumn of 1518, and there is considerable evidence that he worked feverishly to compete, adding a second theme and nineteen figures. A surviving modello for the project, now in the Louvre (a workshop copy of a lost drawing by Raphael's assistant Gianfrancesco Penni) shows the dramatic change in the intended work. Modello for the Transfiguration of Christ, pen and brown ink with white highlights on paper primed with dark brown wash, 40 x 27 cm, c. 1516, Albertina Examination of the final Transfiguration revealed more than sixteen incomplete areas and pentimenti (alterations). An important theory holds that the writings of Blessed Amadeo Menes da Silva was key to the transformation. Amadeo was an influential friar, healer and visionary as well as the Pope's confessor. He was also diplomat for the Vatican State. In 1502, after his death, many of Amadeo's writings and sermons were compiled as the Apocalypsis Nova. This tract was well known to Pope Leo X. Guillaume Bri√ßonnet, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici's predecessor as bishop of Narbonne, and his two sons also consulted the tract as spiritual guide. Cardinal Giulio knew the Apocalypsis Nova and could have influenced the painting's final composition. Amadeo's tract describes the episodes of the Transfiguration and the possessed boy consecutively. The Transfiguration represents a prefiguration of the Last Judgment, and of the final defeat of the Devil. Another interpretation is that the epileptic boy has been cured, thus linking the divinity of Christ with his healing power. Raphael died on 6 April 1520. For a couple of days afterward, The Transfiguration lay at the head of his catafalque at his house in the Borgo. A week after his death, the two paintings were exhibited together in the Vatican. While there is some speculation that Raphael's pupil, Giulio Romano, and assistant, Gianfrancesco Penni, painted some of the background figures in the lower right half of the painting, there is no evidence that anyone but Raphael finished the substance of the painting. The cleaning of the painting from 1972 to 1976 revealed that assistants only finished some of the lower left figures, while the rest of the painting is by Raphael himself. Rather than send it to France, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici retained the picture. In 1523, he installed it on the high altar in the Blessed Amadeo's church of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, in a frame which was the work of Giovanni Barile (no longer in existence). A mosaic copy of the painting was completed by Stefano Pozzi in St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City in 1774. In 1797, during Napoleon Bonaparte's Italian campaign, it was taken to Paris by French troops and installed in the Louvre. Already on 17 June 1794, Napoleon's Committee of Public Instruction had suggested an expert committee accompany the armies to remove important works of art and science for return to Paris. The Louvre, which had been opened to the public in 1793, was a clear destination for the art. On 19 February 1799, Napoleon concluded the Treaty of Tolentino with Pope Pius VI, in which was formalized the confiscation of 100 artistic treasures from the Vatican. Wedding procession of Napoleon and Marie-Louise of Austria in 1810 (detail) Among the most sought after treasures Napoleons agents coveted were the works of Raphael. Jean- Baptiste Wicar, a member of Napoleon's selection committee, was a collector of Raphael's drawings. Baron Antoine-Jean Gros, another member, had been influenced by Raphael. For artists like Jacques-Louis David, and his pupils Girodet and Ingres, Raphael represented the embodiment of French artistic ideals. Consequently, Napoleon's committee seized every available Raphael. To Napoleon, Raphael was simply the greatest of Italian artists and The Transfiguration his greatest work. The painting, along with the Apollo Belvedere, the Laoco√∂n, the Capitoline Brutus and many others, received a triumphal entry into Paris on 27 July 1798, the fourth anniversary of Maximilien de Robespierre's fall. In November 1798, The Transfiguration was on public display in the Grand Salon at the Louvre. As of 4 July 1801, it became the centrepiece of a large Raphael exhibition in the Grande Galerie. More than 20 Raphaels were on display. In 1810, a famous drawing by Benjamin Zix recorded the occasion of Napoleon and Marie Louise's wedding procession through the Grande Galerie, The Transfiguration on display in the background. St. Matthew and another apostle, red chalk over stylus, 328 x 232 mm The painting's presence at the Louvre gave English painters like Joseph Farington (on 1 and 6 September 1802) and Joseph Mallord William Turner (in September 1802) the opportunity to study it. Turner would dedicate the first of his lectures as Professor of Perspective at the Royal Academy to the picture. Farington also reported on others having been to see the picture: Swiss painter Henry Fuseli, for whom it was second at the Louvre only to Titian's The Death of St. Peter Martyr (1530), and English painter John Hoppner. The Anglo-American painter Benjamin West \\"said that the opinion of ages stood confirmed that it still held the first place\\". Farington himself expressed his sentiments as follows: After the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1815, envoys to Pope Pius VII, Antonio Canova and Marino Marini managed to secure The Transfiguration (along with 66 other pictures) as part of the Treaty of Paris. By agreement with the Congress of Vienna, the works were to be exhibited to the public. The original gallery was in the Borgia Apartment in the Apostolic Palace. After several moves within the Vatican, the painting now resides in the Pinacoteca Vaticana.  Reception  pouncing, c. 1519 The reception of the painting is well documented. Between the year 1525 and 1935, at least 229 written sources can be identified that describe, analyse, praise or criticise The Transfiguration. The first descriptions of the painting after Raphael's death in 1520 called The Transfiguration already a masterpiece, but this status evolved until the end of the 16th century. In his notes of a travel to Rome in 1577, the Spanish humanist Pablo de C√©spedes called it the most famous oil-painting in the world for the first time.Dohe, Leitbild Raffael, p. 49. The painting would preserve this authority for more than 300 years. It was acknowledged and repeated by many authors, like the connoisseur Fran√ßois Raguenet, who analysed Raphael's composition in 1701. In his opinion, its outline drawing, the effect of light, the colours and the arrangement of the figures made The Transfiguration the most perfect painting in the world. An auxiliary cartoon for the apostle far left Jonathan Richardson Senior and Junior dared to criticise the overwhelming status of The Transfiguration, asking if this painting could really be the most famous painting in the world. They criticised that the composition was divided into an upper and a lower half that would not correspond to each other. Also the lower half would draw too much attention instead of the upper half, while the full attention of the viewer should be paid to the figure of Christ alone. This criticism did not diminish the fame of the painting, but provoked counter-criticism by other connoisseurs and scholars. For the German-speaking world, it was the assessment by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that prevailed. He interpreted the upper and the lower half as complementary parts. This assessment was quoted by many authors and scholars during the 19th century and thus the authority of Goethe helped to save the fame of The Transfiguration.Dohe, Leitbild Raffael, p. 65. During the short period of time the painting spent in Paris, it became a major attraction to visitors, and this continued after its return to Rome, then placed in the Vatican museums. Mark Twain was one of many visitors and he wrote in 1869: \\"I shall remember The Transfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself; partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in the world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful.\\" In the early 20th century, the fame of the painting rapidly diminished and soon The Transfiguration lost its denomination as the most famous painting in the world. A new generation of artists did not accept Raphael as an artistic authority anymore. Copies and reproductions were no longer in high demand. While the complexity of the composition had been an argument to praise the painting until the end of the 19th century, viewers were now repelled by it. The painting was felt to be too crowded, the figures to be too dramatic and the whole setting to be too artificial. In contrast, other paintings like the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci were much easier to recognise and did not suffer from the decline of the overwhelming status of Raphael as an artistic example.Dohe, Leitbild Raffael, pp. 220-224. Thus The Transfiguration is a good example for the changeability of the fame of an artwork, that may last for centuries but may also decline in just a short period.  Reproductions  The fame of the painting is also based on its reproduction. While the original could only be admired in one place ‚Äì in Rome, and for a short period of time in Paris after it had been taken away by Napoleon ‚Äì the large number of reproductions ensured that the composition of the painting was omnipresent in nearly every important art collection in Europe. It could thus be studied and admired by many collectors, connoisseurs, artists and art historians. Including the mosaic in St Peter‚Äôs in the Vatican, at least 68 copies were made between 1523 and 1913. Good copies after the painting were highly sought after during the Early Modern period and young artists could earn money for an Italian journey by selling copies of The Transfiguration. One of the best painted copies ever was made by Gregor Urquhart in 1827.Dohe, Leitbild Raffael, pp. 128-129. At least 52 engravings and etchings were produced after the painting until the end of the 19th century, including illustrations for books like biographies and even for Christian songbooks. The Istituto nazionale per la grafica in Rome possesses twelve of these reproductions. At least 32 etchings and engravings can be traced that depict details of the painting, sometimes to use them as a part of a new composition. Among these depictions of details is one set of prints of heads, hands and feet engraved by G. Folo after Vincenzo Camuccini (1806), and another set of heads produced in stipple engraving by J. Godby after drawings by I. Goubaud (1818 and 1830). The first engraved reproduction of The Transfiguration is also called to be the first reproductive print of a painting ever. It was made by an anonymous engraver in 1538 and is sometimes identified with the manner of Agostino Veneziano. Iconography pouncing, 499 x 364 mm, at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford Raphael's painting depicts two consecutive, but distinct, biblical narratives from the Gospel of Matthew, also related in the Gospel of Mark. In the first, the Transfiguration of Christ itself, Moses and Elijah appear before the transfigured Christ with Peter, James and John looking on (Matthew 17:1‚Äì9; Mark 9:2‚Äì13). In the second, the Apostles fail to cure a boy from demons and await the return of Christ (Matthew 17:14‚Äì21; Mark 9:14). The upper register of the painting shows the Transfiguration itself (on Mount Tabor, according to tradition), with the transfigured Christ floating in front of illuminated clouds, between the prophets Moses, on the right, and Elijah, on the left, with whom he is conversing (Matthew 17:3). The two figures kneeling on the left are commonly identified as Justus and Pastor who shared August 6 as a feast day with the Feast of the Transfiguration. These saints were the patrons of Medici's archbishopric and the cathedral for which the painting was intended. It has also been proposed that the figures might represent the martyrs Saint Felicissimus and Saint Agapitus who are commemorated in the missal on the feast of the Transfiguration. The upper register of the painting includes, from left to right, James, Peter and John, traditionally read as symbols of faith, hope and love; hence the symbolic colours of blue-yellow, green and red for their robes. In the lower register, Raphael depicts the Apostles attempting to free the possessed boy of his demonic possession. They are unable to cure the sick child until the arrival of the recently transfigured Christ, who performs a miracle. The youth is no longer prostrate from his seizure but is standing on his feet, and his mouth is open, which signals the departure of the demonic spirit. As his last work before this death, Raphael (which in Hebrew ◊®÷∏◊§÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú [Rafa'el] means \\"God has healed\\"), joins the two scenes together as his final testament to the healing power of the transfigured Christ. According to Goethe: \\"The two are one: below suffering, need, above, effective power, succour. Each bearing on the other, both interacting with one another.\\"In Italienische Reise, December 1787, quoted Schiller, I, 152 The man lower left is the apostle-evangelist Matthew, some would says St. Andrew, depicted at eye-level and serving as interlocutor with the viewer. The function of figures like the bottom left was best described by Leon Battista Alberti almost a century earlier in 1435. pouncing, c. 1519 Matthew (or Andrew) gestures to the viewer to wait, his gaze focused on a kneeling woman in the lower foreground. She is ostensibly a part of the family group, but on closer examination is set apart from either group. She is a mirror image of a comparable figure in Raphael's The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple (1512). Giorgio Vasari, Raphael's biographer, describes the woman as \\"the principal figure in that panel\\". She kneels in a contrapposto pose, forming a compositional bridge between the family group on the right and the nine apostles on the left. Raphael also renders her in cooler tones and drapes her in sunlit pink, while he renders the other participants, apart from Matthew, oblivious to her presence. The woman's contrapposto pose is more specifically called a figura serpentinata or serpent's pose, in which the shoulders and the hips move in opposition; one of the earliest examples being Leonardo da Vinci's Leda (c. 1504), which Raphael had copied while in Florence. In the centre are four apostles of different ages. The blonde youth appears to echo the apostle Philip from The Last Supper. The seated older man is Andrew. Simon is the older man behind Andrew. Judas Thaddeus is looking at Simon and pointing towards the boy. The apostle on the far left is widely considered to be Judas Iscariot He was the subject of one of only six surviving so-called auxiliary cartoons, first described by Oskar Fischel in 1937. Analysis and interpretation J. M. W. Turner The iconography of the picture has been interpreted as a reference to the delivery of the city of Narbonne from the repeated assaults of the Saracens. Pope Calixtus III proclaimed August 6 a feast day on the occasion of the victory of the Christians in 1456. Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu noted that the healing of the obsessed boy in the foreground takes precedence over the figure of Christ. Modern critics have furthered Montesquieu's criticism by suggesting that the painting should be renamed to \\"Healing of the Obsessed Youth\\". J. M. W. Turner had seen The Transfiguration in the Louvre, in 1802. At the conclusion of the version of his first lecture, delivered on 7 January 1811, as Professor of Perspective at the Royal Academy, Turner demonstrated how the upper part of the composition is made up of intersecting triangles, forming a pyramid with Christ at the top. In a 1870 publication, German art historian Car Justi observes that the painting depicts two subsequent episodes in the biblical narrative of Christ: after the transfiguration, Jesus encounters a man who begs mercy for his devil-possessed son. Raphael plays on a tradition equating epilepsy with the aquatic moon (luna, from whence lunatic). This causal link is played on by the watery reflection of the moon in the lower left corner of the painting; the boy is literally moonstruck. In Raphael's time, epilepsy was often equated with the moon (morbus lunaticus), possession by demons (morbus daemonicus), and also, paradoxically, the sacred (morbus sacer). In the 16th century, it was not uncommon for sufferers of epilepsy to be burned at the stake, such was the fear evoked by the condition. The link between the phase of the moon and epilepsy would only be broken scientifically in 1854 by Jacques-Joseph Moreau de Tours. Raphael's Transfiguration can be considered a prefiguration of both Mannerism, as evidenced by the stylised, contorted poses of the figures at the bottom of the picture; and of Baroque painting, as evidenced by the dramatic tension imbued within those figures, and the strong use of chiaroscuro throughout. As a reflection on the artist, Raphael likely viewed The Transfiguration as his triumph. Raphael uses the contrast of Jesus presiding over men to satiate his commissioners in the Roman Catholic Church. Raphael uses the cave to symbolize the Renaissance style, easily observed in the extended index finger as a reference to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. Additionally, he subtly incorporates a landscape in the background, but uses darker coloring to show his disdain for the style. Yet the focal point for the viewer is the Baroque styled child and his guarding father. In all, Raphael successfully appeased his commissioners, paid homage to his predecessors, and ushered in the subsequent predominance of Baroque painting. On the simplest level, the painting can be interpreted as depicting a dichotomy: the redemptive power of Christ, as symbolised by the purity and symmetry of the top half of the painting; contrasted with the flaws of Man, as symbolised by the dark, chaotic scenes in the bottom half of the painting. The philosopher Nietzsche interpreted the painting in his book The Birth of Tragedy as an image of the interdependence of Apollonian and Dionysian principles.Nietzsche, F. The Birth of Tragedy section 4. Trans W. Kaufmann. Vintage Books. 1967. The sixteenth-century painter and biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects that The Transfiguration was Raphael's \\"most beautiful and most divine\\" work.

The majority of what is known from his life comes from the book Asrar al-Tawhid (ÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ≠€åÿØ, or \\"The Mysteries of Unification\\") written by Mohammad Ibn Monavvar, one of his grandsons, 130 years after his death. The book, which is an important early Sufi writing in Persian, presents a record of his life in the form of anecdotes from a variety of sources and contains a collection of his words. During his life his fame spread throughout the Islamic world, even to Spain. He was the first Sufi writer to widely use ordinary love poems as way to express and illuminate mysticism, and as such he played a major role in foundation of Persian Sufi poetry. He spent most of his life in Nishapur. Biography Statue of Ab≈´- Sa'ƒ´d Abul-Khayr in Nishapur. Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d was born in the village of Mihne, part of Greater Khorasan, today located near mihne in Akhal Province. His father was a herbalist and physician with an interest in Sufism. He then moved and lived in the city of Nishapur, and subsequently moved back to Meyhaneh after a few years. Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d's formal education included Islamic scholarship and Arabic literature that he continued until the age 23 when he left them for Sufism. He also traveled to and spent time in small towns around the same province visiting other Sufis or his teachers. Mysticism His mysticism is a typical example of the Khorasani school of Sufism. He extracted the essence of the teachings of the past Sufis of this school (and to some extent other schools as well) and expressed them in a simpler, and in a sense deeper, form without the use of philosophy. He held a special reverence for earlier Sufis, especially Bayazid Bastami and Hallaj. Moreover, in Asrar al-Tawhid, Tazkiratul AwliyƒÅ and Noorul Uloom it has been written that Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d went for the visit of Shaikh Abul Hassan Kharaqani and got deeply influenced by his personality and state. His system is based on a few themes that appear frequently in his words, generally in the form of simple emotional poems. The main focus of his teachings is liberation from ‚ÄúI‚Äù, which he considered the one and only cause of separation from God and to which he attributed all personal and social misfortunes. His biography mentions that he would never call himself \\"I\\" or \\"we\\" but ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead. This idea of selflessness appears as Fotovvat (a concept very near to chivalry) in his ethical teachings and as Malaamat, a kind of selflessness before the Beloved which he considers a sign of perfect love in his strictly mystical teachings. Both of these concepts in a certain sense are spiritual forms of warrior ethics. Despite their simplicity he believed that the full application of these teachings to one's life requires both divine grace and the guidance of an experienced Sufi, and is impossible through personal efforts alone. His picture as portrayed in various Sufi writings is a particularly joyful one of continuous ecstasy. Other famous Sufis made frequent references to him, a notable example being the Persian Sufi poet Farid al-Din Attar, who mentions Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d as his spiritual guide. Many miracles are attributed to him in Sufi writings. Poetry Many short Persian poems are attributed to him and he is considered one of the great medieval Persian poets. The attribution of these poems has always been doubtful and due to recent research, it is generally believed that he wrote only two poems in his life. The attribution of so many poems to Ab≈´- Sa'ƒ´d was due to his great fondness for poetry. His love for poetry can be seen from the fact that he usually used love poetry written by non-Sufis in his daily prayers. Even his last words were a poem, and at his funeral instead of the recitation of Qur‚Äôanic verses, he requested the following poem. Another example of the poems attributed to him. Views on Islam Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d insists that his teachings and Sufism as a whole are the true meaning of Islam. He based his teachings on the mystic interpretation of verses from Qur‚Äôan and some hadiths and was considered a learned Islamic scholar. Nevertheless, his interpretations of Qur‚Äôan were considered an ocean of knowledge in exegesis of the Quran. To this day this has been one of the causes of criticizing him from a religious point of view. In general he was bold in expressing his mystic opinions as can be seen from his praise of Hallaj who was considered a heretic by most of the Pseudo-Sufis and most ignoramus laymen of the time due to irrelevant conclusions without a depth of support of the great majority of the Islamic scholars of the time and present modern era, although the common opinion about Hallaj changed in time. Relationship and Avicenna There is evidence that Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d and Avicenna, the Persian physician and philosopher, corresponded with one another. Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d records several meetings between them in his biography. The first meeting is described as three days of private conversation, at the end of which Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d said to his followers that everything that he could see (i.e. in visions), Avicenna knew, and in turn Avicenna said that everything he knew Ab≈´-Sa'ƒ´d could see, in realistic theory presents the superlative connection between Islamic Saints of God (ÿ£ŸàŸÑŸäÿßÿ°, Awliya) revealing the reliability of such spiritual powers as believed to be placed on them by Allah ( ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá, God).

It is located on the western side of the Brisbane CBD and is made up of various bridges and overpasses. The North Bank development is proposed to alleviate the visual disruption of the expressway and recapture Brisbane for pedestrians. The Expressway runs the entire western length of the Brisbane CBD from Coronation Drive to the Captain Cook Bridge at Gardens Point, an estimated before becoming the Pacific Motorway which ends at the Gold Coast. Congestion The Riverside Expressway runs parallel to the Brisbane River and George Street. Traffic congestion in the central city area became problematic in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Story Bridge, William Jolly Bridge and Victoria Bridge were clogged with traffic wanting to cross from one side of town to the other. A traffic engineering company called Wilbur Smith and Associates was asked to study Brisbane's traffic problems by the state government. They delivered a report, the Brisbane Transportation Study, which included plans for traffic management for many years. In 2016, the road was the most congested in the state with average traffic speeds in afternoon peak times slowing to 19 km per hour. History The expressway at night Construction on the Riverside Expressway began in late 1968, when the pylons for the bridge were laid on the north bank of the Brisbane River. It was built over the former Short Street which provided access to a wharf. The bridge was completed in 1975 as was the Southeast Freeway to Holland Park. The Brisbane River was used as a source for gravel to make much of the concrete used in construction. =2006 appearance of cracks= During September and October 2006, roadworks occurred on the Expressway, and surrounding structures, including the Captain Cook Bridge. Maintenance on these structures had not been done since its construction in the 1970s. On 17 October 2006, parts of the expressway were closed due to safety concerns regarding hairline cracks in the Alice Street and Ann St ramps. The initial conclusion reached by engineers is that the hairline fracture, measuring over 2 metres long and 0.4 mm wide, was caused by the stress on the structure due to \\"The weight of both ramps is [now] balanced on one bearing and they are failing to shift their weight to their other bearings as designed.\\" This road closure caused widespread delays for motorists travelling through the inner city. Public transport facilities were heavily utilised to travel to work at peak periods. Business activity in the Brisbane central business district was affected by a dramatic reduction in customers as shoppers avoided the area. On 20 October Department of Main Roads workers successfully drove a 22 tonne truck up and down the Ann Street ramp deeming the ramp to have passed a weight test. The main section of the Expressway was reopened, except for the Alice St. and Ann St. ramps. A few days later the ramps were completely reopened to all but heavy vehicles. Major intersections and crossings At the northern end the road start where North Quay ends at the intersection with Herschel Street. Nearby the road is crossed by the Kurilpa Bridge. Entrance and exits are provided for both Turbot Street and Ann Street. The Riverside Expressway is then crossed by the Victoria Bridge. Further south there are entrances and exits for Elizabeth Street, Margaret Street and Alice Street. Panorama of Brisbane in Oct 1995 with the Riverside Expressway on the right side.

Quarrendon School was placed on special measures, for the second time in five years, in September 2004.The school came out of special measures in November 2006, after making satisfactory progress. In 2007, the school was planning to apply to DCSF to become a specialist Science and Technology College. The school's sixth form reopened in September 2008. Buckinghamshire County Council originally planned to close the school in 2009, and to move to a new site, built as part of the Berryfields Major Development Area (MDA), with housing replacing the school on the current site. However, in 2006 there was some doubt as to whether this would happen due to funding issues. In 2007 it was proposed that Quarrendon would become a Church Academy, jointly funded and controlled by the Local Authority and the Church of England. It was also proposed that Brunel University, would become a partner. The proposal was accepted in November 2008. Quarrendon became The Aylesbury Vale Academy in 2009 and had ¬£1.5m invested in it over the next few years. Pupils and staff at the school automatically transferred to the new Academy.

He studied with Benedetto Croce and Adolfo Omodeo, and did field research with Diego Carpitella into the funeral rituals of Lucania and the tarantism. Ernesto de Martino was born in Naples, Italy, where he studied under Adolfo Omodeo, graduating with a degree in philosophy in 1932. His degree thesis, subsequently published, dealt with the historical and philological problem of the Eleusinian Gephyrismi (ritual injuries addressed to the goddess) and provides an important methodological introduction to the concept of religion. Clearly influenced by reading Das Heilige by Rudolf Otto, de Martino preferred to emphasize the choleric nature of the believer, overturning the German scholar's thesis and making it capable of being applied to relations with gods in polytheistic religions and spirits in animist religions. Attracted by the ideological stance of the regime, for several years de Martino worked on an essay interpreting Fascism as a historically convenient form of civil religion. However, the attempt was insubstantial and the work, still unpublished, was gradually rejected by the author, who subsequently approached left-wing ideas and after the war became a supporter of the Italian Communist Party. At this time, which we now call the \\"Neapolitan\\" period, lasting until 1935, de Martino fell under the spell of the personality and work of an archaeologist who was particularly open-minded concerning the ancient history of religions and who was disliked by both the regime and its intellectual opponents: Vittorio Macchioro, known for his Orphic interpretation of the frescoes in the Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii and advocate of a theory of religion understood essentially as experience.http://www.bookrags.com/research/de-martino-ernesto-eorl-04/ From 1957 to his death he taught ethnology and history of religions at Cagliari's University: here, with Alberto Mario Cirese, Clara Gallini, Giulio Angioni and other scholars he founded the Anthropological School of Cagliari. De Martino has also been a very charismatic mentor and teacher. One of his students, the writer Muzi Epifani, dedicated to him the comedy The Escape.

Croatia bordered Bulgaria probably somewhere in present-day Bosnia,Maddalena Betti: The Making of Christian Moravia (858-882), 2013, p. 130 between the rivers Bosna and Drina.–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤: –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞. –ß–∞—Å—Ç I. –û—Ç 681 –¥–æ 1018 –≥., p. 47 The situation started changing in the early 10th century when the new Bulgarian ruler Simeon I started a campaign against the Byzantine Empire. The conflict went in favor of Bulgaria and the Byzantines found themselves in great danger. Simeon captured a large part of the Byzantine territory in Europe and was crowned as \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians\\" by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos in 913.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 155-156 He was later crowned at the church of Ohrid as \\"Tsar of all Bulgarians and Greeks\\" by the newly appointed Bulgarian patriarch in 925. However, the Byzantines always addressed Simeon as \\"prince\\" (archon) and the prelate continued to be referred to as an archbishop. According to the juridical reasoning of the time, only the Pope and the Byzantine Emperor could bestow royal or imperial titles, and an emperor might be crowned only by a patriarch. Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos protested bitterly against Simeon's usurpation of the imperial title. The Patriarch of Constantinople, Nicholas Mysticus, did the same. In such a predicament, Simeon demanded Pope John X (914-928) to send him an imperial crown and to recognize the head of the Bulgarian church as Patriarch. Naturally, Simeon had to promise to recognize the papal primacy in the Church. John X accepted Simeon's request and sent a solemn mission to Bulgaria, headed by Cardinal Madalbertus and John, illustrious Duke of Cumae. The papal mission reached Bulgaria at the end of summer or during the fall of 926, carrying a crown and scepter with which they would crown Simeon as Bulgarian Emperor. When the papal mission arrived in Preslav, Madalbertus started long negotiations with Simeon and the representatives of the Bulgarian church. Probably, Madalbertus convoked a church synod in Bulgaria as he later did in Split, in Croatia, on his way back to Rome in 928. The negotiations regarding ecclesiastical matters were successful, and Archbishop Leontius was created Patriarch in Preslav, still during Simeon's reign. = Reasons for the war = In 924 Simeon sent a large army against Zaharija in the Principality of Serbia. The Bulgarian armies ravaged Serbia and forced Zaharija to flee to Croatia. Serbia was annexed by Bulgaria by which Simeon considerably expanded his state.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 154 After Simeon's annexation of Serbia the Bulgarian state bordered the Croatian kingdom under Tomislav, who was a Byzantine ally.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 157 Croatia was now located between Bulgaria and the weakly defended Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia, a possible new target of Simeon.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 289-291 Tomislav received and protected the Serbs who were expelled by Simeon from Rascia, otherwise, Serbs would have been obliterated out of existence.De Administrando Imperio: XXXII. Of the Serbs and of the country they now dwell in Tomislav may have been granted by the Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos some years previously with some form of control over the coastal cities of the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia and rewarded with some share of the tribute collected from the cities,Florin Curta: Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250, p. 196 thus securing the friendship of Tomislav. These events were a sufficient proof to Simeon that the Croats took the side of the Byzantine Emperor and that they would support him actively in the future. Therefore, Simeon saw Croatia, harboring his enemies and allied to the empire, as a threat and he could not direct all his forces towards Byzamtium since there was nothing to prevent Croatia from striking his rear.  The battle  In 926 Simeon sent a large army to invade Croatia. The strength of Simeon's army is unknown. The commander of the Bulgarian forces in this battle was Duke Alogobotur. According to Byzantine historian Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Croatia at the time was able to field an army of 100,000 foot soldiers, 60,000 horse soldiers, 80 big battleships and 100 smaller battleships,De Administrando Imperio: XXXI. Of the Croats and of the country they now dwell in. \\"Baptized Croatia musters as many as 60 thousand horse and 100 thousand foot, and galleys up to 80 and cutters up to 100.\\" but these numbers are generally taken as a considerable exaggeration.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 262 According to the palaeographic analysis of the original manuscript of DAI, the estimation of the number of inhabitants in medieval Croatia between 440 and 880 thousand people, and military numbers of Franks and Byzantines - the Croatian military force was most probably composed of 20,000-100,000 infantrymen, and 3,000-24,000 horsemen organized in 60 allagions. The Bulgarians were met by a Croatian army in the mountainous area of Eastern Bosnia. The Croatian forces completely destroyed the Bulgarians. Arguably key to the overwhelming victory was the choice of terrain on which the battle took place. Bulgarians at the time when the battle started were in an unfavorable position and the Croatian army had made a surprise attack against them. Croatian soldiers would probably have been more experienced in fighting in the mountainous terrain of the Bosnian highlands. The Croats adjusted their military tactics, time and place of the battle to their opponents who possibly outnumbered them, which brought themselves a decisive advantage. Duke Alogobotur most likely perished in the battle along with most of his soldiers since he is no longer mentioned in sources.  Aftermath  Simeon suffered a crushing defeat, but did not lose the bulk of his forces. He had sent a part of his army on that campaign and those forces had suffered heavy losses, but his overall army was strong enough to carry out another invasion of Byzantium. The Croatian-Bulgarian war did not continue in a significant extent, no territorial changes followed, and peace was concluded after the death of Emperor Simeon in 927. In 927 Pope John X sent his legates with Bishop Madalbert to mediate between Croats and Bulgarians. Simeon died in May 927. His son and successor Peter I renewed the war with the Byzantines and concluded a peace treaty the same year. Byzantine sources, specifically George Kedrenos, say that the cause for Peter's peace treaty proposal was his fear that all his neighbors, the Hungarians, Serbians, Croatians and other, could take the advantage of Simeon's death to attack Bulgaria. In addition, Bulgaria had a major domestic problem, a severe famine resulting from an attack by locusts.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 161  See also  *Croatian‚ÄìBulgarian wars *History of Croatia *History of Bulgaria  References   External links  * Map of Bulgaria in the late 9th and early 10th century (–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤: \\"–°—Ö–µ–º–∞ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ —Å –í–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—è –∫—ä–º 865 –∏ 905 –≥. –∏ —Å –•—ä—Ä–≤–∞—Ç—Å–∫–æ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ 30-—Ç–µ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ X –≤.\\") 10th-century military history of Croatia 920s conflicts 926 Battles involving the First Bulgarian Empire Battles involving medieval Croatia Military history of Bosnia and Herzegovina 10th century in Bulgaria Battles of the Middle Ages Medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"Croatian‚ÄìBulgarian battle of 926"},{"id":"2952682","text":"The Independent Schools Council (ISC) is a non-profit lobby group that represents over 1,300 schools in the United Kingdom's independent education sector.

In 1998, it reconstituted as the Independent Schools Council. Schools that are members of the associations that constitute ISC are inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI). Since December 2003, ISI has been the body approved by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for the inspection of ISC schools and reports to the DfE under the 2002 Education Act. ISI was part of ISC until, in late 2007, the ISI became its own limited company, thereby separating itself from ISC. The current chairman of ISC is Barnaby Lenon. ISC is run by the chief executive, Julie Robinson.  Partnerships with state schools  Figures from the 2019 ISC Annual Census show 11,466 partnerships were recorded in that year. The types of partnerships vary from academy sponsorship to seconding teaching staff, serving as governors at state schools and sharing facilities to partnering for activities and 5,000 projects. The ISC has published an annual report of cross-sector partnership work between independent and state schools called Celebrating Partnerships.  Operation  ISC has five principal activities: * Provide authoritative research and intelligence about the sector * Provide legal and regulatory information/guidance * Provide online access and support informing parental decisions * Promote the sector through lobbying and communications * Provide a meeting place in central London for members Current priorities include the following activities: * To represent the views of our member associations in the National education debate * To champion and channel sector consensus on public examinations and national curriculum frameworks * To protect and promote the sector‚Äôs interests on charitable status, public benefit and social mobility * To promote the sector‚Äôs view on a proportionate regulatory and inspection regime * To promote the sector‚Äôs view on the proper regulatory framework for all aspects of safeguarding * To protect and promote the sector‚Äôs interests in recruiting overseas pupils * To support schools offering early years education * To carry out annual data gathering and analysis on the sector via the Census * To analyse the sector‚Äôs performance in national exams and university offers and admissions * To carry out surveys on attitudes towards the sector and financial benchmarking * To provide support for our expert groups * To promote and coordinate the views of the sector, the associations and their members through the media * To ensure consistent media responses across the sector * To provide a high quality daily news service to all schools * To support the marketing and promotion of schools, including user friendly access to information about schools * To promote and catalogue independent-state school partnerships and provide an analysis of what works best * To detail training opportunities for unqualified teachers in ISC schools * To encourage good graduates to work in independent schools * To counter misconceptions about independent schools * To provide guidance and support for members and schools on all of the aboveIndependent Schools Council  About Us  ISC‚Äôs Strategic Objectives.

Judicial review of the Charity Commission, 2011  In 2011, the ISC challenged the Charity Commission in relation to the latter's statutory guidance on public benefit. The Upper Tribunal heard the judicial review, which was combined with an Attorney General's reference, over five days in May 2011 and reserved judgment until October 2011. The lengthy ruling upheld ISC's main ground of complaint, which was that the guidance did not reflect the true state of charity law on public benefit and charities which charge fees. A subsequent hearing and ruling in December 2011 ordered that the Commission withdraw large parts of its guidance or face a quashing order. The disputed guidance was withdrawn shortly before Christmas 2011, and replacement guidance was put out to consultation in 2012.

Caporegime is an Italian word, which is used to signify the head of a family in Sicily, but has now come to mean a ranking member, similar to captain or senior sergeant in a military unit. In general, the term indicates the head of a branch of an organized crime syndicate who commands a crew of soldiers and reports directly to the Don (Boss) or an Underboss or Streetboss. The shortened version \\"capo\\" has been used to refer to certain high-ranking members of Latin American drug cartels as well. Background The Mafia, particularly the American Mafia, is typically divided into distinct and partially independent \\"crews\\" headed by a \\"capo\\" or leader of the individuals. Individual crew members report to the capo. The crew collects protection and other money for the capo, who at regular intervals gives a share (or \\"taste\\") of the collected money to the underboss or the boss. Estimates of average income of a capo varies and is difficult to quantify. Income is dependent on the success and size of a capo's crew and the state of the economy at the time. Mafia crews are usually independent from each other, with members typically operating strictly within their own crew. Asking Mafia members how many crews and how many individuals are in a family is prohibited because of the Mafia's oath of secrecy and the suspicion that the inquiring individual might be an informant. Sometimes, a crew might specialize in certain areas like gambling, while other crews might be more involved in legitimate interests like construction. A crew might also operate in certain geographical areas. The number of caporegimes/crews depends on the size of a family. The Gambino crime family has had more than 20 capos whereas the St. Louis crime family has had fewer. Operation In the Mafia, when a boss makes a decision, he passes instructions down through the chain of command. Whenever he issues orders, in most cases he gives them to the capo. In some cases, he gives orders to the consigliere or the underboss, who in turn passes them to the capo. In either case, it is the capo who passes them to the soldiers in his crew. For years, this made it extremely difficult to indict a boss for illegal acts, since the soldiers almost never receive orders directly from him. A caporegime acts as a buffer between the soldiers and the boss. Effectively, a caporegime operates his own small family within the framework of a larger family. Each capo is in charge of a mini-gang or a crew of soldiers and associates that can range greatly in size. These men may or may not be based in close proximity. For example, Bonanno crime family capo Joey Gambino had crew members spread throughout New York's five boroughs and even had crew members operating in New Jersey. Capos have varying degrees of power. Some are relatives or close friends of the boss, which gives them more influence. A capo with an active crew generating much profit is always respected. For example, when he was a capo, John Gotti was widely respected and tolerated due to the profits his crew generated for the Gambino crime family. Despite their various blunders and mistakes, they avoided getting killed by their superiors and were tolerated due to this fact. On the other hand, capo Joe Sferra of the DeCavalcante crime family was demoted to soldier and removed from his lucrative union post in June 1965 after a series of blunders. In 1984, a more severe loss of power occurred to Salvatore \\"Salvie\\" Testa, a once rising Philadelphia crime family capo. He ended up getting murdered by Nicky Scarfo due to the suspicions raised about his loyalty. Sources * Capeci, Jerry. The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia.

L√Ω B√≠'s forces sacked the provincial capital Long Bien (Hanoi) within months in the spring of 541, and Xiao Zi managed to escape to Kuang Province, the Liang imperial capital. The Liang Dynasty unsuccessfully sent another governor to Giao Ch·ªâ afterwards.

In 548, L√Ω B√≠ was killed by treacherous Laotian tribesmen while on retreat from the Hong River Plain.Taylor 143 Facing an inevitable defeat and dwindling military supplies, Tri·ªáu Tuc realized he could not endure the long campaign and therefore he appointed his trusted son Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c in charge of the resistance military forces after L√Ω B√≠'s death.

Resistance against the Liang Recognizing the superior strength of the Liang army, Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c often retreated to more favorable terrains, mainly in the swamps and marshlands areas and stationed his armed forces in the forests for tactical advantages, where he was able to employ guerrilla warfare and wage a war of attrition against the Liang army.Woods 29 Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c was the first general to understand and make extensive use of tactical guerrilla and attrition warfare methods as a means of decimating and slowly demoralizing the enemy . Tri·ªáu would rest his army during the day and attack the Liang army at night, seizing goods and killed many Chinese soldiers. Afterwards, he quickly retreated back to his stronghold before the Chinese could reassemble their army to counter-attack.Taylor 151 After the assassination of L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø in 548, his elder brother, L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o, became the de facto ruler of V·∫°n Xu√¢n. L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o died of an illness in 555 and left no heirs, this prompted the military and officials elected Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c as leader and de facto ruler. However, his election to lead the war against the Liang was not undisputed as other prominent family members of L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø began to challenge Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c leadership. The remaining L√Ω family members and Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c alliance began to fall apart as both sides claim legitimacy. While Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c claimed rightful succession garnered through court officials, military, and the general populace. On the other hand, L√Ω family members claimed rightful leadership must be upheld through traditional hereditary as they were still considered to be the ruling family in name. As strong as the Chinese were, they could not make any headway against the type of warfare devised by the generalissimo Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞∆°ng. This indecisive period lasted until 557 when finally a respite came for the V·∫°n Xu√¢n (northern Vietnamese) country. China at this time was under the civil war during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the famous Chinese general Chen Batian's (Tr·∫ßn B√° Ti√™n) skills and troops were needed in his homeland to quell a revolt. The Vietnamese forces, however, had no time to rejoice at the news of this temporary respite. Civil war Shortly after L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o died, a L√Ω family member, L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª≠ (L√Ω Thi√™n B·∫£o's cousin) made claim to the imperial throne and challenged Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c. Both sides vied against one another and civil war broke out for the throne with no decisive victory. Wary about engaging in internal fighting that would only frustrate the people, Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞∆°ng negotiated a truce and peace. From Long Bi√™n northward would be under L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª≠'s rule and the land south of Long Bi√™n would belong to Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞∆°ng. In 571, L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª± broke the truce and attacked Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c's domain. Since Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c's domain was not prepared or imagined L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª± would attack, therefore they were easily defeated. His capital was sacked and burned by L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª±'s forces, however he managed to escape. During his retreat, Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c committed suicide. Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c's remaining forces and territories surrendered and were incorporated into L√Ω Ph·∫≠t T·ª±'s domains.Anh Th∆∞ H√†, H√≤ÃÇng ƒê·ª©c Tr√†ÃÇn A brief chronology of Vietnam's history - Page 23 2000 \\"On April 13, 548, Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c ascended the throne as Tri·ªáu Vi·ªát V∆∞ong (another name: D·∫° Tr·∫°ch V∆∞∆°ng). ...

The Yacht issue was a series of postage stamps, bearing the image of the German Kaiser's yacht, SMY Hohenzollern II, that were used in all of Germany's overseas colonies. Millions of the stamps were produced and they were the principal means of postage for all German imperial overseas possessions in the years 1900‚Äì1915. German colonies at that time were Samoa, Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, Kiautschou, Togo, Kamerun, German New Guinea, German South-West Africa, and German East Africa. History The SMY Hohenzollern II in 1902. The German colonies were all acquired between 1884 and 1899. They belonged to the Universal Postal Union and used the same postage rates as the mainland German Empire.Beach, Frederick C. & Rines, George E., eds. (1912); The Americana: A Universal Reference Library, Volume 9; Scientific American, NY. See Section 22, \\"Germany ‚Äì The Colonies\\": \\"The German colonies belong to the World [sic] Postal Union. There is the same rate of postage for letters, papers, etc., sent to Germany and to each colony as within the German Empire.\\" Initially, regular Imperial stamps from the mainland were used, and only their cancellation marks would reveal their colonial usage; later, the names of the individual colonies were overprinted upon the regular stamps before sale. In 1900, a new stamp design was released for universal use in all the colonies. Redolent of the imperial grandeur of the Kaiser, the yacht was used as a symbol of German power and prestige. The seafaring nature of the design also underscored the new hopes of the German Empire under Wilhelm II. The Kaiser had embarked on a quest to expand worldwide and by 1898 was rapidly building his navy to compete with other world powers, particularly Great Britain.Meyer, G.J. (2006); A World Undone: The Story of the Great War 1914 to 1918; Delacorte, USA; . See p.286: \\"The German Navy was born in 1898... Wilhelm II and Tirpitz had embarked upon the building of a navy that they hoped to make as powerful as Britain's....\\" The \\"Yachts\\" were first released in 1900 and remained the standard postal design for all German colonial mail until shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. By mid-1915 all the German colonies had surrendered to Allied forces, and with them came their postal administrations. The confiscated German stamps, virtually all of them Yachts, were stamped with new names and prices for Allied wartime use. The Yachts thus continued in service throughout the war years, unlike the Kaiser's yacht itself which was decommissioned in June 1914. Printing key plate could be engraved as needed. Individual Yacht issues were printed from master printing plates which were blank in the \\"scrolls\\" surrounding the design. These \\"key plate stamps\\" could be engraved with names and prices as needed. Sometimes blank stamps were printed and stored, and the text would be overprinted later. On fully engraved plates, the text color matches the design color, while overprinted blanks have their text in rich black ink. The \\"lozenges\\" watermark used on the stamp back The printing was done by the intaglio method, which required moistening of the paper before printing. After the drying process was complete, the irregular contraction of the paper would sometimes cause the finished stamps to have designs of slightly different size.Friedemann, Albert (1980); The Postage Stamps and Cancellations of the Post Offices in German South West Africa; Bergvliet, S.Africa; . See p.36: \\"The method of intaglio printing used at the time required slight moistening of the paper before printing, then drying, gumming, and finally perforating. The paper contracted irregularly, thus causing differences in the size of the printed area....\\" Early printings were not watermarked, but from 1905 onwards, the classic \\"lozenges\\" watermark was applied to the back of the paper. Two designs Two separate designs of the Yacht stamps were published. They were issued to each of the colonies in a standardized set of colors and denominations. The less expensive varieties (3‚Äì20 pf. and 1‚Äì2 marks) were printed in monotone shades of red, orange, green, indigo and brown. The more expensive versions (25‚Äì50 pf. and 3‚Äì5 marks) were printed differently for aesthetic appeal: the small design had its ship and text printed with extra heavy black outlines, while the larger design was printed with contrasting colors like red and green. Most of the stamps were denominated in German currency (1 Mark = 100 Pfennig), although German East Africa used its own currency, the Rupie (1 Rupie = 64 Pesa and, from 1905, 1 Rupie = 100 Heller). The leased port of Kiatschou used the Chinese Dollar ($1 = 100 Cents) as its currency after 1905. =Large design Yacht= The larger, more broadside, and more expensive version was printed in values of 1, 2 3, or 5 marks. The large Yacht issues were panoramic and were designed in two subtly distinct versions, one with a long unfurled scroll and another with a shorter, double-folded scroll. Together they provided the large Yachts with a visual uniformity across colonies because the font size would always be roughly the same, in contrast to the small design. Large design: representative varieties File:D-Kiautschou 1919 36 II B.jpgShort scroll: one-color, 1.5 Chinese dollars, Kiautschou.

File:D-Ostafrika 1919 39 II A.jpgLong scroll: two-color, 3 rp., German East Africa. =Small design Yacht= The smaller, forward-facing design was more common, and was printed in values of 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, and 50 pfennigs. The small Yacht issues all have exactly the same design with differences only in the text. Because the size of the blank scrolls could not be altered, significant changes to font size and structure were necessary to accommodate colony names of varying length: German Southwest Africa stood out from other issues for its tightly cramped letters, while Togo and Samoa required decorative emblems to fill in the yawning blank spaces around their names.

Following Allied occupation in the First World War, the German colonies had their stamps seized, but most were rereleased within a few days. The stamps were overprinted with the occupiers' postal codes and redenominated to the appropriate new currency. This breach of postal etiquette was taken quite poorly in Germany, and at least one provincial governor, in Belgium, decreed heavy penalties for any stamp collectors or dealers possessing Allied stamps.Chambers, William & Chambers, Robert (1917); Chambers's Journal, Vol. VII, Dec. 1916‚ÄìNov. 1917; See p. 262: \\"In retaliation for the British boycott [spoilage of German stamps], the German Governor of Belgium has imposed a heavy fine, accompanied by other pains and penalties, upon Belgian stamp dealers and collectors having in their possession any war-stamps of the Allies.\\" Issues of German New Guinea and Marshall Islands were, like Samoa, surcharged by the British with \\"G.R.I.\\"Littell, Eliakim & Littell, Robert S. (1917); The Living Age, Vol. 293; Boston USA. See p.291: \\"The German colonial postage-stamps, bearing a representation of the Imperial yacht Hohenzollern... were temporarily withdrawn from circulation...

A Layer 2 MPLS VPN is a term in computer networking. It is a method that Internet service providers use to segregate their network for their customers, to allow them to transmit data over an IP network. This is often sold as a service to businesses. Layer 2 VPNs are a type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) that uses MPLS labels to transport data. The communication occurs between routers that are known as Provider Edge routers (PEs), as they sit on the edge of the provider's network, next to the customer's network. Internet providers who have an existing Layer 2 network (such as ATM or Frame Relay) may choose to use these VPNs instead of the other common MPLS VPN, Layer 3. There is no one IETF standard for Layer 2 MPLS VPNs. Instead, two methodologies may be used. Both methods use a standard MPLS header to encapsulate data. However, they differ in their signaling protocols. Types of Layer 2 MPLS VPNs = BGP-based = The BGP-based type is based on a draft specification by Kireeti Kompella, from Juniper Networks. It uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as the mechanism for PE routers to communicate with each other about their customer connections. Each router connects to a central cloud, using BGP. This means that when new customers are added (usually to new routers), the existing routers will communicate with each other, via BGP, and automatically add the new customers to the service.Using BGP as an Auto-Discovery Mechanism for Provider-provisioned VPNs = LDP-based = The second type is based on a draft specification by Chandan Mishra from Cisco Systems. This method is also known as a Layer 2 circuit. It uses the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) to communicate between PE routers. In this case, every LDP-speaking router will exchange FECs (forwarding equivalence classes) and establish LSPs with every other LDP-speaking router on the network (or just the other PE router, in the case when LDP is tunnelled over RSVP-TE), which differs from the BGP-based methodology. The LDP-based style of layer 2 VPN defines new TLVs and parameters for LDP to aid in the signaling of the VPNs.Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)  Vendor implementations  * Alcatel-Lucent: LDP based * Foundry Networks: LDP-based (NetIron XMR Series, NetIron MLX Series) * Juniper Networks: BGP-based (MX/M/T/J-series) * Juniper Networks: LDP-based (MX/M/T/J/E-series) * Cisco Systems: LDP-based (IOS) * Cisco Systems: LDP- based and BGP-based (IOS XR) * Cisco Systems: LDP-Based [BGP-DISC] * MRV communications : LDP-based * Lucent Technologies (formerly Riverstone Networks): LDP-based * Ericsson (formerly Redback Networks): LDP-based * Huawei Technologies: LDP-based & BGP-based (NE/S-series) * ZTE:LDP-based & BGP-based (ZXCTN6000/9000 series, ZXR10 series) References MPLS networking ","title":"Layer 2 MPLS VPN"},{"id":"2952762","text":"Alan Barnes may refer to: *Alan Barnes (cricketer) (1850‚Äì1915), English cricketer *Alan Barnes (murder victim) ( 1962‚Äì1979), murder victim in Adelaide, possibly killed by Bevan Spencer von Einem *Alan Barnes (musician) (born 1959), English jazz musician *Alan Barnes (writer), British writer and editor in the field of cult film and television ","title":"Alan Barnes"},{"id":"2952763","title":"Bundesautobahn 46"},{"id":"2952772","text":"Martin Luther University College, formerly Waterloo Lutheran Seminary, is a seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada federated with the nondenominational Wilfrid Laurier University, located in Waterloo, Ontario. History The college building as seen from the Wilfrid Laurier University Library in 2013 In 1911, the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary of Eastern Canada opened its doors to students. Waterloo was selected as the location of the seminary for two main reasons, the first being that land was offered by the citizens of Waterloo on the edge of town, and the second being that most of the Lutherans in Canada resided in the Waterloo and Berlin (now known as Kitchener) area. In 1914 the Seminary developed non-theological courses under the name of the Waterloo College School. In 1924 the Waterloo College of Arts was established, offering post-secondary three-year programs. In 1925 the Faculty of Arts, under the name of Waterloo College, affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. The Waterloo College Associate Faculties (WCAF), a semi-autonomous entity within Waterloo College focused on cooperative education in applied sciences, was conceived in the 1950s by the College's president Gerald Hagey. WCAF accepted its first cohort of students in 1957, and formally split from Waterloo College in 1959 to become the University of Waterloo. In 1960, Waterloo College ended its affiliation with Western and became a university in its own right: Waterloo Lutheran University. As a church-affiliated institution, Waterloo Lutheran was ineligible for capital funding from the province, and the Lutheran church was in no position to invest heavily in the university. On November 1, 1973, Waterloo Lutheran University dropped its church affiliation and became the secular, public Wilfrid Laurier University. Theological courses continued to be offered by the Waterloo Lutheran Seminary, which federated with the public university. Today Wilfrid Laurier University emphasizes liberal arts while the University of Waterloo emphasises science and engineering. Waterloo Lutheran Seminary renamed itself to Martin Luther University College, with an announcement at the Eastern Synod Assembly in Toronto on Saturday, June 23, 2018. The school (Luther, for short) continues to be federated with Laurier. Programs The entrance to the college Theological Education Martin Luther University College offers Master of Divinity program for people preparing for the ministry in a variety of churches and Master of Arts in Theology program in two fields: Public Faith and Spirituality and Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy. Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy is the largest program, and prepares people to work in clinical settings such as counselling agencies. Individuals studying for the diaconal ministry of the ELCIC can pursue the Public Faith and Spirituality field. * Bachelor of Arts in Christian Studies and Global Citizenship *Master of Divinity * Master of Arts in Theology: Public Faith and Spirituality * Doctor of Philosophy in Human Relationships: Pastoral Leadership Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy (counselling) The Waterloo Lutheran Seminary offers non-denominational graduate counselling programs within their Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy program stream. Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy is a unique form of therapy which uses spiritual resources as well as psychological understanding for healing and growth. It is provided by mental health professionals with in-depth spiritual, religious and theological education. Graduates of the Spiritual Care & Psychotherapy programs serve throughout society in counselling centres, social agencies, hospitals, schools, churches and synagogues. Drawing on spiritual and religious resources, chaplains and counsellors assist persons who are struggling with depression, grief, marital and family conflict, substance abuse and other issues. They also work with those persons who are seeking something more from their lives. Graduate programs in Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy: * Master of Arts in Theology: Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy * Doctor of Philosophy in Human Relationships: Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy * Graduate Diploma in Spiritual Care and Psychotherapy Partnerships The Seminary offers the most extensive selection of Pastoral Counselling programs in Canada and graduates have been accredited by American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy and the Canadian Association for Pastoral Practice and Education.

Under Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) standards, programs require graduates to have earned an accredited bachelor's degree or its equivalent. Programs usually require students to complete two years of full-time study or its equivalent to earn the degree. The degree can serve as preparation for entering a doctoral program in theology (ThD), religion (PhD), or a related subject, such as education, counseling, social sciences, or humanities. The MTS degree should not be confused with the Master of Sacred Theology (STM) degree which is usually an additional year-long program of advanced study after the MTS or Master of Divinity (MDiv) degree focusing on one area of special interest. Some divinity schools and seminaries, notably Yale Divinity School, use the degree title \\"Master of Arts in Religion\\", abbreviated MAR, instead of Master of Theological Studies.https://divinity.yale.edu/admissions- aid/degree-programs-and-certificates/master-arts-religion Curriculum The MTS may require the completion of a summative evaluation, which could be a thesis or other project.

He was, because of his surname, nicknamed \\"Dutchy\\". Holland, who spent the majority of his cricketing life in Newcastle, was a late bloomer, and his Test debut aged 38 made him the oldest Australian debutant in more than half a century. It was not until the 1978‚Äì79 season, aged 32, that the New South Wales selectors called up Holland to continue the state‚Äôs long tradition of leg spin bowling. He quickly formed an integral part of the bowling attack that made the state the dominant domestic team in the Sheffield Shield in the 1980s. Forming a spin oriented attack with Murray Bennett (left arm orthodox) and Greg Matthews (off spin), Holland was part of the team that won the Sheffield Shield in 1982‚Äì83, 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86. Holland finished his first class career with a season with Wellington in New Zealand‚Äôs domestic league. Career When Holland was 15 he met Colin McCool, the player coach at Belmont Club. When he was 19 he played for Northern NSW against Mike Smiths' 1965‚Äì66 MCC team. He represented Northern NSW in 1975‚Äì76 against the touring West Indian side as an opening batsman. =1978‚Äì79= Holland made his Shield debut in 1978‚Äì79, taking 1-113 against Queensland.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/38/38857.html It was the only first class game he played that summer, the selectors preferring David Hourn and Graeme Beard to be the NSW spinners. =1979-80= Holland played for NSW in the 1979-80 season. He took four wickets against Queensland,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39825.html five against Victoriahttps://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39834.html seven against Tasmania,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39859.html three against the touring Englishhttps://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39932.html and five against South Australia.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/39/39966.html He wound up taking 25 first class wickets at 30.48. =1980‚Äì81= Holland's 4‚Äì30 helped NSW beat WA by an innings. He was left out of the McDonald's Cup side but kept in the NSW Shield team. He took 5‚Äì82 against South Australia, his first five- wicket haul at first class level. He took 30 wickets that summer at 31.03. =1981‚Äì82= Holland took six wickets in his first Shield game and four in his second, causing people to discuss him as a test prospect. He took 27 wickets that summer at 24.48. =1982‚Äì83= Highlights of this summer included 3‚Äì16 against Queensland. However Holland had relative lack of success over this summer, taking only 16 wickets at 52.06 with a best of 4-100. =1983‚Äì84= Holland took his best figures to date, 7‚Äì56 against South Australia. There was some talk this would put him in contention to replace the Australian spinner, Tom Hogan. He took 24 wickets at 29.91. =1984-85 season: West Indies= Holland began the 1984‚Äì85 Shield comp well with four wickets against South Australia. Holland made his Test debut in the Second Test of the 1984‚Äì85 Australian season against the West Indies cricket team in Brisbane. He was relatively unsuccessful, taking 2/97 and scoring 6 and 0 as Australia suffered an eight wicket defeat. He was retained for the Third Test in Adelaide, but after taking match figures of 2/163, he was dropped. Holland went back to New South Wales and continued the form which had gained him Test selection in the first place. This included a tour match victory over the West Indies, after which both Holland and Bennett were selected for the Fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The selectors had felt that the uncertain performance of the Caribbean batsmen during the tour match showed that they had a weakness against spin bowling, and introduced a \\"horses for courses\\" spin oriented attack on a dry Sydney pitch. The West Indies had crushed Australian opposition throughout the summer, winning the first three Tests by an innings, eight wickets and 191 runs respectively. Furthermore, in the fourth Test, Australia had slumped to 8/198 chasing 370 to narrowly avoid defeat when time ran out. With pundits expecting another Australian failure, they won the toss and amassed 9/471. The West Indies were reduced to be all out for 163, with Holland taking 6/54 including Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Larry Gomes and captain Clive Lloyd. Forced to follow on, they fell for 253 in the second innings with Holland taking 4/90 to complete a ten wicket match haul. The New South Wales pair perplexed the tourists, taking 15 of the 20 wickets, as Australia took an unexpected innings victory. Following his spin success at the SCG, he was selected to make his ODI debut on the same ground against the same team in the subsequent triangular tournament. With 0/50, he was the most expensive bowler in the match and did not play again in the season. Holland took 59 first class wickets that summer at 25.79. =1985 Ashes= He was selected for the 1985 Ashes tour to England, but only had sporadic success. In the ODIs, he played only in the first match at Manchester. He took his only ODI wickets with 2/49 as Australia won, but was the most expensive bowler and was dropped. He was not selected for the First Test, but was recalled for the Second Test at Lord's. He took 5/68 in the second innings, breaking a stubborn century partnership between Mike Gatting and Ian Botham to take the last four wickets and ensure Australia had a small target to chase, which they did successfully. He was used mostly as a defensive option, and took few wickets with only a further wicket coming for the cost of 355 runs in the next three Tests, after which he was dropped for the final Sixth Test. Holland took 29 first class wickets on tour at 35.06. =1985-86 season= He had another highlight upon his return to Australia for the 1985‚Äì86 season. After conceding 106 runs without success in the First Test as Australia lost by an innings, Holland took a 10 wicket match haul against New Zealand at the SCG, as Australia took a four wicket win to avoid being whitewashed by their neighbours. He took 6/106 in the first innings to reduce New Zealand to 9/169 before 4/68 in the second ensured Australia was able to chase the target. He managed 3/90 and ended a run of five consecutive ducks in the Third Test but it was not enough to prevent Australia's first and only series loss to New Zealand. He was dropped for start of the series against India in favor of Ray Bright but was recalled for the Third Test at the SCG, where he played his final Test. He failed to trouble the spin-proficient Indians, taking 1/113 as they amassed 600 and pushed for an innings victory when time ran out. His Test career spanned eleven Tests and consisted of unpenetrative streaks interspersed with wicket taking bursts. He took 34 wickets at 39.76, but excluding the Tests at Sydney, Lord‚Äôs and Adelaide respectively mentioned earlier, the other eight Tests yielded only nine wickets. He took 48 first class wickets at 32.39 that summer. Holland was overlooked for the tour of New Zealand and India. Cricket writer Phil Wilkins said that \\"ignoring Holland for India seemed indecent with its excessively demanding conditions and the siege mentality which so often applies to the game with its consuming hours of waiting and watching and working.\\" \\"I found I was very tired towards the end of last season,\\" said Holland in October 1986. \\"I lost that bit of zip in my bowling, I was not doing enough to get people out, I was not spinning the ball as much.\\" He did tour Zimabwe and took 9 wickets at 26.77. =1986-87 season= At the beginning of the 1986‚Äì87 summer, Holland expressed interest in being available for Australian selection. He was not picked, the selectors preferring Greg Matthews, Peter Sleep and Peter Taylor. He took 17 wickets at 45.05 with a best return of 6-86. =1987-88= Holland played one more season of first class cricket, in New Zealand. He took 31 wickets at 23.80 with a best return of 7-69. Career summary His bowling was marked by use of flight, a disciplined length and a variety of leg breaks and topspinners and a googly that was used relatively sparsely. He took 316 wickets at 31.16 in 95 first class matches. His batting was poor, averaging 9.67 at first-class level. He made five successive Test ducks, an unfortunate Test record he jointly holds with Ajit Agarkar and Mohammad Asif, in a career yielding 35 runs at an average of 3.18, but a defiant resistance effort in the 1984‚Äì85 Shield final helped ensure a New South Wales triumph. Personal life Holland was a civil engineering surveyor, and was married to Carolyn, with three adult children named Craig, Rohan and Naomi. Rohan, was named in honour of his cricketing hero, Rohan Kanhai, the former West Indian cricketer. Robert had 5 grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, Thomas Holland, was selected in 2014 as a high school student to represent Australia in baseball (Under 15's). Holland devoted most of his time to his two lifelong passions. First was his local cricket club, Southern Lakes Cricket Club (now known as Toronto Workers Cricket Club), a successful and progressive club in Toronto, NSW. The club enjoys encouraging and sponsoring promising foreign and domestic cricketers to play with them during the upcoming seasons. Holland was also a keen bowling coach who enjoyed passing on his secrets to the new cricketing generations at high schools and coaching clinics around Australia. In an international cricketing era where there were many instances of abrasive on field behaviour, Holland was especially known and regarded for his sense of gentlemanly conduct and commitment. In September 2006, Holland celebrated his 60th birthday with a celebrity cricket match with former teammates. In August 2016 Holland and his wife were assaulted and hospitalised in Lake Macquarie. Holland had asked a man and a woman to stop riding motorcycles on the cricket ground where he volunteered as a curator. The pair were later arrested and found guilty. In April 2017, Holland had a brain tumour removed, which was later diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. On 15 September 2017 a benefit night was held to help raise money to fund treatment, hosted by Mark Taylor. A number of former teammates including Greg Matthews, Trevor Chappell, Wayne Phillips and Murray Bennett were in attendance. This was in addition to a crowd sourcing page to help raise the $45,000 required. However, Holland died two days after the benefit event.

The poem whose actual title is al-KawƒÅkib ad-durriyya fƒ´ Mad·∏• Khayr al-Bariyya (, \\"The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation\\"), is famous mainly in the Sunni Muslim world. It is entirely in praise of Muhammad, who is said to have been praised ceaselessly by the afflicted poet, to the point that the Prophet appeared in a dream and wrapped him in a mantle or cloak; in the morning the poet discovers that God has cured him. BƒÅnat Su øƒÅd, a poem composed by Ka'b bin Zuhayr was originally called as Al-Burdah. He recited this poem in front of Muhammad after embracing Islam. Muhammad was so moved that he removed his mantle and wrapped it over him. The original Burdah is not as famous as the one composed by Imam al-Busiri even though Muhammad had physically wrapped his mantle over Ka'b not in a dream like in the case of Imam al-Busiri.  Composition  Al-Busiri narrated the circumstances of his inspiration to write the Burdah: The Burda is divided into 10 chapters and 160 verses all rhyming with each other. Interspersing the verses is the refrain, \\"My Patron, confer blessings and peace continuously and eternally on Your Beloved, the Best of All Creation\\" (Arabic: ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸä ÿµŸÑ Ÿàÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ ÿØÿßÿ¶ŸÖÿß ÿ£ÿ®ÿØÿß ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ≠ÿ®Ÿäÿ®ŸÉ ÿÆŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÑŸÇ ŸÉŸÑŸáŸÖ). Each verse ends with the Arabic letter mƒ´m, a style called mƒ´miyya. The 10 chapters of the Burda comprise: *On Lyrical love yearnly *On Warnings about the Caprices of the Self *On the Praise of the Prophet *On His Birth *On His Miracles *On the Exalted Stature and Miraculous Merits of the Qur'an *On the Ascension of the Prophet *On the Struggle of Allah's Messenger *On Seeking Intercession through the Prophet *On Intimate Discourse and the Petition of One's State.  Popularity  Sunni Muslims have traditionally venerated the poem. It is memorized and recited in congregations, and its verses decorate the walls of public buildings and mosques. This poem decorated Al-Masjid al- Nabawi (the mosque of Muhammad) in Medina for centuries but was erased but for two lines. Over 90 commentaries have been written on this poem and it has been translated into Hausa, Persian, Urdu, Turkish, Berber, Punjabi, English, French, German, Sindhi, Saraiki, Norwegian, Chinese (called Tianfangshijing), and other languages. It is known and recited by a large number of Sunni Muslims, ordinarily and on special occasions, such as Mawlid, making it one of the most recited poems in the world. Translations The poem has seen several different translations, into a variety of languages.See section, \\"Popularity\\" Arguably the most important translation of recent times is that by Timothy Winter into English.\\"Imam al-Busiri, The Mantle Adorned\\", Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad), (London: Quilliam Press, 2009) Audio The full rendition of this famous poem has been produced by The Adel Brothers. They have sung the full poem in over 20 different styles.'The Mantle of Praise', see 'External links' below. Legacy The Burda was accepted within Sunni Islam and was the subject of numerous commentaries by mainstream Sunni scholars such as Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, Nazifi and Qastallani It was also studied by the Shafi'i hadith master Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 A.H.) both by reading the text out loud to his teacher and by receiving it in writing from a transmitter who heard it directly from Busiri himself. The founder of Wahhabism, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, considered the poem to be idolatory (shirk).

Tradition Hayrides traditionally have been held as celebratory activities, usually in connection to celebration of the autumn harvest. Hayrides originated with farmhands and working farm children riding loaded hay wagons back to the barn for unloading, which was one of the few times during the day one could stop to rest during the frenetic days of the haying season. By the late 19th century and the spread of the railroads, tourism and summer vacations in the country had become popular with urban families, many of whom had read idealized accounts of hayrides in children's books. To capitalize on the demand, local farmers began offering \\"genuine hayrides\\" on wagons loaded with hay, since one could make more cash income selling rides to \\"summer people\\" than by selling the same wagon-load of hay (although most farmers did both). During this era, farming was transforming from a subsistence system to a cash system, and there were few options for bringing real money into the average farm. Over time the hayride became a real tradition, although the original concept of riding on top of a load of hay was gradually replaced with a simple ride in a wagon sitting on a layer of hay intended to cushion the ride. This was considered far safer than (if not as fun as) riding perched 15-20 feet on top of a slippery pile of hay on a moving vehicle. Contemporary hayrides are often organized commercially, providing an additional source of income for farms or existing on their own as an enfranchised activity during the fall season. During fall, a hayride may feature a stop at a pumpkin patch where passengers can pick a pumpkin or be dropped off to pick apples. Hayrides may also deliver customers to the entrance of a corn maze. Haunted Hayrides Hayrides on Halloween are often dubbed as 'haunted hayrides'. These hayrides sometimes incorporate special effects and actors portraying ghosts, monsters, and other spooky creatures to attract thrill-seekers and capitalize on the Halloween season. Haunted Hayrides are held all over North America, but most prominently on the East Coast including major ones in Crownsville, MD and Mountville, PA.  Accidents  Despite the fact that hayrides are typically regarded as a lighthearted activity, there have been incidents where hayrides have flipped or veered off-road and resulted in injuries or death. Other accidents, such as the Cormier-Village hayride accident, can occur when hayrides collide with other vehicles on or near roads.

It occurs naturally in the tars obtained by the distillation of resinous woods. It crystallizes in large plates, which melt at 98.5 ¬∞C and boil at 390 ¬∞C. It is readily soluble in warm ether and in hot glacial acetic acid. Sodium and boiling amyl alcohol reduce it to a tetrahydroretene, but if it heated with phosphorus and hydriodic acid to 260 ¬∞C, a dodecahydride is formed. Chromic acid oxidizes it to retene quinone, phthalic acid and acetic acid. It forms a picrate that melts at 123-124 ¬∞C. Retene is derived by degradation of specific diterpenoids biologically produced by conifer trees. The presence of traces of retene in the air is an indicator of forest fires; it is a major product of pyrolysis of conifer trees. It is also present in effluents from wood pulp and paper mills. Retene, together with cadalene, simonellite and ip-iHMN, is a biomarker of higher plants, which makes it useful for paleobotanic analysis of rock sediments. The ratio of retene/cadalene in sediments can reveal the ratio of the genus Pinaceae in the biosphere.  Health Effects  A recent study has shown retene, which is a component of the Amazonian organic PM10, is cytotoxic to human lung cells.

The Salem Street Burying Ground was used exclusively from the late 17th century to the late 19th century for the burial of the town's wealthy. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The Salem Street Burying Ground was originally the private cemetery of the Wade family. It was acquired by the town of Medford in May 1717. The earliest stone is dated 1683 and the latest 1881. Records indicate that there are six hundred people buried there, but there are only 485 markers. There are several known reasons for this discrepancy. During the 17th century, one gravestone often marked the burial place of several members of the same family. The final resting place of no less than four members of the Wade family is marked by a single large, brown, slate block; among the largest in the burial ground. Similarly, near the Riverside Avenue entrance of the cemetery, a flagpole and granite stone marker (pictured) commemorate the graves of several unknown Revolutionary war soldiers buried there. The marker's text reads, \\"In Memory of New Hampshire Soldiers who Fell at Bunker Hill Buried in this Town and Interred at this Spot.\\" Records also indicated that there are more than fifty slaves buried in unmarked graves in the southwest corner of the cemetery.  History  The cemetery and the area surrounding it were settled as a plantation owned by the absent Matthew Craddock, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, in 1630. The land was used as a private farm and plantation for forty-five years. From 1660 to 1675, the second owner of the land, Edward Collins, broke the land up into smaller tracts which were sold individually. The purchasers, the Tufts, Bradshaw, Willis, Wade, Brooks, Francis, and Whitmore families became the founders of the town of Medford. The largest farm in the area was owned by Jonathan Wade. When Wade died in 1689, he left the estate to his son, Dudley. It included \\"that little pasture called the burying place\\". By 1717, the Wade family plot had become the town burying ground.  The graves  Among several notable figures buried there are Massachusetts Governor and Revolutionary War figure John Brooks, whose grave is marked by a large obelisk located in the approximate center of the Burying Ground, and Sarah Bradlee Fulton, a Revolutionary War heroine whose grave is marked by a rock to the left of the Brooks monument. The details of 35 graves have been documented. Starting from the Burying Ground's northwest corner and working eastward, the graves were selected for documentation in alternating groups of five (five were chosen and their data recorded, the next five were skipped, the following five chosen, and so on). The information collected included first and last names, ages, birth dates (when available), death dates and gravestone iconography. Also included were any pertinent titles (Deacon, Captain, Major, etc.). Many of the markers fail to provide any specific birth date, noting instead the age of the deceased in years, months, and days. The tombstones of the female dead often omit a first name (for example, \\"Here lyes buried the wife John Chalcedony, Mrs. Chalcedony\\"). By far the most prevalent image on the tombstones is the winged skull motif, which represents an ascension into Heaven. Among other symbols engraved on the stones are the willow tree, representing sadness or mourning; the hourglass, representing the passage of time; and bones, representing death or decay. For the most part the markers are headstones, but there are also three obelisks, two table tombs, one double stone, and three large slabs. There is also a large, tall block of what appears to be granite in the most southerly corner of the cemetery that has no markings of any kind, and it is unclear whether this is a memorial of or just surplus stone. There is no mention of it in any of the records consulted. Aside from that granite block, most of the markers are made from slate.

Sa√Ød came to public prominence after helping facilitate the Al-Yamamah arms deal between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. He established the Sa√Ød Foundation in 1982 and the Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford in 1996 with an initial ¬£20 million donation to the University. Sa√Ød owns several properties worldwide, including Tusmore Park in Oxfordshire, but is officially a resident of Monaco. Sa√Ød is a Foundation Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford. Biography Sa√Ød was born in Damascus, Syria, in 1939 to a prominent Syrian family. Sa√Ød's grandfather had served in the Turkish army during the Ottoman period, reaching the rank of general and was a colonial governor of Ottoman Syria. Sa√Ød was the youngest son of Rida Sa√Ød, a prominent Syrian ophthalmologist who was the Syrian Minister for Higher Education and who had founded the Syrian University in Damascus in 1926 under the request of the then King Faisal. Sa√Ød's father died when he was still a child, and after initial schooling by Jesuits in Beirut, Lebanon, Sa√Ød studied at the Institute of Bankers in London. Sa√Ød had been offered a place at the University of Cambridge, but was unable to take up the place as a result of political instability in Syria in which his family's assets were sequestrated.Valerie Grove. 'My Battle with the Dons', The Times, London, 13 November 1996, pg .17 Sa√Ød finally left Syria amidst the 1963 Syrian coup d'√©tat. Sa√Ød described the atmosphere in Syria at the time as being similar to 'the Terror in the French Revolution' in which 'young men were being rounded up.' In Switzerland Sa√Ød worked for the Union de Banque Suisse (now UBS), and later the Banque Commerciale Arabe SA, before his return to England. Sa√Ød established two restaurants serving Middle Eastern cuisine in London in 1967, including Caravanserai on Kensington High Street, the restaurants were sold in 1969. In 1969 Sa√Ød married Rosemary Thompson, whom he had met in Switzerland, and they had three children together; two sons, Karim and Khaled, and a daughter, Rasha. In 1981 their son Karim died in an accident at the home of Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia. Sa√Ød was attending a ceremony at the prince's house at the time to receive Saudi citizenship by royal decree. To honour his son Sa√Ød established the Karim Rida Sa√Ød Foundation to help disadvantaged children and young people of the Middle East. Sa√Ød moved to Saudi Arabia in 1969. Saudi Arabia lacked much modern infrastructure at the time, and large infrastructure projects were subsequently funded by the rising price of oil in the early 1970s. During this period of time, he founded and invested in companies that supported large-scale infrastructural projects. Sa√Ød was ambassador and head of the delegation of St Vincent and the Grenadines to UNESCO from 1996 to 2018. Sa√Ød also previously served as St Vincent and the Grenadines ambassador to the Holy See.http://www.svgconsulate.co.uk/overseas_diplomatic_and_consular.htm In March 2016, Sa√Ød was told by British banking firm Barclays that he could no longer bank with them, despite having been a long-standing customer; the BBC reported that \\"The bank is understood to be concerned about holding accounts that are linked to what are described as 'high-risk countries'\\". In response, Sa√Ød said he would be taking legal action against Barclays. Those proceedings were settled by June 2016. =Relationship with Syria= Sa√Ød assisted the future Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with securing a place in Britain to study ophthalmology in 1992, and was acquainted with the Anglo-Syrian family of Assad's wife, Asma al-Assad (n√©e Akhras). In a 2012 interview with Charles Moore in The Spectator, Sa√Ød said that he had found Bashar '...civilised, nice, polished', and that he admired Asma as 'a caring person'. Sa√Ød welcomed Bashar's ascension to the Presidency of Syria following the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, feeling it was Syria's 'only salvation. His acceptance speech in 2000 was music to my ears. He said he wanted to reform the legal system, revoke the [now 50-year-old] emergency laws, and fight corruption.' Sa√Ød helped introduce Western politicians and businesspeople to Syria, and helped push for political reform in the country. Visiting Syria in 2011 at the advent of the Syrian uprisings in response to the Arab Spring, Sa√Ød told Asma that 'the winds of change are contagious. Please tell the President to promise free elections. He must be the champion of change.' Sa√Ød was appalled by the resulting Syrian Civil War and was summoned to see Bashar al-Assad in June 2011 as he wished to gauge Western views of the conflict. Sa√Ød implored Assad to enact promised reforms and to engage with his political opponents. Sa√Ød welcomed the Arab Spring and wished for a secular government in Egypt modelled on that of Turkey's. =Sa√Ød Foundation= The Karim Rida Sa√Ød Foundation was established in 1982 by Wafic and Rosemary Sa√Ød in memory of their son. It was renamed the Sa√Ød Foundation in 2008. It is an English charity. Since 1984, the Scholarships Programme has offered scholarships and training opportunities for talented young Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese and Palestinians, mainly to study in the UK, to enable them to acquire skills that will bring benefits to others in their countries of origin. To date the Foundation has funded scholarships for almost 900 students from these countries. In 1993 the Foundation established the Child Development Programme (CDP) with the aim of supporting Jordanian, Lebanese and Palestinian community-based organisations to develop and deliver good quality and sustainable care services for disabled children and education in areas of greatest need. The CDP has funded more than 250 project grants since its start, reaching tens of thousands of children. In 1996, the Foundation established the first Disability Programme in Syria, opening an office in 2001 to directly implement the Programme. The office became a locally registered charity in Syria in 2012, the Sa√Ød Foundation for Development. The programme worked to strengthen the professional capacity of disability practitioners and organisations, raising awareness of disability, developing a cadre of national trainers in disability-related fields and supporting or providing services for children with disabilities (and their families) especially in marginalised communities. Due to the current turmoil in Syria, since late 2011 the Sa√Ød Foundation has been providing support for non-political organisations that are delivering emergency humanitarian assistance, including shelters, medical care and schooling, to Syrians most affected by the crisis, whether refugees in Lebanon and Jordan or internally displaced within Syria itself. It has pledged over US$1.8 million to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) for university scholarships for Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. The Sa√Ød Foundation also supports the Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford. =Business career= In the 1960s Sa√Ød became acquainted with the Saudi Arabian princes Bandar and Khalid, sons of Prince Sultan. Sultan was the brother of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and would later become the Saudi Defence Minister; princes Bandar and Khalid would later serve as the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States and co-commander of Allied forces in the Gulf War, respectively. Following his acquaintance with Akram Ojjeh, a fellow Syrian financier and the founder of the TAG Group, Sa√Ød established TAG Systems Constructions SA, a civil engineering and telecommunications business, which he chaired. In 1992 Sa√Ød won a unanimous verdict in a libel case in the British high court, and was awarded ¬£400,000 in damages.David Davis. \\"Tycoon wins libel case over letters.\\" The Times, London, 22 May 1992, pg. 3 The case concerned letters that had been published alleging that Sa√Ød was untrustworthy. Sa√Ød described the letters as \\"humiliating and untrue\\", and that the allegations in the letters had caused him \\"tremendous damage\\". Sa√Ød owned almost 50% of British Mediterranean Airways, and loaned the airline ¬£8 million before its 2007 sale to BMI. Sa√Ød's wealth was estimated at ¬£1.5 billion by the Sunday Times Rich List in 2014. In 1995 Sa√Ød co-founded Sagitta Asset Management, which handled his family's wealth and the assets of other ultra high-net-worth individuals and their families, it was sold to Fleming Family & Partners in 2005.Caroline Merrell. \\"Fleming buys arms broker's fund\\", The Times, London, 23 November 2005, pg. 51 Sa√Ød also invested in the merchant bank established by Jonathan Aitken, Aitken Hume, and invested ¬£5 million in the short lived Sunday Correspondent newspaper. In the United States Sa√Ød invested in the National Bank of Washington and Garfinckel's stores. =Al-Yamamah contract= Sa√Ød helped facilitate the al-Yamamah deal between the British and Saudi governments in the 1980s. The al-Yamamah deal is the biggest export deal in British history and has generated ¬£43 billion in revenue for the British company BAE Systems. The Daily Telegraph has described Sa√Ød as a 'key fixer' who 'helped broker' the deal, with the Guardian describing Said as the 'fixer at the heart' of the deal. The Guardian newspaper wrote that from the proceeds of al-Yamamah '[British] Police later calculated that more than ¬£6bn may have been distributed in corrupt commissions, via an array of agents and middlemen'. In June 2007, the BBC's Panorama alleged BAE Systems had paid Prince Bandar \\"hundreds of millions of pounds\\" in return for his role in the al-Yamamah deals. Turki bin Nasser was also a recipient of money from BAE. An investigation into the al-Yamamah deal was opened by the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and later closed for reasons of national security after the Saudi Arabian government had threatened to withhold cooperation on anti-terrorist issues. In a 2007 statement issued by Sa√Ød on the al-Yamamah deal said that he had \\"...never been the 'business manager' for anybody, let alone any member of the Saudi Royal Family, nor has he ever 'distributed commissions' to any member of the Saudi Royal Family\\". Sa√Ød's role in al-Yamamah has led to him being described as an arms dealer, a term that he rejects. In 2001 Sa√Ød said that the deal '... brought a huge boost to British industry: you are talking about thousands of jobs. But for some reason, which I cannot understand, the press want to portray this as a shady, mysterious deal ... Quite honestly, I thought I was doing this country a favour; I have never even sold a penknife. I was not paid a penny [for advising British Aerospace] but I benefited because the project led to construction in Saudi Arabia that involved my companies.' Sa√Ød's friendship with Thatcher's son, Mark Thatcher, has been perceived as having played an important role in Britain securing the al-Yamahah deal. Mark Thatcher and Sa√Ød have both denied allegations of commissions from the Saudi government. Companies linked to Sa√Ød acquired properties in Belgravia and Mayfair that were 'put at the service' of Thatcher and Dick Evans, the BAE chief executive after the al-Yamamah deal according to The Guardian. Jonathan Aitken in his 2013 book, Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality dismisses the belief that Mark Thatcher was pivotal to the deal. Aitken emphasises the role of Margaret's husband, Denis Thatcher as the intermediary between her and Prince Bandar with the assistance of Dick Evans. Aitken described a dinner party at his house in honour of Richard Nixon at which Sa√Ød met the Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine who told him of his optimism that Britain would secure a large defence contract for BAE Hawk aircraft with Saudi Arabia. Sa√Ød told Heseltine of his scepticism of the deal's success, and he was later approached by James Blyth, the Ministry of Defence's head of defence sales. Blyth asked Sa√Ød about the progress of the deal and Prince Bandar reported from his father, Prince Sultan that he had signed a letter of intent with the French government instead of the British. Sa√Ød informed Thatcher who impressed upon him the historic ties between Britain and Saudi Arabia, which appealed to the Pro-British Prince Bandar and Sa√Ød. =Sa√Ød Business School= The copper covered ziggurat of the Sa√Ød Business School In July 1996 it was announced that Sa√Ød had donated ¬£20 million to the University of Oxford to found a business school.John O'Leary. \\"Oxford given ¬£20m by Arab magnate.\\", The Times, London, 17 July 1996. Sa√Ød had agreed to donate the money after the university had voted in 1990 for the creation of a business school, and needed funds of ¬£40 million. Opposition initially arose to the school due to the lack of a suitable site and the nature of management as an academic discipline,Desmond Dearlove. \\"Will Oxford play the management game?\\", The Times, London, 7 October 1996. and Sa√Ød said that he would reconsider his gift after a potential site on a sports ground at Mansfield Road in Oxford was voted against.David Charter, \\"Oxford's ¬£20m gift at risk.\\", The Times, London, 6 November 1996. The new building for the school opened in August 2001, designed by Edward Jones and Jeremy Dixon. It was accompanied by protests over Sa√Ød's role in the Al-Yamamah arms deal. A new building at the school, the Thatcher Business Education Centre was opened by The Prince of Wales in 2013 and named by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014 in the presence of Sa√Ød and his wife, Rosemary. Nelson Mandela visited the Sa√Ød Business School at the invitation of Sa√Ød in 2002, to open the lecture theatre named in his honour. Bust of Wafic Sa√Ød by Michael Rizzello at the Sa√Ød Business School, Oxford Sa√Ød had donated over ¬£70 million to the school by 2014, and he is a member of the University of Oxford's Chancellor's Court of Benefactors. The court consists of the largest individual donors to Oxford, and meets annually with senior officials from the university. Sa√Ød's philanthropic efforts for the university have seen him honoured with the Sheldon Medal, the highest honour that Oxford bestows upon its benefactors.https://www.campaign.ox.ac.uk/file/donor-recognition.pdf The Sheldon Medal is awarded annually to a member of the Chancellor‚Äôs Court of Benefactors that has 'made a strategic difference to the life of the university'. A bust of Sa√Ød by Michael Rizzello stands at the entrance to the Sa√Ød Business School, it was one of the last works sculpted by Rizzello before his death in 2004.\\"Michael Rizzello.\\", The Times, London, 9 October 2004, pg. 51 Relationship with Margaret Thatcher Sa√Ød was a passionate supporter of the British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and said of the effect of her premiership after the Winter of Discontent that 'We found we couldn't rely on British manufacturers any more. Then here she comes, this lioness. The honour of England is challenged in the Falklands and she sends an armada! She fights the most powerful union and defeats it.' and said that 'for me, her friendship is the biggest medal'. Sa√Ød was a significant donor to Thatcher's Conservatives in the 1980s, donating at least ¬£350,000 during her premiership. Sa√Ød can no longer donate to British political parties due to his foreign citizenship. Sa√Ød's wife, Rosemary, donated ¬£580,000 to the Conservatives between 2012 and 2014, and Sa√Ød's daughter, Rasha, was recorded as having given four donations totalling ¬£47,000 to the Conservatives in 2008, but these were later explained as having come from her mother, after being incorrectly reported by the Conservatives to the Electoral Commission. The Sunday Times had reported that she had asked her parents to donate to the party on her behalf, and that some of the money had come from them, but her father said that she was mistaken as she could not afford to make such a donation. Sa√Ød is close friends with Charles Powell, the former chief foreign affairs adviser to Thatcher. Sa√Ød appointed Powell chairman of his Sagitta Asset Management in 2001, and Powell chairs the Sa√Ød Business School Foundation.apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends80%5C0001069380_AC_20130831_E_C.pdf Other interests Sa√Ød was an executive producer of the 1987 film The Fourth Protocol, based on Frederick Forsyth's novel of the same name.Frederick Forsyth's. \\"Spymaster trapped in the City.\\" The Times, London, 17 March 1987, pg. 17 Sa√Ød funded half the film's budget of ¬£3.5 million due to his love of Forsyth's novel. =Philanthropy= Sa√Ød is a philanthropist and has significantly donated to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation, Eton College, and the Royal Shakespeare Company. Sa√Ød also donated ¬£250,000 to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. He is the founding donor of the Wafic Sa√Ød Molecular Cardiology Research Laboratories at the Texas Heart Institute. =Art collecting= Sa√Ød is a noted collector of Impressionist art, having owned paintings by Jean Renoir, Claude Monet, Paul C√©zanne, and paintings of sporting scenes.Nicholas Wapshott. \\"Collectors flock to London in Brit Art's wake.\\", The Times, London, 9 July 2004, pg. 15 Sa√Ød put 11 paintings from his collection up for auction at Phillips in New York in 2000, among the paintings that sold were Renoir's Women in the Garden (1873) and Girl in a Flowered Hat (1896), Pissarro's September Festival, Pontoise (1872) and C√©zanne's Hill of Galet, Pontoise (1879‚Äì80). In 1982 Sa√Ød paid a record ¬£80,000 at auction for a Quran that had been made for Qaitbay, the 15th-century Egyptian sultan in 1488.Geraldine Norman, Sale Room Correspondent. \\"Regent's Park Mosque buys Sultan's manuscript for ¬£80,000.\\" The Times, London, 27 April 1982, pg. 14 The Quran was for a period displayed at the newly constructed Regent's Park Mosque in London. In 1987 Sa√Ød acquired 20 pieces from the auction of the jewellery collection of Wallis Simpson, including the famous panther bracelet, the cross bracelet and the flamingo brooch by Cartier. All these were later sold at an auction in 2010. =Horse racing= Sa√Ød was a prominent racehorse owner, having owned the Henry Cecil trained horses Bosra Sham and Lady Carla.Richard Evans. \\"Wafic Said to sponsor Guineas\\", The Times, London, 9 September 1997, pg. 43 Lady Carla was named for Carla Powell, the socialite wife of Charles Powell. Bosra Sham won the 1996 1,000 Guineas and Champion Stakes under Said's racing colours. Sa√Ød's Sagitta Asset Management sponsored the 1,000 and 2,000 Guinea Stakes, and having ended their sponsorship in 2003, Sa√Ød withdrew his racing interests, citing his non-residence in England as the reason. =Property= Tusmore House Sa√Ød family trusts own two homes in the United Kingdom, a ¬£10 million property in Eaton Square in London's Belgravia district, which when bought in 1992, was then the highest price paid for an apartment in the United Kingdom,Rory Ross. \\"The last lap of luxury.\\" The Times, London, 14 October 1992, pg. 33 and Tusmore Park, a 3,000 acre estate near Bicester in Oxfordshire.

In 2012 Sa√Ød erected a 92 ft limestone obelisk topped with gold in the grounds of Tusmore Park to honour the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The obelisk is the largest constructed in the United Kingdom since the 18th century. Margaret Thatcher frequently visited Sa√Ød at Tusmore Park, staying for long periods in Tusmore Park's Clock House in the last years of her life. Sa√Ød rebuilt Tusmore House in 2000 to a neo-Georgian design by William Whitfield of Whitfield Lockwood Architects.

He described numerous species and was a founder of the Entomological Society of London in 1833 along with John Obadiah Westwood.  Biography  L.C. Dickinson (1819‚Äì1908)alt=left Frederick was the second son of John Thomas Hope of Netley Hall, Shrewsbury, and Ellen Hester Mary, only child and heiress of Sir Thomas Edwardes, and was born at their home in 37 Upper Seymour Street, London. He studied under the private tutor Reverend Delafosse and joined Christ Church, Oxford in 1817 and graduated with a BA in 1820. Presented to the curacy of Frodesley in Shropshire, he quickly retired as a result of ill health. Hope married, in 1835, the wealthy Ellen Meredith, who had earlier rejected a proposal of marriage from Benjamin Disraeli. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Linnean Society. Ellen, herself a naturalist, was a great supporter of her husband's interests, which included collecting engraved portraits (140,000); topographical engravings (70,000); and natural history engravings (20,000). Hope traveled across Europe and his studies of fish and crustaceans resulted in Catalogo dei crostacei Italiani e di molti altri del Mediterraneo (1851). His extensive insect collections, were offered to the University of Oxford in 1849, but this was initially not accepted until 1850. A new museum was constructed in 1855 and he was also awarded an honorary degree in that year. In 1860, he founded and endowed a professorship of zoology, nominating J.O. Westwood as the first Hope professor. Westwood also curated Hope‚Äôs collections. Hope described the larvae of flies that sometimes infect humans and he called the condition as \\"myasis\\" (now spelt in medical literature as myiasis) in 1840. Hope's interest in insects began around 1817. He was chiefly interested in the Coleoptera. Hope's initial collection of insects included 31 cabinets of varying sizes containing 964 drawers, store boxes, 1800 books, 249 solanders, and 18 portfolios. He continued to add specimens and books and purchased specimens for the Hope Department, including material from the collections of Edward Donovan, James Francis Stephens, Thomas Marsham, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston. Many are types. He was a founder member of the Zoological Society of London, and in 1833, the Entomological Society of London of which he was subsequently treasurer, president and vice-president at different times. Hope collaborated with many naturalists of the period, including Charles Darwin. Works Dorcus hopei is a stag beetle named after F.W. Hope Hope published numerous papers, including some 60 papers on entomology of which the majority were on the Coleoptera, many describing new genera and species (British and world). A complete list is given in Pettigrew (1874). His books included the Coleopterists Manual, containing the Lamellicorn beetles of Linnaeus and Fabricius in three volumes published from 1837 onwards: *The Coleopterist's Manual **Containing The Lamellicorn Insects Of Linneus And Fabricius.

It usually starts on the first Friday of the month. The town is the birthplace of internationally known author Chinua Achebe, the foremost in Nigeria. An Ogidi indigene, Harford C. Anierobi (from Umuezeobodo, Ajilija-Uru Ogidi) was the prominent actor \\"Dominic\\" in the 1949 documentary titled Daybreak in Udi, which won an Oscar for Best Documentary and a BAFTA award for Best Documentary.\\"Daybreak in Udi\\", Film Affinity. Also from Ogidi is Catherine Uju Ifejika (n√©e Ikpeze) (born 28 October 1959), a Nigerian lawyer, and Chairperson/CEO of Brittania-U Nigeria Limited (BUNL), an indigenous petroleum company for upstream exploration and production, and Brittania-U Ghana Limited (BUGL). She is believed to be one of the six most powerful women in oil and gas in the world and one of the richest women in Africa. She has received both national and international awards for best practices in business leadership.\\"Catherine Uju Ifejika\\", Britannia-U. Other attractions include the famous Iyi-Enu Hospital, and Aforigwe market. The people are known for protecting pythons, as the creature is regarded as a deity. Ogidi means pillar.  History  Ogidi's known history can be recounted for more than 450 years. The founding father of the town, Ezechumagha (born c.1550), married Anum-Ubosi; they had a son in 1580 named Inwelle. Inwelle married and had a son in 1611 named Ogidi (meaning strong pillar because he was a great warrior). Ogidi had two wives: (i) Duaja, whose children were Akanano, Uru, Ezinkwo, Umu-Udo, and Ama-Okwu; and (ii) Amalanyia, whose children were Ikenga, Nne Ogidi, Uruagu and Achalla Ogidi. After the migration of five of Ogidi's children, the remaining four sons (Akanano, Uru, Ezinkwo and Ikenga) formed the present Ebo Ino (four quarters) of Ogidi. History has it that Umu-Udo migrated to present-day Umunya (in Oyi Local Government of Anambra State). Ama-Okwu was either sold into slavery or got integrated into other parts of Ogidi, especially Odida in Ikenga. Nne Ogidi was married to Agulu, and is the name of a thriving village in Agulu. Uruagu migrated and settled in Nnewi, but present-day Uruagu Nnewi people deny any claim with Ogidi. Achalla Ogidi (a great elephant hunter) migrated to present-day Okija (derived from Oka Ije Achalla Ogidi). Of the four sons who stayed in Ogidi: *Akanano had two wives. The first wife had Ire and Abo, while the second had Ezi-Ogidi and Umuru. *Uru (born c.1643) had eight children: Ntukwulu, Ajilija, Adazi, Umudoma, Uru Ezealo, Uro Oji, Umu Anugwo, and Ogwugwuagu. *Ezinkwo had two sons: (a) Ogidi-Ani, who had Ogidi-Anu Ukwu and Ogidi-Ani Etiti; and (b) Nkwelle Ogidi, who had Ezinkwelle and Uru Owelle. *Ikenga had two wives: (a) Aghaluji Ejebe Ogu, who had Obodo Okwe and Anugwo; and (b) Ezenebo, who had Nanri and Odida. This is also the final resting place of Chinua Achebe.  Kingship  The Current Igwe is HRM ·ª§z·ªç Alexander Onyido (Ezechuamagha). In the period after the colonial pacification of Ogidi, the Igweship derived ultimately from non-hereditary appointment as Native Court by the colonial administration in Onitsha Province which was Conferred on Walter Okerelu Amobi (Nwatakwochaka) of the Amobi family, ·ª§m·ª• Udene, Uru Ogidi. From the time Walter Amobi who was first appointed to Native Court got his appointment, he made at least one attempt to claim Paramount rulership which was rejected by the colonial administration.\\"The Warrant Chiefs: indirect rule in southeastern Nigeria, 1891-1929 (Ibadan history series)\\", PdfDrive. Igwe Amobi I of Ogidi, Walter Okafor Okerulu Nwatakwochaka Amobi (1838‚Äì18 December 1925), was the first Native court of Ogidi. His father, Abraham Amobi, was born in 1806. He was one of the first people to encounter the English Church missionaries and embrace their religion when they arrived in Onitsha through the River Niger. He became the first catechist in Ogidi. His son, Igwe Walter Okafor Amobi I of Ogidi, had an opportunity to learn from Christian education and culture. He was active in the palace council of the Obi of Onitsha and adjudicated in its native courts. A wealthy and prosperous noble, he was appointed as a Political Agent of Queen Victoria's Royal Niger Company in 1898; he commanded a contingent of soldiers. In 1923 he applied to be made Paramount ruler of Ogidi but his request was turned down by the colonial administrator who stated \\" it is contrary to the present policy of government, to place any one Chief as Paramount Chief over towns and villages he has no hereditary right of control...\\".Memo MP NO.4/1923 dated 31.1.1923 by DO, Onitsha in OP 56/1923, Petition for the recognition of Walter Amobi as Paramount Chief As Igwe, Amobi I was instrumental in establishing peaceful and mutually beneficial contact between the Royal Niger Company and the people of Ogidi and the greater Igbo hinterland. Though peace-loving, he was a brave, able and resolute warrior in battle and at other times of conflict. His courageous leadership earned him the respect and gratitude of his people and those of the neighbouring provinces. During this period, he was invested with the princely and ducal title of \\"Ozo\\", in recognition of his successes against Portuguese raiders striking inland from the Niger Delta, and indigenous soldiers attacking from provinces to the north. Upon his death, Amobi I was succeeded by his eldest son, Prince Benjamin Olisaeloka Amobi. As Igwe Amobi II of Ogidi, he later represented the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria at the coronation of King George VI of England in 1937. During Amobi II's long reign, he maintained cordial relations with the rulers of other kingdoms and provinces, including the Oba of Benin, the Obi of Onitsha, Ojiako Ezenne of Adazi, the Oni of Ife and the Oba of Lagos. His eldest son, (Dr.) Benedict Vincent Obiora Amobi, became Igwe Amobi III in 1975 after the death of Igwe II that year. When he died in 1986, (Engr.) Walter Nnamdi Ifediora Amobi (born 19 March 1929) ascended the throne as Igwe Amobi IV of Ogidi, serving until his death in 1998. Walter Amobi had married Uche in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1957. They had six children, including second son, Ifediora Chimezie Amobi, born on October 1, 1960. He married and has three children, including Chastity Lynn Nwakego Grant-Amobi, born on 27 October 1982. After Amobi IV's death in 1998, none of his sons became a successor. In August 2016, the people of Ogidi elected a new Igwe, Alexander Uzo Onyido. Onyido is a pharmacist who was trained at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Kaduna State. He rose to the rank of chief pharmacist with Kano State Government under the Federal Ministry of Health. Before his ascension to the throne, he was also Chairman of PAL Group.

The township is located on Waterloo Bay. It has a rainfall of 426 mm per annum. At the 2006 census, Elliston had a population of 377. History The first inhabitants of the land that is now Elliston were the Nauo. The first recorded exploration of the adjacent coastline was by Matthew Flinders in the vessel from 10-13 February 1802. He named the offshore islands but did not note the presence of Waterloo Bay in his log. Edward John Eyre explored the area on land in 1840 and 1841 on a journey to Western Australia from Port Lincoln. Originally named Waterloo Bay, the township was later named by Governor Sir William Jervois on a plan for the town on 23 November 1878. Locally it is believed to be named after the writer and educator Ellen Liston who was born in England in 1838 and emigrated to South Australia in 1850. She was a governess working on a local property (Nilkerloo) owned by John Hamp. It has also been suggested that Jervois, who had a military background chose to honour Sir Henry Walton Ellis (1783‚Äì1815) who was a hero of the Battle of Waterloo during which campaign he died of his wounds. The area was settled in the 1840s with Elliston being the central port from which the early settlers transported their wool and wheat to market. Sailing ships and later steam ships crossed Waterloo Bay's notorious reefed entrance. A number of ships foundered in the bay due to its narrow entrance and variable tides. The Nauo people were hit extremely hard by the effects of European settlement. There was a very great deal of violence against Aboriginal people in this area (and a good deal of violence against white settlers also). The Waterloo Bay Massacre is thought to have occurred close to Elliston, and there are also many better-documented murders and other violent acts towards Aboriginal people in this area. =Historic buildings= Hall Mural The hall, which was officially opened on 10 February 1968, is distinguished by its mural which was painted with the help of local community members under the direction of artists Siv Grava and John Turpie. According to the placard erected by the District Council of Elliston, it is the largest mural of its type in Australia, depicts the historical life of Elliston and covers more than 500 square metres in area. The first District Council of Elliston Council Chambers were built in 1913 and still stand adjacent to Waterloo Bay Caravan Park. The Country Women's Association Rooms were the first to be built in South Australia by that organisation and opened on 4 July 1936. The Post Office was opened on 13 August 1880 and is the oldest public building still in use. The first Police Station (which still stands) was opened in 1881 and continued in use until 1971. =Heritage listings= Elliston has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Flinders Highway: Oaklands Shearing Shed * off Flinders Highway: Elliston Cast Iron Lead Light * off Flinders Highway: Elliston Jetty * 9 Memorial Drive: Elliston Country Women's Association Rest Rooms Geography Elliston Beach The town of Elliston lies on Waterloo Bay, a small coastal inlet which is partially protected by a number of reefs lining the entrance to the bay. Outside of the bay, the coastline is exclusively large cliffs, with a number of surf beaches located on these stretches. Inside the bay, it is relatively calm and shallow, with seagrass beds and reefs underwater, and sandy beaches lining most of the bay. Inland, the country is mostly flat agricultural land. The southern end of the Lake Newland Conservation Park lies about 10 km to the north of the town. Offshore, Flinders Island is west south west of Wellington Point at Elliston. Economy Elliston Jetty Agriculture, fishing and tourism make up Elliston's economy. Barley and wheat farming take place alongside sheep grazing on the adjacent farmland. Marine activities include abalone diving, lobster and scale fisheries. The area is a tourist destination, the town having two caravan parks as well as motel and hotel accommodation. Fishing, swimming and other water based activities are common in the protected bay. Surfing is possible at stretches along the coast, but high numbers of sharks make it risky. Many surf beaches are known for catches of salmon, mulloway and shark as well, with Lock's Well one of the more established beaches. Community In the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, the population of the Elliston town census area was 377 people. Males outnumbered females. 92.8% of the population was born in Australia, with immigrants coming from England, France, Germany, Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Korea. Christianity is the most followed religion in the town with 51% of the town following the religion. The major denominations in the town are the Anglican, Catholic and One Heart Uniting Church churches. 29% of the town had no religious beliefs. The town has a number of sporting clubs and facilities, as well as churches, hotels and many local businesses. Former Port Adelaide Power footballer Cameron Hitchcock is from Elliston.

The station was renamed several times: to Port Talbot and Aberavon on 5 June 1897; to Port Talbot General on 1 July 1924 (the suffix distinguishing it from other stations in Port Talbot), later reverting to the original Port Talbot in April 1947, finally becoming Port Talbot Parkway on 3 December 1984. While it now bears the title Parkway, it is not a parkway station per se. It was named Parkway in the 1980s by British Rail when the old goods shed and yard were converted to a large car park, with freight handling moved to Margam Knuckle Yard, to encourage patronage of eastbound commuters from the Neath and Swansea Valley areas. The idea was that overall travel time could be saved by catching the train at Port Talbot instead of Neath or Swansea because of the low line speed west of Port Talbot and the limited parking at the other two stations. There were originally two stations near to the current site, one of which was Aberavon Town, which was on the old Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway route and the other being the nearby terminus of the Port Talbot Railway named Port Talbot Central. =21st century redevelopment= Aerial view of the new footbridge during construction work (May 2016) Tesco planned to vacate its current store site near the Aberafan Centre and build a new store beside the station featuring a superstore, petrol station and car park.

Curiel was born in San Diego, California, in 1974 and is of Mexican descent. He grew up in the neighboring city of Chula Vista, where he graduated from Bonita Vista High School in 1992. Curiel started P.O.D. that year, along with friend Noah \\"Wuv\\" Bernardo. The band started building a strong local fanbase, releasing several albums independently. In 1998, they were signed to a record deal (Atlantic Records) and released their hit albums The Fundamental Elements of Southtown (1999) and Satellite (2001) including hit singles, \\"Alive\\" and \\"Youth of the Nation\\". Both albums have had mainstream success, gaining multi Platinum certifications by the RIAA and three Grammy Award nominations. P.O.D. has also contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. Marcos has attended the Howard Fine Acting Studio. Curiel is the youngest member of P.O.D. P.O.D. (1992‚Äì2003; 2006‚Äìpresent) In an e-mail sent to fans in 2003, P.O.D. front man Sonny Sandoval said Curiel left \\"to pursue his own vision apart from P.O.D.\\" However, Curiel insisted in a phone call from his San Diego home that he was kicked out by Atlantic Records management. \\"Because of your loyalty and respect, it saddens me to say that Marcos is no longer with P.O.D.,\\" Sandoval wrote. \\"Never have we imagined P.O.D. without him, but we now know this vision is bigger than the four of us.\\" Curiel, who was always an outspoken member of P.O.D., was particularly upset because the band's ex-manager Tim Cook, not his bandmates, called to fire him. He said the group met a few weeks before his removal and everyone acted enthusiastic about his projects. He has been quoted as saying; \\"As soon as I was out, they started talking stuff behind my back,\\" he said. \\"It's very, very shady. I have friends defending me on the Web site, and every time they put something up in defense of me, it gets deleted. I'm like, 'What? This is not fair, dude.' ... Then I found out they had another guitar player already. I was like, 'Whoa, they've been plotting this for a long time.'\\" On December 30, 2006, just months after P.O.D. left Atlantic Records and on the same day his replacement Jason Truby left the band, Marcos was asked to rejoin P.O.D. The band announced to their fans via email through their mailing list and via their MySpace page, that Curiel had re-joined. The next day, Curiel played with P.O.D. for the first time since his departure on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show. Two months later they signed a new deal with INO Records. The Accident Experiment (2002‚Äì2007)  The Accident Experiment, also known as AeX, is a rock band based in San Diego, California. It was formed in 2002 when co- founder Curiel left the band P.O.D. The band featured Curiel on guitar, Pete Stewart (Grammatrain) with the vocals, Tony Delocht on bass, and Ernie Longoria on drums (both from Sprung Monkey). The band's first EP, Arena EP, was released in 2003. In 2005, the band signed to indie label Rock Ridge Music, and their first full-length album, United We Fear, was released October 18, 2005. A video had been shot and released for the first single Sick Love Letter. Curiel and Longoria began jamming and they solidly evolved into a steady rock act opening to Foo Fighters, Drowning Pool, Staind, and other known bands. In December 2006, Curiel re-joined P.O.D. and The Accident Experiment went on hiatus. Their Arena EP was re-released by Rock Ridge Music on May 8, 2007. The EP included some new songs by the group. * Pete Stewart ‚Äì vocals * Marcos Curiel ‚Äì guitar, producer * Tony Delocht ‚Äì bass * Ernie Longoria ‚Äì drums Daylight Division In 2009, Curiel formed the band Daylight Division, with Joe Loeffler, formerly of Chevelle, Dave Buckner, of Papa Roach, and Lukas Rossi, of Rock Star Supernova. Rossi left soon after joining. Because the remaining members failed to find a permanent lead vocalist, they disbanded.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Betsucomi magazine from the December 2000 issue (released in November) to the August 2005 issue (released in July). Shogakukan collected the individual chapters into 12 bound volumes under the Flower Comics imprint. Viz Media licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. Hot Gimmick inspired two drama CDs and an alternate-ending light novel, the latter of which is licensed by Viz Media. A live-action film adaptation, titled Hot Gimmick: Girl Meets Boy and directed by Y≈´ki Yamato, was released in Japan on June 28, 2019. Plot The story revolves around Hatsumi Narita, a passive sixteen-year-old girl who lives in a company housing complex that is ruled by the tyrannical Mrs. Tachibana, the wife of the company's vice president. How a family behaves in the housing complex can affect an employee's status in the company. When her promiscuous younger sister Akane thinks she might be pregnant, Hatsumi gets talked into buying her a pregnancy test. Unfortunately, things do not go exactly as planned and Hatsumi is blackmailed by Ryoki Tachibana, the arrogant teenage son of the powerful Tachibana family who bullied her as a kid, into being his slave. Characters =The Narita Family= ; Portrayed by: Yui Horie/Tamaki Nakanishi (drama CDs), Miona Hori (film) :The main character of the series. At the beginning of the series she is a second-year student at Takazono High School, a public school. When her younger sister Akane's fear of being pregnant leads Hatsumi into purchasing a pregnancy test for her, Ryoki Tachibana sees her with it and, in exchange for keeping this secret, Hatsumi becomes Ryoki's personal slave. However, when Hatsumi's childhood friend, Azusa Odigiri, moves back into the complex, she finds she has feelings for him. These feelings do not waver even after certain events rise up that would ordinarily cause her to sever ties with Azusa. Near the middle of the series however an absence of Azusa causes Hatsumi to shift attention and rationalize her now developing feelings for Ryoki, which she later concludes is love, with the hope Ryoki's actions will become less domineering. :Hatsumi is good- hearted but gullible. She does not form her own opinions and, despite talking herself up and reassuring herself that she will be assertive, has extreme difficulty standing up to people who misuse her. She is almost incapable of making her own decisions and spends more time thinking about others' well- being than her own. Hatsumi's low self-esteem is most likely the product of her upbringing; it is improbable she has ever been encouraged to set goals for herself outside of schoolwork and staying below the radar of the complex gossip hounds. ; Portrayed by: Akeno Watanabe (drama CDs), Hiyori Sakurada (film) :Hatsumi's younger sister; somewhat of a floozy. She dates many boys, and early on harbors a none-too-inconspicuous crush on Ryoki. After being rejected by him (and briefly taking out her anger on Hatsumi), she begins to develop feelings for Ryoki's best friend, Subaru Yagi. At the beginning of the series, she is a third-year student (it is mistakenly stated in earlier publications that Akane is a second-year) at a local public junior high school. Despite being beautiful and popular, Akane is actually very insecure in a real relationship. She supports Hatsumi and Ryoki's relationship, occasionally offering her sister's boyfriend advice. ; Portrayed by: Shin- ichiro Miki/Yoshinori Ogino (drama CDs), Shotaro Mamiya (film) :The eldest of the Narita children. At the beginning of the series, he is a freshman law student at Hitotsubashi University. He is not home much due to various part- time jobs. Hatsumi learns later that Shinogu is adopted. He was taken in by the Naritas when he was a small child, but his parents had left behind extreme debt when they died. In an attempt to repay the money to his adoptive parents, Shinogu moves out of the house and holds down a slew of part-time jobs, placing aside his dreams of medical school. :Shinogu is kind and helpful. Like Hatsumi, he often puts others before himself. He is very dedicated and believes in doing the right thing, but is often wracked with guilt concerning the trouble he put his parents through, and his feelings for Hatsumi. Shinogu is in love with Hatsumi but, in an effort to not burden her with his feelings, tries to put distance between them. In the end, he tries to dissolute his adoption from the Naritas in an attempt to distance himself from Hatsumi further and become a priest. ; Portrayed by: Etsuko Kozakura/Noriko Shitaya (drama CDs) :Hatsumi's younger brother. At the beginning of the series, he is in kindergarten. ; :The mother. She is very afraid of Mrs. Tachibana, and does whatever she can to please her. Later in the series, she overcomes this fear and addresses Mrs. Tachibana about her continued mistreatment of their family. ; :The father. He takes the blame for Miho Odagiri's death by confirming Azusa's conclusion that he was her lover, but it is later revealed that he was paid by his office superior, Shuichiro Tachibana, to be his scapegoat. He spends much time working away from home due to his unfavorably low position on the company ladder, but in the end returns to Tokyo under Shuichiro's orders as an apology for all the hardships the latter had given him and his family, he is presumably living again with his wife and children. Went to college with both Azusa's and Ryoki's fathers. =The Tachibana Family= ; Portrayed by: Kosuke Toriumi/Masazumi Ozo (drama CDs), Hiroya Shimizu (film) :Hatsumi's biggest fear since she was a child, due to him pushing her down the stairs. He turns Hatsumi into his personal slave, but also wants her as his girlfriend. Although he is abusive to her, there are times when he lets his guard down and shows that, despite his abusive way of showing it, he genuinely cares about her. At the beginning of the series, he is a second-year student at the prestigious private school, Kaisei Academy. It is revealed that when Hatsumi and Ryoki were kids in the company housing complex, that Hatsumi was Ryoki's sole friend, while Hatsumi was also friends with Azusa. Nevertheless, Ryoki did not treat Hatsumi well, even as a child, going as far as pushing Hatsumi down a flight of stairs, emotionally scarring her. This is revealed later to have been unintentional, giving young Ryoki an anxiety attack. :Ryoki becomes easily angry or jealous and does not like displaying other emotions. It is clear he has only ever been prized for his intelligence (which he reaffirms constantly around Hatsumi by calling her \\"dimwit,\\" \\"birdbrain,\\" etc.). Ryoki's family is disjointed and loveless, which is why he finds Hatsumi's devotion to her family incomprehensible. His family's past actions have influenced his views on relationships as well, such as strictly practicing and prizing monogamy in his relationship with Hatsumi, no doubt because of his father's past known affair with Azusa's mother. Ryoki displays great insecurity in his trust with relations involving Hatsumi, feeling at any second that she is off \\"flirting with other men\\". He expects just the same level of commitment and monogamic views from Hatsumi, which is seen throughout the series as a humorous assertion of power; with Ryoki demanding she should keep conversations with all men under one minute, answer the phone on the first ring when he calls, show up at least an hour early to all dates, and often overreacts when a male's name is mentioned in conversation, even if it's just Hikaru, Hatsumi's little brother. However, he is also seen often struggling to understand Hatsumi's reactions, helping her out of difficult situations and giving her his support. ; :Ryoki's mother and the undisputed \\"queen\\" of the company housing complex. She delights in manipulating the lives of those beneath her, starting malicious rumors and relocating workers based on their family's reputation. Multiple times she tries to separate Hatsumi and Ryoki, seeing Hatsumi as unsuitable and undeserving of her son. Natsue is presumably obsessed with controlling the people of the complex because she has almost no control in her own family (Ryoki never listens to a word she says and rebuffs her concerns with no emotion, and Shuichiro, in his rare appearances, easily undermines her at every turn). Natsue and Shuichiro are in an arranged marriage due to the wishes of their parents. ; :Ryoki's father, he mostly stays at a hotel near the company so he hardly ever returns to the complex. Shuichiro and Natsue have an arranged marriage. As such, Shuichiro feels no love toward his wife or his son. When a young Ryoki asks his father why he's never around, Shuichiro alludes to a lover, whose identity is later revealed to be Miho Odagiri, Azusa's mother. The reason for Shuichiro never showing up to meet her was because he claims he asked her to leave her life, but she always chose Azusa and her husband. The reader assumes this is because Miho thought Shuichiro would remain persistent, as he did after their first separation. =The Odagiri Family= ; Portrayed by: Hiroyuki Yoshino/Taisuke Yamamoto (drama CDs), Mizuki Itagaki (film) :An old friend of Hatsumi's. They were very good friends when they were younger; he always protected her from Ryoki. When he returns, he is a popular model doing magazine work and TV commercials. His return prompts Hatsumi to realize she has loved him since childhood. :At the beginning of the series, Azusa is outwardly nice, protective, caring and generous. As time goes on and secrets are revealed, Hatsumi discovers he is manipulative, self-destructive and severely depressed. Azusa is obsessed with revenge, using all his money from modeling to pay private detectives to discover who the lover of his mother was, and consequentially who was responsible for her death. He blamed Ryoki's family at one point, and tried to let his friends gang rape Hatsumi in front of Ryoki. He is unconvinced that anyone truly cares for him and remains emotionally distant. Although, he has feelings for Hatsumi and cares for Shinogu as well, whom he supports his feelings for Hatsumi. :At the end of the series he decides to take Hatsumi away from Ryoki as revenge on Shuichiro. ; :Azusa's father who works mostly overseas so he hardly lives with his son. Divorced Azusa's mother, supposedly because she was having an affair. He is about to remarry, but worries about Azusa's opinion of it. ; :Azusa's mother, Minoru's ex-wife, and Shuichiro's former lover. She left with Azusa when Minoru divorced her and she became ostracized by the other wives in the complex. She soon fell ill but remained optimistic that her lover will return to her, as he promised. Died three years prior to the beginning of the series. =The Yagi Family= ; Portrayed by: Soichiro Hoshi (drama CDs), Kaisei Kamimura (film) :Ryoki's dorky best friend, who is also a friend of Hatsumi. His hobbies are video games and anime (especially Gundam), and collecting models and action figures. He develops feelings for Akane, even though she often scares him, coming on too strong for him (as she's had many boyfriends and/or flings, and Subaru has never had a girlfriend). At the beginning of the series he is a second-year student at Takazono High School (Class A). Early on, it is implied that Subaru has a crush on Hatsumi, though these later fade when he develops feelings for Akane. He often worries about Ryoki and often tries to help him with Hatsumi. ; :Subaru's older sister. She graduated from beauty school and is currently working as an intern at a hair salon. She has a secret crush on Shinogu, but fails to tell him because he is \\"too unattainable.\\" She often laments the dorkiness of her brother, and is fairly good friends with the Narita siblings as she worries about them often. =Others= ; :The Tachibana family's maid. She has been in love with Shuichiro Tachibana ever since she was young, but he does not reciprocate her feelings. She's one of the few who truly cares about Ryoki, helping Hatsumi see that she is misreading his loneliness, jealousy, and his love for her as him being a cold, aloof tyrant. ; Portrayed by: Akiko Hiramatsu (drama CDs), Riho Yoshioka (film) :Owner of a modeling agency and Azusa's manager. She has claimed her relationship with Azusa is one of \\"give and take,\\" which started when she took him in as a runaway. He initially offered to sleep with her for money - instead, she took him on as a model. She cares for Azusa, though her emotions do not seem to matter to him. ; :Shinogu's friend from work, and roommate. He has a crush on Akane and is constantly flirting with her, fully aware that she is going out with Subaru. Despite being very flirtatious, he offers good advice to those characters experiencing relationship problems especially Shinogu and he does not attempt to destroy Akane's relationship with Subaru (he helps them to grow closer.) Kazama refers to himself as a \\"good guy.\\" ; :A girl who attends Teitoko Girls Academy and is on the same intellectual level as Ryoki. After learning of Hatsumi and Ryoki's relationship, Natsue Tachibana makes multiple attempts to have her son enter a relationship with Ruri instead, considering her more deserving of Ryoki. Ruri is obsessed with beating Ryoki on practice exams and proving she is more intelligent than he is. Light novel Hot Gimmick S is a light novel spin-off of the manga, published in Japan in November 2005. It was written by Megumi Nishizaki and illustrated by Miki Aihara. The story focuses on the relationship between Hatsumi and Shinogu, with Hatsumi narrating. Characters from the manga also make brief appearances and play small roles in the story. A few new characters are introduced, as well. The novel also introduces new nicknames never used in the manga: Hatsumi calls Akane \\"Aka-chin\\" and Hikaru \\"Hii-kun\\". At the age of two, she refers to herself as \\"Hami-tan\\" as opposed to \\"Hami-chan,\\" like in the manga. At the very end of the novel, a scene from volume nine of the manga where Shinogu and Hatsumi recall childhood memories while trapped in an elevator is featured. This section was falsely advertised as being an entirely new manga chapter about the two. Viz Media licensed the novel for an English-language release in North America, published on February 20, 2007. =New characters= ;Wakana Nanami :A friend of Shinogu's who works with him as a tour conductor. She frequently visits him at the caf√© where he works. Upon meeting Hatsumi, Wakana urges her to \\"root\\" for her in her quest to have Shinogu as her boyfriend. She is ambitious, good-looking, and not unkind despite her pursuit of Shinogu. Shinogu calls her \\"Nana\\". ;Satoko Shinoda :Shihoko's mother and a probation officer. She was assigned to Yuko's family, among others. She died before Akane was born. ;Yuko Tanizaki :Shinogu's biological mother and an old friend of Shihoko. Both her parents have criminal records (her father for theft, her mother for drugs), and she routinely shoplifts. Years later she becomes an alcoholic, dates an abusive gambler, and often beats her son. ;Yuko's boyfriend :Yuko's unnamed boyfriend has no job and amasses drastic gambling debts. When he loses, he vents his anger by beating Yuko and Shinogu. ;Satoru Shionoya :Shihoko's first love and biological father of Shinogu. After being introduced to Yuko, he falls in love with her instead, and the two elope. Years later he leaves Yuko and Shinogu to attend university, claiming \\"This is not my life.\\" Live-action film On September 24, 2018, a live-action film adaptation was announced for release in the following year. The following day, Aihara posted about the film on her blog. On December 17, Toei Company, the film's distributor, confirmed the release date as June 28, 2019. On March 14, 2019, the film's full title was revealed to be Hot Gimmick: Girl Meets Boy.

History According to Le m√©nagier de Paris (1393), which doesn't include a recipe for the dessert, darioles were served at weddings. Recipes from later English records and Le viandier (1486) are unclear. A 15th century Italian recipe for a large custard tart called dariola is known. By the 18th-century the dessert had taken the form of a small custard tart with fluted sides. In late 19th-century recipes the custard is elaborately flavored and scented with citron, orange flower water, and vanilla sugar. The recipe from Larousse gastronomique filled the pastry with liquor- laced frangipane instead of custard.

He was the father of Ellen H√∏rup (1871-1953). He was one of the most influential politicians of the Danish non-Socialist left wing. Life H√∏rup was born in Torpmagle near Hundested, the son of a North Zealandian schoolteacher, but belonged to the relatively well-to-do middle class. Already as a student H√∏rup took interest in politics, early joining the party Venstre after a short conservative intermezzo. From the start he opposed both the middle and upper class of the capital and the National Liberal academic circles. After some failing attempts he was 1876 elected to the Danish parliament's first chamber (the Folketing) and kept his seat until 1892. H√∏rup soon had a leading position in Left and is regarded as one of \\"the five Left leaders\\" with only the leader of the more traditional farmer wing Christen Berg as his equal. During the constitutional struggle against the prime minister Estrup from H√∏jre he became one of the central figures. First of all H√∏rup was a social liberal and anti-militarist in the Danish parliament. He rejected the military defence as an unrealistic, dangerous and expensive protection of Denmark and he founded a long-standing scepticism against the army that has affected many Danes. Besides he sharply turned against all chauvinist and nationalist points of view (and against all that he regarded as such). His domestic political views seem to have been a parliamentarian rule but first of all the recognition of the peasants and the smallholders as socially equal persons. Though not a socialist himself he also co-operated with the Social Democrats and his uncompromising political view about equality impressed some workers and socialists. Perhaps his greatest direct influence is due to his work as a journalist. After some years of working for the more traditional liberal press he founded the radical liberal newspaper Politiken (Eng. The Policy) in 1884. H√∏rup was the owner and this was enough to make his daughter financially independent because she came to have shares. Here he attacked the conservative forces and their thoughts. He also connected radical authors to his case, for instance Georg Brandes, whose brother Edvard was H√∏rups co-editor and party colleague. This created a long-standing connection between liberal radical forces and the men of literature. In fact he himself both worked as a poet and a translator. However H√∏rup's political influence and power were limited because of the \\"eternal opposition\\" of Left. As the leader of the most radical part of Left he was often at the odds with the more national and moderate wings of his party who disapproved of many of his opinions. He condemned the attempts of compromise with the Right and his relationship to his fighting companion and opponent Christen Berg was switching between co-operation and obstruction. An attempt of making a compromise himself 1887 failed and after his loss of his parliament seat he had to leave most of the daily leadership of his political fraction to others. However he went on fighting as an editor and also supported the attempt of Left unit after the resignation of Estrup cabinet. In July 1901 H√∏rup, already dying from cancer, was made Minister of Public Works in the first Left cabinet, the Cabinet of Deuntzer. In 1905 his supporters founded the political party Det Radikale Venstre as whose mental inspiration he has since been acknowledged. His daughter Ellen H√∏rup (1871-1953) was a writer, pacifist and a feminist.Ellen H√∏rup, Danish Peace Academy, 20 August 2015 He died in Copenhagen, aged 60. The long distance influence of H√∏rup has been immense. Left liberals and socialists as well as communists have referred to him and quoted his apothegms regarding him as the ideal unselfish and consequent progressive politician. In return his harsh criticism of national ideals also created many bitter enemies. In fact some parts of H√∏rup's person and thoughts are still not fully cleared up. Perhaps his legacy is first of all his wish of the creation of a political culture based upon regular political differences, upon an equal social evaluation and upon sense of realities. He was the cousin of the poet Holger Drachmann. Quotes * Democracy is its own verdict, its own measure and its own weight! (1874) * Nothing over and nothing besides the Folketing!

Established in 1911 as the Elizabeth Street School and known as Elizabeth College since 1985, the college caters for approximately 1,000 students in Years 11 and 12 and is administered by the Tasmanian Department of Education. In 2019 student enrolments were 959. The college principal is Dr Dianne Purnell. History From 1842 onwards, a school was established when Holy Trinity Church constructed a small school of two classrooms on the site. This school, known as Trinity Hill School, became the Elizabeth Street School in 1911. This school became known as a practising school for newly graduated teachers from the University of Tasmania, where students were taught in primary education. In 1918, the school was used as a hospital during the Spanish Influenza epidemic. After World War II, the school became known as the Elizabeth Street Secondary Modern School, and taught girls and boys in secondary education. In 1968, the Elizabeth Matriculation College was established when the high school was re-built to accommodate senior students wishing to study for the newly created Higher School Certificate. In 1985, the school became known as Elizabeth College. Subjects The subjects that are taught at Elizabeth College fall within the curriculum of the Tasmanian Qualifications Authority (TQA). Courses available at the college include Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Science, Mathematics, Languages, Media Production, Humanities, and many more. Upon successful completion of studies at the college, students are awarded the Tasmanian Certificate of Education. Students are able to enroll in whichever subjects they desire. There is no minimum number of subjects to be taken, though students requesting financial support from the Government will require a full-time workload. However, to earn a Tasmanian Certificate of Education, they must pass at least one course that involves Mathematics, Technology and/or English, with several courses covering multiple areas. Facilities Facilities at the college include a large library/study area in the centre of the campus, a gymnasium and many computer laboratories. These are used extensively and are often required for coursework. Extra facilities include a weights training room, theatre, photographic darkrooms, MDT and auto workshops, and Student Services block. This area offers counselling and security services to students and the college. Staff here include a college chaplain, a security officer and college police officer, as well as counsellors. The college also has a large cafeteria where activities for Harmony Day and other charitable events are held throughout the year. Adjacent to the cafeteria is Tang Cafe, which used primarily by students of Food Technology. There is also a student common room in H Block. International co-operation Elizabeth College has ties across the world, including China and Japan. Every year there is a school trip organised to both China and Japan. Elizabeth College has a sister school in Hiroshima, Japan called Inokuchi Senior High and in China called Quanzhou Foreign Language School. There are cultural exchanges to both of these schools on an annual and biannual bases and the schools visit the college.

Biography =Early years= Michael Heiss was born in Pfahldorf, Bavaria (part of present-day Kipfenberg), to Joseph and Gertrude (n√©e Frei) Heiss. He received Confirmation when he was only two years old because his parents feared they would be without a bishop for a prolonged period of time due to tension between church and state. He entered a Latin school at age 9, and later graduated from the gymnasium of Neuburg in 1835. Heiss then entered the University of Munich, where he originally studied law but switched to theology after deciding to join the priesthood. He completed his studies at the ecclesiastical seminary in Eichst√§tt. =Ordination and ministry= He was ordained a priest by Bishop Karl-August von Reisach on October 18, 1840. Because, at age 22, he was younger than the age requirement for ordination, he was granted a dispensation by Pope Gregory XVI. Heiss served as a curate in Raitenbuch and afterwards in Pleinfeld. In December 1842, he emigrated to the United States, where he became pastor of Mother of God Church in Covington, Kentucky. He remained in Covington until 1844, when he was made secretary to John Henni, the newly appointed Archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He erected St. Mary's Church in Milwaukee, and served as its first pastor with his charge extending over an area of 52 square miles. In 1856, he was named the first rector of St. Francis Seminary, serving for 12 years. =Bishop of La Crosse, Wisconsin= Heiss was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of La Crosse on March 3, 1868, and was ordained a bishop on September 6, 1868. =Archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin= On March 14, 1880, Bishop Heiss was appointed coadjutor Archbishop of Milwaukee. On September 7, 1881, he succeeded Archbishop John Henni on his death as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. He was an opponent of the Americanist heresy. Archbishop Heiss died in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and was buried in St. Francis, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, in a chapel at St. Francis de Sales Seminary.

Code that handles such intercepted function calls, events or messages is called a hook. Hooking is used for many purposes, including debugging and extending functionality. Examples might include intercepting keyboard or mouse event messages before they reach an application, or intercepting operating system calls in order to monitor behavior or modify the function of an application or other component. It is also widely used in benchmarking programs, for example frame rate measuring in 3D games, where the output and input is done through hooking. Hooking can also be used by malicious code. For example, rootkits, pieces of software that try to make themselves invisible by faking the output of API calls that would otherwise reveal their existence, often use hooking techniques.  Methods  Typically hooks are inserted while software is already running, but hooking is a tactic that can also be employed prior to the application being started. Both these techniques are described in greater detail below. = Source modification = By modifying the source of the executable or library before an application is running, through techniques of reverse engineering, you can also achieve hooking. This is typically used to intercept function calls to either monitor or replace them entirely. For example, by using a disassembler, the entry point of a function within a module can be found. It can then be altered to instead dynamically load some other library module and then have it execute desired methods within that loaded library. If applicable, another related approach by which hooking can be achieved is by altering the import table of an executable. This table can be modified to load any additional library modules as well as changing what external code is invoked when a function is called by the application. An alternative method for achieving function hooking is by intercepting function calls through a wrapper library. When creating a wrapper, you make your own version of a library that an application loads, with all the same functionality of the original library that it will replace. That is, all the functions that are accessible are essentially the same between the original and the replacement. This wrapper library can be designed to call any of the functionality from the original library, or replace it with an entirely new set of logic. = Runtime modification = Operating systems and software may provide the means to easily insert event hooks at runtime. It is available provided that the process inserting the hook is granted enough permission to do so. Microsoft Windows for example, allows you to insert hooks that can be used to process or modify system events and application events for dialogs, scrollbars, and menus as well as other items. It also allows a hook to insert, remove, process or modify keyboard and mouse events. Linux provides another example where hooks can be used in a similar manner to process network events within the kernel through NetFilter. When such functionality is not provided, a special form of hooking employs intercepting the library function calls made by a process. Function hooking is implemented by changing the very first few code instructions of the target function to jump to an injected code. Alternatively on systems using the shared library concept, the interrupt vector table or the import descriptor table can be modified in memory. Essentially these tactics employ the same ideas as those of source modification, but instead altering instructions and structures located in the memory of a process once it is already running.  Sample code  = Virtual method table hooking = Whenever a class defines/inherits a virtual function (or method), compilers add a hidden member variable to the class which points to a virtual method table (VMT or Vtable). Most compilers place the hidden VMT pointer at the first 4 bytes of every instance of the class. A VMT is basically an array of pointers to all the virtual functions that instances of the class may call. At runtime these pointers are set to point to the right functions, because at compile time, it is not yet known if the base function is to be called or if an overridden version of the function from a derived class is to be called (thereby allowing for polymorphism). Therefore, virtual functions can be hooked by replacing the pointers to them within any VMT that they appear. The code below shows an example of a typical VMT hook in Microsoft Windows, written in C++.psyfl, #include #include \\"windows.h\\" using namespace std; class VirtualClass { public: int number; virtual void VirtualFn1() //This is the virtual function that will be hooked. { cout << \\"VirtualFn1 called \\" << number++ << \\" \\"; } }; using VirtualFn1_t = void(thiscall*)(void* thisptr); VirtualFn1_t orig_VirtualFn1; void fastcall hkVirtualFn1(void* thisptr, int edx) //This is our hook function which we will cause the program to call instead of the original VirtualFn1 function after hooking is done. { cout << \\"Hook function called\\" << \\" \\"; orig_VirtualFn1(thisptr); //Call the original function. } int main() { VirtualClass* myClass = new VirtualClass(); //Create a pointer to a dynamically allocated instance of VirtualClass. void** vTablePtr = *reinterpret_cast(myClass); //Find the address that points to the base of VirtualClass' VMT (which then points to VirtualFn1) and store it in vTablePtr. DWORD oldProtection; VirtualProtect(vTablePtr, 4, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProtection;); //Removes page protection at the start of the VMT so we can overwrite its first pointer. orig_VirtualFn1 = reinterpret_cast(*vTablePtr); //Stores the pointer to VirtualFn1 from the VMT in a global variable so that it can be accessed again later after its entry in the VMT has been //overwritten with our hook function. *vTablePtr = &hkVirtualFn1; //Overwrite the pointer to VirtualFn1 within the virtual table to a pointer to our hook function (hkVirtualFn1). VirtualProtect(vTablePtr, 4, oldProtection, 0); //Restore old page protection. myClass->VirtualFn1(); //Call the virtual function from our class instance. Because it is now hooked, this will actually call our hook function (hkVirtualFn1). myClass->VirtualFn1(); myClass->VirtualFn1(); delete myClass; return 0; } It is important to note that all virtual functions must be class member functions, and all (non-static) class member functions are called with the thiscall calling convention (unless the member function takes a variable number of arguments, in which case it is called with cdecl). The thiscall calling convention passes a pointer to the calling class instance (commonly referred to as a \\"this\\" pointer) via the ECX register (on the x86 architecture). Therefore, in order for a hook function to properly intercept the \\"this\\" pointer that is passed and take it as an argument, it must look into the ECX register. In the above example, this is done by setting the hook function (hkVirtualFn1) to use the fastcall calling convention, which causes the hook function to look into the ECX register for one of its arguments. Also note that, in the above example, the hook function (hkVirtualFn1) is not a member function itself so it cannot use the thiscall calling convention. fastcall has to be used instead because it is the only other calling convention that looks into the ECX register for an argument. = C# keyboard event hook = The following example will hook into keyboard events in Microsoft Windows using the Microsoft .NET Framework. using System.Runtime.InteropServices; namespace Hooks { public class KeyHook { /* Member variables */ protected static int Hook; protected static LowLevelKeyboardDelegate Delegate; protected static readonly object Lock = new object(); protected static bool IsRegistered = false; /* DLL imports */ [DllImport(\\"user32\\")] private static extern int SetWindowsHookEx(int idHook, LowLevelKeyboardDelegate lpfn, int hmod, int dwThreadId); [DllImport(\\"user32\\")] private static extern int CallNextHookEx(int hHook, int nCode, int wParam, KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT lParam); [DllImport(\\"user32\\")] private static extern int UnhookWindowsHookEx(int hHook); /* Types & constants */ protected delegate int LowLevelKeyboardDelegate(int nCode, int wParam, ref KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT lParam); private const int HC_ACTION = 0; private const int WM_KEYDOWN = 0x0100; private const int WM_KEYUP = 0x0101; private const int WH_KEYBOARD_LL = 13; [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] public struct KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT { public int vkCode; public int scanCode; public int flags; public int time; public int dwExtraInfo; } /* Methods */ static private int LowLevelKeyboardHandler(int nCode, int wParam, ref KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT lParam) { if (nCode  HC_ACTION) { if (wParam  WM_KEYDOWN) System.Console.Out.WriteLine(\\"Key Down: \\" + lParam.vkCode); else if (wParam  WM_KEYUP) System.Console.Out.WriteLine(\\"Key Up: \\" + lParam.vkCode); } return CallNextHookEx(Hook, nCode, wParam, lParam); } public static bool RegisterHook() { lock (Lock) { if (IsRegistered) return true; Delegate = LowLevelKeyboardHandler; Hook = SetWindowsHookEx( WH_KEYBOARD_LL, Delegate, Marshal.GetHINSTANCE( System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetModules()[0] ).ToInt32(), 0 ); if (Hook != 0) return IsRegistered = true; Delegate = null; return false; } } public static bool UnregisterHook() { lock (Lock) { return IsRegistered = (UnhookWindowsHookEx(Hook) != 0); } } } } = API/function hooking/interception using JMP instruction aka splicing = The following source code is an example of an API/function hooking method which hooks by overwriting the first six bytes of a destination function with a JMP instruction to a new function. The code is compiled into a DLL file then loaded into the target process using any method of DLL injection. Using a backup of the original function one might then restore the first six bytes again so the call will not be interrupted. In this example the win32 API function MessageBoxW is hooked.For more information, see http://ntvalk.blogspot.nl/2013/11/hooking-explained-detouring-library.html /* This idea is based on chrom-lib approach, Distributed under GNU LGPL License.

The advantage of this method is that it is less detectable by antivirus software and/or anti-cheat software, one might make this into an external hook that doesn't make use of any malicious calls.

These are the Psalter of Emmeran, 10th century, described by Martin Gerbert,De Cantu et Musica Sacra (1774). who gives a few illustrations from it; the Cotton manuscript of Tiberius C. VI in the British Museum, 11th century; the famous Boulogne Psalter, A.D. 1000; and the Psalter of Angers, 9th century.For illustrations see Annales arch√©ologiques, iii. p. 82 et seq. In the Cotton manuscript the instrument consists of an angular frame, from which depends by a chain a rectangular metal plate having twelve bent arms attached in two rows of three on each side, one above the other. The arms appear to terminate in small rectangular bells or plates, and it is supposed that the standard frame was intended to be shaken like a sistrum in order to set the bells jangling. Sebastian VirdungMusica getutscht und aussgezogen (Basle, 1511). gives illustrations of these instruments of Jerome, and among them of the one called bumbulum in the Cotton Manuscript, which Virdung calls Fistula Hieronimi. The general outline is the same, but instead of metal arms there is the same number of bent pipes with conical bore. Virdung explains, following the apocryphal letter, that the stand resembling the draughtsman's square represents the Holy Cross, the rectangular object dangling therefrom signifies Christ on the Cross, and the twelve pipes are the twelve apostles. Virdung's illustration, probably copied from an older work in manuscript, conforms more closely to the text of the letter than does the instrument in the Cotton manuscript. There is no evidence whatever of the actual existence of such an instrument during the Middle Ages, with the exception of this series of fanciful pictures drawn to illustrate an instrument known from description only. This is origin of the four sources cited above. The word bombulum was probably derived from the same root as the bombaulios () of Aristophanes (Acharnians, 866), a comic compound for a bag- pipe with a play on an insect that hums or buzzes. The original described in the letter, also from hearsay, was probably an early type of organ. According to one source, it may be named due to its sound resembling that of flatulence: Hemingstone cites this old Latin extract from the Liber Feodorum or Book of Fees.

Their scope can include the following: restricting the days to harvest fish or game, restricting the number of animals per person, restricting species harvested, and limiting weapons and fishing gear used. Hunters, fishermen and lawmakers generally agree that the purposes of such laws is to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both environment and populations of fish and game. Game laws can provide a legal structure to collect license fees and other money which is used to fund conservation efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in wildlife management practice. Great Britain In Great Britain the game laws have developed out of the forest laws, which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under William the Conqueror, it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game. Game laws such as the British Night Poaching Act 1828 and Game Act 1831, both still in force in modified form, and still more their predecessors, such as the notorious Black Act of 1723, enacted savage penalties for poaching. But the Game Act installed under William IV did greatly mitigate the game laws: the necessity for any qualification except the possession of a game certificate was abolished, and the right was given to anyone to kill game on their own land, or on that of another with permission. United States During the early history of the United States, little or no attention was paid to the destruction of birds or other wild animals. Probably the earliest law on the subject was one passed in Massachusetts in 1817, establishing closed seasons for certain animals shot as game. Eventually wild game, whether of forest, field or stream, became perhaps better protected than in any other country in the world. All states passed game laws of their own. Nearly every state instituted a game and fish commission and numerous game wardens. A national game law, known as the Lacey Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1900, gave to the United States Department of Agriculture certain powers, by which, among other provisions, no importation of wild animals could be made without a permit from Secretary of Agriculture. Many important additions and amendments to the Federal laws were passed during the succeeding 10 years, all tending to protect game and game birds in their natural state without interfering with the importation of birds' eggs or animals for breeding purposes. During 1910 there was an increase in these importations. Congress then came to adopt the theory that the migratory birds, being in most cases mere travelers across states, were not local residents nor state property, but belonged to the people at large; and if they were to be saved to the people the national authority must intervene. Therefore, Congress passed (4 March 1913) the Weeks‚ÄìMcLean Act, the gist of which was: ‚ÄúAll wild geese, wild swans, brant, wild ducks, plover, woodcock, rail, wild pigeons, and all other migratory game and insectivorous birds which in their northern and southern migrations pass through or do not remain permanently the entire year within the borders of any State or Territory, shall hereafter be deemed to be within the custody and protection of the Government of the United States, and shall not be destroyed or taken contrary to regulations hereinafter provided therefor. The Department of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed to adopt suitable regulations to give effect to the previous paragraph.‚Äù The most important effect of this law ‚Äî and a very far-reaching benefit ‚Äî was the stoppage of the shooting of wild fowl in the spring, which was especially prevalent in the Mississippi River Valley. Because of a constitutional weakness, this act was later replaced by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

It is located in the municipality of Veere, Zeeland, between Dishoek and Westkapelle on the former island Walcheren. On 1 January 2005 it had 1,556 inhabitants. Originally, Zoutelande was mainly an agricultural village. The village's character changed slowly into a tourist resort as the demand for beach recreation rose from about the middle of the 19th century. Zoutelande was a separate municipality until 1966, when it became a part of the new municipality Valkenisse. Nowadays, tourism is Zoutelande's most important source of existence. Zoutelande, together with the beach of Dishoek and Westkapelle, are often called \\"Zeeland's Rivi√®ra\\", after the famous south- coast of France. It is one of Zeeland's most-visited coasts, and one of the few places in the Netherlands where the beach faces south. Plenty of rooms, studios, bungalows and apartments are available to thousands of visitors every summer; most of the tourists are of German origin, although other nationalities are also widely represented. The remaining agriculture in the area benefits of the demand for accommodation in the form of mini-campings. Bicycle-rental, beachfront establishments, hotels, B&Bs;, shops and a boulevard are all to be found in and around the village. Like Domburg, Zoutelande was a favorite among Dutch painters, like Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig, Piet Mondriaan and Jan Toorop who praised its sky. It is said that the reflection of the sun on the water colors the sky more brilliantly and transparently than anywhere else. Monuments left Zoutelande has several monuments, among them the Dutch Reformed Church with a tower in which fragments of late 13th century brick gothic can be found. In about 1500 the church was formed into a hall church. In 1573 the church was returned to its original state through war damage during the Eighty Years' War. It is estimated that the tower and church got their present shape in about 1738. In 1950 a restoration took place. The parish of the church is connected through legend with Saint Willibrord. Unfortunately an old monument, the Willibrord Well, was lost due to the building of the present sea dyke. The well, created by Willibrord and dating from the sixteenth century, according to the legend contained healing water. Because of the building of a new dyke in the 1960s, slightly further inland than the old row of dunes, part of the town had to be demolished. This is the reason why the church, which originally stood in the center of the village, is now almost at the foot of the dyke. In 1984 a new well was built to remember the legend. Zoutelande also has a windmill. It is a round, brick-built corn mill that originates from 1722.

He then moved to Kentucky himself. In 1782, a raiding party of Shawnee Indians led by British and Loyalist officers attacked Bryan Station, but were driven off. Kentucky militia companies then pursued the fleeing invaders. Trigg commanded half of the men, while Daniel Boone led the other. The mounted militiamen soon overtook the raiders, but the experienced woodsman Boone warned that it looked like a trap. Ignoring Boone's warning, the militiamen charged across the river at Blue Licks, only to find themselves in an Indian ambush. Trigg and many others, including Boone's youngest son, were killed in the disastrous battle. Trigg's body was later found hacked into pieces. Trigg County, Kentucky, was named in memory of Stephen Trigg.  Early life and family  Trigg was a son of William Trigg (1716‚Äì1773) and Mary (Johns) Trigg (1720‚Äì1773), whose family was prominent on the Virginia frontier. His father served as a judge of the Court of Chancery, an equity court, and the Bedford County Court.Virkus, The Compendium of American Genealogy, 887. Trigg had four brothers, William, John, Abram and Daniel, who were all soldiers in the Revolutionary War. Two of the brothers, John and Abram, would later represent Virginia in the U.S. Congress. Stephen Trigg married Mary Christian, daughter of another Virginia pioneer, Israel Christian. Trigg lived the early part of his life in southwest Virginia and ran a tavern in Botetourt County.Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission, Revolutionary Virginia: Road to Independence, 3:309. Trigg and his wife had three sons and two daughters. His daughter Mary married General David Logan, and was the mother of was Stephen Trigg Logan, who would serve in the Illinois state legislature and become Abraham Lincoln law partner in Springfield, Illinois.  Virginia pioneer  Location of Fincastle, Virginia The western county of Augusta in Virginia could no longer serve the needs of the pioneers along the New River, and the county of Botetourt was created in 1769.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:91. Trigg was appointed one of its first justices of the peace, presiding over misdemeanors and other civil cases. From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which was a criminal court.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 108‚Äì109; Kegley, Kegley's Virginia Frontier, 385, 401. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was formed in 1770, Trigg was prominent in its development, selling lots and building the town's prison and courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.Kegley, Frederick Bittle, Kegley's Virginia Frontier, 401‚Äì3. As the population increased, the southwestern half of Botetourt County was separated in 1772 and became Fincastle County.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:95. Trigg was one of its first justices of the peace.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:97. He was also a Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, besides being appointment Deputy Clerk and surveyor of the road from New River to the Sinking Spring.Cook, Fincastle and Kentucky Countys, Virginia, 131, 290, 293; Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 130. Trigg also continued pursuing his livelihood as a merchant at Dunkard Bottom in present-day Pulaski County. From 1773 to 1774, he partnered with David Ross and operated a community store in New Dublin, with branches located in Meadow Creek, Reed Creek and Reed Island.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:369. At this time, many indentured servants came to this area of the state. Short of money, they sold themselves to the ship owners for passage to America for a term of servitude that gained them land and tools upon completion. In October, Trigg advertised the sale of 30 white indentured servants at his home with a discount for \\"ready money\\".Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:161, 370. Trigg also served as a delegate to the last session of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1775, representing Fincastle County, but he absented himself to serve as a captain in Dunmore's War.Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission, Revolutionary Virginia: Road to Independence, 3:309; Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia, 105. Settlers again agitated for another split, and so Fincastle County was split into three counties and became defunct in 1776; the new counties were Montgomery, Washington and Kentucky.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:103. Trigg was again a member of the first court of justices held for a new county, this time Montgomery.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:107. He also served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1778.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 253; Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:107; Swem, A Register of the General Assembly of Virginia 1776‚Äì1918 and of the Constitutional Conventions, 439.  Early Kentucky pioneer  The new Virginia counties were growing rapidly, and with this growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed as one of the judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779‚Äì80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles.Stephenson, Martha, \\"Why the Mother Town?\\", Kentucky State Historical Society 24 (1926), 273. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land.Hammon and Taylor, Virginia's Western War, 1775‚Äì1786, 109. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases.Hammon and Taylor, Virginia's Western War, 1775‚Äì1786, 117. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of land.Hoefling, 126. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4 km¬≤) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6 km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 7:253; Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:370. When Kentucky County, Virginia, was split into three counties in 1780, Trigg was made lieutenant colonel for the new county militia of Lincoln.Cook, Fincastle and Kentucky Countys, Va, 19. He also continued his public service by being one of the first justices of the peace, was one of the trustees to lay out Louisville, and served in the Virginia House of Delegates by representing Kentucky County in the 1780‚Äì1781 session.Leonard, General Assembly of Virginia, 138. It was during this session that he, along with his fellow delegate John Todd, secured passage of the act that allowed the formation of Louisville.\\"Introduction to the Certificate book of the Virginia Land The Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society\\", 21 (1923), 5‚Äì6. Despite the growth of settlement in Kentucky, white colonists there were far from secure. Historian Virginia Webb Howard wrote of this era: Trigg continued his service in the militia throughout this period. In 1781, he was made colonel of the Lincoln County militia.Cook, Lincoln County, Kentucky Records, 8. In 1782, the four delegates to the Virginia General Assembly from Kentucky pushed for Trigg's recommendation as one of the assistant judges to the newly created Supreme Court for Kentucky, but his early death prevented him from taking this position.Wilson, Samuel M., \\"The First Land Court of Kentucky 1779‚Äì1780\\", Address before the Kentucky State Bar Association at Covington, Kentucky, 6 July 1923 (Lexington, Ky: n.pub., 1923), 40.  Revolutionary War  Meanwhile, events had moved from local agitations against the British crown to outright war. Early on, Trigg served in local militias, but he also represented Fincastle in the Virginia Conventions. These were five political meetings that started after Lord Dunmore, the governor of Virginia, had dissolved the House of Burgesses after its delegates expressed solidarity with Boston, Massachusetts, where the harbor had been closed by the British. Trigg was at the first convention in 1774 and was elected a delegate to the second convention in 1775, though he did not attend. He was elected to the third convention (July‚ÄìAugust 1775), and did appear. He was also a delegate to the Fourth Convention (December 1775 ‚Äì January 1776), but did not attend.Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission, Revolutionary Virginia: Road to Independence, 3:309; Leonard, General Assembly of Virginia, 110, 112, 114, 117. His other revolutionary activity at the time was as a member of the Fincastle County Committee of Safety, an outgrowth of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence. The Virginia Committee of Correspondence was formed on March 12, 1773, and requested each county to do the same. The British refused to address the issues that were of greatest concern to the colonists, and so the freeholders of Fincastle County met at the Lead Mines on January 20, 1775, forming a Committee of Safety in which Trigg was a member. They were one of the first to respond to the request of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence to form such a body.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 201‚Äì203; Kegley, Early Adventurers, 370. Committees of Safety basically served as provisional governments for their area.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 1:101. It was also at this meeting that they drew up the Fincastle Resolutions, which was a precursor to the Declaration of Independence issued by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776; Trigg was one of the signatories. The resolutions, addressed to the Virginia members of the Continental Congress, contained the boldest assertion of the grievances and rights of the American colonies.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 201‚Äì203. In February 1775, he wrote to his brother-in-law William Christian, suggesting they call another meeting of the freeholders to elect their delegates to the second Virginia Convention.Kegley, Early Adventurers, 370. With the news that William Christian was leaving with the Fincastle militia company to Williamsburg to fight, Trigg took over as chairman of the Committee of Safety. On October 7, 1775, they met to express their appreciation of Trigg, writing that \\"together with the most exemplary zeal and attachment to the liberties of your country, and your indefatigable industry in the service thereof, you merit and deserve our particular thanks.\\"Harwell, Richard, ed., The Committees of Safety of Westmoreland and Fincastle. Proceedings of the County Committees 1774‚Äì1776 (Richmond, VA:n.pub., 1956), 67. In 1776, Cherokees entered the war with the aim of driving colonists from their lands, which meant the people living in southwestern Virginia were facing British-armed Cherokees. The members of the Committee of Safety met at Fort Chiswell on June 11, 1776, and drafted a letter to Oconostota and Attacullaculla, chiefs of the Cherokee nation, to meet with them and come to terms for a peace agreement. The letter mentions the colonists' dissatisfaction with Britain: Trigg was one of the signers of this letter.Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission, Revolutionary Virginia: Road to Independence, 7:446. The conflict with the Cherokees was called the Christian Campaign (presumably from Col. William Christian's last name) and Trigg was the paymaster in 1776‚Äì1777.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 217. In 1777, he was tasked with making a list of men who swore allegiance to several militia companies. By May 1778, the inhabitants along the New River had either left or were ready to leave at a moment's notice, due to increased hostilities with the Shawnee in the area.Johnson, William Preston and the Allegheny Patriots, 207‚Äì208. William Preston, an officer in the militia, felt exposed on the frontier, but was reluctant to abandon his home \\"Smithfield\\", not only for the safety of his family, but also for the county records he safeguarded.Johnson, William Preston and the Allegheny Patriots, 208. Trigg was then leaving for his term in the General Assembly, and Preston urged him and the other delegate for a guard. When it was initially presented to the Governor's Council, Preston's petition was denied, but Trigg met several times with Governor Patrick Henry about Preston's situation and won another hearing with the Council. Trigg made three separate appeals in all before carrying his point.Tillson, Gentry and Common Folk, 94. When the governor agreed to send a guard of twelve men and a sergeant, Trigg sent Preston the news and also told him of the Treaty of Alliance that was signed in France in February. = Last battle and death = This headstone at the Blue Licks Battlefield State Park marks the mass grave where Trigg and his men were buried. In 1782, the British staged an invasion of Kentucky with the help of their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas.Ranck, Kentucky Locals: The Story of Bryan's Station, 26‚Äì28. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station.Talbert, Benjamin Logan: Kentucky Frontiersman, 156‚Äì159; Bakeless, Daniel Boone: Master of the Wilderness, 297‚Äì98. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.Calendar of Virginia State Papers, 281. Trigg was buried in a mass grave near the battle site, in what is now Nicholas County, Kentucky. Kentucky later named a county Trigg County to honor him. There is a historical marker in Cadiz, on the courthouse lawn, US 68. Historians Lewis and Richard Collins wrote of Trigg, \\"He was greatly beloved and very popular; and if he had lived, would have taken rank among the most distinguished men of his time.\\"Collins & Collins, History of Kentucky.

In May 2003 Kodansha released Slut Girl +Œ±, a reprint with an extra chapter. =Plot= Sayoko Bizen is a buxom, cynical, shrewdly intelligent, and sexually uninhibited loner trying to move up in the world. Sayoko quits her executive secretary job after her boss fails to seduce her, and she exposes his affair with a co-worker. By chance, she meets a meek and outwardly unimpressive young man named Satoru Ichi (actual name: Yuichi Tsugaru), a virgin whom she initially tries to scam by coming to his apartment as a massage girl, who Satoru mistakenly believes is a call girl. When Satoru is distraught to learn that she is not a prostitute and has wasted hundreds of dollars, Sayoko takes pity on him and decides to have sex with him. She quickly discovers that Satoru is blessed with an incredible libido and a surprising ability to perform sexually, which she takes advantage of by staying with him until morning. Because she loses her job as a result, she moves in with him, agreeing to have sex with him in exchange for room and board, and for additional money that she subsequently persuades him to give her for various get-rich schemes of hers. Sayoko also introduces Satoru to a collection of equally curvaceous women, all acquaintances of hers. These include Franco-Australian aspiring actress Neena Canberra, former co-worker and martial arts expert Takako Tosa, and incompetent nurse Emi Tanba, all of whom Satoru has sex with. Borrowing seed money from Satoru, Sayoko recruits all three of these women to aid her in her biggest get-rich-quick scheme: developing and selling the rights to a product that combines many popular fads, which works out very profitably. She then leaves Satoru with his cut of the profits, but with the promise that she may come back to him someday. In the bonus chapter \\"Slut Girl Alpha\\" that concludes the story, Sayoko returns to stay with Satoru. =Characters= ; :Sayoko Bizen is a business savvy woman who's hit some hard luck and shacks up with Satoru Ichi. ; :Satoru Ichi is the sappy country boy who becomes the boyfriend/benefactor of Sayoko Bizen. ; :Michi Higo is an employee of Teichu General Trading Company who was sleeping with the president's useless son to gain an easy life. ; :Neena Canberra is French citizen and friend of Sayoko Bizen who came to Japan to be a television personality. ; :Takako Tosa is a friend of Sayoko Bizen who blamed her for the destruction of her company and has been trying to hunt her down. ; :Emi Tanba is a nurse at Ohka Hospital who loves designer clothes and a bisexual friend of Sayoko Bizen. =Reception= Derek Guder gave the manga series a three-star review in Manga: The Complete Guide, praised for \\"distinctive\\" and \\"expressive\\" drawings, and the fact that not only are the manga's women well made, but also the recurrent humor: \\"The story lines are played up for comedic payoff, and you can't help but laugh at the characters' facial expressions liven up otherwise boring sex scenes.\\"Thompson, Jason (2007). Manga: The Complete Guide. New York: Ballantine Books & Del Rey Books. p. 469. Timothy Perper and Martha Cornog praise the expressive translation of the English edition, and describe Sayoko as a \\"tsuya/yoen\\" woman, a complex figure with \\"voluptuous charm\\" and \\"bewitching beauty\\".

He spent most of his career with Newcastle United. McFaul was born in Coleraine. He joined Newcastle United from Linfield in his native Northern Ireland in 1966 after impressing in a friendly match. It took two years for him to establish himself as Newcastle's goalkeeper, a position he held until after the 1974‚Äì75 season. His career highlight was probably when he helped Newcastle to the 1974 F.A. Cup final at Wembley, but were beaten 3-0 by Liverpool, whose first two goals were from shots by Kevin Keegan and Steve Heighway that McFaul got his fingertips to but was unable to stop. McFaul played six times for Northern Ireland, it is generally agreed that it would have been many more times except for the fact that the position was held by Pat Jennings, one of the era's finest goalkeepers. He went on to serve Newcastle as player, coach, assistant manager and then finally, in 1985, as manager. He departed in October 1988 after a poor start saw early season optimism turn into an ultimately futile struggle against relegation. McFaul's reputation was as a caring and loyal manager, who got the best out of a number of players including Peter Beardsley and Paul Goddard. His biggest contribution was probably his decision to make Paul Gascoigne an integral part of the first team despite his being only 18 at the time. McFaul has since managed teams in Northern Ireland and worked as the coach of the national team of Guam. In Northern Ireland he managed his hometown club Coleraine who are very close to his heart. Things didn't go to plan and his spell as manager coincided with a lowly period in Coleraine history. He did, however, discover Paul Gaston, who went on to captain Coleraine and play over 600 games for the club. McFaul is now working as a scout for Norwich City, professional connections having been made with Norwich Manager Glenn Roeder during Roeder's time as Newcastle United manager. Many Northern Ireland fans reflect that his true ability was never fully seen at international level due to it being the Pat Jennings era. Newcastle United manager Willie McFaul was appointed caretaker manager of Newcastle United in August 1985 after Jack Charlton had resigned after a pre season friendly against Sheffield United after a row with the Newcastle fans over the sale of Chris Waddle and the failure to sign Eric Gates from Ipswich Town. His first game in charge was away to Southampton,where he made the bold decision to make 18-year-old Paul Gascoigne the playmaker of the team. By the end of August Newcastle had beaten Liverpool 1‚Äì0, a result that was good enough to earn McFaul a permanent deal as manager. Ian Stewart and Alan Davies were early signings as Newcastle made a great start to the 1985‚Äì86 season. By November they were in the top six, with McFaul signing giant striker Billy Whitehurst to boost the forward line. More impressive results followed, including a 2‚Äì2 draw with champions Everton and a 1‚Äì1 draw at Anfield against Liverpool, as well as beating Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest away 2‚Äì1 and beating Arsenal 1‚Äì0 at St James' Park with Glenn Roeder getting the winner. Newcastle finished the season in 11th place, a good position for McFaul given the chaos at the start of the season when he took over as manager. Little transfer activity over the summer of 1986 meant that Newcastle had a bad start to the 1986‚Äì87 season and found them bottom of the table in November. McFaul was given money to spend and he brought in Andy Thomas and spent a club record ¬£400,000 on Paul Goddard from West Ham United. Goddard's arrival inspired the team to wins over Chelsea, West Ham United and Nottingham Forest. Newcastle were still bottom in March 1987 and they found help from Gascoigne and Goddard, with Goddard equalling a club record of scoring in seven straight games, to finish the season in mid-table. Peter Beardsley was sold to Liverpool on the eve of the 1987‚Äì88 season for a British record ¬£1.9m, to the anger of Newcastle's fans. McFaul signed Brazil's flamboyant striker Mirandinha to replace Beardsley, and with Wimbledon winger Glyn Hodges coming in as well as Irish teenager Michael O'Neill, Newcastle had their best season under McFaul finishing eighth, with Gascoigne taking all the plaudits winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award. The summer of 1988 brought McFaul's biggest challenge as manager of Newcastle United, as key players Paul Gascoigne, Neil McDonald and Paul Goddard were sold for a combined fee of ¬£3.7M, to the dismay of the Toon Army. With huge gaps in the team McFaul went on a shopping spree buying goalkeeper Dave Beasant for ¬£700,000, defender Andy Thorn for ¬£800,000, winger John Hendrie for ¬£500,000, and Hearts striker John Robertson for ¬£800,000. Despite Gascoigne's sale Newcastle fans were in great spirits for the opening game of the season, as 3,000 travelled down to Goodison Park. Newcastle lost 4‚Äì0 with Tony Cottee bagging a hat-trick. A battling 2‚Äì2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur seemed to have been the start for McFaul, but no wins in the next four matches saw his Newcastle side under severe pressure, but they pulled off a great win at champions Liverpool 2‚Äì1 with Mirandinha and Hendrie scoring. A 3‚Äì0 defeat at home to Coventry City spelt the end for McFaul, who had only been given the job three years earlier for a couple of matches and had given his all for Newcastle United.

According to Bailey's history of Andover, the spelling Shawshin was the most common in the old records, although Shawshine, Shashin, Shashine, Shashene, Shawshene, and later, Shawsheen, are found. The name, says Bailey, is said to mean \\"Great Spring\\".Historical Sketches of Andover by Sarah Loring Bailey, 1880 The river runs generally northward through the towns of Bedford, Billerica, Wilmington, Tewksbury, Andover, and Lawrence, where it joins the Merrimack. Like its parent, the river has played an important role in the development of the area, including industrial development, with many mills built to take advantage of the river's power. Today there are trails and parks located along several sections of the river, and a preservation effort is carried out by the Shawsheen River Watershed Association. In June 2001, the Merrimack River Watershed Council determined that the Shawsheen River failed to meet water quality standards. This situation was largely attributed to stormwater runoff via town, private and state storm drain systems. As a result of increased pollutants, major portions of the Shawsheen River are now listed as impaired waters on the 303(d) list of the Clean Water Act.

He attended Campbell College in Belfast and later attended Belfast College of Art from 1926.Retrospective of Surreal Sculptures, Belfast Newsletter, October 2008. After 1928, he continued to study at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. He originally intended to become a painter, but influenced by A.H. Gerrard, Head of Sculpture at the Slade and by Henry Moore whom he met there, he turned to sculpture. He received the Robert Ross Leaving Scholarship which enabled him and his wife (Beth Crowther) to travel to Paris where he visited the studio of Brancusi. Information brochure published by F.E.McWilliam Gallery and Studio. During the first year of the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force and was stationed in England for four years where he was engaged in interpreting aerial reconnaissance photographs. He was then posted to India. While there he taught art in the Hindu Art School in New Delhi. After his return from India, he taught for a year at the Chelsea School of Art. He was then invited by A. H. Gerrard to teach sculpture at the Slade. He continued in this post until 1968. The 1950s saw him receive many commissions including the Four Seasons Group for the Festival of Britain exhibition in 1951. A major commission (1957) was Princess Macha for Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry. Reclining Figure, located in the grounds of Queen's University Belfast During the Northern Ireland Troubles he produced a series of bronzes (1972-73) known as Women of Belfast in response to the bombing at the Abercorn Tea-Rooms In 1964 he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Queen's University Belfast. In 1966 he was appointed CBE and in 1971 he won the Oireachtas Gold Medal. McWilliam is represented in many public collections, including MOMA (New York) and Tate Britain.Rediscovering the Surrealist Sculpture of F.E.McWilliam, Belfast Newsletter, 22 March 2013. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland organised a retrospective of his work in 1981 and a second retrospective was shown at the Tate Gallery in 1989 for his 80th birthday. He continued carving up to his death. He died of cancer in London on 13 May 1992. McWilliam's style of work consists of sculptures of the human form contorted into strange positions, often described as modern and surreal. In September 2009 Banbridge District Council opened a gallery and studio dedicated to the work of and named after McWilliam.

Biography =Early life and education= Kilian Flasch was born at Retzstadt, in the Main-Spessart district of Bavaria, to Andreas and Anna Margareta (n√©e Giesuebel) Flasch. One of ten children, he was his parents' fourth child and second son; he was the only son who survived infancy. He was raised on his family's farm and received his early education at neighboring schools. In 1847, his family sold their farm and immigrated to the United States, settling in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Flasch entered the College of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, and continued his studies at St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. In 1856, he returned to Wisconsin and enrolled at the newly opened St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee. He completed his studies at St. Francis, where he was a member of the first graduating class. =Priesthood and ministry= Flasch was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Henni on December 16, 1859. He celebrated his first Mass at the chapel of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, of which three of his sisters were members, in Milwaukee the following Sunday. His first assignment was as pastor of St. Stephen Church in New Coeln, which included the mission of St. James Church in Oak Creek. From 1860 to 1863, he served as the first resident pastor of St. Louis Church in Caledonia. In October 1860, Flasch was appointed professor of moral theology and master of discipline at St. Francis Seminary. He remained at the seminary until the spring of 1865, when he became a chaplain and instructor at a convent of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in Jefferson due to ill health. He briefly resumed his duties at the seminary before being named pastor of St. Mary's Visitation Church in Elm Grove in May 1867. During his seven-year tenure, he constructed a new church building and rectory, and ministered to an orphanage. He returned to St. Francis Seminary in November 1874, where he resumed his post as professor of moral theology in addition to becoming spiritual director. From 1879 to 1881, he served as rector of the seminary. =Bishop of La Crosse, Wisconsin= On June 14, 1881, Flasch was appointed the second Bishop of La Crosse by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Archbishop Michael Heiss, with Bishops Francis Krautbauer and Rupert Seidenbusch serving as co-consecrators, at the chapel of St. Francis Seminary. He was installed on September 1. Flasch made his first ad limina visit to Rome in 1883. He attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884, serving as a member of the Committee on Schools. An outspoken supporter of Catholic education, he established 36 new schools during his tenure and, at the Plenary Council, unsuccessfully sought to require Catholic parents to send their children to parochial schools. However, he originally opposed creating a national Catholic university but later served on the Board of Trustees for the Catholic University of America. He presided over the second diocesan synod of La Crosse in 1887, and created over 60 new parishes. Because of his poor health, Flasch traveled to Chatawa, Mississippi, in March 1891 for a change of climate. The trip proved unsuccessful and he returned to La Crosse, where he died two months later at age 60. He was originally buried in the Catholic Cemetery Chapel, but his remains were later transferred to the Cathedral of St. Joseph the Workman.

Gameplay Gameplay involves squad tactics, vehicles, and a wide variety of weapons and ammo. Plot The game takes place in the year 2015, ten years after a deadly man-made virus (Spontaneous Genome Degeneration Syndrome) kills billions across the planet. The initial protagonists are four soldiers who have spent the last decade in a bunker at a Russian Kalinina military base. What greets the survivors initially is a barren world populated by sporadic groups of survivors. Every community is self-sustaining, with trade organized by the Seeker Guild. Seekers are people who scavenge pre-catastrophe (referred to as Old Time) equipment from ruined cities. It is also revealed that after the disaster, central society became non-existent, with territories being controlled by gangs; apparently the area where the group's base was located was the territory of the Slingers, a group of thugs who have started to capture and kidnap people lately. The group took control of a nearby town and its radar station. They also interrupted another kidnapping and busted up the Slinger base nearby, securing vital intelligence. The kidnapped were due to be sold at a slave market in New Boston, which the group wiped out and freed the slaves. They also paid a small visit to the Slinger headquarters nearby, killing their leader and permanently crippling their operations, as well as narrowly avoiding being caught in the crossfire of a gang war between the Claws and The Final Revolution. The protagonists acquired intel about a secretive group of highly trained and heavily armed soldiers and scientists, known as NOAH. Their operations and location were a complete secret with only the local Seekers knowing the location of their laboratories. To gain this information in exchange, the protagonists intervened in the gang war in Bergstadt, joining one gang and wiping out the other (the choice is up to the player). However, the defeated gang retreated first to the township Solensk, then besieged the nearby NOAH base, leaving the protagonists to break the siege. The leader of the local NOAH forces, Prof. Vlamidir Czeko gave the group minimal info: they were extensively but not successfully researching SGDS in the hope of finding a cure. They were suspicious about a religious community known as COTUC (Church Of The Undying Child). Suspiciously, nearly all of COTUC survived the SGDS-catastrophe and seem to be benefited from it, as they used the past ten years to research advanced technology. To get more information, especially the location of the COTUC headquarters protagonists infiltrated a COTUC monastery protected by heavily armed troops, cyborgs and crawling mines: mines capable of subterranean movement and attracted to vibrations caused by surface movement. Fortunately the visit of a high ranked COTUC member can be used to extract the desired information. At this point, the storyline splits into two paths: the player can choose to join COTUC or to defeat them. Joining COTUC the protagonists accepted a mission to infiltrate a NOAH compound and got vital intelligence from a COTUC spy. The intelligence revealed NOAH as responsible for creating SGDS and distributing it through the world in order to develop and sell the vaccine at a high price. Obviously, the vaccine wasn't completed and billions died as a result. Finally, the joint protagonist-COTUC taskforce raided and destroyed the central NOAH headquarters. At the end, the leader of COTUC arrived and gave the group a Hobson's choice: either surrender and be transformed into Death Knight cyborgs, or go down fighting. Opposing COTUC the protagonists had to infiltrate the COTUC headquarters, disguised as unarmed monks. The group had to use anything they can find to fight their way out. It was also discovered that the COTUC not only found and synthesised a cure, but also perfected SGDS to become an even more potent toxin. Unfortunately the leader of COTUC escaped to his last resort and took the antidot with him. With a little help from a squad of NOAH soldiers the numerous enemies were defeated and a counterstrike targeting the players base was prevented. In his final standoff the COTUC leader offered an alliance, which was promptly and violently rejected. Depending on the players choice the game has three possible endings, which are narrated in the closing: * If the player joined COTUC and surrendered, the protagonists are transformed into hideous Death Knights. Their only hope is to eventually beeing able to break through the brainwashing and get revenge. * If the player joined COTUC and fights, everyone is slaughtered. Maybe someone else will rise up and win against the COTUC in the future. * If the player sided with NOAH and killed the COTUC leader, it is remarked as the first step of humanity towards restoring civilization. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

She has published 11 novels, including Luck (2005), which was a nominee for the 2005 Scotiabank Giller Prize, and Critical Injuries (2001), which was longlisted for the 2002 Man Booker Prize. Her latest novel, Exit Lines, was published in 2009. Life and career Joan Barfoot was born on May 17, 1946 in Owen Sound, Ontario, and graduated with a degree in English from the University of Western Ontario in 1969. She worked as a reporter and editor for various newspapers in Ontario including the Windsor Star, the Toronto Sun and the London Free Press.Canadian Books & Authors web site As a child, while she and her mother watched a squirrel in their back yard from their kitchen, her mother told Barfoot to tell her the squirrel's story and she'd write it down. Barfoot doesn't remember the story but remembers her delight when her mother read the story back to her and the power of creating it. Barfoot was also encouraged to write by a teacher who told Barfoot she wrote well and to consider some word- related career. In addition to writing Barfoot occasionally teaches creative writing classes though she believes writing ought to be an entirely private pleasure and a puzzle. She lives in London, Ontario. In 1986, her second novel, Dancing in the Dark (1982), became a film of the same name, starring Martha Henry. It won three Genie Awards, including Best Art Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.Dancing in the Dark is a novel about the reflection of a criminally insane woman who is serving time in prison for the murder of her unfaithful husband. She explains her reasoning for the murder throughout the novel while looking for psychological freedom. Barfoot's work has been compared internationally with that of Anne Tyler, Carol Shields, Margaret Drabble, Fay Weldon and Margaret Atwood.Author web site Barfoot's first novel to win an award was Abra. Abra is about a young mother who abandons her home, husband and children and moves to the Canadian Wilderness. In 1992, she won the Marian Engel Award, presented each year by the Writers' Trust of Canada to a female Canadian novelist who is in the middle of her career. Critical commentary In 2005, the Giller jury committee, describing Luck, wrote that \\"Joan Barfoot is at the peak of her powers with this splendidly realized tragicomedy about a household in the wake of an unexpected death. With its note-perfect narration, mordant wit and wonderfully neurotic cast of characters, Luck shows how death can reveal life in all its absurdity and complexity.

PDB = 1de9. Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease is an enzyme that is involved in the DNA base excision repair pathway (BER). Its main role in the repair of damaged or mismatched nucleotides in DNA is to create a nick in the phosphodiester backbone of the AP site created when DNA glycosylase removes the damaged base. There are four types of AP endonucleases that have been classified according to their mechanism and site of incision. Class I AP endonucleases () cleave 3‚Ä≤ to AP sites by a Œ≤-lyase mechanism, leaving an unsaturated aldehyde, termed a 3‚Ä≤-(4-hydroxy-5-phospho-2-pentenal) residue, and a 5‚Ä≤-phosphate. Class II AP endonucleases incise DNA 5‚Ä≤ to AP sites by a hydrolytic mechanism, leaving a 3‚Ä≤-hydroxyl and a 5‚Ä≤-deoxyribose phosphate residue. Class III and class IV AP endonucleases also cleave DNA at the phosphate groups 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ to the baseless site, but they generate a 3‚Ä≤-phosphate and a 5‚Ä≤-OH. Humans have two AP endonucleases, APE1 and APE2. APE1 exhibits robust AP-endonuclease activity, which accounts for >95% of the total cellular activity, and APE1 is considered to be the major AP endonuclease in human cells. Human AP endonuclease (APE1), like most AP endonucleases, is of class II and requires an Mg2+ in its active site in order to carry out its role in base excision repair. The yeast homolog of this enzyme is APN1. Human AP Endonuclease 2 (APE2), like most AP endonucleases, is also of class II. The exonuclease activity of APE2 is strongly dependent upon metal ions. However, APE2 was more than 5-fold more active in the presence of manganese than of magnesium ions. The conserved domains involved in catalytic activity are located at the N-terminal part of both APE1 and APE2. In addition, the APE2 protein has a C-terminal extension, which is not present in APE1, but can also be found in homologs of human APE2 such as APN2 proteins of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.  Structure of APE1  Positive residues on the surface of the APE1 protein (in blue) anchor and bend DNA though interactions with DNA's negative phosphate groups. PDB 1de9. Hydrogen bonding among key amino acid residues help stabilize active site structure. Moreover, a negatively charged residue (Glu 96) helps hold the Mg2+ also needed to stabilize the AP site in place PDB 1de9. APE1 contains several amino acid residues that enable it to react selectively with AP sites. Three APE1 residues (Arg73, Ala74, and Lys78) contact three consecutive DNA phosphates on the strand opposite the one containing the AP site while Tyr128 and Gly127 span and widen the minor groove, anchoring the DNA for the extreme kinking caused by the interaction between positive residues found in four loops and one Œ±-helix and the negative phosphate groups found in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. This extreme kinking forces the baseless portion of DNA into APE1's active site. This active site is bordered by Phe266, Trp280, and Leu282, which pack tightly with the hydrophobic side of the AP site, discriminating against sites that do have bases. The AP site is then further stabilized through hydrogen bonding of the phosphate group 5¬¥ to the AP site with Asn174, Asn212, His309, and the Mg2+ ion while its orphan base partner is stabilized through hydrogen bonding with Met270. The phosphate group 3' to the AP site is stabilized through hydrogen bonding to Arg177. Meanwhile, an Asp210 in the active site, which is made more reactive due to the increase in its pKa (or the negative log of acid dissociation constant) caused through its stabilization through its hydrogen bonding between Asn68 and Asn212, activates the nucleophile that attacks and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone and probably results in the observed maximal APE1 activity at a pH of 7.5. Mechanism The APE1 enzyme creates a nick in the phosphodiester backbone at an abasic (baseless) site through a simple acyl substitution mechanism. First, the Asp210 residue in the active site deprotonates a water molecule, which can then perform a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate group located 5¬¥ to the AP site. Next, electrons from one of the oxygen atom in the phosphate group moves down, kicking off one of the other oxygen to create a free 5¬¥ phosphate group on the AP site and a free 3¬¥-OH on the normal nucleotide, both of which are stabilized by the Mg2+ ion. 400px Inhibition of APE1 Lucanthone Known inhibitors of APE1 include 7-nitroindole-2-carboxylic acid (NCA) and lucanthone. Both of these structures possess rings attached to short chains, which appear similar to the deoxyribose sugar ring without a base attached and phosphodiester bond in DNA. Further, both contain many H-bond acceptors which may interact with the H-bond donors in the active site of APE1, causing these inhibitors to stick in the active site and preventing the enzyme from catalyzing other reactions. APE1 as chemopreventive target Because APE1 performs an essential function in DNA base-excision repair pathway, it has become a target for researchers looking for means to prevent cancer cells from surviving chemotherapy. Not only is APE1 needed in and of itself to create the nick in the DNA backbone so that the enzymes involved later in the BER pathway can recognize the AP-site, it also has a redox function that helps activate other enzymes involved in DNA repair. As such, knocking down APE1 could lead to tumor cell sensitivity, thus preventing cancer cells from persisting after chemotherapy. APE2 enzyme activity APE2 has much weaker AP endonuclease activity than APE1, but its 3'-5' exonuclease activity is strong compared with APE1 and it has a fairly strong 3'-phosphodiesterase activity. The APE2 3' ‚Äì5' exonuclease activity has the ability to hydrolyze blunt-ended duplex DNA, partial DNA duplexes with a recessed 3' -terminus or a single nucleotide gap containing heteroduplex DNA. The APE2 3'-phosphodiesterase activity can remove modified 3'-termini, such as 3'-phosphoglycolate as well as mismatched nucleotides from the 3' primer end of DNA. APE2 is required for ATR-Chk1 DNA damage response following oxidative stress.

It opened in April 1934, four months after the repeal of Prohibition, and has been visited by many counterculture icons over the years. History The Blue Moon is the first and oldest tavern in the U-District. It was an instant hit with students, together with the still-thriving Duchess Tavern in Ravenna (which was established in the same year as the Blue Moon). Updated at Under state law, students had to trek one mile from campus to purchase drinks. The Blue Moon was one of the rare bars outside of the Central District to serve African American servicemen during World War II. The tavern also provided a haven for UW professors who were caught up in the McCarthyist purge, such as Joe Butterworth, who used the bar as his writing desk. Its heyday continued into the 1950s and 1960s. Regulars included authors Tom Robbins and Darrell Bob Houston,Tom Robbins: A Critical Companion, Catherine Elizabeth Hoyser, Lorena Laura Stookey, Greenwood Publishing, 1997 poets Theodore Roethke, Richard Hugo, Carolyn Kizer, Stanley Kunitz, and David Wagoner, and painters Richard Gilkey and Leo Kenney. Other visitors included Dylan Thomas, Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsberg and Mik Moore. A popular story claims that sometime in the late 1960s, Tom Robbins tried to call the artist Pablo Picasso in Barcelona from a pay phone at the Blue Moon Tavern. Supposedly, Robbins got through to Picasso, but the artist refused to accept the overseas collect calling charges. The Blue Moon declined in the 1970s. Efforts to \\"redevelop\\" the property in 1989 were derailed by community activists led by Walt Crowley; however, an attempt in 1990 to gain landmark status failed. Developers spared the tavern after landmark status was denied. The Blue Moon remains one of the few surviving blue-collar landmarks in Seattle. Crowley referenced Walt Crowley (1992). Forever Blue Moon, The Story of Seattle's Most (In)Famous Tavern (Seattle: Blue Moon). In 1995, the alley to the west of the Blue Moon was named Roethke Mews in honor of the bar's famous patron Theodore Roethke.

Harsdorff, (26 May 1735 - 24 May 1799) was a Danish neoclassical architect considered to have been the leading Danish architect in the late 18th century.  Early life and training  He was born Caspar Frederik Harsd√∏rffer in Copenhagen, Denmark to German-born schoolteacher Johan Christopher Harsd√∏rffer from N√ºrnberg and his Swedish-born wife Anne Marie Eriksdatter. He began his education in mathematics in order to train for the Engineer Corps, but his interest lay in architecture, which he studied enthusiastically. When the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) opened in 1754 at Charlottenborg Palace he was able to study under French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. In 1756 his design for a city gate won the Academy‚Äôs large gold medallion, giving him the distinction of being the first Danish architect to win the coveted award. The award included a six-year travel grant.  Education and travel years  In 1757, he traveled to Paris where he stayed there four years, also in the company of sculptor Carl Frederik Stanley who resided in Paris at the same time. While there he studied under Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel (1705‚Äì1774) an architect employed by King Louis XV of France. In late spring 1762 he traveled to Rome, where he discovered the remains of Ancient Rome and drew and measured the antiquities he studied.  Career in Denmark  He returned to Denmark in 1764, and was named Building Inspector. That same year he was invited to join the Academy, and received the assignment to design \\"Et kongeligt Palais, liggende paa en smuk Plads\\" (\\"A royal palace located on a beautiful plaza\\"). His design was judged successful, and he was accepted as member of the Academy in 1765, where he was given a job as Professor in Perspective in 1766. Between 1766-1769 he built the memorial chapel for former Lord High Steward Count Adam Gottlob Moltke at Karise Church in Faxe, which had been begun by his former teacher and now fellow Professor at the Academy architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. In 1770 he was named Royal Building Master to the court of King Christian VII. In 1771 Professor Jardin requested that Harsdorff be named his successor as Professor of Architecture at the Academy, which position he filled that year after Jardin vacated the position on 26 March in conjunction with his leaving Denmark to return to France. As professor he played an important role in the classical education of the next generation of architects. His students included Peter Meyn, Joseph Christian Lillie and Christian Frederik Hansen. Harsdorff also became a member of the Main Building Directorate (Overbygnings direktionen) in 1771. In 1773 he designed the pulpit at Our Saviour‚Äôs Church (Vor Frelsers Kirke) in the Christianshavn district of Copenhagen. The neoclassical wood pulpit is painted to look like golden marble, and features a frieze attributed to Johannes Wiedewelt and Peder Als. That same year he rebuilt in the King‚Äôs Garden (Kongens Have), the gardens at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, the temple-like Hercules Pavilion for which Johannes Wiedewelt‚Äôs studio produced the reliefs of Hercules and Omphale. The pavilion now houses a caf√©. He also was commissioned to enlarge the Nicolai Eigtved-designed The Royal Theatre (1748) on Kongens Nytorv that year. In the course of his work on this project he received permission to develop the site between the theatre and Charlottenborg Palace, home of the Art Academy, which he then developed 1779-1780 as a home for his family. Rebuilding of the theatre was carried on 1773-1774. In 1774-1779 he designed and started building the austere memorial chapels for Christian VI and Frederik V at Roskilde Cathedral. Work on this project, however, was stopped in 1779 because of lack of money. The work began again many years after his death, and was completed by his student Christian Frederik Hansen (1820-1825). Harsdorff acted as the Academy‚Äôs Director 1777-1779, and was named to the title of Justitsraad in 1778. In 1779-1780 he designed and built Harsdorff House at Kongens Nytorv 3-5, which became the new model for Copenhagen townhouses of the time. The building is shown on a Danish postage stamp, part of series entitled Danish Houses which features significant Danish buildings. The building is now owned by real estate company Karberghus. The tenants include the Harsdorffs Hus Office Club. Between 1781-1785 he designed the interior design in two large rooms at The Royal Library. In 1781 he was named Head Royal Building Master. Between 1794-1795 he designed and built the colonnade at Amalienborg Palace to connect the recently occupied King‚Äôs palace, Moltke Palace, with the Crown Prince‚Äôs residence, Schack‚Äôs Palace. In 1795 he was asked to create plans for Frederik's Church (Frederikskirke), now known as The Marble Church (Marmorkirken), work on which had been halted 1770 after French neoclassical architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin had led the effort. Harsdorff created two plans, and made a model of one of them. The project was approved, but Harsdorff health was now weak. The work eventually was developed according to plans by Ferdinand Meldahl (1827‚Äì1908). Personal life In May 1770 Harsdorff married the widow Elisabeth (Elsebeth) Margrethe Braun, daughter of Building Master to the royal court Jacob Fortling. The couple had three children of whom two daughters survived In May 1799 he became sick at his country home Rosenlund on Gammel Kongevej, Frederiksberg, and he died there on 24 May 1799. He was buried in Assistens Cemetery (Assistens Kirkeg√•rd), Copenhagen. He was survived by his wife.  Aftermath  Art historian and critic Niels Lauritz H√∏yen‚Äôs Nordic Art Society (Selskabet for nordisk Kunst) published the book \\"C. F. Harsdorffs V√¶rker\\" (1871). In 1985, a memorial plaque in his memory was erected at Assistens Kirkeg√•rd. An exhibition devoted to his work was held in Copenahgen‚Äôs Kunstindustrimuseet September 1985.

In a series of punitive expeditions led by Northern Territory Police constable William George Murray, people of the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre, and Kaytetye groups were killed. The massacre occurred in response to the murder of dingo hunter Frederick Brooks, killed by Aboriginal people in August 1928 at a place called Yukurru, also known as Brooks Soak. Official records at the time state that at least 31 people were killed, however analysis of existing documentation and Aboriginal oral histories reveal that the fatalities were likely to have been as high as 200. Background Central Australia was Australia's last colonial frontier, sparsely populated and, by 1928, was facing the fourth year of the harshest drought on record. Parched conditions, though later discounted by authorities as a precipitating factor, were to play a key role in events at Coniston. Appropriating water resources was fundamental to pastoral economy, and exclusive control over water was a priority in order to maintain cattle in good condition on any station. With the worsening of the drought, as waterholes dried up, the starving nomadic Aboriginals were forced to move back in towards the permanent waterholes and soaks located on the new station properties. It was generally believed in the white community that the interests of traditional Aboriginal land owners and those of cattle stations could not be reconciled. Either one or the other must prosper. Pastoralists regarded their presence, begging for food or spearing cattle, as an \\"aggravation\\", and would drive the incoming Aboriginals from these few remaining water sources, according to Cribbin, in order to ensure the survival of their cattle.North Australia (pink) and Central Australia (brown) =The killing of Fred Brooks= 61-year-old Fred Brooks had worked as a station hand on Randall Stafford's Coniston station, north-west of Alice Springs, in a number of stints since World War I. In July 1928 he asked Stafford if he could have a go at dingo hunting. Stafford warned him that he and the woman he cohabited with, Alice, had been threatened by \\"myalls\\" (an offensive term denoting traditional living Aboriginal people) and that venturing any further than west would be unsafe. Alice was believed to have broken kinship rules by living with the white man. Brooks bought two camels and on 2 August, left with two 12-year-old Aboriginal children, Skipper and Dodger, to trap dingos for the 10 s (2011:A$35.65) bounty on their scalps. Approaching a soak from the homestead, he found around 30 Ngalia-Warlpiri people camped. Brooks knew some and decided to camp with them. The first two days were uneventful and Brooks caught several dingoes. According to evidence in a later inquiry, on 4 August, Charlton Young and a companion who were exploring the area for a mining company, stopped by and warned Brooks that the Aboriginal people had been getting \\"cheeky\\" lately by visiting the mining camps heavily armed, demanding food and tobacco. About the same time several Aboriginal children were being taken away to Alice Springs. According to one version, Brooks had been approached several times to trade but had so far refused, until 6 August. The Aboriginal tradition, related to Peter and Jay Read by Alec Jupurrula and Jack Japaljarri, holds that a Warlpiri, Japanunga Bullfrog and his wife were approached by Brooks who asked Bullfrog if he could take his wife, Marungardi, to do Brooks' washing in exchange for food and tobacco. Marugardi performed her chores but, either returned to Japanunga's camp without the promised supplies or did not return, so at dawn the next day, Japanunga killed Brooks. A third account is more detailed, stating that Japanunga became enraged when he found his wife in bed with Brooks and attacked him, severing an artery in his throat with his boomerang. This account claims that Bullfrog, his uncle Padirrka, and Marungardi then beat Brooks to death, and that Aboriginal elders, in fear for the foreseeable consequences, then banished Bullfrog and Padirrka and ordered Brooks' two boys to return to the homestead and say that he had died of natural causes. =Discovery of Brooks' body and responses= Accounts vary as to who first came across Brooks' body. Until the publication of Cribbin's book in 1984, it was believed that Bruce Chapman, the prospector, was first on the scene. The following day an Aboriginal person named Alex Wilson camped at the now deserted soak and finding the body rode back to the station, where he described hysterically how Brooks had been \\"chopped up\\" by 40 Aboriginal people and the parts stuffed in a rabbit burrow. Randall Stafford had been in Alice Springs requesting police to attend to prevent the spearing of his cattle. He returned to be told of the murder and dismemberment of Brooks but chose to wait for the police. No one returned to the soak and no one attempted to retrieve the body. On 11 August, the Government Resident J. C. Cawood sent Constable William George Murray, the officer in charge at Barrow Creek who also held the post of Chief Protector of Aborigines, to Coniston to investigate the complaints of cattle spearing. Told of the murder, Murray drove back to Alice Springs and telephoned Cawood, who refused to send reinforcements, telling Murray to deal with the Aboriginal people as he saw fit. Returning to Coniston, Murray questioned Dodger and Skipper who described the circumstances of the murder and named Bullfrog, Padirrka, and Marungali as the killers. According to his own report, Murray also obtained the names of 20 accomplices (he never recorded the names, or explained how his informants, who were not eyewitnesses, knew them; nor were these inconsistencies ever questioned at later proceedings). Murray organised a posse consisting of tracker Paddy, Alex Wilson, Dodger, tracker Major (elder brother of Brooks' boy Skipper), Randall Stafford and two white itinerants Jack Saxby and Billie Brisco. Massacre Brooks was killed on or about 7 August 1928, and his body was partly buried in a rabbit hole. No eyewitnesses to the actual murder were ever identified, and there are conflicting accounts of the discovery of the body and subsequent events. On 15 August, dingo trapper Bruce Chapman arrived at Coniston and William George Murray sent Chapman, Paddy and Alex Wilson and three aboriginal trackers to the soak to find out what happened. The three buried Brooks on the bank of the soak. In the afternoon two Warlpiri, Padygar and Woolingar arrived at Coniston to trade dingo scalps. Believing them to be involved with the murder Paddy arrested them but Woolingar slipped his chains and attempted to escape. Murray fired at Woolingar and he fell with a bullet wound to the head. Stafford then kicked him in the chest breaking a rib. Woolingaar was then chained to a tree for the next 18 hours. The next morning the posse, with Padygar and Woolingar following on foot in chains, set out for the Lander River where they found a camp of 23 Warlpiri at Ngundaru. With the posse encircling the camp, Murray rode in and was surrounded by Aboriginal people yelling, Brisco started shooting with Saxby and Murray joining in. Three men and a woman, Bullfrog's wife Marungali, were killed on the encounter, with another woman dying from her wounds an hour later. A subsequent search of the camp turned up articles belonging to Brooks. Stafford was furious with Murray over the shooting and the next morning returned to Coniston alone. During the night, Murray captured three young boys who had been sent by their tribe to find what the police party was doing. Murray had the boys beaten to force them to lead the party to the rest of the Warlpiri but had they done so, they would have been punished by their tribe. To resolve the dilemma, the three boys smashed their own feet with rocks. Despite the injuries Murray forced the now crippled boys to lead the party; according to Cribbin. By nightfall they reached Cockatoo Creek where they sighted four Aboriginal people on a ridge. Paddy and Murray captured two but one ran with Murray firing several shots at him which missed, Paddy then knelt and fired a single shot hitting the fleeing man in the back and killing him instantly. After questioning the other three and finding they had no connection with the murder Murray released them. The next two days saw no contact with Aboriginal people at all as word had spread with many Aboriginal people heading into the desert, preferring to risk dying of thirst rather than face the police patrol. Returning to Coniston, Murray left Padygar, Woolingar and one of the three boys, 11-year-old Lolorrbra (known as Lala, who would become a chief witness at the enquiry), whose crushed feet had become infected, in Stafford's custody before heading north to continue the search. Following tracks, the patrol came upon a camp of 20 Warlpiri, mostly women and children. Approaching the camp Murray ordered the men to drop their weapons. Not understanding English the women and children fled while the men stood their ground to protect them. The patrol opened fire, killing three men; three injured died later of their wounds and an unknown number of wounded escaped. By Murray's account, he met four separate groups of Warlpiri, and in each case was obliged to shoot in self-defense ‚Äì a total of 17 casualties. He later testified under oath that each one of the dead was a murderer of Brooks. The Warlpiri themselves estimated between 60 and 70 people had been killed by the patrol. On 24 August, Murray captured an Aboriginal person named Arkirkra and returned to Coniston, where he collected Padygar (Woolingar had died that night still chained to the tree) and then marched the two to Alice Springs. Arriving on 1 September, Arkirkra and Padygar were charged with the murder of Brooks while Murray was hailed as a hero. On 3 September, Murray set off for Pine Hill station to investigate complaints of cattle spearing. Nothing has been recorded about this patrol, but he returned on 13 September with two prisoners. On 16 September, Henry Tilmouth of Napperby station shot and killed an Aboriginal person he was chasing away from the homestead; this incident was included in the later enquiry. On the 19th, Murray again departed, this time under orders to investigate a non-fatal attack on the person of a settler, William Nuggett Morton, at Broadmeadows Station, by what Morton described as a group of 15 Myall Warlpiri people who were also in the same area. Morton, a former circus wrestler, had a reputation for his sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women and violence against both his white employees and Aboriginal people. On 27 August, he left his camp to punish Aboriginal people for spearing his cattle. At Boomerang waterhole he found a large Warlpiri camp; what happened here is unknown but the Warlpiri decided to kill Morton. During the night they surrounded his camp and at dawn 15 men armed with boomerangs and yam sticks rushed Morton. His dogs attacked the Aboriginals and after breaking free Morton shot one and the rest fled. Morton returned to his main camp and was taken to the Ti Tree Well mission where a nurse removed 17 splinters from his head and treated him for a serious skull fracture. From the station, on 24 September, a party consisting of Murray, Morton, Alex Wilson and Jack Cusack (the latter two being of Aboriginal descent), embarked on a series of encounters: three incidents were later described by Murray, in which 14 more Aboriginal people were reportedly killed, but it is likely that there were more. At Tomahawk waterhole four were killed, while at Circle Well one was shot dead and Murray killed another with an axe. They then moved east to the Hanson River where another eight were shot. Morton identified all of them as his attackers. The party now returned to Broadmeadows to replenish their supplies before travelling north. No records of this patrol were kept. According to the Warlpiri, this patrol encountered Aboriginal people at Dingo Hole where they killed four men and 11 women and children. The Warlpiri also recount how the patrol charged a corroboree at Tippinba, rounding up a large number of Aboriginal people like cattle before cutting out the women and children and shooting all the men. There is anecdotal evidence that there were up to 100 killed in total at the five sites. Constable William George Murray was back in Alice Springs on 18 October where he was asked to write an official report on the police actions. The report was only several lines long; he wrote: \\"....incidents occurred on an expedition with William John Morton, unfortunately drastic action had to be taken and resulted in a number of male natives being shot.\\" No mention was made of the number killed, the circumstances of the shootings or where they occurred. Trial of two Aboriginal people The trial of Arkirkra and Padygar for Brooks' murder took place in the Supreme Court of Central Australia located in Darwin in North Australia on 7 and 8 November before Justice Mallen. The first witness was 12-year-old Lolorrbra (known as Lala) who testified in detail that he saw Arkirkra, Padygar and Marungali kill Brooks. He also testified that all the Aboriginal people that had helped them were now dead. Constable Murray took the stand next, his evidence becoming so involved in justifying his own actions in killing suspects that Justice Mallen reminded him that he himself was not on trial and to avoid facts not relevant to the guilt of the accused. The court then adjourned for lunch. The verdict was a foregone conclusion as all that remained was the reading of the confessions made by the accused in Alice Springs. Despite lunch for the jurors being provided by the local hotel, two of the jurors went home to eat. A furious Justice Mallen dismissed the jury, ordered a new jury be empanelled and a new trial to be convened the following day. The new trial began with Lolorrbra being asked to repeat his evidence. This time his evidence, although still maintaining that the accused were the murderers, was completely contradictory. Under cross examination it became apparent within minutes that he had been coached on what to say. When the prosecution tried to introduce the written confessions of the accused, Justice Mallen pointed out that as the accused had been charged by a South Australian rather than Central Australian magistrate he would disallow the statements. The prosecution declined to call the accused to testify. Murray took the stand next, angering Justice Mallen when he repeated his justifications for killing suspects. The judge remarked \\"It appears impossible for all those bands of natives to be associated with the murder of Brooks. It looks as if they were shot down at different places just to teach them and other aborigines a lesson.\\"Native Slaughter: Alice Springs Horror: Minister's Criticism Perth Daily News, 13 November 1928, at Trove With no evidence of guilt presented, Justice Mallen ordered the jury to acquit the accused. During his testimony, Murray said that the group had \\"shot to kill\\": > Justice Mallen: Constable Murray, was it really necessary to shoot to kill > in every case? Could you not have occasionally shot to wound? > Murray: No your honour, what is the use of a wounded blackfellow hundreds > of miles from civilization? > Justice Mallen: How many did you kill? > Murray: Seventeen your honour. > Justice Mallen: You mean you mowed them down wholesale! > ‚ÄîThe Northern Territory Times, 9 November 1928 In the courtroom to hear this and other evidence of massacre was Athol McGregor, a Central Australian missionary. He passed on his concern to church leaders, and eventually to William Morley, outspoken and influential advocate of the Association for the Protection of Native Races, who did the most to secure a judicial enquiry. The Federal government was also under considerable pressure to act. The British media had been reporting on Australia's treatment of Aboriginal people (Australia was in financial difficulties at the time and an economic mission from London was considering financial assistance), a federal election was due on 17 November and the League of Nations had publicly criticized the case. During the trial Murray was billeted with the Northern Australia police. Although Murray officially admitted to only 17 deaths, Constable Victor Hall said he was shocked with Murray's \\"freely expressed opinions of what was good enough for a blackfellow\\", and claimed he bragged to fellow officers that he had killed \\"closer to 70 than 17\\". Board of Inquiry The Board of Inquiry was presided over by police magistrate A. H. O'Kelly and was deeply compromised from the start ‚Äì its three members being hand-picked to maximise damage control; J. C. Cawood, Government Resident of Central Australia, and Murray's immediate superior, being one of them. Cawood revealed his own disposition in a letter to his departmental secretary shortly after the massacre: \\"‚Ä¶trouble has been brewing for some time, and the safety of the white man could only be assured by drastic action on the part of the authorities ‚Ä¶ I am firmly of the opinion that the result of the recent action by the police will have the right effect upon the natives.\\"Cawood to Secretary Home & Territories Dept 25 October 1928. NAA A431 1950/2768 Part 1 The board sat for 18 days in January 1929 to consider three incidents (Brooks, Morton and Tilmouth) that resulted in the deaths of Aboriginal people, and in one more day, finished its report, finding that 31 Aboriginal people had been killed and that in each case the death was justified. The hearing decided, in the face of indubitable evidence to the contrary, that there had been no drought in Central Australia, evidence of ample native food and water supplies and thus no mitigation for cattle spearing. A journalist for the Adelaide Register-News who travelled with the board during its tour of Central Australia to determine the claims of drought reported; \\"Five years of drought have burnt every blade of grass from the plains and left a wilderness of red sand...the wonder is that any living thing survives. Every settler visited by the Board had lost between 60 and 80 percent of his stock [to the drought] this year alone.\\" The day after this report was published, a settler replied in the letters to the editor that the drought made the life of one ewe worth more to Australia than \\"all the blacks that were ever here\\". Cawood expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in his annual report for 1929, writing: \\"The evidence of all the witnesses was conclusive ‚Ä¶ the Board found that the shooting was justified, and that the natives killed were all members of the Walmulla (sic) tribe from Western Australia, who were on a marauding expedition, with the avowed object of wiping out the white settlers‚Ä¶\\"Report of Government Resident Central Australia, 1929, p6 Following his appointment, O'Kelly had stated his intention that the enquiry would not be a whitewash and it is speculated he had been \\"got at.\\" To take up his appointment, O'Kelly travelled by train from Canberra to Melbourne with Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, who was campaigning for the upcoming election with the White Australia policy as his party's main platform, accompanying him. O'Kelly later said that had he known how the enquiry would turn out, he would have refused the appointment, stating that if the same circumstances happened again someone would be hanged for the killings. Reporting on the inquiry, the Adelaide Register-News wrote: \\"he [Murray] is the hero of Central Australia. He is the policeman of fiction. He rides alone and always gets his man.\\" The Northern Territory Times announced that the police were wholly exonerated, and that \\"there was not a scintilla of evidence\\" to support the view that the police had conducted a reprisal or punitive expedition.Tragedy of the Centre: Police Exonerated The Northern Territory Times, 5 February 1929, at Trove Aftermath Constable William George Murray remained with the Northern Territory Police until the mid 1940s. He retired to Adelaide where he died in 1975. William Morton moved out of the area several years after the massacre. Bullfrog was never arrested and moved to Yuendumu where he died of old age in the 1970s. The Walkabout cover featuring One Pound Jimmy One of the few survivors was Gwoya Jungarai, who left the area after the massacre destroyed his family. A later picture of him as One Pound Jimmy became an iconic Australian postage stamp. Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri, a prominent Papunya Tula painter, was a survivor of the massacre. His father was away hunting and survived while his mother had hidden him in a coolamon under a bush before being shot and killed.Tjukurrtjanu: Origins of Western Desert Art National Gallery of Victoria and Museum Victoria The strong oral history established after the massacre is recorded in paintings by some indigenous artists and the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre and Kaytetye refer to the period as The Killing Times. Similarly, other massacres that have occurred in the Ord River region have been recorded by Warmun artists such as Rover Thomas.

The name relates to its location \\"on the climb\\" (an der steige) of a trade route over the Swabian Jura mountain range. History Although the area had settlements since the Bronze Age, Geislingen was founded by the counts of Helfenstein as a transit collection station on the important commercial route between the Rhine valley and the Mediterranean. The fortified Helfenstein castle existed since 1100. Giselingen was first mentioned as civitas in a document dated 1237. From 1396 through 1802, Geislingen was owned by the free and imperial city of Ulm on the Danube. In 1803 Ulm and Geislingen became part of Bavaria, but in a land exchange were incorporated into the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1810. Industrialization started with the arrival of the railroad and the construction of the Fils Valley Railway (1847-1850) up the Geislinger Steige, a steep incline of rail and road to the plateau of the Schw√§bische Alb (Swabian Jura), and Geislingen (Steige) station.

This victory, a landmark for First Amendment rights, won Fein's right to disseminate his art. Fein won another federal First Amendment lawsuit to remove a government-imposed gag order. As recognition, Fein received a nomination for a PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award in 2001. Fein now presides the board of First Amendment Project, a nonprofit organization that protects and promotes freedom of information, expression, and petition.  Early life and career  Born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa, Fein graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in 1986, with a Bachelor of Arts in Industrial Psychology. After living in New York for a couple of years, Fein moved to Los Angeles, where he began reporting directly to the President of Orion Pictures, as part of the creative team for numerous films, among them Academy Award-winning Dances with Wolves and The Silence of the Lambs. From the outset, Fein's work has led him into some high- profile confrontations. In 1994, his CD-ROM Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the US Military, based on the book by renowned investigative reporter Randy Shilts that examined the issue of gays in the military, used digital technology as an art form. When the US Navy unsuccessfully attempted to block its release, it became the first CD-ROM to triumph under First Amendment protections. Conduct Unbecoming won the Critic's Choice Award, was praised by Wired Magazine as \\"a tantalizing peek at the potential of CD-ROM publishing,\\" and dubbed \\"evolutionary\\" by Rolling Stone Magazine.  Art and law  Fein was the first South African-born American to challenge government restrictions on technological communications when he filed a federal lawsuit 30 January 1997. Fein, represented by Michael Traynor of Cooley Godward LLP and by William Bennett Turner of Rogers, Joseph, O'Donell and Phillips, filed a lawsuit against Janet Reno, former United States Attorney General, challenging the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). The CDA made the communication of anything \\"indecent with the intent to annoy\\", a felony punishable by a fine and up to two-year imprisonment. President Bill Clinton signed the CDA into law in February 1996. Fein filed the lawsuit, Apollomedia v. Reno, the same time he launched his Annoy.com web site. A three-judge panel in United States District Court for the Northern District of California made a divided decision on the lawsuit. Fein filed a Supreme Court appeal, which he won in 1999. In June 1999, the U.S. government sent Fein an order to reveal a user of Annoy.com's e-card service. Earlier, in April 1999, the University of Houston tried unsuccessfully to obtain the website's records. The government later ordered Fein to stop discussing details of this investigation, its existence or its application. In United States v. ApolloMedia, Fein argued that this gag order violated the First Amendment and the statutory requirement that it have a definite duration. The case moved from a Texas magistrate court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and then to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit granted the appeal. The District Court then unsealed the website's records and all related proceedings and lifted the gag order.  Art, politics and censorship  As an artist, Fein is represented by Toomey Tourell in San Francisco and Axis Gallery in New York, and his shows have been dogged by controversy. In 2001, Fein was scheduled to open a solo exhibition, Annoy.com, (based on his critically acclaimed web site of the same name), in San Francisco in October. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Artforum Magazine pulled an advertisement for Fein's show from their October issue. The advertisement displayed an image of a purse-lipped former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani, sitting naked in a urine-filled glass, referencing the technique used by artist Damien Hirst, in which animate objects are soaked in formaldehyde and encased in a glass containers. Fein's advertisement, designed to link Mayor Giuliani with mayoral candidate Michael Bloomberg, incorporated imagery from the exhibition Sensation that resulted in mayor Giuliani withholding funding from the Brooklyn Museum. Clutching a crucifix with a nod to artist Andres Serrano and with another Giuliani targeted work, Chris Ofili's Virgin Mary forming the backdrop, copy on the top of the image reads: \\"Mike for Mayor\\" and at the bottom, \\"Start Spreading the News.\\" Artforum Executive Editor Knight Landesman stated that the magazine was understaffed and that the editors did not feel comfortable publishing a disparaging image of Rudy Giuliani. In October 2004, Palo Alto-based printing company Zazzle destroyed two of Fein's giant images. just before the opening of a solo exhibition at Toomey Tourell Gallery. The first of the images, reviewed at Chelsea's Axis Gallery by The New York Times' Ken Johnson, was described as \\"an American flag with the stars and stripes made from the text of the official Abu Ghraib report ... accompanied by fifty representations of the iconic image of a hooded man teetering on a box with wires trailing from his arms comprising the stars.\\" The other depicted President Bush on a crucifix and was entitled \\"Who Would Jesus Torture?\\" The printing company told San Francisco Chronicle art critic Kenneth Baker that it had \\"destroyed the images\\"; company spokesperson Matt Wilsey claimed the image might \\"offend Christians,\\" and threatened to sue Fein for defamation if Fein publicly criticized the company's actions. \\"Who Would Jesus Torture?\\" was published in Art of Engagement, Visual Politics in California and Beyond, by Peter Selz, released in November 2005, and exhibited at the Katzen Arts Center at American University in 2006. (Peter Selz is Professor Emeritus of the History of Art at the University of California, Berkeley, the founding director of the Berkeley Art Museum, and a former curator of New York's Museum of Modern Art.) In November 2006, \\"Who Would Jesus Torture\\" accompanied an article about Fein in American Protest Literature by author and Harvard University lecturer Zoe Trodd, published by Harvard University Press. It was this interview that Fein cited as a catalyst for his exhibition Torture, which opened at Toomey Tourell gallery in San Francisco in January 2007, featuring gigantic, high-resolution photographs that reenacted infamous scenes from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . Fein's Torture series was exhibited in Beijing in September 2007 and in London in October 2007. A review in the December 2007 issue of Art in America magazine, summed up the impact of Fein's Torture series, stating: \\"Torture of detainees or their rendition to countries with even more abusive torture regimens has become semi-legal under the Bush administration. Fein reminds us, however, that these practices can never be anything less than intolerable.\\" Fein is the current editor of First Amendment Project's web log and writes a blog, Pointing Fingers for the San Francisco Chronicle.

They were connected with ex-Beatle George Harrison, and had groups of instrumentalists to back them on each album. Splinter was the first act signed to Harrison's Dark Horse Records label, when it was partnered with A&M; Records. The band's sound has often been likened to that of The Beatles (particularly Harrison and John Lennon) and Badfinger. The duo's biggest success came with their debut album, the critically admired The Place I Love (1974), which contained the hit single \\"Costafine Town\\". The Place I Love, Harder to Live and Two Man Band have been remastered and reissued on compact disc on the Big Pink Music label from South Korea. The remainder of Splinter's catalogue is out of print and has yet to be issued on compact disc. History Splinter, who had worked together at various times in the Newcastle and London music scenes, first came to the attention of Harrison through Mal Evans, a longtime assistant to The Beatles and latterly a scout for Apple Records.Leng, p. 142.\\"George Harrison talks about how Mal Evans discovered Splinter and 'Lonely Man' in this the last APPLE film (1974)\\", Tom Brennan's Splinter Library, 26 November 2011 (retrieved 25 October 2012). Harrison was impressed with one of their songs, \\"Lonely Man\\", which he felt would be ideal for a film he was producing, based on the stage play Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs. Harrison and his then bride of two weeks Patti Boyd attended the play's opening in 1966.Clayson, p. 346. Harrison initially intended to sign Splinter to Apple Records and held sessions at Apple Studio in central London to work on the song;Leng, p. 143. Harrison associate Pete Ham also participated in these sessions, held in mid-1973.\\"'Lonely Man' demo session by Splinter (with Pete Ham)\\", Tom Brennan's Splinter Library, 26 November 2011 (retrieved 25 October 2012). Plans were made for \\"Lonely Man\\" to be released as an Apple single and Splinter were shown performing the piece in the Apple film. However, Bill Elliot was featured on an Apple single (#1835) \\"God Save Us\\" b/w \\"Do the Oz\\" both written by Lennon/Ono and under the moniker of \\"Bill Elliot and The Plastic Oz Band\\" on the A side. The B side was the \\"Elastic Oz Band\\". Elliot was also featured on the 45rpm picture sleeve. But as Apple fell apart, Harrison decided to establish his own record label, setting up offices in London on Royal Avenue and in Los Angeles. Once Harrison heard more Splinter material he invited them to record an album.Madinger & Easter, p. 442. Work on this spanned 17 months, with the majority of the sessions taking place at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT. Also during this period, Purvis and Elliot co-wrote the song \\"Kyle\\" with Gary Wright, another friend of Harrison's who contributed to the lengthy sessions for Splinter's album.Leng, p. 143fn. (\\"Kyle\\" appeared on the 1974 Spooky Tooth album The Mirror.) On their Dark Horse Records debut album, The Place I Love, Harrison produced all the songs and played a variety of instruments, including electric and acoustic guitars, dobro, bass guitar and harmonium.Bruce Eder, \\"Splinter biography\\", Allmusic (retrieved 26 October 2012). As well as Wright, other musicians included Alvin Lee, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voorman, Willie Weeks and Mel Collins.Select: albums: The Place I Love, Tom Brennan's Splinter Library, 26 November 2011 (retrieved 25 October 2012). The album was so heavy with George Harrison's participation it was rumoured this was secretly Harrison's new band. Most of the songs were written by Purvis, with Elliott co-writing lyrics on \\"China Light\\" and \\"Costafine Town\\".Bruce Eder, \\"Splinter The Place I Love\\", Allmusic (retrieved 26 October 2012). \\"Costafine Town\\" was an international hit single, reaching the top ten in Australia and South Africa, and the top 20 in the United Kingdom. Both this single and the album also charted on the Billboard charts in the United States.\\"Splinter: Awards\\", Allmusic (retrieved 26 October 2012). The follow-up single, \\"Drink All Day\\", was banned in the UK by the BBC for the inclusion of the word \\"bloody\\". In preparing for Splinter's second album, Harder to Live, Harrison arranged for them to record at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles during the late spring and early summer of 1975.Leng, p. 178. The band were unable to use the studio time, however, due to Purvis suffering from hay fever, apparently brought on by the LA smog. Since Harrison was in town working with fellow Dark Horse acts such as Keltner's band Attitudes, he instead used the pre-booked studio time to record his own album, Extra Texture.Madinger & Easter, p. 451.Leng, pp 178‚Äì79. This would be Harrisons last Apple album. Harrison only participated on one track on Harder to Live ‚Äì a new version of \\"Lonely Man\\".\\"Splinter ‚ÄìHarder to Live 1975\\", waddywachtelinfo.com (retrieved 26 October 2012). The original recording from 1973 remains unreleased, apart from its appearance in the Little Malcolm movie. The song was co-produced by Harrison and Tom Scott, and featured Harrison on guitar.Leng, p. 187. \\"Lonely Man\\" was a hit in Japan, and in recording a version of the song in Japanese, Splinter became the first western artists to sing in that language. They were helped to achieve this by Japanese actor and singer Masatoshi Nakamura. The Japanese single credited the song as written by B Pervis/M Evans. Another set of musicians provided backing: Chris Spedding, Waddy Wachtel and John Taylor. Recently the film \\"Little Malcolm\\" has been released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK. Also during this period, Splinter won the Outstanding Song Award at the 1976 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival, held at the Budokan in Tokyo, with their song \\"Love Is Not Enough\\". This performance was released on an album that documented this annual song festival. As a result of this success, \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" was released as a single in Japan. This first version was produced by Tom Scott, and is a different arrangement from the one that subsequently appeared on Two Man Band. Splinter toured America briefly as an opening act for Duran Duran and other 80s British bands touring at the time. Although the duo of Purvis and Elliott continued to perform together until 1984,Two Man Band was the last Splinter album released in most countries and their final album on Dark Horse Records. Harrison is credited as co-executive producer, and played some of the guitar.Leng, p. 208. The main production duties were entrusted to Norbert Putnam. This album had two singles released \\"Round & Round\\" b/w \\"I'll Bend for You\\". The latter was a non-LP track and lastly \\"Motions of Love\\" as double sided promo single in 1977. \\"Motions\\" did get released in 1978 with a B side of \\"I Need Your Love\\". After Two Man Band, Splinter recorded two more albums that were each released in just two countries. The first of these, Streets at Night, was issued only in Japan, in 1979. Purvis and Elliott produced and arranged this album themselves. Streets at Night featured Alan Clark, who played keyboards, synthesizers and clavinet. During this period, Splinter were associated with the Japanese music TV station NTVM, and worked with the Japanese rock band Godiego. A single of Splinter singing the Godiego song \\"Ghandara\\" (associated with the TV show Monkey) was released, and they also appeared on a compilation album, Our Favourite Songs, a set led by members of Godiego. A single \\"Danger Zone\\" b/w \\"Swear to God\\" was released in the UK in 1979 on Barn Records. The final Splinter album was Splinter, which was released in the UK in 1980 on the Bellaphon label. The album was also issued in Japan the following year under the title Sail Away, with a song called \\"Pigalle\\" used in place of \\"All That Love\\". Splinter finally split up in 1984. In recent years, Purvis has re-emerged as a performer and composer, working for a British cancer research charity.

Commun., 1997, 1303-1304. Container molecule. Green: Ga cluster, L = ligand, Molecular encapsulation in supramolecular chemistry is the confinement of a guest molecule inside the cavity of a supramolecular host molecule (molecular capsule, molecular container or cage compounds). Examples of supramolecular host molecule include carcerands and endohedral fullerenes. Reactivity of guests  An important implication of encapsulating a molecule at this level is that the guest is prevented from contacting other molecules that it might otherwise react with. Thus the encapsulated molecule behaves very differently from the way it would when in solution. The guest molecule tends to be extremely unreactive and often has much different spectroscopic signatures. Compounds normally highly unstable in solution, such as arynes or cycloheptatetraene, have been successfully isolated at room temperature when molecularly encapsulated. Examples One of the first examples of encapsulating a structure at the molecular level was demonstrated by Cram and coworkers; they were able to isolate highly unstable, antiaromatic cylobutadiene at room temperature by encapsulating it within a hemicarcerand. Isolation of cyclobutadiene allowed chemists to experimentally confirm one of the most fundamental predictions of the rules of aromaticity. In another example the cage consists of a gallium tetrahedral cluster compound stabilized by 6 bidentate catechol amide ligands residing at the tetrahedron edges. The guest is a 16 electron and thus very reactive ruthenium metallocene (an organometallic catalyst) with a cyclopentadienyl ligand (red) and a 1,3,7-octatriene ligand (blue). The total charge for this anion is 11 and the counterions are 5 tetramethyl ammonium cations and 6 potassium cations. The ruthenium compound decomposes in water within minutes but encapsulated it survives in water for weeks. Large metalla- assemblies, known as metallaprisms, contain a conformationally flexible cavity that allows them to host a variety of guest molecules. These assemblies have shown promise as agents of drug delivery to cancer cells. An application of encapsulation is controlling reactivity, spectroscopy, and structure. For instance, excited state reactivity of free 1-phenyl-3-tolyl-2-proponanone (abbreviated A-CO-B) yields products A-A, B-B, and AB, which result from decarbonylation followed by random recombination of radicals A‚Ä¢ and B‚Ä¢. Whereas, the same substrate upon encapsulation reacts to yield the controlled recombination product A-B, and rearranged products (isomers of A-CO-B). Other applications: * the encapsulation of filaments of a self-assembling bi-copper complex in polymer nanowires. =Alcohol= According to food chemist Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in Munich, alcohol can be molecularly encapsulated in cyclodextrines, a sugar derivate. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder. The cyclodextrines can absorb an estimated 60 percent of their own weight in alcohol.Alcohol powder: Alcopops from a bag , Westdeutsche Zeitung, 28 October 2004 (German) A US patent has been registered for the process as early as 1974.Preparation of an Alcohol Containing Powder, General Foods Corporation March 31, 1972  See also  *Cryptophane  References  # Cram, D.

History It was a district of the former Portuguese East Africa. Its name was derived from a Swazi chief named Gaza, a contemporary of Shaka Zulu. It covered most of present-day Gaza and Inhambane provinces, and the southern portions of Manica and Sofala provinces. Refugees from various clans oppressed by Dingane (Shaka's successor) were welded into one tribe by Gaza's son Soshangane, his followers becoming known as Shangaan or Mashangane. A section of them was called Maviti or Landeens (i.e. couriers), a designation which persisted as a tribal name. Between 1833 and 1836 Soshangane made himself master of the country as far north as the Zambezi and captured the Portuguese posts at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane, Sofala and Sena, killing nearly all the inhabitants. The Portuguese reoccupied their posts, but held them with great difficulty, while in the interior Soshangane continued his conquests, depopulating large regions. Soshangane died about 1856, and his son Umzila, receiving some help from the Portuguese at Delagoa Bay in a struggle against a brother for the chieftain-ship, ceded to them the territory south of the Komati River. North of that river as far as the Zambezi, and inland to the continental plateau, Umzila established himself in independence, a position he maintained till his death (c .1884). His chief rival was a Goan named Manuel Ant√≥nio de Sousa, also known as Gouveia, who came to Africa about 1850. Having obtained possession of a crown estate (prazo) in the Gorongosa District, he ruled there as a feudal lord while acknowledging himself a Portuguese subject. Gouveia captured much of the country in the Zambezi valley from the Shangaan, and was appointed by the Portuguese captain-general of a large region. Exploration Probably the first European to penetrate any distance inland from the Sofala coast since the Portuguese gold-seekers of the 16th century was St Vincent Whitshed Erskine, who explored the region between the Limpopo and Pungwe (1868-1875). Portugal's hold on the coast had been more firmly established at the time of Umzila's death, and Gungunyana, his successor, was claimed as a vassal, while efforts were made to open up the interior. This led in 1890-1891 to collisions on the borderland of the plateau with the newly established British South Africa Company, and to the arrest by the company's agents of Gouveia, who was, however, freed and returned to Mozambique via Cape Town. The border between the British and Portuguese colonies was set by the Anglo- Portuguese Treaty of June 11 1891. An offer made by Gungunyana (1891) to come under British protection was not accepted. In 1892 Gouveia was killed in a war with a native chief. Gungunyana maintained his independence until 1895, when he was captured by a Portuguese force and exiled, first to Lisbon and afterwards to the Azores, where he died in 1906. With the capture of Gungunyana opposition to Portuguese rule largely ceased.

In addition to the GPS navigation system and general processing and control logic, COMAND includes components such as an address book, telephone, radio and in many cases a CD/DVD drive. It is connected to other (often separate) devices such as CD/DVD changers, sound system and surround sound amplifier, TV receiver and the optional Linguatronic voice control system via an optical fibre network. The first generations of COMAND used the D2B optical network standard whereas later models are based on MOST. A key feature of all COMAND systems is to provide deep integration between the various functions such as multimedia, navigation and telephony and to also allow multiple presentation and control facilities. An example of functional integration is where other audio sources can be muted when a phone call comes in or when navigation guidance is being given. It is also the case that the main audio system, speakers and microphone are used for all these functions instead of being logically and functionally separate. With regard to multiple presentation and control facilities, COMAND based vehicles allow steering wheel controls to be used alongside the main COMAND buttons and controller and COMAND related status information and instructions can be displayed in the instrument cluster in addition to the main COMAND display. On vehicles with a factory fitted Mercedes-Benz rear seat entertainment system, this also provides integration with the COMAND system, allowing for instance the rear seat displays to show content from the COMAND TV receiver or to play out the rear DVD audio over the car's surround sound system. On newer S-Class and CL-Class models such as the W221, the integration between COMAND and other vehicle functions is even more complete, including access via COMAND to the HVAC system, seat controls, etc. On these cars, in contrast to most other Mercedes-Benz vehicles, COMAND is part of the standard specification rather than an optional extra. COMAND was introduced first exclusively on the flagship S-Class and CL-Class models. Later, it became available on other Mercedes cars too. Model History =COMAND 2.5= An early model UK-spec (right hand drive) W220 S-Class, with the COMAND system screen and buttons on the center console. Somewhat confusingly, COMAND 2.5 (not to be confused with the much later COMAND-APS NTG2.5) actually refers to the first generation of COMAND systems, introduced on the W220. The \\"2.5\\" label seems to refer to the fact that the main COMAND unit for this first generation had a height of 2.5 DIN. This COMAND system had a cassette drive, a built-in CD drive for the navigation map discs, an FM/AM radio tuner, a 4-channel amplifier and external connectors to other systems. The European models used Tele Atlas map discs (CD). Towards the end of 1999, the system was upgraded to use the improved DX type navigation discs. COMAND 2.5 uses a D2B optical bus for connection to the external CD changer, the telephone system, the optional Bose surround sound system and the optional Linguatronic voice control system. The COMAND 2.5 unit was made by Bosch. COMAND 2.5 was an option on almost all models and denoted by Mercedes-Benz option code 352. =COMAND 2.0/COMAND 2.0 MOPF= The same COMAND 2.5 technology (with DX navigation maps) was next incorporated in a somewhat different form factor known as COMAND 2.0 (with \\"2.0\\" referring to the fact that this modified unit had a 2 DIN height), but with the cassette drive removed. These units were introduced on the W210 E-Class as rectangular units, later also in a more rounded form on amongst others the W203 and R230 models. From S-Class model year 2003, COMAND 2.5 was replaced by a widescreen version of COMAND 2.0 known as COMAND 2.0 MOPF. Note that COMAND 2.5, COMAND 2.0 and COMAND 2.0 MOPF are collectively referred to as \\"COMAND 2\\" systems (despite these being the first generation COMAND systems and, confusingly, despite the successor being known as COMAND-APS NTG1. =COMAND-APS NTG1= This new generation of COMAND systems was introduced on the model year 2002 W211 E-class and is in fact a complete redesign. MOST replaces the D2B optical ring network. The Mercedes-Benz option code became 527 (although, confusingly, COMAND 2.0 MOPF was also given this option code). These new MOST based systems were given the name COMAND-APS to distinguish them from the older D2B systems. The NTG1 system further distinguished itself from earlier models by having DVD based navigation instead of the CD based COMAND 2. This allowed to carry a whole region (such as Europe) on a single disc. NTG1 systems were also able to play MP3 CDs/DVDs. =COMAND-APS NTG2= The NTG2 evolution was a cheaper and more integrated version of COMAND-APS, having all core components in the single double DIN head unit instead of three separate components as had been the case with NTG1 (an audio gateway including the radio, amplifier, and MOST controller; a head unit with display; and a navigation processor) and thereby also simplifying the wiring. However, unlike NTG1 models, the NTG2 COMAND was unable to play MP3 discs. To use the navigation at the same time as listening to an audio disc requires the optional CD changer. This version of COMAND was used in various models such as the W203 C-Class and the W209 CLK and even the Vito/Viano. It was also fitted to the Smart Forfour. =COMAND-APS NTG3/NTG3.5= The rotary controller for COMAND-APS NTG3 together with the telephone keypad and quick access buttons. The button with the * symbol on the left is a programmable \\"favourite\\" button. A W221 S-Class showing the location of the COMMAND screen to the right of the speedometer Intended for the flagship W221 S-Class and the W216 CL-Class, COMAND NTG3 is a high-end system. Unlike for most other Mercedes-Benz cars, the S-Class and CL-Class from now on have COMAND as standard, allowing even better integration and for COMAND to operate even more vehicle functions. The navigation maps are stored on an internal hard disk instead of a DVD disc (although updates are installed from an update DVD). In addition to operating the audio, video, navigation and telecommunication systems, the NTG3 COMAND also controls a host of other features, such as the multi-contour and drive-dynamic seats, the HVAC system, the rear window shade, the vehicle locking, alarm and immobiliser, interior and exterior lighting functions, the optional ambient lighting feature, easy entry/exit settings, etc. The NTG3 system comes with a large, high resolution 8\\" TFT 16:9 widescreen colour COMAND display mounted higher and more directly into the driver's line of sight and with a separate, large rotary controller mounted on the centre console in between the front seats. This system was the first COMAND to support DAB radio on the MOST bus. NTG3 uses an in-dash DVD (and CD) changer and CompactFlash reader for MP3 music. A digital TV tuner and a Harman Kardon Logic7 stereo sound system with 14 speakers and a 600W 13-channel DSP amplifier can be optionally installed and controlled via COMAND. Where a factory fitted rear seat entertainment package is installed, this can use the NTG3 digital TV tuner and the surround sound system for playing out its audio over the speakers instead of headphones. As with previous models, Linguatronic voice command and control is available as an option too. The main controller for NTG3 is a large rotary dial with haptic feedback, although there are also buttons for quick access to commonly used functions and even a \\"favourite\\" button that can be assigned a function of choice. In addition, buttons on the steering wheel give access to various COMAND functions too and the large screen in the instrument cluster can display various COMAND related settings and information in addition to the main COMAND display. The model year 2009 W221 S-Class received an upgraded version, COMAND-APS 3.5 NTG. This includes improved Bluetooth support and split view (where the passenger watches a DVD while the driver sees other COMAND functions such as the navigation map on the same display). The new NTG3.5 system also features a new rights management provision to prevent the use of copied map update discs. This rights management function means it is not possible to upgrade NTG3 based vehicles to NTG3.5. =COMAND-APS NTG4= The NTG4 system is a reduced cost version of NTG3 technology. It was first introduced when the W204 C-Class launched in 2007 and features a 5\\" screen, much smaller than the higher resolution, bigger 8\\" screen on the flagship W221. It is the first version of COMAND that supports the Mercedes Media Interface. Like NTG3, it stores maps on a hard disk and has a card reader for MP3 music. It is also built with a somewhat larger 6\\" screen for other models such as the W212 and W218. Amongst other implementation differences are the fact that in the W204 version the screen electrically folds in and out whereas in other incarnations it is fixed. The Mercedes SLS has COMAND NTG4 too. Unlike the NTG3 system, NTG4 did not support 7 character UK postcodes when first released (only 5 character postcodes), but some NTG4 units (e.g. those in the MY2010 W212 and up) have a firmware upgrade available from Mercedes dealers which does add 7 character UK postcodes. NTG4 is also used in Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class (X204). =COMAND-APS NTG2.5= Command APS in a 200C 2011 model Somewhat confusingly, COMAND-APS NTG2.5 was introduced after NTG4, replacing COMAND in models previously fitted with NTG1 and NTG2 systems (apart from the W209 CLK as that model was replaced by the W207 E-Class coupe. The unit has a SD card reader in addition to the DVD drive. An optional DVD changer can replace the single drive. The Mercedes-Benz option code is 512 for the single drive unit and 527 for the unit with the optional DVD changer. Like NTG4 models, it supports the Media Interface. The unit also stores the navigation maps on an internal HDD which have some extra space for mp3 files. =COMAND-APS NTG4.5= In late 2011, Mercedes starting fitting the new COMAND-APS NTG4.5 to its W204 cars for Model Year 2012, and then to other models such as the W212, W207 and R172 SLK. It thus became the latest generation of COMAND for its non-flagship cars (i.e. cars other than the S-Class and CL-Class). It is also referred to as COMAND Online as it can use the mobile broadband connection on the telephone to connect to Mercedes-Benz Internet based services. It allows the running of various downloadable apps (such as Facebook) in the COMAND system. It uses a 7\\" colour display and has a SD-Card slot. The resolution, which is quite good at the time, is 800*480. Initially, the graphics were brown and black, and this system became known as GEN1. The colour scheme of the display were then changed to Grey/Black/Red at the same time as the graphics in the instrument cluster changed and this is known as GEN2 and coincided with the MY2013 update. Initially different firmware was used in GEN1 and GEN2, but later on the firmware for GEN1 and GEN2 was merged into 1 firmware release and the colour scheme became a run- time configuration item. Again, Media Interface is supported and maps are stored on a hard disk and restricted, as with NTG3.5, by a PIN based rights management protection feature. Like NTG3/3.5 it also has a separate rotary controller (although smaller than for NTG3/3.5 based vehicles). =COMAND-APS NTG4.7= COMAND-4.7 was installed in vehicles from June 2013 onwards, such as GLK350(2015). It now supports direct tethering of iPhones & Android phones to support the internet function which was not previously possible with these devices. It also features internet radio plus slight changes to the route guidance. The differences to NTG4.5 are new Mercedes Apps; CPU upgrading; 80G to 100G SATA; better Navigator figure performance, which enable a more fluent system as a whole. Supported file formats are: * Audio ** MP3 (supported bit rates: fixed and variable 32 kbit/s to 320 kbit/s, sampling rates of 8kHz to 48kHz) ** WMA (fixed 5 kbit/s to 384 kbit/s, sampling rates of 8kHz to 48kHz) ** CD-A ** AAC (Apple formats): .aac, .mp4, .m4a, and .m4b (copy protection files are not supported) * Video ** MPEG ** WMV ** M4V ** AVI =COMAND-APS NTG5.0= Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) COMAND Online NTG5.0 This is the last version to use the COMAND name and has been introduced in the 2013/2014 S class, 2014 GLA and C-class. It includes Mercedes Online Radio which is broadcast from Europe 24/7. The maps zoom in/out more smoothly and are enriched with graphics and functions. The core of the system is an Intel Atom (CPU) processor. There are three generations of NTG5, NTG5*1, NTG5*2 and NTG5.5. NTG5*1 has a keypad, whereas NTG5*2 / NTG5.5 does not. COMAND NTG5*1 has support for Apple Car Play and Android Auto (Early units did not have this support but it can be added). NTG5*2 is fitted in S, CL, C, GLC, AMG-GTS, X-Class and the new generation Vito. NTG5*1 is fitted to facelift A, B, CLA, GLA, W207-E, W212-E, CLS, GLE and GLS vehicles. NTG5*5 was fitted to the new W213-E class and is replacing NTG5*2 as vehicles are face-lifted. The NTG 5.0 plays the following file formats: Audio: * MP3 v1, 128 kbit/s, 44.1 kHz, Stereo (.mp3) * MP3 v1, 320 kbit/s, 44.1 kHz, Stereo (.mp3) * ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, iTunes AAC-LC (.m4a) * PCM, 16 bit, stereo 44100 Hz (.wav) Video: * MPEG sequence, v1, system multiplex (DVD PAL, MPEG2) (.mpg) * MPEG-4 AVC H264, AAC Audio (.mkv) * ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1 (.mp4) =Mercedes- Benz User Experience (MBUX)= MBUX in a Mercedes-Benz CLA The COMAND name is no longer in use and has been replaced by MBUX. The new multimedia system is installed in many Mercedes-Benz vehicles. A second-generation system, called \\"My MBUX\\", is being introduced to the new W223.

It was released on 8 September 2006 in the UK. Filmed in Wawa, Ontario, Snow Cake is a drama about the relationship between autistic Linda (Weaver), and a neurotypical British tourist Alex (Rickman) who has a change of heart after a fatal car accident involving himself and Linda's daughter Vivienne (Hampshire). Plot Eccentric teenager Vivienne Freeman hitches a ride from a reluctant recluse, visiting Englishman Alex Hughes. Just when they reach her home town of Wawa, she is killed by a transport truck ramming their vehicle, while Alex only gets a nosebleed. Everybody confirms that it was not Alex's fault. Alex visits Vivienne's mother, Linda, to deliver some gifts Vivienne had bought her and to provide support. She has been informed about her daughter's death a few hours before Alex's visit, but does not show any signs of grief. Linda is autistic and constantly behaves in unusual ways while showing that she fully understands what is happening around her. She has a cleanliness mania which involves her constantly making sure everything in her home is neat, and prevents her from touching garbage bags. Her problem is finding someone who will put the garbage outside to be collected (but only when the truck arrives), as this was always something done by her daughter. Linda insists that Alex stay a few days so that he can do it for her. He agrees and also arranges Vivienne's funeral. During his stay he begins a relationship with Linda's back fence neighbor, Maggie, who Linda mistakenly thinks is a prostitute. Wawa‚Äôs Chief of Police, Clyde, is jealous of Alex‚Äôs connection to Maggie, which he tries to sour by telling Maggie that Alex has just been released after serving time for killing a man. Maggie does not ask Alex about this, but instead waits until he brings the subject up himself. Alex reveals that he punched and accidentally killed the man (he fell and cracked his head) who caused his son's death. The man had been driving drunk and hit Alex‚Äôs 22-year-old son while his son was on his way to meet Alex for the first time ‚Äî Alex had only recently learned about his existence, the result of a brief affair. Alex, released from prison, has flown to Timmins and is driving to Winnipeg (he was not aware of the vast distance) to see his son‚Äôs mother. Linda dislikes Maggie to the point where she initially refuses her help. But after Alex leaves to continue his journey to Winnipeg, she allows Maggie to come into her home to take her garbage out. Cast * Alan Rickman as Alex * Sigourney Weaver as Linda * Carrie-Anne Moss as Maggie * Emily Hampshire as Vivienne * James Allodi as Clyde * Callum Keith Rennie as John Neil, driver of the killer truck * David Fox as Dirk, Linda‚Äôs father * Jayne Eastwood as Ellen, Linda‚Äôs mother * Julie Stewart as Florence, an over helpful (‚Äúbossy‚Äù) townsperson * Selina Cadell as Diane Wooton, a divorced townsperson Production  The screenwriter, Angela Pell, wrote the role of Alex Hughes with Rickman in mind. It was also Rickman who read the script and made sure Weaver (fellow Galaxy Quest costar) was contacted about the role of Linda. Both Rickman and Weaver were runners-up at the Seattle International Film Festival for the respective prizes of Best Actor and Best Actress. During the course of making the movie, Weaver researched the subject of autism and was coached by Ros Blackburn, a woman with the condition who is also an author and speaker about autism and Asperger's syndrome. Alan Rickman chose not to research the subject of autism in order to make his character have an impact/shock when facing Linda. Release The film was screened and discussed at Autism Cymru 2nd international conference in May 2006 as well as the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, among others. It was also the opening night screening for the Berlin Film Festival. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 6.09/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Sigourney Weaver gracefully undertakes a difficult role, while the rest of the cast lifts the histrionic plot into something worthwhile.\\" Awards & nominations The film was nominated in four categories at the 27th Genie Awards in 2007: * Best actress: Sigourney Weaver * Best supporting actress: Emily Hampshire * Best supporting actress: Carrie- Anne Moss (Won) * Cinematography: Steve Cosens References External links  2006 films 2006 drama films British drama films Canadian films English-language films Canadian independent films Canadian drama films Films set in Northern Ontario Films about autism Films directed by Marc Evans British independent films British films ","title":"Snow Cake"},{"id":"2953330","text":"The Vultee A-31 Vengeance was an American dive bomber of World War II, built by Vultee Aircraft. A modified version was designated A-35. The Vengeance was not used operationally by the United States, but was operated as a front-line aircraft by the British Royal Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the Indian Air Force in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. The A-31 remained in service with U.S. units until 1945, primarily in a target-tug role.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 69. Design and development Working on the Vengeance bomber at the Vultee plant in Nashville, Tennessee (1943) In 1940, Vultee Aircraft started the design of a single engined dive-bomber, the Vultee Model 72 (V-72) to meet the requirements of the French Arm√©e de l'Air. The V-72 was built with private funds and was intended for sale to foreign markets. The V-72 was a low-wing, single-engine monoplane with a closed cockpit and a crew of two. An air-cooled radial Wright Twin Cyclone GR-2600-A5B-5 engine rated at powered the V-72. It was armed with both fixed forward-firing and flexible-mounted machine guns in the rear cockpit. The aircraft also carried up to of bombs in an interior bomb bay and on external wing racks.Wegg 1990, p.163. The Vengeance was uniquely designed to dive vertically without lift from the wing pulling the aircraft off target. To this end, it had a 0¬∞ angle of incidence on the wing to better align the nose of the aircraft with the target during the dive. This resulted in the aircraft cruising in a nose-up attitude, giving a poor forward view for the pilot, particularly during landing. It had an unusual, \\"W\\"-shaped wing planform. This resulted from an error in calculating its centre of gravity. Moving the wing back by \\"sweeping\\" the centre section was a simpler fix than re-designing the wing root. This gives the impression of an inverted gull wing when seen from an angle, when in fact the wing has a more conventional dihedral on the outer wing panels. France placed an order for 300 V-72s, with deliveries intended to start in October 1940. The fall of France in June 1940 stopped these plans, but at the same time the British Purchasing Commission, impressed by the performance of the German Junkers Ju 87, was shopping for a dive bomber for the Royal Air Force, and as it was the only aircraft available, placed an order for 200 V-72s (named Vengeance by Vultee) on 3 July 1940, with orders for a further 100 being placed in December.Wegg 1990, pp.162‚Äì163. As Vultee's factory at Downey was already busy building BT-13 Valiant trainers, the aircraft were to be built at the Stinson factory at Nashville, and under license by Northrop at Hawthorne, California. The first prototype V-72 flew from Vultee's factory at Downey, California, on 30 March 1941. Additional aircraft were ordered for Britain in June 1941 under the Lend-Lease scheme, with those being given the US Army Air Corps designation A-31. After the U.S. entered the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a number of V-72 and A-31 aircraft were repossessed for use by the USAAF.Donald 1995, p.250. As the USAAF became interested in dive bombing, it decided to order production of an improved version of the Vengeance, designated the A-35, for both its own use and for supply to its allies under Lend-Lease. It was fitted with a more powerful Wright Twin Cyclone R-2600-19 engine and improved armament. As US Army test pilots disliked the poor pilot view resulting from the zero-incidence wing, that was \\"corrected\\" in the A-35, giving the plane a better attitude in cruise but lessening its accuracy as a dive bomber.Shores and Smith 1977, p.31.Vengeance! The Vultee Vengeance Dive Bomber by Peter C. Smith, Airlife Publishing, 1986 When production of the Vengeance was completed in 1944, a total of 1,931 aircraft had been made.Wegg 1990, p. 152. The majority were produced at the Vultee plant in Nashville, Tennessee. Indecision about which aircraft type should replace it in production at the Vultee plant led to several \\"make-work\\" contracts for Vengeance aircraft to prevent dispersion of the skilled workforce. That resulted in the overproduction of what was considered an obsolete aircraft. =Evaluation= Vultee assembly line in August, 1942 Operational experience with other dive bomber aircraft of the period, such as the Blackburn Skua, Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, Aichi D3A \\"Val\\", Douglas Dauntless, Breda Ba.65 and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver, indicated that the Vengeance would be vulnerable to enemy fighters. To be effective, all those aircraft required an environment of local air superiority and fighter escort. Fighter escort and lack of fighter opposition in the theatres in which it served, combined with its vertical dive capability, meant that the Vengeance suffered only light combat losses. Early experience with the aircraft showed that there were problems with engine cooling. In service, the RAF managed to solve those problems, but Free French aircraft that did not have these problems remedied were grounded, being declared uneconomical and unreliable to operate. The aircraft was described as being stable in flight and in a dive, with heavy elevator and rudder control, but with light aileron control. Forward visibility was considered poor due to the large radial engine. There were a number of fatal accidents with the Vengeance due to improper dive procedures, as well as a center of gravity problem when the aircraft was flown with the rear cockpit canopy open, but without a rear gunner. In combat, the type was considered rugged, reliable, stable, and generally well-behaved. Commonwealth forces operated the type from May 1942 to July 1944. Burma tended to be a low priority for Allied air planners, and forces in that theater got what was left over. Aircraft such as the Vickers Wellington and Hawker Hurricane spent their last days in Burma. The Vengeance saw considerable action attacking Japanese supply, communications and troop concentrations in Burma. Its service in that theater has been described as \\"...very effective.\\" Peter Smith, author of Jungle Dive Bombers at War, wrote that, \\"Their pilots had difficulty in getting them off the ground with a full load. At Newton Field they were using the full length of the 6,000 feet runway before becoming airborne. Kittyhawk aircraft could carry the same bomb load and in addition carry out ground-strafing\\". In contrast, many crew spoke well of the Vengeance. \\"I certainly didn't have that experience of the Vultee. I can recall no incidents of pilots having difficulty in taking off with full bomb loads, and the Kittyhawk could not carry the same bomb load even after their undercarriage had been strengthened. I remember the Vultee as a lovely aircraft to fly, an aircraft that was hard to stall and was fully aerobatic. You could do anything in them, rolls, loops, stall turns, and there was enough room in the cockpit to hold a ball. I used to like flying them, although a lot of blokes thought that they were too cumbersome.\\"James-Martin, Howard (Sgt Pilot) Australian War Memorial MSS1514 Operational history =UK and India= Worker at Vultee-Nashville makes final adjustments in the wheel well of an inner wing before the installation of the landing gear. (February 1942) By the time that Britain had received large numbers of Vengeances, its opinion on the usefulness of specialised dive bombers had changed. As the Battle of Britain and operations over North Africa had shown the dive bomber to be vulnerable to fighter attack, the Vengeance was rejected for use over Western Europe or the Mediterranean. It was decided to use the Vengeance in the Burma Theatre to carry out dive-bombing operations in close support of British and Indian troops in the jungles.Shores and Smith 1977, p.32. The first RAF squadrons (No. 82 and No. 110) received Vengeances in October 1942. The first dive bombing missions against Japanese forces were flown on 19 March 1943. A further two RAF squadrons in Burma received Vengeances, (No. 84 and No. 45), together with two squadrons of the Indian Air Force (IAF) (No. 7 and No. 8). Vengeances were heavily deployed in support of the second Arakan campaign of 1943/44, and defending against the Japanese attacks on Imphal and Kohima of April‚ÄìJuly 1944.Shores and Smith 1977, pp.34‚Äì36. Following the successful defeat of the Japanese attack, the RAF and IAF started to phase out the Vengeance in favour of more versatile fighter bombers and twin-engine light bombers, with the last Vengeance operations over Burma being carried out on 16 July 1944.Shores and Smith 1977, pp.36‚Äì37. After Burma service, a detachment from 110 Squadron RAF was sent to Takoradi in West Africa via the Middle East, a number of aircraft breaking down en route. Between September and December 1944, 11 Vultees took part in air-spraying trials against malarial mosquitoes, using under wing spray dispensers.Air Enthusiast #71 September‚ÄìOctober 1997 pp68-71 article by Neate, Don R. With a Vengeance! Fighting Malaria in West Africa, Vultee-style Although phased out of front line service with the RAF, Britain continued to receive large numbers of Vengeances, with bulk deliveries of Lend Lease aircraft (as opposed to those purchased directly by Britain) having only just started. Many of these surplus aircraft, including most Vengeance Mk IVs, were delivered to the UK and modified as target tugs, being used in that role both by the RAF and the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA).Shores and Smith 1977, p.37. In those roles, all armament was removed from the aircraft. =Australia= Australia placed an order for 400 Vengeances as an emergency measure following the outbreak of war in the Pacific, which was met by a mixture of Lend Lease and diversions from the original British orders. While the first Vengeance was delivered to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1942, the aircraft did not arrive in substantial numbers until April 1943. The RAAF's first Vengeance squadron, No. 12 Squadron flew its first operational mission against Selaru Island in the Dutch East Indies. Squadrons equipped with the Vengeance included Nos. 12, 21, 23, 24 and 25 Squadrons. Of these, all but 25 Squadron served briefly in the New Guinea campaign.Shores and Smith 1977. pp.37‚Äì38. Australian Vengeances flew their last operational sorties on 8 March 1944, as they were considered less efficient than fighter bombers, having a short range and requiring a long runway, and were withdrawn to allow more effective fighter bombers to move into the forward area.Shores and Smith 1977, pp.38‚Äì39. The Vengeance squadrons were re-equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers.Dennis et al 2008, p. 549. The view of the Vengeance's limitations is disputed by Peter Smith in Jungle Dive Bombers at War, \\"The precision and skill of the dive- bombing method...and its clear superiority over most other means of air attack when it came to destroying small and well-hidden targets in difficult country, was proven over and over again in the Asian jungle campaigns. Yet the men who achieved these excellent results, for such economy of effort and comparatively small loss, were but a handful of pilots who have been forgotten in the overwhelming mass of the heavy-and medium bomber fleets that were pounding both Europe and Asia by 1945. This capacity was exemplified in the raid by RAAF Nos. 21 and 23 Squadrons on Hansay Bay. Smith wrote, \\"...the jungle-clad hills and islands of forgotten or unknown lands would become the major stage for the ultimate expression of the dive-bombers' skill.\\" While the RAAF still had 58 Vengeances on order in March 1944, this order was cancelled and the aircraft were never delivered. Small numbers of Vengeances remained in service with support and trials units until 1946. =Brazil= Thirty-three V-72s and A-35s were supplied to Brazil from 1943, carrying out a few anti-submarine patrols. They were withdrawn by April 1948.Wegg 1990, p.164. =Free French= The Free French Air Force received 67 A-35As and -Bs in 1943, being used to equip three bomb groups in North Africa. The French, however, keen to get the aircraft operational as soon as possible did not incorporate improvements found necessary by Britain and Australia, so their aircraft proved to be unreliable and had extremely high oil consumption. As such, they were restricted to training operations, being finally withdrawn in September 1944.Pelletier 2007, pp.75‚Äì79. =United States= A-35B in flight. This is a target tug conversion with all armament removed. While the U.S. received 243 V-72s and A31s diverted from the RAF orders together with large numbers of A-35s specifically built for it, these saw no combat, being used as initial equipment for light bomber squadrons that re-equipped with twin-engine aircraft before deploying overseas, and as trainers or target tugs.Shores and Smith 1977, p.40. From April 1944, a number of Vengeance Mk IV series Is were made available to the 8th Air Force and assigned to target-towing flights and Combat Crew Replacement Center stations. All armament was removed and a light cable winch fitted in the rear fuselage for sleeve towing. Some of these aircraft continued to be flown with British national markings and serial numbers. By late June 1944, there were seven A-35Bs at RAF Cluntoe, seven at Greencastle, ten at RAF Sutton Bridge and six at RAF East Wretham. When the CCRCs were dissolved in the autumn, the Vengeances were transferred to combat groups, with most fighter and several bomber groups having one on hand at some time during 1945. A-35Bs did not show a high state of serviceability by this time and were generally considered troublesome to maintain. They were also designated RA-35B (R for Restricted) by this time.Freeman 1984, p.208.

He played for Iraklis in the Greek Alpha Ethniki and Pakhtakor in the Soviet Supreme League. He also played for Greece and the Soviet Union side. Hatzipanagis has been described as \\"the Greek Maradona\\". Career =Pakhtakor= Hatzipanagis was born in 1954 in Tashkent (capital city of Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic), to Greek political refugees. He was scouted by Pakhtakor. They wanted to invest in this raw, yet refined player, but the law was strict: he had to apply for Soviet citizenship to be eligible for the Soviet top flight. Hatzipanagis made his professional debut at the age of 17. During his time there, he made ninety six appearances and scored twenty two goals, and gained promotion from the Soviet First League to the Soviet Supreme League in 1972. =Iraklis= With the Reign of the Colonels finally over a year ago, Hatzipanagis signed for the Thessaloniki club Iraklis, and such was his reputation that he filled the stadium for his first match in December 1975. The Iraklis fans would be one of the reasons this exceptional talent never joined another team, the other being his contract with Iraklis was heavily favoured towards the club making it almost impossible for him to leave in spite of his desire to test himself in a better league. Despite interest from Lazio, Arsenal, Porto and Stuttgart, the club's board feared the consequences of selling the crowd favourite, and Hatzipanagis stayed at Iraklis until 1990. His farewell appearance for the club came in a UEFA Cup first round match against Valencia on 19 September, in a 0‚Äì0 draw. In the second leg on 3 October, the team lost 2‚Äì0 at the Mestalla Stadium, with Hatzipanagis an unused substitute. International career =Soviet Union= He was called up to the Soviet Union under-19 squad. He was promoted to the senior squad and represented the Soviet Union Olympic team in the 1976 qualifying tournament. His debut was made in a 3‚Äì0 home win against Yugoslavia. He even managed to score his team's last goal in his debut. Hatzipanagis featured in three more matches (two matches against Iceland and one against Norway). However, despite being told by national coach Konstantin Beskov that his ability was \\"way above Greece's level\\", he turned his back on the Soviet league ‚Äì where as a left-sided attacker he was considered second only to the great Oleh Blokhin ‚Äì to move to the land of his fathers. =Greece= Another highlight for Hatzipanagis was his first appearance for the Greek national side, in a friendly match against Poland at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium in May 1976. The Athens crowd were bewitched by the long- haired wonder, who seemed to do whatever he wanted with the ball. Afterwards, Hatzipanagis was notified that he was ineligible for international duty, having played for the USSR. His second appearance with the national team came many years after his retirement: he played for 20 minutes in the friendly match against Ghana on 14 December 1999 - where he was honored by the Hellenic Football Federation for his overall contribution to the game of football. Legacy As an attacking midfielder with Iraklis, he packed in the crowds at Thessaloniki's Kaftanzoglio Stadium, where his performances earned him the moniker of 'the footballing Nureyev'. However, the reason he gave for his fancy footwork was simple enough. \\"When I see defenders in front of me, I want to dribble around every one of them,\\" he once said. Further recognition did come on 22 June 1984, when he was invited to join a World XI featuring other legends such as Franz Beckenbauer, Mario Kempes, Kevin Keegan, Dominique Rocheteau, Peter Shilton, Jean-Marie Pfaff, Hugo Sanchez, Ruud Krol, Felix Magath and his countryman Thomas Mavros for a match against New York Cosmos in New Jersey. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's 50th anniversary, he was selected as Greece's Golden Player of the past 50 years by the Hellenic Football Federation. Now aged 50, Hatzipanagis said: \\"It is very touching to see that you are not forgotten, that your contribution is appreciated even after so many years.\\" He added: \\"I regret not having been able to wear the Greek national jersey more than once. And I regret not having made a career abroad. I would have liked to play in a better league, to have enjoyed football at that level. If I could turn back the clock, I would do some things differently.\\" Honours =Club= Pakhtakor *Soviet First League **Winner (1): 1972 Iraklis *Greek Cup **Winner (1): 1975‚Äì76 **Runner up (2): 1979‚Äì80, 1986‚Äì87 *Balkans Cup **Winner (1): 1985 =Individual= *Soviet Masters of Sports award **Master of Sports: 1974 *UEFA Jubilee Awards **Greece's Golden Player: 1954‚Äì2003 *Goals from direct corner kicks: 7, in the 1982-83 season References Notes External links * 1954 births Living people UEFA Golden Players Greek footballers Greece international footballers Soviet First League players Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. players Pakhtakor Tashkent FK players Olympic footballers of the Soviet Union Soviet footballers Uzbekistani footballers Sportspeople from Tashkent Uzbekistani people of Greek descent Soviet people of Greek descent Super League Greece players Association football midfielders ","title":"Vasilis Hatzipanagis"},{"id":"2953332","text":"Saxon is the debut studio album by the English heavy metal band Saxon, released in 1979.

In an incompressible flow, stagnation pressure is equal to the sum of the free- stream static pressure and the free-stream dynamic pressure.Stagnation Pressure at Eric Weisstein's World of Physics (Wolfram Research) Stagnation pressure is sometimes referred to as pitot pressure because it is measured using a pitot tube. Magnitude The magnitude of stagnation pressure can be derived from Bernoulli EquationEquation 4, Bernoulli Equation - The Engineering Toolbox For incompressible flow and no height changes. For any two points 1 and 2: :P_1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho v_2^2 The two points of interest are 1) in the freestream flow at relative speed v where the pressure is called the \\"static\\" pressure, (for example well away from an airplane moving at speed v); and 2) at a \\"stagnation\\" point where the fluid is at rest with respect to the measuring apparatus (for example at the end of a pitot tube in an airplane). Then :P_\\\\text{static} + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho v^2 = P_\\\\text{stagnation} + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho (0)^2 orHoughton, E.L and Carpenter P.W.

In our airplane example, the stagnation pressure would be atmospheric pressure plus the dynamic pressure. In compressible flow however, the fluid density is higher at the stagnation point than at the static point. Therefore, \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho v^2 can't be used for the dynamic pressure. For many purposes in compressible flow, the stagnation enthalpy or stagnation temperature plays a role similar to the stagnation pressure in incompressible flow. Clancy, L.J.

Horsehay used to have four pubs, The Station Inn, The Forester Arms, the All Labour In Vain and the Travellers Joy, however The Station Inn closed down in 2012, and the All Labour In Vain closed in 2014. It also has a Methodist Chapel, a village hall, a post office, and a golf course complete with restaurant. History Originally Horsehay was nothing more than a farm, until the 1750s when Abraham Darby II built a blast furnace next to what is now known as Horsehay Pool. The Coalbrookdale Company further developed the area, constructing brickworks and later a pottery in 1838. Coalbrookdale specialised in the smaller and more decorative ironwork pieces, whereas Horsehay produced many larger scale products, including the railway bridge in nearby Shifnal. As the iron trade in the area began to slump, in 1857 the railway arrived. Horsehay is still home to the Telford Steam Railway to this day. A.B. Cranes bought the site previously occupied by the ironworks to manufacture some of the largest cranes in Europe until it closed down in 1983. The site has been transformed into both a small factory estate and a housing estate. The houses which were kept for the ironworks employees were clustered around Horsehay Pool in Spring Village, and they are still lived in today. =Horsehay Works= Horsehay works has a history of more than 230 years on the same site. Formed in 1755 by Abraham Darby II it contributed to the birth of the industrial revolution through large scale production of iron. Later it produced pre-fabricated bridges for export all over the world. It was a major employer in the area until the mid-1980s when it closed under the ownership of Adamson Alliance. The following is based on an article \\"Horsehay Works (1755‚Äì1986) - a history of a once dominating company\\" by J. L. Woolley (local artist and former employee of Horsehay Works): Abraham Darby I, a Quaker, succeeded in smelting iron with coke as a fuel suitable for forges in 1709. The Coalbrookdale Company needed additional furnaces and Horsehay (an easy walk to the north) provided a sufficient water supply and land for lease. In addition, Dawley (adjacent to the east) provided mines. The furnace at Horsehay came into blast successfully on 5 May 1755. For this venture, Darby II enlisted the financial help of Thomas Goldney III (the main shareholder of the Coalbrookdale Company). The new furnace ushered in a period of great activity when the East Shropshire Coalfield, for a time, became the area of greatest production of iron then known. Such was the importance of the furnace that many people including dignitaries visited it. A railway from Horsehay to the nearby Severn wharves was built and the first waggon of 'pigs' (iron) was sent down Jiggers bank through Coalbrookdale and on to the wharves almost within sight of the Ironbridge (built later by Abraham Darby III, completed in 1779). Telford Horsehay Steam Trust Horsehay is home to the Telford Steam Railway. It holds various events throughout the year, including as of 2017, a 1940s weekend and a Polar Express experience at Christmas. Famous residents William Ball Horsehay was the birthplace of novelist Edith Pargeter, who wrote the popular Brother Cadfael novels under the pen name \\"Ellis Peters\\". Country singer/songwriter, Raymond Froggatt still lives and has his studio in the village. Television personality Paul Hendy used to live in one of the cottages round Horsehay Pool. Back in the early 19th century, a giant of a man called William Ball worked in the Horsehay Iron Works. At the time, he was the heaviest man in England, tipping the scales at 36 Stones. Following an eye injury, he finished work at the Iron Works and toured the country under the name of \\"John Bull\\". See also *Listed buildings in Dawley Hamlets References *Heath, P. Horsehay.

The Georgians, led by general Giorgi Saakadze, annihilated an Iranian detachment of Shah-Abbas I. In spring 1625, in order to avoid a forthcoming revolt, Shah-Abbas I sent his troops into Georgia under the orders of Qarachaqay Khan. He attempted to carry out the policy of wholesale massacre and deportation in Kartli. Apparently, the Shah did not fully trust Giorgi as he took his son Paata hostage, after appointing Giorgi the adviser to the Persian general. By the side of Giorgi in the army of the enemy, there was another son of his, Avtandil. Upon Giorgi's advice, Qarachaqay Khan dispatched most of his troops to different parts of Javakheti, caused them disperse and made them easier to defeat. The Georgians owe their success to the preparations carried out by commander-in-chief Saakadze. According to the plans of the leaders of the revolt, the Georgians were to assault the enemy camp earlier than planned; Saakadze and his entourage were to slaughter the commanders of the Persian army. At dawn on 25 March, Annunciation, the joint Kartlian and Kakhetian troops approached the enemy's camp. Hearing the noise, the guards gave alarm. All Persian commanders gathered in Qarachaqay Khan's tent and also summoned Giorgi. Giorgi killed Qarachaqay Khan with help of his son, while Avtandil took the life of Qarachaqay's son. It did not take long for Giorgi and his entourage to slaughter the stunned Persian commanders. The rest of the Georgians under their second commander Zurab Eristavi, encroached upon the confused enemy who were left without any guidance at that time. After a fierce and bloody massacre throughout the evening, the Georgians won a crushing victory. The data about the Martqopi battle are given in ‚Äúthe Life of Kartli‚Äù and by a Turkish chronicler Mustafa Naima of the 17th century. In the aftermath of the battle, the Georgians took Tbilisi and drove the Persians out of other regions, while half of the Shah's army which did not take part in the battle, still remained combat effective.Battles at Martqopi and Marabda References External links *The History of Georgia Martqopi Martqopi 1625 in Europe Martqopi 17th century in Georgia (country) 17th century in Iran ","title":"Battle of Martqopi"},{"id":"2953349","text":"CHIN may refer to: * Canadian Heritage Information Network, a government agency in Canada that promotes Canadian culture and heritage on the Internet * CHIN Radio/TV International, a media company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada * CHIN (AM), a radio station (1540 AM) licensed to Toronto, Ontario, Canada * CHIN-FM, a radio station (100.7 FM) licensed to Toronto, Ontario, Canada See also * Chin (disambiguation) These meanings are distinct from the word chin.

This conflict was an immediate consequence of the Treaty of Amasya signed between the Ottoman and Safavid empires in 1555. This peace deal left a fragmentized Kingdom of Georgia divided into spheres of influence. The kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, and the eastern part of the principality of Samtskhe, were allotted to the Safavids which had already garrisoned the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. Luarsab I, the indomitable king of Kartli, refused to recognize the terms of the Amasya treaty and continued to worry Tbilisi. This provoked another Iranian expedition, the fourth in Luarsab's reign. The Safavid forces, the Qizilbash, placed by Shah Tahmasp I under the command of ShƒÅhverdƒ´ KhƒÅn ZiyƒÅdoghl≈´ QƒÅjƒÅr, beylerbey of Karabakh, crossed into Kartli in 1556 or 1558.

He helped develop the concept of the matching function (explaining the flows from unemployment to employment at a given moment of time), and pioneered the empirical work on its estimation. Pissarides has also done research on structural change and growth. Pissarides' most influential paper is arguably \\"Job Creation and Job Destruction in the Theory of Unemployment\\" (with Dale Mortensen), published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1994. This paper built on the previous individual contributions that both authors had made in the previous two decades. The Mortensen‚ÄìPissarides model that resulted from this paper has been exceptionally influential in modern macroeconomics. In one or another of its extensions or variations, today it is part of the core of most graduate economics curricula throughout the world. Pissarides' book Equilibrium Unemployment Theory, a standard reference in the literature of the macroeconomics of unemployment, is now in its second edition, and was revised after Pissarides' joint work with Mortensen, resulting in the analysis of both endogenous job creation and destruction.

He was a director of the National Bureau of Standards during the Great Depression and chairman of the Uranium Committee before America entered the Second World War. The Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University is named in his honor.  Life and work  Briggs was born on a farm in Assyria, Michigan, near Battle Creek, Michigan. He was the eldest of two brothers in a family that descended from Clement Briggs, who arrived in America in 1621 on the Fortune, the first ship to follow the Mayflower. He grew up in an outdoor life with duties to attend such as would be found on an active farm in the late 19th century. He went to the Briggs School built by his grandfather and later was a teacher there. Briggs entered Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) in East Lansing, Michigan, entering by examination at age 15. Michigan State was a Land Grant college, so courses were taught in agriculture and mechanical arts. He majored in agriculture, but by graduation time in 1893 his interests had moved on to mechanical engineering and physics. He next entered the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, completing a master's degree in physics in 1895. From there he entered Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and began work on his PhD. In 1896 Briggs married Katharine Cook whom he met as an undergraduate at Michigan Agricultural College. Lyman and Katharine Cook Briggs had two children, a boy, Albert (known as \\"Bertie\\") and a girl, Isabel. Albert died in infancy, and Isabel would eventually marry Clarence Myers and go on to generate the Myers‚ÄìBriggs Type Indicator with her mother (). In 1896 he also joined the US Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. While in Washington, he also continued his research at Johns Hopkins under Henry Augustus Rowland. Although he spent time working with the newly discovered Roentgen Rays, he ultimately graduated in 1903 with a Ph.D. in agriculture with a dissertation On the absorption of water vapor and of certain salts in aqueous solution by quartz. He was also elected to the Cosmos Club the same year. =US Department of Agriculture= In Briggs' first professional position he was put in charge of the Physics Laboratory (later the Bureau of Soils) of the US Department of Agriculture. He was one of a new breed of multi-disciplinary scientists studying the biology and ecology of plant life. His research work was concentrated on water retention of soils and he was a founder of the science of soil physics. In 1906 he devised a soil classification technique called the moisture equivalent based on centrifuging, which is now thought of as the first Pedotransfer function. In the same year he also organized a biophysical laboratory that later became the Bureau of Plant Industry. Briggs worked with Homer Leroy Shantz on the effect of environment on the water uptake by plants, and was an early contributor to ecology. =World War I= Briggs was detailed by an Executive Order to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Standards in 1917 due to mobilization pressures of World War I. There he developed an artificial horizon device for naval vessels with John Hayford which established a stable zenith independent of the roll of the vessel for the aiming of naval guns. This allowed for the roll of the ship to be observed, so that the firing of the guns could be timed with the roll of the ship. The device was so successful it found its way into the control rooms of most naval vessels. A confidential report called the Hayford‚ÄìBriggs report was given to the Navy, but never published. =National Bureau of Standards (1917‚Äì1945)= Briggs (left) received the Magellanic Premium together with Paul R. Heyl in 1922 In 1920 Briggs officially left the Department of Agriculture and joined the National Bureau of Standards, where he was chief of the Engineering Physics Division (later the Mechanics and Sound Division). He appointed Hugh L. Dryden to head the Aerodynamics Physics Section, and together they pioneered research in the aerodynamics of airfoils moving near the speed of sound in an airstream. This work had significant application in developing blade forms for aircraft propellers. He also retained an interest in navigational devices, and with Paul R. Heyl invented the Heyl‚ÄìBriggs earth inductor compass. The compass used a spinning electric coil subjected to the magnetic field of the Earth to determine the bearing of an airplane in relation to the Earth's magnetic field. For this invention, they received the Magellan Medal of the American Philosophical Society in 1922. This type of compass was used by Admiral Byrd in his flight to the North Pole and by Charles Lindbergh on his 1927 trans-Atlantic flight. In 1926 Briggs was appointed assistant director for research and testing by National Bureau of Standards Director George Kimball Burgess. On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess as director of the National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name \\"a good Democrat\\" as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, \\"I haven't the slightest idea whether Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all I know is that he is the best qualified man for the job.\\" Briggs took over the Bureau during difficult times. It was the height of the depression and his first task was to reduce costs 50%. He managed to save the jobs of about 2/3 of the career employees by putting many on part-time employment and transferring others to the American Standards Association while they continued their work at the bureau. He emphasized doing work with direct economic impact and got money from the Works Progress Administration to hire unemployed mathematicians to develop math tables. Due to Briggs outstanding persuasive powers, he managed to get Congress to increase its appropriation for the Bureau in 1935, and many of the employees that were let go were re-hired. =Uranium Committee (1939‚Äì1941)= S-1 Executive Committee at the Bohemian Grove, September 13, 1942. From left to right are Harold C. Urey, Ernest O. Lawrence, James B. Conant, Lyman J. Briggs, E. V. Murphree and Arthur Compton In 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt called on Briggs, by then aged 65, to head the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the fission of uranium, as a result of the Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter. Even though Roosevelt had sanctioned a project, progress was slow and was not directed exclusively towards military applications. Eugene Wigner said that \\"We often felt we were swimming in syrup\\". Boris Pregel said \\"It is wonder that after so many blunders and mistakes anything was accomplished at all\\". Le√≥ Szil√°rd believed that the project was delayed for a least a year by the short-sightedness and sluggishness of the authorities. At the time Briggs was not well and was due to undergo a serious operation. He was unable to take the energetic action that was often needed. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom German refugees Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls under professor Marcus Oliphant made a breakthrough, indicating that it would be possible to make a bomb from purified U-235. From June 1940, copies of British progress reports were sent to Briggs via a British contact in Washington, Ralph H. Fowler. In March 1941 a British committee of Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning scientists, called the MAUD Committee, concluded that an atomic bomb was \\"not only feasible, it was inevitable\\". They also pointed out that a large part of a laboratory in Berlin had been devoted to nuclear research. A copy of the MAUD Committee's interim report was sent to the Briggs in the USA because Britain lacked the resources to undertake such a large and urgent program on its own. Britain also wished to move its key research facilities to safety across the Atlantic. The MAUD Committee issued another report giving technical details on the design and costs on 15 July 1941. Britain was at war and felt an atomic bomb should have the highest priority, especially because the Germans might soon have one; but the US was not at war at that time and many Americans did not want to get involved. One of the members of the MAUD Committee, Marcus Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941 in an unheated bomber to find out why the United States was ignoring the MAUD Committee's findings. Oliphant said that: \\"The minutes and reports had been sent to Lyman Briggs, who was the Director of the Uranium Committee, and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment. I called on Briggs in Washington, only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee. I was amazed and distressed.\\" Oliphant then met the whole Uranium Committee. Samuel K. Allison was a new committee member, a talented experimentalist and a prot√©g√© of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. \\"Oliphant came to a meeting\\", Allison recalls, \\"and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us.\\" Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited other physicists to galvanise the USA into action. As a result, in December 1941 Vannevar Bush, director of the powerful Office of Scientific Research and Development, undertook to launch a full-scale effort to develop atomic bombs. As the scale of the project became clearer, it came under direct military control as the Manhattan Project. =World War II= Briggs sought new business for the Bureau. In 1939 he sent Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper a list of services the Bureau could provide in the event of armed conflict in Europe. By 1942 90% of the Bureau's activities were classified work for the war effort. Some of the Bureau's activities were the non-rotating proximity fuze, guided missile developments (see the Bat), establishment of a Radio Propagation Laboratory, critical materials research on optical glass which Germany had previously supplied, on quartz and synthetic rubber and measurement and calibration services. Briggs changed the Bureau's culture from one of open access to one of secrecy. Briggs retired from the Bureau in 1945, at the age of 72. He was appointed director emeritus of NBS after working for 49 years in federal government. Bureau employees erected a bronze sundial in his honor through their Employees Welfare Association. At his request the names of the first three directors of Bureau are cast onto the rim of the instrument: Samuel Wesley Stratton, George Kimball Burgess, and Lyman James Briggs. In 1948 Briggs received the Medal of Merit from US President Harry Truman for his distinguished work in connection with World War II. At the request of Secretary of Commerce Henry A. Wallace, he wrote a 180-page account on NBS war research that was published in 1949. =Later life= In his retirement Briggs returned to research, establishing a laboratory for studying fluids under negative pressure at the National Bureau of Standards. This topic was directly related to his earlier research in the water uptake of plants. In one famous experiment he measured the negative pressure (or tension) that would break a column of water held in a capillary tube by capillary action. It turned out that at room temperature the maximum attainable tension in water was 250 bar and in mercury nearly 500 bar. This finding was published in several papers between (1950‚Äì1953), and the 1950 paper remains a classic and is still regularly cited in the literature on metastable water. Briggs' love for baseball triggered another piece of research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls led Briggs to test them, and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by addressing the issue of whether or not a pitched baseball could curve out of the plane of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the Washington Senators baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the trajectory and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (see curveball). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the twists in the tape. This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research results. Another of Briggs many interests was the National Geographic Society and in 1934 he chaired the Society's Committee on Research and Exploration. During this time he instrumented two stratospheric balloon flights, the second of which broke the existing record for altitude in 1936. During retirement he became more active in the Society, and led an expedition to study the solar eclipse in Brazil in 1947. Briggs often wrote articles for the National Geographic Magazine. Briggs died March 25, 1963, aged 88, after a diverse life of scientific exploration and service. He is remembered for his range of interests. Briggs was almost universally liked, and had a reputation for levelheadedness and serenity. Edward U. Condon, Briggs' successor at the Bureau said: \\"Briggs should always be remembered as one of the great figures in Washington during the first half of the century, when the Federal Government was slowly and stumblingly groping towards a realization of the important role science must play in the full future development of human society.\\" In 2007, Michigan State University honored the Lyman Briggs school, named for Briggs, by allowing it to become the Lyman Briggs College.

G. Ballard.  Plot summary  The main character of the novel is the World Health Organization doctor John Mallory who, six months after his arrival in Central Africa, finds that intense guerrilla activity has left him without patients. He devotes himself, instead, to the task of bringing water to the region, with dreams of setting the Sahara in flower. When he accidentally manages to achieve his task by creating a river, he becomes prey of an increasingly delirious spiral of fantasies, starting to identify himself with the new river that he has dubbed \\"Mallory\\". Obsessed, he decides to go up the river in order to \\"kill\\" its source, together with a teenaged African girl, whom he considers a sort of spirit of the waters, and other characters including a half-blind British documentary filmmaker and two ruthless local chieftains trying to take advantage of the new prosperity brought by the water.

Life Born 1030,George Andrews Moriarty, The Plantagenet Ancestry of King Edward III and Queen Philippa (Mormon Pioneer Genealogy Society, Salt Lake City, UT, 1985), p. 13 Adelaide was an illegitimate daughter of the Norman duke Robert the Magnificent. Robert's likewise illegitimate son and successor, William the Conqueror, was Adelaide's brother or half-brother.The question of who her mother was remains unsettled. Elisabeth Van Houts ['Les femmes dans l'histoire du duch√© de Normandie', Tabularia ¬´ √âtudes ¬ª, n¬∞ 2, 2002, (10 July 2002), p. 23, n. 22] makes the argument that Robert of Torigny in the GND II, p. 272 (one of three mentions in this volume of her being William's sister) calls her in this instance William's 'uterine' sister' (soror uterina) and is of the opinion this is a mistake similar to one he made regarding Richard II, Duke of Normandy and his paternal half-brother William, Count of Eu (calling them 'uterine' brothers). Based on this she concludes Adelaide was a daughter of Duke Robert by a different concubine. Kathleen Thompson [\\"Being the Ducal Sister: The Role of Adelaide of Aumale\\", Normandy and Its Neighbors, Brepols, (2011) p. 63] cites the same passage in GND as did Elisabeth Van Houts, specifically GND II, 270-2, but gives a different opinion. She noted that Robert de Torigni stated here she was the uterine sister of Duke William \\"so we might perhaps conclude that she shared both mother and father with the Conqueror.\\" But as Torigni wrote a century after Adelaide's birth and in that same sentence in the GND made a genealogical error, she concludes that the identity of Adelaide's mother remains an open question. Adelaide's first marriage to Enguerrand II, Count of Ponthieu potentially gave William a powerful ally in upper Normandy.Kathleen Thompson, 'Being the Ducal Sister: The Role of Adelaide of Aumale', Normandy and its Neighbours 900‚Äì1250; Essays for David Bates, ed.

It came into the family by way of Enguerrand's mother, the heiress of Aumale. It was settled on Adelaide of Normandy as a countship by her brother William the Conqueror, but at what exact time isn't known. Adelaide was the first countess followed by her son Stephen of Aumale as the second holder but first count. See Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, Vol. I, p. 350. As a dowager Adelaide began a semi-religious retirement and became involved with the church at Auchy presenting them with a number of gifts. In 1060 she was called upon again to form another marital alliance, this time to a younger man Odo, Count of Champagne.Kathleen Thompson, 'Being the Ducal Sister: The Role of Adelaide of Aumale', Normandy and its Neighbours 900‚Äì1250; Essays for David Bates, ed.

Gameplay The game features 11 different fighters, each with different weapons and abilities. The player may freely destroy the environment, and use destroyed objects as weapons against their opponents. The characters each have alternate costumes, which, depending on which the player chooses, may change their default weapon. However, it does not affect the weapon's damage capabilities or uses. The game plays much like Power Stone with its arena-style gameplay. Release The GameCube version was originally planned for a U.S. release in late 2002 and in Europe in 2004, but was canceled while it was released in Japan in 2003. A scaled-down port of Barbarian was originally planned for release on the Game Boy Advance, but was later canceled. Reception The game received \\"mixed reviews\\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Many video game websites and publications gave earlier reviews and average scores on the GameCube and Xbox versions in late 2002, months before the release dates for both of those versions were canceled in the U.S. due to mediocre reception for the PS2 version.

The invading Khwarazmid Empire was led by Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, its last Sultan, who was driven from his realm by the Mongol Empire and was trying to recapture lost territories. The battle ended with a Khwarezmid victory and is marked as a disastrous event in Georgian history due to betrayal. As a result, the royal court of Georgian Queen Rusudan (1223‚Äì1245) moved to Kutaisi and the country was exposed to subsequent looting during the Mongol invasion. Prelude Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu sent an abasement letter to Queen Rusudan demanding subordination of Georgia under his rule. At the same time, he assembled a huge military force, asking for troops from his allies and nobles across the empire. The purpose was to completely crush the Kingdom of Georgia and take all its dominions successfully ceding its existence. The Georgian court and leadership had notes and reports about a possible intervention but did not consider it necessary to take measures since that threat was not taken seriously. Instead, the nobility replied by sending a letter that reminded Jalal ad-Din of his crushing defeat against the Mongols, while having no idea how strong his empire already was by then. In 1225, a large Khwarezmid army crossed the Georgian border and soon both parties met on the battlefield.Great Battles of Georgia By Jaba Samushia; elf, pp. 71‚Äì72 Strength Under the command of Queen Rusudan, messengers were sent out to all regions of the Kingdom of Georgia in order to gather troops. During that period the kingdom had the potential to raise around 100,000 men in total including mercenaries. However the Georgians had reserved some forces for security reasons, thus leaving around 60‚Äì70,000 men for battle. The strength of the invading army far exceeded that of Rusudan's forces. According to the unknown Georgian chronicler named \\"jamtaaghtsereli\\", the army of Jalal ad-din was 140,000 men strong. Armenian sources say that the Muslim coalition deployed up to 200,000 men.Merab Vachnadze, Vakhtang Guruli, Mikheil Bakhtadze, History of Georgia; Artanuji 2004, page 112. Disposal A Georgian vanguard of around 17‚Äì18,000 men led by the Toreli brothers - Shalva Akhaltiskheli and Ivane Akhaltsikheli rushed towards the Khwarazmid forces to secure areal dominance. While the Khwarazmians were disposed on lower ground and flat lands, the Georgian who had arrived earlier were deployed wisely on top of surrounding plateaus and established a strategic advantage for the arriving main army. General Mkhargrdzeli with his more than 50,000 warriors arrived in time and initially kept himself in the background being expected by the other commanders to react on any attack against his vanguard while remaining unnoticed by the enemy. Battle The battle began with Jalal ad- Dins left wing attacking the Georgian vanguard and it did not take long for his main forces to be ordered into fight. By that time, Shalva Toreli- Akhaltiskheli and Ivane Toreli-Akhaltsikheli had already sent several messengers to the Georgian commander Ivane Mkhargrdzeli asking him to strike the Khwarezmid rear as the vanguard was able to stabilize the front lines. Despite the crucial advantage of the terrain, relief for the vanguard became critically necessary. Mkhargrdzeli's army had still not replied and his Georgian army's main body remained absolutely stationary. A nearly perfect opportunity to force its enemy to fight against being encircled or caught in a pincer movement, was wasted. Soon the Georgian vanguard was breaking apart and finally got completely overrun. Commander Mkhargrdzeli then ordered his troops to abandon the battlefield entirely, leaving the other two commanders Shalva and Ivane Akhaltsikheli in their enemies' hands. Once again internal conflicts and personal feuds between Georgian grand feudal lords decisively crippled the Georgian kingdom's defences and its leaders power. The results of betrayal was that a quarter of the Georgian army was annihilated, leaving the country poorly steeled against an upcoming Mongol invasion. The capture of Dvin brought about the end of Georgia's medieval heyday.

The organization distributes donated, purchased and prepared foods through a network of nearly 1,000 feeding programs and 262 Partner Agencies in 13 North Texas counties. The NTFB supports the nutritional needs of children, seniors, and families through education, advocacy and strategic partnerships. History The North Texas Food Bank was established in 1982 by Liz Minyard (prior owner of the Minyard's Food Stores chain), Kathryn Hall, Jo Curtis and Lorraine Griffin Kircher. Their goal was to address the critical issue of hunger in North Texas by securing donations of surplus unmarketable, but wholesome, foods and grocery products for distribution through a network of charitable organizations in 13 North Texas counties: Dallas, Denton, Collin, Fannin, Rockwall, Hunt, Grayson, Kaufman, Ellis, Navarro, Lamar, Delta and Hopkins. In the first year of operation, the Food Bank distributed 400,000 pounds of food. 13 counties serviced by the North Texas Food Bank. Members of the North Texas Food Bank's organizing committee became advocates with members of the Texas Legislature for the passage of the Good Faith Donor Act, which protects donors from liability of donated product. With the passage of this act in 1983, many potential donors began actively donating. The North Texas Food Bank is a certified member of Feeding America's Food Bank Network. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization, solicits food and grocery products from national suppliers for distribution through more than 200 certified Food Banks nationally. Feeding America also provides Food Banks with operational standards, training, support and inspection, and educates the public and government officials about the nature and solutions to the problem of hunger in the U.S. Based on distribution North Texas Food Bank is ranked 8th nationally among Feeding America food banks. Since 1982, NTFB has distributed more than half a billion pounds of food. =Close the Gap (2008-2011)= Ending in June 2011, Close the Gap was the organization's three-year strategic plan to narrow the food gap by providing access to 50 million meals annually. By the end of their 2011 fiscal year (July 2010-June 2011), the organization provided access to 50.5 million meals; exceeding their goal. =ReThink Hunger (2011-2014)= Beginning in July 2011, NTFB began its three-year strategic plan, ReThink Hunger, to improve the services provided. The plan focused on three pillars: *Healthier ‚Äì Providing more nutritious food, including fresh produce. *Smarter ‚Äì Understanding hunger better through the development of The Hunger Center of North Texas, a collaborative research program that provides tools and information to fight hunger more efficiently. *Stronger ‚Äì Building capacity and collaborating more efficiently by investing in programs, facilities and partnerships that offer the best opportunities to improve service and efficiency. In Fiscal Year 2014, the final year of the Rethink Hunger campaign, NTFB provided access to 62 million nutritious meals through a network of 262 Partner Agencies and 1000 feeding programs. = Stop Hunger, Build Hope Capital Campaign (2015-2018) = In 2015, the North Texas Food Bank announced a 10-year plan to provide access to 92 million meals annually by 2025. The goal reflects the current need for food assistance in NTFB's 13-county service area and represents a nearly 50 percent increase in meals distributed today. In February 2017, NTFB publicly launched the Stop Hunger Build Hope Capital Campaign to help fund a new Northern Distribution Center and other initiatives that will allow NTFB to reach the 92 million meal goal. In January 2018, the $55 million goal that would fund additional NTFB capacity, partner agency capacity and provide more insights about clients was achieved. Operations The North Texas Food Bank allocates all donations by using only 6% of all resources for fundraising and administrative costs which allows 94 cents of every dollar donated to reach the hungry. The organization focuses on providing more nutritious food to the community it serves, becoming a thought leader on the subject of hunger in North Texas and expanding its reach in North Texas. Both donated and purchased product are stored in their main warehouse location in Plano, the Perot Family Campus, which they moved into in September 2018. North Texas Food Bank trucks pickup food donations from various locations. After being received and sorted by Food Bank volunteers and employees the food is then distributed to agencies throughout North Texas. NTFB truck in parking lot The North Texas Food Bank gathers donations of both perishable and nonperishable food as well as nonfood items. These items are then distributed to North Texas area food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and other programs that serve people in need. An estimated 31,000 individuals volunteer their time at NTFB each year. =Board of Directors= Executive Committee Anurag Jain, Access Healthcare (Chairman); Michael Brookshire, Bain & Company; Julia Buthman, Prudential Capital Group; Tyler Cooper, Cooper Aerobics; Calvin Hilton, Alliance Data; Bill Hogg, Community Volunteer; Cheryl Hughes, Toyota Motor North America, Inc.; Ginny Kissling, Ryan, LLC; Adam Saphier, Trammell Crow Co.; Priya Sarjoo, Grant Thornton, LLP Members at Large John Beckert, Highlanders Partners; Flauren Bender, The Greenway Shop; Bobby Chestnut, Bank of America Merrill Lynch; Jerri Garison, Baylor Scott & White; Jeff George, Revival Healthcare Capital and Maytal, LLC; James D.

NTFB works to ensure that these seniors have access to nutritious foods that meet their health needs through two primary programs - People and Nutrition (PAN), and Nourishing Neighbors. = SNAP Outreach = The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) addresses the nutritional needs of low- income families and is one of the nation's most important defenses against hunger. NTFB helps to increase enrollment through application assistance and providing SNAP information in their 13-county service area to overcome barriers to participation. NTFB Social Services Assistance Coordinators answer questions about the application process and help clients complete and submit applications. NTFB's SSA team also assists with applications for CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and Medicaid. The assistance is free to the applicants. In FY18, NTFB provided access to 27 million meals through the SNAP program with an estimated $69 million in SNAP funds distributed into the economy of our service area. = Partner Agencies & Community Distribution = NTFB works closely with more than 200 food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other facilities to ensure that we get nutritious food to those who need it. These strategic partnerships are critical to fighting hunger in North Texas. In addition to providing food to these critical partners, we also work with these organizations to provide complementary nutrition-related programs including SNAP benefits outreach services, and nutrition education workshops and courses. This also includes Our Community Pantry, NTFB's first client-choose food pantry to be operated and staffed by the North Texas Food Bank that operates out of South Dallas. = Nutrition Services = NTFB has provided free culinary and nutrition education to high-income populations since 1996. In partnership with Share Our Strength's Cooking Matters, NTFB offers food management courses to North Texans, teaching the basics of nutrition, cooking, food-budgeting and food safety to promote healthful and affordable food choices. NTFB also works to distribute fresh produce to food insecure children, seniors and families in North Texas. This includes parking with community gardens to grow and connect fresh produce to these in need. In Fiscal Year 18, NTFB distributed 26.8 million pounds of fresh produce to clients across North Texas. Mass Care Task Force Hurricane Katrina brought over 30,000 evacuees to the North Texas area. Non-profit organizations in the North Texas area found that they were unable to meet the needs of those who migrated into the area. So in 2006, chief executive officers from the American Red Cross, the North Texas Food Bank, The Salvation Army and the Volunteer Center of North Texas formed the Mass Care Task Force; to prepare for disaster relief in the area. The task force is currently working on funding for the relief plan. In 2017, when Hurricane Harvey hit the Gulf Coast, the Mass Care Task Force officially activated for the first time to provide food, shelter, and assistance to refugees from the area.

In forest ecology, canopy also refers to the upper layer or habitat zone, formed by mature tree crowns and including other biological organisms (epiphytes, lianas, arboreal animals, etc.). Sometimes the term canopy is used to refer to the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual tree or group of trees. Shade trees normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants.  Observation  Early observations of canopies were made from the ground using binoculars or by examining fallen material. Researchers would sometimes erroneously rely on extrapolation by using more reachable samples taken from the understory. In some cases, they would use unconventional methods such as chairs suspended on vines or hot-air dirigibles, among others. Modern technology, including adapted mountaineering gear, has made canopy observation significantly easier and more accurate, allowed for longer and more collaborative work, and broadened the scope of canopy study.  Canopy structure  monkey-ladder vine canopy over a road Canopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement (three-dimensional geometry) of a plant canopy. Leaf area index (LAI), leaf area per unit ground area, is a key measure used to understand and compare plant canopies. It is also taller than the understory layer. The canopy holds 90% of the animals in the rainforest. They cover vast distances and appear to be unbroken when observed from an airplane. However, despite overlapping tree branches, rainforest canopy trees rarely touch each other. Rather, they are usually separated by a few feet.  Canopy layer of forests  Dominant and co-dominant canopy trees form the uneven canopy layer. Canopy trees are able to photosynthesize relatively rapidly due to abundant light, so it supports the majority of primary productivity in forests. The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading to a relatively sparsely vegetated understory layer. Forest canopies are home to unique flora and fauna not found in other layers of forests. The highest terrestrial biodiversity resides in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Many rainforest animals have evolved to live solely in the canopy, and never touch the ground. The canopy of a rainforest is typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of sunlight. The canopy is below the emergent layer, a sparse layer of very tall trees, typically one or two per hectare. With an abundance of water and a near ideal temperature in rainforests, light and nutrients are two factors that limit tree growth from the understory to the canopy. In the permaculture and forest gardening community, the canopy is the highest of seven layers.

Both are flying banderoles (the Breton Kroaz Du and the English flag of St. George.) A banderole (, \\"little banner\\") is a comparatively small but long flag, historically used by knights and on ships, and as a heraldic device for representing bishops. Bannerol, in its main uses is the same as banderole, and is the term especially applied to banners about a yard square carried at the funerals of great men and placed over the tomb. Often it commemorated a particular exploit of the person bearing the coat of arms. Banderole ( a wooden stick having one pointed end covered with metallic shoe) is used in conventional military survey. It's used to depict various stations established during carrying the survey forward. Double banderole are used to erect Survey Beacon. Knights, bishops and ships A banderole is a small flag or streamer carried on the lance of a knight, or a long narrow flag, with cleft end flying from the mast-head of a ship in battle. Lion rampant holding a banderole In heraldry, a banderole is a streamer hanging from beneath the crook of a bishop's crosier and folding over the staff, and for other small streamers or ribbons. Art and architecture A 1506 painting by Bernhard Strigel with banderole. The term is also used in art and architecture for a speech scroll or streamer, representing a roll of parchment carried by or surrounding a figure or object, for bearing an inscription, mainly during the medieval and Renaissance periods. In particular banderoles were used as attributes for Old Testament prophets, as may be seen in the Santa Trinita Maest√† by Cimabue, (Uffizi, 1280‚Äì90), Duccio's Maest√† (1308‚Äì11), and other works. The convention had a historical appropriateness, as the Old Testament was originally written on scrolls, whereas nearly all surviving New Testament manuscripts are codices (like modern books). They may also be used for the words of angels, especially Gabriel's greeting to Mary in Annunciation scenes.Ladis, Andrew & Maginnis, Hayden B. J., Painting in the Age of Giotto: A Historical Reevaluation, pp. 155-156, 1997, Penn State Press, , En banderole Starting in the British Army during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), and continuing in use in various armies throughout the later 18th, 19th, and early 20th Centuries, up to and including the Soviet Red Army in their \\"Great Patriotic War\\" (1941-1945), the term en banderole referred to soldiers wearing either their greatcoat (heavy overcoat) or blanket, rolled up along its longer edge, draped over one shoulder and across their back and breast, and fastened‚Äîsometimes with a small bespoke strap, other times with a short length of simple rope‚Äînear their waist. The practice was begun by British light infantrymen fighting in North America during the Seven Years' War, known there as the \\"French and Indian\\" war, to make carrying their equipment more convenient to fighting in the heavily-wooded terrain.

It is usually a part of the Cultural Resources Management (CRM) methodology and a popular form of rapid archaeological survey in the United States of America and Canada. It designates a series of (c. 0.50 m or less) test holes, usually dug out by a shovel (hence the name) in order to determine whether the soil contains any cultural remains that are not visible on the surface. The soil is sifted or screened through 1/4\\" or 6 mm wire mesh to recover the artifacts. STPs will often be laid out over the project area in a grid-like fashion or in a consistently spaced line, creating a fairly systematic survey. Therefore, after the holes have been dug, one may map artifact densities over the project area, pinpointing the locations of possible sites where further investigation may be necessary. The interval at which the STPs are placed varies considerably and, in CRM at least, is sometimes prescribed by state regulations (in the U.S.) or is determined by the conditions in the field. The usual space between two STPs is 10 m or more but it can be considerably less (e.g., 1 m). The current standards in the United States is 30m or less. The depth of an STP depends on the depth at which either the bedrock or the sterile subsoil is found. The form of STP may vary from region to region and even within regions by company/organization. Common forms include circular and square shaped. Circular STP often have cylindrical to \\"bullet\\" (i.e., cylinder with short inverted conical base) shaped profiles and range from 30 cm to 50 cm diameter. Square STPs are typically about 50 cm, but some locations prefer other sizes (e.g., 40 cm). Unusual and unusually ineffective variants include circular (30 to 50 cm diameter) STP with truncated conical profiles. Depth of STP excavation also varies widely and is often dependent upon local soil types and expected maximum depth of sites. Typically this ranges from 30 cm to 1.0 m. A second factor is mechanical, in that excavation is limited by the tools and techniques used (i.e., shovel versus trowel). Typically STP are excavated to a maximum average of 1.0 m, although it is possible to excavate somewhat deeper (1.25 to 1.5 m) dependent upon the excavator and the tools available. STP can be combined with other techniques and tools (augers, corers) to extend the maximum depth of effective testing beyond 1.5 m.

They held that there are two first causes ‚Äî the perfectly good and the perfectly evil. The latter is also the creator of the world, the god of the Jews, and the author of the Old Testament. Jesus Christ is the son of the good deity; he was sent into the world to oppose the evil; but his incarnation, and therefore his sufferings, were a mere appearance. Regarding the body as the work of the evil deity, the Cerdonians formed a moral system of great severity, prohibiting marriage, wine and the eating of flesh, and advocating fasting and other austerities. Most of what the Church Fathers narrate of Cerdo's tenets has probably been transferred to him from his famous pupil Marcion, like whom he is said to have rejected the Old Testament and the New, except part of Luke's Gospel and of Paul's epistles.

Vegetables, the second largest food group in many nutrition guides, come in a wide variety of shapes, colors and sizes. A food group is a collection of foods that share similar nutritional properties or biological classifications. List of nutrition guides typically divide foods into food groups and Recommended Dietary Allowance recommend daily servings of each group for a healthy diet. In the United States for instance, USDA has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups. Historical food groups The USDA promoted eight basic food groups prior to 1943, then seven basic food groups until 1956, then four food groups. A food pyramid was introduced in 1992, then MyPyramid in 2005, followed by MyPlate in 2011. Dietary guidelines were introduced in 2015 and slated to be rereleased every five years. The 2020 guidelines were to be released in Spring 2020.https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition- programs-policies/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines. The most common food groups * Dairy, also called milk products and sometimes categorized with milk alternatives or meat, is typically a smaller category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups. Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, yogurt, cheese, cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the Harvard School of Public Health who point out that \\"research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products‚Äîone to two servings a day‚Äîis fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it‚Äôs not essential for adults, for a host of reasons.\\" * Fruits, sometimes categorized with vegetables, include apples, oranges, bananas, berries and lemons. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals. * Grains, beans and legumes, sometimes categorized as cereals, is often the largest category in nutrition guides. Examples include wheat, rice, oats, barley, bread and pasta. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of starch and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. * Meat, sometimes labelled protein and occasionally inclusive of legumes and beans, eggs, meat analogues and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides. Examples include chicken, fish, turkey, pork and beef. * Confections, also called sugary foods and sometimes categorized with fats and oils, is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups. Examples include candy, soft drinks, and chocolate. * Vegetables, sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of legumes, is typically a large category second only to grains, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides. Examples include spinach, carrots, onions, and broccoli. * Water is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category, others list it separately from other food groups, and yet others make it the center or foundation of the guide. Water is sometimes categorized with tea, fruit juice, vegetable juice and even soup, and is typically recommended in plentiful amounts. Uncommon food groups The number of \\"common\\" food groups varies depending on who is defining them.

Early life and career Gelling was born on Tynwald Day (5 July) 1938 in Santon, a village to the south-west of Douglas. He was apprenticed in engineering from 1954 to 1959 and after National Service in the Royal Air Force he became a salesman of agricultural machinery and vehicles. He was a general manager of his company from 1969. His political career began immediately as his National Service ended in 1961 when he was elected as a Santon Parish Commissioner; he served for 25 years and had five terms as Chairman of the Commissioners. In the Tynwald election of November 1986 Gelling was elected as Member of the House of Keys for Malew and Santon constituency. Like most political figures in the Isle of Man, Gelling does not belong to any political party and has fought elections as an Independent on his own personal record and policies. Gelling served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry from 1988 to 1989 and was then appointed to the important role of Minister for Treasury. In this role he kept the Isle of Man's status as a 'tax haven' and moved to build up the financial services sector as Chairman of the Financial Supervision Commission. After the 1996 general election, Gelling was elected Chief Minister of the Isle of Man. In the November 2001 General Election he was re-elected. He decided to retire from the Chief Ministership the following year and was elected by his Keys colleagues to be a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC). The Legislative Council is the Upper House of Tynwald, the Isle of Man's parliament. He retained his interest in the financial services industry as the head of Isle of Man Finance, a body set up by the Manx Treasury to promote the industry. After the sudden resignation of Richard Corkill on 2 December 2004 in a financial scandal, Gelling was re-elected as Chief Minister on 14 December. He stayed in office then for exactly two years before stepping down as Chief Minister after the 2006 General Election. He then stood down as an MLC on 18 January 2007, retiring from politics. Personal life Gelling has been married to Joan (n√©e Kelly) since 1960, they have 4 children together.

He was awarded the Wynne Prize seven times. He was also a recipient of the Commonwealth Government prize for his painting of the Federal Capital site at Canberra. In some sources, the two Listers are hyphenated. Biography At the age of eight he moved with his parents to Yorkshire, England; where his father was born. There, he studied at Bedford School, then spent a year in Paris studying art. While there, his father changed the family name from Buttrey to Lister by deed poll. From 1876 to 1880, he studied mechanical engineering at the College of Science and Arts and the Fairfield Engineering Works, both in Glasgow, after which he became a ship's engineer. While studying, he joined the St. Mungo Art Club, founded by a Scottish cartoonist known as Cynicus, and was soon exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy, aged only seventeen.Australian Dictionary of Biography After serving four years at sea as a ship's engineer, he settled in London in 1884, where he began painting professionally as well as teaching. During his stay there, he exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and several others. He returned to Sydney in 1888 where he began producing the seascapes and coastal scenes for which he is best known. He joined the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, and remained with that organization when several artists broke away to form the \\"Society of Artists, Sydney\\" in 1907. During this time, he also became a trustee of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales and served as Vice-President from 1919 until his death. In 1898 he had a successful showing at the Exhibition of Australian Art in the Grafton Galleries, London. That same year, he received his first Wynne Prize. In 1899, he married Bessie Enid Jenkins, a divorc√©e. He was a regular exhibitor at Anthony Hordern's art gallery from 1919‚Äì40. Margaret Preston cited him as an early influence. He was known for his preference for very large canvases. He was struck by a taxi in Mosman; suffering severe head injuries from which he died a few hours later. In his obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald they made note of the fact that the driver was a woman. He was survived by a daughter. His wife had predeceased him in 1935.

It was hosted by former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, with a panel of two commentators, one each from the right and left of the political spectrum. The show was introduced on 16 January 2003, as was the Daily Politics, after a major review of BBC political programmes. It replaced the nightly Despatch Box (1998‚Äì2002), for which Neil had been the sole presenter in its later years. In February 2019, following Neil's decision to step down as host, the BBC announced that This Week would end in July 2019. The final episode aired on 18 July 2019, a live broadcast from Westminster Central Hall with an invited audience of political dignitaries and celebrities. Mick Hucknall of pop group Simply Red sang \\"Nobody Does it Better\\" to Andrew Neil and the 'Final Show' was closed by 'Quiet Man' covering \\"Make Luv\\" (sic). After September 2019, Neil went on to host The Andrew Neil Show on Wednesdays. This Week was initially replaced on Thursdays by the TV version of Brexitcast, a podcast about Brexit. Overview With a light- hearted tone compared with most political programming, This Week was \\"punchy, irreverent, satirical\\". From start to finish, Michael Portillo was the regular Conservative commentator on the show and the Labour Party commentator until 2010 was Diane Abbott. The two were ostensibly an \\"odd couple\\" coming from different sides of the political spectrum (albeit with a long-standing friendship dating back to when both attended grammar school in Harrow, even having appeared in a production of Macbeth together). During her unsuccessful campaign in 2010 to lead the Labour Party and her subsequent tenure as Shadow Minister for Public Health, Abbott began making only occasional appearances, her ability to speak without constraint becoming noticeable. Eventually, her place was taken by another Labour MP, in rotation each week, always a backbencher, most often Alan Johnson. After returning to the backbenches in 2013, Abbott appeared on a fortnightly basis, alternating with Johnson. Since her appointment to Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet in September 2015, she has not appeared. The tradition of Labour MPs alternating in the spot has continued. Since 2013, Neil's golden retriever Miss Molly also frequently appeared on the show, often walking in front of the camera during shots or choosing to sleep next to guests. This Week often appeared on the BBC Radio 4 Comedy Show Dead Ringers, where Andrew Neil interviewed Diane Abbott and then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn often popped up. Episode format Shown directly following Question Time, This Week presented itself as a more laid-back companion to its predecessor, with episodes regularly opening with a summary of the week's main events in the form of a parody of a popular television series. At the beginning of each episode, Neil asked the two regular commentators for their \\"Moment of the Week\\", occasionally contributing his own \\"moment\\". The standard format consists of three segments, with a guest contributor featuring in each. The first featured a journalist or commentator who presents their \\"Take of the Week\\" in a short film before appearing in the studio to discuss their perspective further. The second segment was a light- hearted \\"Round-up of the Week\\" in and around Parliament, formerly presented by Mark Mardell, who left the show on becoming the BBC's Europe Editor in 2005. The \\"Round-up\\" segment was later presented by a rotation of writers and broadcasters. This was followed by a discussion between the hosts (often joined for this segment by Miranda Green) of the issues raised. The third main segment, \\"Spotlight\\", typically focused more on cultural topics and features a final guest. For many years, there was often also a quiz at the end of the show, in which Neil took pleasure in demonstrating the commentators' ignorance of a range of topics, though this feature no longer appeared in later years. Though primarily a political discussion programme, This Week achieved notoriety for its humorous approach to current affairs. For example, during the 2005 General Election, the show's title sequence spoofed the recently re- released version of \\"Is This the Way to Amarillo\\" and its video featuring comedian Peter Kay. In 2011, following the announcement that the techno band Underworld were to perform at the opening ceremony for the London Summer Olympics, the show's ending credits featured Neil and his guests raving to the band's music. The clip subsequently went viral on YouTube, helping to increase the show's unconventional popularity amongst younger audiences. In 2006, the programme won the Hansard Society Award for Opening Up Politics which was awarded at the Channel 4 Political Awards ceremony. During the general election campaign of 2010, This Week was broadcast on Monday nights in addition to its usual Thursday night slot, with contributors including Sarah Teather, Lynne Featherstone, Caroline Flint and James Purnell and the late Charles Kennedy. Recurring jokes In keeping with its comic style, This Week had several recurring jokes and nicknames. These included assertions that the show's viewers watched the show drinking Blue Nun, David Cameron watched the show in bed wearing his pyjamas, and that the cast regularly went to a nightclub after filming is completed, either Annabel's in Berkeley Square or Lou Lou's in Mayfair (with Charles Clarke providing the guests a minicab service, even when he was not appearing on the show). It was also frequently said that the show had a budget of almost zero, and had few or no regular viewers. While giving out the Twitter and Facebook handles for the show (in the process, creatively mangling the names of the social media sites), Neil also insisted that no comments posted by viewers would be read. In addition, every episode began with the words \\"Evenin' all\\" and ended with \\"That's your lot for this week\\" followed by \\"Nighty-night; don't let the [topical event or person] bite\\". The middle section was introduced with \\"Now, it's late; [topical event]-late.\\" Following Diane Abbott's departure from the show, Neil would joke that her leadership bid and later appointment as Shadow Minister for Public Health were part of her \\"insatiable lust for power\\". On the rare occasions that she consequently made an appearance on the show, Neil introduced her by saying \\"And back by absolutely no public demand whatsoever...\\". In weeks where the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow (or his spouse), had featured in the news, the end credits were frequently shown over a scene of the diminutive Speaker being ceremonially escorted into the House of Commons to the music and lyrics of Jimmy Dean's \\"Big Bad John\\". =Guest commentators' nicknames= Michael Portillo, regularly mocked by Andrew Neil for his garishly-designed shirts and his long- running railway series * \\"Itchy & Scratchy\\" ‚Äì Diane Abbott MP and Michael Portillo * \\"#Choo-Choo\\" & \\"#SadManOnATrain\\" ‚Äì Michael Portillo * \\"#baffled & #HackneyAbbott\\" ‚Äì Diane Abbott MP * \\"#SadManOnTheLeft\\" ‚Äì Alan Johnson * \\"#ShesLovely\\" - Miranda Green * \\"#ManInTheMiddle\\" or \\"Chat-Show Charlie\\" ‚Äì the late Charles Kennedy * \\"#RivieraGigolo\\" ‚Äì Alastair Campbell * \\"#FourPerCent\\" & \\"Liz Mis√©rables\\" ‚Äì Liz Kendall MP * \\"#DivisionBelle\\" ‚Äì Caroline Flint * \\"#theLamminator\\" ‚Äì David Lammy MP * \\"#LastKingofScotland\\" ‚Äì Alex Salmond * \\"Vince the Cable\\" ‚Äì Vince Cable * \\"Shirl the Girl\\" ‚Äì Baroness Shirley Williams of Crosby * \\"#SadManinaSuit\\" ‚Äì Jacob Rees-Mogg MP * \\"#JessWeCan\\" ‚Äì Jess Phillips MP * \\"#SadScouserOnaSofa\\" ‚Äì Esther McVey MP * \\"#SmoothOperator\\" ‚Äì Chuka Umunna * \\"#NorthernSoul\\" ‚Äì Lisa Nandy MP * \\"#MaroonedCamerooned\\" ‚Äì Ed Vaizey * \\"#minesavindaloo\\" ‚Äì Michael Dugher * \\"#glitterballs\\" ‚Äì Ed Balls * \\"#OhItsNotEdBalls\\" ‚Äì Chris Leslie * \\"#littlepinkbus\\" ‚Äì Harriet Harman MP * \\"Molly the dog\\" ‚Äì Molly Neil (Andrew Neil's dog) * \\"Scrubber\\" ‚Äì Iris Bailey (Andrew Neil's dog) =Other political nicknames= * \\"BoJo The Clown\\" ‚Äì Boris Johnson MP, Prime Minister from 2019 * \\"The Maybot\\" ‚Äì Theresa May MP, Prime Minister 2016‚Äì19 * \\"Call Me Dave\\" ‚Äì David Cameron, Prime Minister 2010‚Äì16 * \\"Nick Cleggover\\", \\"#NickFlixandChill\\" ‚Äì Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister 2010‚Äì15 * \\"Spreadsheet Phil\\" ‚Äì Philip Hammond, Chancellor 2016‚Äì19 * \\"Boy George\\" ‚Äì George Osborne, Chancellor 2010‚Äì16 * \\"Not-So-Red Ed\\" ‚Äì Ed Miliband MP * \\"Her Maj\\" or \\"The Boss\\" ‚Äì The Queen * \\"The Great Leader\\" ‚Äì Gordon Brown, Prime Minister 2007‚Äì10 * \\"Our Dear Leader\\" ‚Äì BBC Directors-General Lord Hall of Birkenhead 2013‚Äì19; Mark Thompson until 2012. * \\"Miss Trust\\" ‚Äì The BBC Trust * Jean-Claude \\"Mine's a triple cognac, high five\\" Juncker ‚Äì Jean-Claude Juncker * \\"Bish\\" ‚Äì The Archbishop of Canterbury * \\"Jezza The Red\\" ‚Äì Jeremy Corbyn MP * \\"The Donald\\" ‚Äì Donald Trump, President of the United States. =Election song= During general elections, the show started with the 'election song'.

Gruner won the Wynne Prize for landscape painting seven times, the most of any Australian artist besides Hans Heysen. One of Gruner's winners of the prize, Spring Frost (1919), has since become his best known work, and is regarded as perhaps the most loved Australian landscape painting in the Art Gallery of New South Wales.Spring Frost, AGNSW. Retrieved 18 January 2020. Early life Gruner was born in Gisborne, New Zealand, younger son of Elliott Gr√ºner, a Norwegian-born bailiff, and his Irish wife Mary Ann, who died in 1922. Gruner was brought to Sydney before he was a year old and at an early age showed a desire to draw. When about 12 years old his mother took him to Julian Ashton, who gave him his first lessons in art.B. Pearce, 'Gruner, Elioth Lauritz Leganyer (1882‚Äì1939)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983, pp 134‚Äì135. Retrieved on 30 December 2008 At 14 years of age he obtained a position in a shop where he worked from 7.40 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. to help to maintain the household after his father and older brother died. Artistic career Spring Frost, 1919, Art Gallery of New South Wales Gruner managed to do some painting on weekends, and in 1901 began to send work to the exhibitions of the Society of Artists, Sydney. From around 1907 his work began to attract serious attention: one admirer was Norman Lindsay. In 1911 a small shop was started in Bligh Street, Sydney, to sell works of art produced in Australia, and for a time Gruner took charge of it. He then became an assistant to Julian Ashton at the Sydney Art School, and during Ashton's illness took complete charge of classes at the school for about three months. In 1916 he was the winner of the Wynne Prize with a small landscape, Morning Light, a painting showing the farm of Jim Innes at Emu Plains. This painting was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW). Gruner was again the winner of the Wynne Prize in 1919 with his painting Spring Frost depicting Jim Innes and his cattle and in the following year the AGNSW trustees commissioned him to paint a large picture for the gallery, \\"The Valley of the Tweed\\". Though this was awarded the Wynne Prize in 1921 and is a capable work, it scarcely ranks among his best efforts. He seldom afterwards took anything larger than a 24-inch canvas. In 1923 Gruner visited Europe and was away from Australia for around two years. The effect of travel on his work was very noticeable: there was generally a good deal of simplification, more attention to pattern, and a freer and wider sweep of his brush. Sir William Orpen had provided constructive comments which altered Gruner's style. He became less interested in the problems of light and occasionally his work took on a slightly cold aspect. The changes were not always welcomed by his admirers, but Gruner was right not to allow himself to fall into a groove. He held a one-man show in 1927 and, not being a particularly productive artist, was in a position to sell almost everything he produced. Gruner spent much time in finding a suitable subject, and more still in carefully considering it before a brushstroke was made. Later, Gruner became interested in the study of light again, and some excellent work of his last period combined the qualities of his art and his passion. Gruner suffered from chronic nephritis and died at his home at Waverley on 17 October 1939. He was cremated with Anglican rites. He never married but he left descendants in Australia and New Zealand.Sally Prior, Sydney Morning Herald, 1 March 2014. \\"Elioth Gruner: The master of light\\".

Setting or maintaining a spring-gun is illegal in many places. Uses Spring-guns were formerly used as booby traps against poachers and trespassers. Since 1827, spring-guns and all man-traps have been illegal in England. Spring-guns are sometimes used to trap animals. Although there have been few reported cases of use, there have been several unconfirmed cases over the 20th century. The obvious implication is that spring-guns are still in use today, especially in circumstances where property of high value is in a remote location that makes other forms of securing it unreasonably difficult to effect. In the 18th century, spring-guns were often used to protect graveyards, offering an alarm system of sorts to protect newly buried bodies, which were often stolen by grave-robbers who supplied anatomists with cadavers. Spring-guns were often set to protect property. For this purpose, spring-guns are often placed in busy corridors such as near doors. A trespasser opening the door completely would then be shot. Residents who are aware of the trap use a different door or open the door halfway and disconnect the tripwire. To reduce fatalities by using this trap, non-lethal calibers are often used, or the spring-gun is fitted to fire less lethal ammunition. For example, in the United States, most spring-guns are loaded with non-lethal caliber or shot to avoid liability arising from the use of deadly force in protection of a property interest. Posting clear and unmistakable warning signs as well as making entry to spring-gun guarded premises difficult for innocent persons, such as high walls, fences and natural obstacles, are significant ways to reduce potential tort liability arising from the spring-gun's wounding of a careless or criminal intruder. Important US lawsuits regarding trespassers wounded by spring-guns include Katko v. Briney. Bird v. Holbrook is an 1825 English case also of great relevance, where a spring-gun set to protect a tulip garden injured a trespasser who was recovering a stray bird.Web.archive.org The man who set the spring-gun was liable for the damage caused. Documented examples An historic use of a spring-gun occurred during the night of June 3 or early morning of June 4, 1775, when a spring-gun set by the British to protect the military stores in the Magazine in Williamsburg, Virginia,Colonial Williamsburg Magazine wounded two young men who had broken in. The subsequent outrage by the local population proved to be the final act of the Gunpowder Incident, leading Governor Dunmore to flee the city to a British warship and declare the Commonwealth of Virginia in a state of rebellion. In 1981, Rene Seiptius and two friends attempted to flee from East Germany to West Germany. While they managed to avoid land mines, they did trip a spring-gun, killing one of Rene's friends.Yahoo.com Another case is McComb v. Connaghan in which a 19-year-old burglar was killed by a spring-gun that was set up by the property owner who was a repeated victim of burglary. Alternatives Alternative traps are mines such as the crowd control munition, gas mine or the directional mine, such as the SM-70, which was used on the inner German border to prevent refugees from escaping East Germany. Crowd control munition and gas mines can be less lethal, while concussion mines are meant to kill. The latter are thus only used in military perimeter defenses. In popular culture Spring-guns have appeared in works of fiction such as the novel The Dead Shall Not Rest by Tessa Harris, video games Max Payne, Police Quest II, Metro 2033, Fallout 2, 3 and 4, and the film Saw.

These light systems are classified according to the intensity they are capable of producing: * High intensity runway lights (HIRL) * Medium intensity runway lights (MIRL) * Low intensity runway lights (LIRL) Many HIRL and MIRL systems have variable intensity controls, whereas the LIRLs normally have one intensity setting. At airports where there is a control tower, the tower will manage the lights to account for visibility and pilot preference, but some airports do not have control towers. These airports will have Pilot Controlled Lighting, or PCL, where pilots can adjust the lighting themselves by keying a microphone button a certain number of times. The majority of runway edge lights are clear or white, but there are some exceptions to provide additional information to pilots in certain circumstances.

This battle occurred after the Battle of Martqopi in the same year, when the Iranian army was routed. Context The battle was the result of the Kartli-Kakhetian Uprising of 1625, when Teimuraz I took the leadership of the second rebellion against the Safavid Empire in his lifetime. Abbas I of Persia sent a large army under the command of Isa Khan Safavi (the qurchi-bashi) to quell the uprising, and made him the commander of the Safavid forces in Georgia. Abbas I ordered the Safavid governors in the Caucasus to assist Isa Khan. The Safavid army also included the beglarbegs of Shirvan and Erivan, as well as soldiers from northern and central Iran. Shah Abbas I was commanding the expedition from southern Azerbaijan, where he was encamped. Preparation The Iranian army crossed into Georgian territory at the end of June 1625 and encamped in the valleys of Algeti River on plains of Marabda. King Teimuraz and Giorgi Saakadze assembled 20 thousand men and encamped in Kojori-Tabakhmela plains. The Iranians were waiting for the army of Beglarbeg of Azerbaijan, Shah Bende Khan and hence were not planning on launching an attack yet. Georgian commanders were at contention about the specifics of the strategy they would use in battle. Giorgi Saakadze was insisting on waiting for the attack of the Persians in order to utilize the landscape of the Marabda plains, whereas King Teimuraz was suggesting the opposite. In the end, the plan of Teimuraz was favored over that of Giorgi and so the battle began with the personal leadership of the king, removing Giorgi Saakadze from command. Battle The Persians were prepared for the attack: sangars had already been built and artillery pieces were laid out in the front, behind of which stood musketeers in four rows. The front of the force was put under the leadership of Amirghuna Khan, while Isa Khan Safavi commanded the center of the army. The Georgians came down from the Tabakhmela highlands during the night and charged the Persian fortifications at dawn. The musketeers and artillery caused heavy casualties but were unable to stop the Georgian attack, which broke through the front and destroyed the Iranian vanguard, mortally wounding Amirghuna Khan. The Georgians were able to break the Persian infantry lines and launched a massive offensive on the center of Isa Khan's army. In the heat of battle, the Persian flanks were unable to help the center, got separated from the main force and, according to Teimuraz's plan, started fleeing from the battlefield. The victory of the Georgians seemed almost inevitable, but Isa-Khan and his personal guard was still stubbornly trying to halt the Georgian advance. After much of the Persian army was routed and the rest of it was reduced into a large pocket, one of the Georgian flanks lost the contact point with the enemy and started to celebrate their soon-to-be-had victory. At the same time, Teimuraz I's cavalry battalions got separated from the main battleground while chasing down the retreating Persians. The Qizilbashs used the advantage by reassembling their broken lines and concentrating them around Isa Khan's personal guard and launching a powerful counter-attack on the Georgians. Utilizing the newly arrived reinforcements under Shahbandeh Khan (the governor of the Azerbaijan Province), Isa Khan Safavi managed to break the decimated Georgian lines and rout them in the direction of Kojori Narrows. Conclusion The defeat at Marabda was extremely costly for Georgians, killing many nobles and experienced generals in Teimuraz I's loyal service. The main reasons behind the defeat were non-disciplinary actions of the rebels and the usage of outdated weaponry. Despite the crushing defeat, Georgians continued to fight a guerrilla war against the Persians. The costly victory for the Persians at Marabda did not quell the overall uprising in Kakheti. Shortly after the defeat, the Georgian rebels managed to ambush and kill Shahbandeh Khan. Teimuraz, along with his comrades, actively continued to oppose the Persian hegemony. Teimuraz's political and military maneuvers effectively resulted in restoration of autonomy in eastern Georgia, reinstituting the throne of Kakheti to Teimuraz I himself.

The published code allows an authorized user that has been granted the right to view an RMS protected document to remove the protection and preserve the file formatting. This sort of manipulation requires that the user has been granted rights to decrypt the content to be able to view it. While Rights Management Services makes certain security assertions regarding the inability for unauthorized users to access protected content, the differentiation between different usage rights for authorized users is considered part of its policy enforcement capabilities, which Microsoft claims to be implemented as \\"best effort\\", so it is not considered by Microsoft to be a security issue but a policy enforcement limitation. Previously the RMS SDK enforced signing of code using the RMS capabilities in order to provide some level of control on which applications interacted with RMS, but this capability was later removed due to its limited ability to restrict such behaviors given the possibility to write applications use the web services directly to obtain licenses to decrypt the content. In addition, using this same technique, a user that has been granted rights to view a protected document can manipulate the content of the document without leaving traces of the manipulation. Since Azure RMS is not a non-repudiation solution and, unlike document signing solutions, does not claim to provide anti-tampering capabilities, and since the changes can only be made by users that are granted rights to the document, Microsoft does not consider the later issue to be an actual attack against the claimed capabilities of RMS.

The tarsus forms the lower part of the ankle joint. It transmits the entire weight of the body from the lower legs to the foot.Platzer (2004), p 216 The talus has joints with the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and thinner fibula. These leg bones have two prominences (the lateral and medial malleoli) that articulate with the talus. At the foot end, within the tarsus, the talus articulates with the calcaneus (heel bone) below, and with the curved navicular bone in front; together, these foot articulations form the ball-and-socket-shaped talocalcaneonavicular joint. The talus is the second largest of the tarsal bones; it is also one of the bones in the human body with the highest percentage of its surface area covered by articular cartilage. It is also unusual in that it has a retrograde blood supply, i.e. arterial blood enters the bone at the distal end. In humans, no muscles attach to the talus, unlike most bones, and its position therefore depends on the position of the neighbouring bones.  Structure  Os trigonum on x-ray Though irregular in shape, the talus can be subdivided into three parts. Facing anteriorly, the head carries the articulate surface of the navicular bone, and the neck, the roughened area between the body and the head, has small vascular channels. The body features several prominent articulate surfaces: On its superior side is the trochlea tali, which is semi- cylindrical,Lee F. Rogers (1992) Radiology of skeletal trauma - Volume 2 p.1463 and it is flanked by the articulate facets for the two malleoli. The ankle mortise, the fork-like structure of the malleoli, holds these three articulate surfaces in a steady grip, which guarantees the stability of the ankle joint. However, because the trochlea is wider in front than at the back (approximately 5‚Äì6 mm) the stability in the joint vary with the position of the foot: with the foot dorsiflexed (toes pulled upward) the ligaments of the joint are kept stretched, which guarantees the stability of the joint; but with the foot plantarflexed (as when standing on the toes) the narrower width of the trochlea causes the stability to decrease.Thieme Atlas of Anatomy (2006), p 406 Behind the trochlea is a posterior process with a medial and a lateral tubercle separated by a groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus. Exceptionally, the lateral of these tubercles forms an independent bone called os trigonum or accessory talus; it may represent the tarsale proximale intermedium. On the bone's inferior side, three articular surfaces serve for the articulation with the calcaneus, and several variously developed articular surfaces exist for the articulation with ligaments. For descriptive purposes the talus bone is divided into three sections, neck, body, and head. =Head= The talus bone of the ankle joint connects the leg to the foot. The head of talus looks forward and medialward; its anterior articular or navicular surface is large, oval, and convex. Its inferior surface has two facets, which are best seen in the fresh condition.Gray's Anatomy (1918) The medial, situated in front of the middle calcaneal facet, is convex, triangular, or semi-oval in shape, and rests on the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament; the lateral, named the anterior calcaneal articular surface, is somewhat flattened, and articulates with the facet on the upper surface of the anterior part of the calcaneus. =Neck= The neck of talus is directed anteromedially, and comprises the constricted portion of the bone between the body and the oval head. Its upper and medial surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its lateral surface is concave and is continuous below with the deep groove for the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. =Body= Talus in red, showing surrounding bones The body of the talus comprises most of the volume of the talus bone (ankle bone). It presents with five surfaces; a superior, inferior, medial, lateral and a posterior: * The superior surface of the body presents, behind, a smooth trochlear surface, the trochlea, for articulation with the tibia. The trochlea is broader in front than behind, convex from before backward, slightly concave from side to side: in front it is continuous with the upper surface of the neck of the bone. * the inferior surface presents two articular areas, the posterior and middle calcaneal surfaces, separated from one another by a deep groove, the sulcus tali. The groove runs obliquely forward and lateralward, becoming gradually broader and deeper in front: in the articulated foot it lies above a similar groove upon the upper surface of the calcaneus, and forms, with it, a canal (sinus tarsi) filled up in the fresh state by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. The posterior calcaneal articular surface is large and of an oval or oblong form. It articulates with the corresponding facet on the upper surface of the calcaneus, and is deeply concave in the direction of its long axis which runs forward and lateralward at an angle of about 45¬∞ with the median plane of the body. The middle calcaneal articular surface is small, oval in form and slightly convex; it articulates with the upper surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus. * The medial surface presents at its upper part a pear-shaped articular facet for the medial malleolus, continuous above with the trochlea; below the articular surface is a rough depression for the attachment of the deep portion of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint. * The lateral surface carries a large triangular facet, concave from above downward, for articulation with the lateral malleolus; its anterior half is continuous above with the trochlea; and in front of it is a rough depression for the attachment of the anterior talofibular ligament. Between the posterior half of the lateral border of the trochlea and the posterior part of the base of the fibular articular surface is a triangular facet which comes into contact with the transverse inferior tibiofibular ligament during flexion of the ankle-joint; below the base of this facet is a groove which affords attachment to the posterior talofibular ligament. * The posterior surface is narrow, and traversed by a groove running obliquely downward and medialward, and transmitting the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus. Lateral to the groove is a prominent tubercle, the posterior process, to which the posterior talofibular ligament is attached; this process is sometimes separated from the rest of the talus, and is then known as the os trigonum. Medial to the groove is a second smaller tubercle. Development During the 7-8th intrauterine month an ossification center is formed in the anklebone. Fracture From left to right: Fracture of the neck, body and posterior process of the talus The talus bone lacks a good blood supply. Because of this, healing a broken talus can take longer than most other bones. One with a broken talus may not be able to walk for many months without crutches and will further wear a walking cast or boot of some kind after that. Talus injuries may be difficult to recognize, Section Conclusion: \\"Accurately detecting, classifying, and managing talar injuries can be a challenging endeavor due to the unique anatomic characteristics of the talus and subtle radiographic findings of the injuries.\\", page 778. and lateral process fractures in particular may be radiographically occult. If not recognized and managed appropriately, a talus fracture may result in complications and long-term morbidity. A 2015 review came to the conclusion that isolated talar body fractures may be more common than previously thought. A fractured talar body often has a displacement that is best visualised using CT imaging. In case a talus fracture is accompanied by a dislocation, restoration of articular and axial alignment is necessary to optimize ankle and hindfoot function. As dice Dice were originally made from the talus of hoofed animals, leading to the nickname \\"bones\\" for dice. Colloquially known as \\"knucklebones\\", these are approximately tetrahedral. Modern Mongolians still use such bones as shagai for games and fortune- telling, with each piece relating to a symbolic meaning. In other animals The talus apparently derives from the fusion of three separate bones in the feet of primitive amphibians; the tibiale, articulating with tibia, the intermedium, between the bases of the tibia and fibula, and the fourth centrale, lying in the mid-part of the tarsus. These bones are still partially separate in modern amphibians, which therefore do not have a true talus. The talus forms a considerably more flexible joint in mammals than it does in reptiles. This reaches its greatest extent in artiodactyls, where the distal surface of the bone has a smooth keel to allow greater freedom of movement of the foot, and thus increase running speed.

The king of Imereti Solomon I defeated the Turkish army. The battle took place on December 14, 1757. Solomon I established a strong monarchy and unified western Georgia. His actions stained the relations between the Georgian King and Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, in particular, wanted to stop Solomon's struggle against slavery. The Ottomans were in an alliance with rebellious Georgian nobles, one such example was Levan Abashidze, who was fighting against the King of Imereti. Abashidze arrived in Akhaltsikhe and led an Ottoman army to the Kingdom of Imereti. Solomon enticed them into a strategically adroit place near Khresili and decisively defeated them.Iobashvili g. Georgian Soviet History; tome 11, page 508, Tbilisi., 1987. Background In the 17th century, western Georgia was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman garrisons were dispatched to Tsutskvati, Poti and Shorapani fortresses. 12,000 slaves were sold in the Ottoman Empire every year from Mengrelia alone. Realizing that Georgia was facing the threat of heavy depopulation, the King of Imereti, Solomon I prohibited slavery, opposing turncoat Lords and wanted independence from the Ottoman Empire. Sultan sent Gola Pasha with a large army to punish Solomon I and re-establish Ottoman rule over the Kingdom of Imereti. Strategic Ramifications The importance of battle of Khresili is often misunderstood and greatly underestimated. The decisive Georgian victory ended Turkish influence in Western Georgia in mid 1700s, which started with battle of Sokhoista in mid 1500s at zenith of Ottoman power. While West Georgian (Imereti) kingdom still remained under Bagrationi dynasty even during following two centuries of Turkish influence in Western Georgia since mid 1500s, it was the Ottoman vassal during these two centuries, similar to Walachia or Hungary at the time. Battle of Khresili was a Georgian reconquista, which ended Turkish presence in Imereti. Imereti kingdom regained its full independence from Ottoman Empire after several subsequent repeat Turkish invasions, following battle of Khresili, were defeated as well. Ottomans were eventually forced to sign a treaty with kingdom of Imereti, which stated that Imereti was no longer Ottoman vassal, and the only remnant of past Ottoman glory in this treaty was an annual tribute of 60 women (of any ethnic origin, not necessarily Georgians), which king Solomon failed to honor anyway. The Ottomans wanted to destroy Solomon I and his supporters, and to finally conquer western Georgia The aim of the Georgians was to clear Imereti of Turks, which was successfully achieved. Battle Early in the morning, the Georgians started the attack. Ottoman army was cornered exactly where king Solomon I wanted them. Georgian attack was well prepared, numerically smaller Georgian army compensated its small size by high morale and determination to wipe out invading Turks from their land. King Solomon personally led his small army's charge, reached the commander of Turkish army and cut his head off. Turks panicked and tried to escape. Georgians decisively defeated the Ottoman army, and slaughtered most of 45,000 Turkish invasion force. Ottomans never recovered from such a massive loss of manpower. Two further attempts to invade Imereti after this battle were with smaller Ottoman armies of 20,000 and 13,000 people strong, and while they were still numerically superior to Solomon I's small army, they were defeated just as well. This marked the end of two centuries of Turkish influence in Western Georgia, during which kingdom of Imereti was a vassal of Ottoman Empire. Solomon I the Great and his small kingdom achieved in mid 1700s a full independence from Ottomans, without support from other great powers or external alliances, which was unprecedented for other Eastern European nations who were either conquered or became vassals of Ottoman Empire earlier than Imereti kingdom and gained independence from Ottomans much later than Imereti kingdom.

It was particularly common among the Lombard, Tuscan and, more generally, northern Italian municipalities. Later its use spread even outside Italy. It was the symbol of municipal autonomy. Priests celebrated Mass at the altar before the battle, and the trumpeters beside them encouraged the fighters to the fray. Defended by selected troops, paved with the colors of the municipality, it was generally pulled by oxen and carried an altar, a bell (called \\"martinella\\"), the heraldic signs of the city and a mast surmounted by a Christian cross. In peace time it was kept in the main church of the city to which it belonged. In battle the Carroccio was surrounded by the bravest warriors in the army as the Carroccio guard, and it served both as a rallying-point and as the palladium of the city's honour; its capture by the enemy was regarded as an irretrievable defeat and humiliation. History =Origins= Legnano, a history painting by Amos Cassioli (1832‚Äì1891). The Carroccio, which has Lombard origins, was initially used by Arimannia as a war chariot.D'Ilario, 1976, pp. 189-190. Its function became purely symbolic,D'Ilario, 1976, p. 190. with the addition of the cross, of the city signs, of the altar and with its preservation in the main church of the cityD'Ilario, 1976, p. 189. in a detectable moment between 1037 and 1039 thanks to the Archbishop of Milan Aribert, who imposed his use in one of the sieges that Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor did on several occasions in Milan.Guida d'Italia Touring Club Italiano, Milano Touring editore, 2007, p. 26 In other words, the Carroccio, from a military means, became a purely political instrument. From Milan its use spread in many municipalities of northern Italy, in Tuscany and outside Italy, until the decline in the 14th century. On medieval documents the Carroccio is called carochium, carozulum, carrocerum or carrocelum, while in the Milanese dialect of the time it was probably called car√≤cc or car√≤z.D'Ilario, 1976, p. 196. Its diffusion extended to other Lombard cities, but this cannot be explained as a pure reproduction of the Milanese Carroccio. Moreover, the descendants of the Arimannia, still at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, had maintained, in the medieval society of northern Italy, a certain autonomy and were recognizable for various specific prerogatives, although the Lombard domination had ended by a few centuries. =12th century= The battle of Legnano in a painting by Massimo d'Azeglio. In the background, one can see the cross and the city signs positioned on the Carroccio Documents of 1158 and 1201 confirm the presence of the Milanese Carroccio, in peacetime, in the church of San Giorgio al Palazzo, while others still inside the Palazzo della Ragione. The first document cited contains information on the need to make an iron shield to be placed in the choir of the mentioned church, which was located near the Carroccio, with the lighting of a votive fire fed by a pound of oil. The 1201 document contains similar information: the archbishop and the religious of the San Giorgio al Palazzo church in Milan should have lighted votive lamps around the Carroccio. In 1159 the municipal troops of Brescia conquered the Carroccio of the Cremona area during a battle. The cart was then carried in triumph between the streets of Brescia and was placed in the church of reference of the community, with the \\"martinella\\" which was positioned on the civic tower of the city.D'Ilario, 1976, p. 197. The Carroccio was the protagonist in the battle of Legnano (29 May 1176), during which he was defended, according to legend, by the Company of Death, led, according to popular tradition, by Alberto da Giussano, a fictional character who actually appeared only in literary works of the following century. According to the legend, during the fight, three doves out of the burials of the saints Sisinnio, Martirio and Alessandro at the basilica of San Simpliciano in MilanD'Ilario, 1976, p. 80. rested on the Carroccio causing the flight of Frederick Barbarossa.Marinoni, p. 37. Instead, according to the real historical facts, the municipal infantry arranged a decisive resistance around the Carroccio which allowed the remaining part of the Lombard League army, actually led by Guido da Landriano,Agnoletto, p. 39. to arrive from Milan and defeat Frederick Barbarossa in the famous clash of Legnano. Today it is difficult to establish precisely the exact location of the Carroccio in reference to the current topography of Legnano. One of the chronicles of the clash, the Cologne Annals, contain important information: View of the Castello park in Legnano. In the foreground we see part of the escarpment where, according to some hypotheses, the Carroccio may have been defended during the battle of Legnano. This would suggest that the Carroccio was located on the edge of a steep slope flanking the river Olona, so that the imperial cavalry, whose arrival was planned by Castellanza along the river, would have been forced to attack the center of the army of the Lombard League going up the escarpment:Agnoletto, p. 39. this decision later proved to be strategically incorrect, given that Frederick Barbarossa came instead from Borsano, or from the opposite side, which forced the municipal troops to resist around the Carroccio with the escape road blocked by the Olona. Considering the evolution of the clash, this could mean that the crucial phases in defense of the Carroccio have been fought on the territory of the San Martino contrada (more precisely, near the 15th century church of the same name, which in fact dominates a slope that descends towards the OlonaD'Ilario, 1984, p. 233.) or of the Legnanese quarter of \\"Costa di San Giorgio\\", since in another part of the neighboring areas it is not possible to identify another depression with the characteristics suitable for its defense.Percivaldi, p. 8. Considering the last hypothesis mentioned, the final clash could also have taken place on part of the territory now belonging to the contrade of Sant'Ambrogio and San Magno (between the quartier of \\"Costa di San Giorgio\\" and the Olona is still present a steep slope: this slope was later included in the Castello park) and to the municipality of San Giorgio su Legnano. =13th century= It was afterwards adopted by other cities, and first appears, after Legnano, on a Florentine battlefield in 1228. The Florentine Carroccio was usually followed by a smaller cart bearing the \\"martinella\\", a bell to ring out military signals. When war was regarded as likely the \\"martinell\\" was attached to the door of the Church of Santa Maria in the Mercato Nuovo in Florence and rung to warn both citizens and enemies. In times of peace the Carroccio was in the keeping of a great family which had distinguished itself by signal services to the republic. The Florentine carroccio was captured by the Ghibelline forces of Castruccio Castracani in the 1325 Battle of Altopascio, after which it was displayed by the victors in a triumph held in the streets of Lucca. The carro della guerra of Milan was described in detail in 1288 by Bonvesin de la Riva in his book on the \\"Marvels of Milan\\". Wrapped in scarlet cloth and drawn by three yoke of oxen that were caparisoned in white with the red cross of Saint George, the city's patron, it carried a crucifix so massive it took four men to step it in place, like a ship's mast.Bovesin de la Riva, De Magnalibus Mediolani: Meraviglie di Milano (Milan, 1998), as reported in John Dickie, Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and Their Food (New York, 2008), p. 33. The Carroccio of the Lombard League was captured by the imperials in 1237 during the battle of Cortenuova, donated to Pope Gregory IX by the emperor Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and transported to the Palazzo Senatorio in Rome in what is still called the Sala del Carroccio (\\"Room of Carroccio\\"), where the commemorative inscription of the gift is kept made by the emperor to the Roman people. The inscription reads:Br√©holles, p. 132.D'Ilario, 1976, p. 193. Plaque commemorates the departure of the Carroccio in San Simpliciano church towards Legnano just before the homonymous battle Rome, in addition to being the seat of the papacy, was also the capital of a vast empire, and therefore the sending of the Carroccio to the city by the emperor had a strong symbolic meaning. In particular, in 1237 the Lega Lombarda lost the Carroccio in battle because of the muddy roads, which prevented the municipal troops from putting it safely in time. In 1275 it was the Carroccio of the Bolognese (who were Guelphs) to be captured in the battle of San Procolo by the Forlivese, who were instead Ghibellines, and to be brought in triumph to Forl√¨. In the mid-13th century the Carroccio di Cremona was instead captured in battle by the municipal militias of Parma. Accounts of the Carroccio will be found in most histories of the Italian republics.; see, for instance, Matteo Villani's Chronache, vi. 5 (Florence, 1825-1826); P. Villari, The Two First Centuries of Florentine History, vol. i. (Engl. transl., London, 1894); Gino Capponi, Storia della Repubblica di Firenze, vol. i. (Florence, 1875) =14th century: decay and disappearance= The decadence of the Carroccio occurred due to the evolution of war tactics. When larger and more manoeuvrable armies began to appear, the municipal infantry were replaced by soldiers of \\"ventura\\", who, being mercenaries, lacked emotional ties and belonging to the city. The symbolic value of the Carroccio, in this historical context, was therefore less. Moreover, from a logistical point of view, the Carroccio, being a very slow vehicle drawn by oxen, was not very mobile, and often created obstacles to the actions of war, which were becoming faster and faster. For these reasons, the Carroccio, in the 14th century, went inexorably towards a phase of decadence which then led to its disappearance from the battlefields. =The use of the Carroccio outside Italy= Similar cart-mounted standards were also to be found elsewhere in Europe, at the Battle of the Standard (1138), employed by the English, and at the Battle of Sirmium (1167), employed by the Hungarians.‚ÄúA carroccio made an appearance in England with the English army fighting for King Stephen at Northallerton in 1138 (the Battle of the Standard).‚Äù Jim Bradbury, The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare, Routledge (2004) p.238 Treadgold, Warren (1997). A History of the Byzantine State and Society. p. 646. Stanford University Press. . In addition, the Carroccio was also used in 1214 in the Battle of Bouvines. Function In addition to the already mentioned symbolic value, the Carroccio had an important military tactical function.D'Ilario, 1976, p. 192. He began to gain military value especially after the battle of Legnano, where, between the first times in history, the infantry, which was gathered around the Carroccio, held the chivalry head. Until then, the latter was in fact considered clearly superior to the soldiers on foot. Since the infantry gathered around the Carroccio, the latter, besides having a strong symbolic value, therefore had an important tactical function: with the capture of the Carroccio, for the municipal militias, the defeat was almost certain. Also for this reason, the Carroccio, in addition to being considered the most coveted war booty, was kept in the cathedrals, which were the most important churches of the municipalities, and was the protagonist, always in times of peace, of the most important ceremonies and events that took place in the cities. In addition to the war purpose, the Carroccio had other functions, which could also be carried out in times of peace. The leaders of the municipalities, on the Carroccio, could make important decisions concerning the city, while the judges could use it as a mobile tribunal to issue their sentences. The Lombard Lega infantry, during the battle of Legnano, managed to resist the various attacks perpetrated by the imperial cavalry due to the tactics of the latter, which foresaw assaults on small disorganized groups. Only after the clash of Legnano did the cavalry begin to change strategy, attacking the infantry in defense of the Carroccio in conspicuous organized forces, thus succeeding in breaking its resistance. This change in war strategy contributed, together with the reasons already mentioned in the previous paragraph, to the decadence and disappearance of the Carroccio from the battlefields. Description =The remains that survived= Reproduction of the Carroccio during the historical parade of the Palio di Legnano 2015 In Brescia there is a cross that probably belonged to the flagpole of the Carroccio from Cremona conquered in 1191 at the battle of the Malamorte.Tucci, p. 4. Inside the Siena Cathedral, on the other hand, two large 10-15 meter spars are preserved, which traditionally refers to the Carroccio, victorious from the battle of Montaperti. In Cremona, in the civic museum, there is a wooden platform that is thought to have belonged to the cart of the wagon taken from the Milanese in 1213 in Castelleone. =In the chronicles= Since there are very few surviving remains from medieval times, information on the shape of the Carroccio is fragmentary. Alessandro Visconti, in a book from 1945, referring to the chronicler Arnulf of Milan, reports this description: It is possible to imagine the size of the Carroccio banner taking as a reference the banner of the bishop of the city of W√ºrzburg, used in 1266 during the battle of Kitzingen and kept at the Mainfrankisches Museum. The banner is three meters by five with the image of Saint Kilian. Two depictions of the Carroccio in the Middle Ages reached the 21st century iconographically: the first is present in the Montauri Chronicles of Siena, and the second in the Chronicle of Giovanni Villani.Voltmer, pp. 183-184. The two representations are the result of stories by non-ocular chroniclers, being the authors of the 14th and 15th centuries, therefore of an era where the presence of the Carroccio in everyday life had by now disappeared. The first representation shows only two movable flagpoles, one with the help of the other, while in the second image, where there is a four-wheeled cart with a flag, the subject is shown in more detail. The same image of the Carroccio is present in a fresco by Stradanus dedicated to the House of Medici, which depicts Piazza della Signoria during the feast of John the Baptist. It is therefore probable that three types of Carroccio existed: the first \\"classic\\" on the Milanese model, the Tuscan one with two flagpoles (with the Carroccio of Florence that presented a bell), and the one widespread in Flanders and Germany, which was a simple cart with a central flagpole. From the description, made by Salimbene di Adam, of the dismantling of the one captured by the Parmesans to the Cremonese during the Battle of Parma in 1248, it can be deduced that there were five parts of the Carroccio: four wheels, a platform, the flagpole, the flag and various decorations. The wheels were very large, and were usually painted red in Milan and Florence, white in Parma, and in precious colors not specified in Siena and Padua. The flagpole, according to the description of Bonvesin da la Riva, weighed as four men and was usually supported by ropes (certainly that of Milan). In the Chigi codex, the Florentine Carroccio presents two flagpoles and the flag, which very often was not fixed to a side bar, was in precious fabric usually divided into two halved colors, or it was decorated with a cross motif. Unlike in Northern Europe, the representation of the patron saint did not appear on Italian wagons, where it was often depicted as decoration of the front body. The tow of the Carroccio was usually executed by oxen or - very rarely - by horses. =The \\"martinella\\"= On the right, the Carroccio during the battle of Legnano on a painting by Amos Cassioli The use of the bell (the \\"martinella\\") is still controversial. It is not clear whether he was directly on the Carroccio or else he followed on another vehicle. The function of recall of the soldiers around the Carroccio was carried out by the \\"martinella\\", while the trumpeters imparted the orders and, very often, incited the troop to the combat.D'Ilario, 1976, p. 192. In 2000 the original \\"martinella\\" of the Battle of Legnano was identified: it was kept on the bell tower of the hermitage of Sant'Alberto di Butrio of Ponte Nizza, in the province of Pavia. In the same year of the discovery, it was paraded during the historical procession of the Palio di Legnano.Ferrarini, p. 188. =The specialis magister= The specialis magister, who took care of the maintenance of the Carroccio, was paid by the municipality, for his service, 8 soldi a day. In addition to checking the functionality of the wagon, the specialis magister participated in the war actions in which the Carroccio was involved by dressing armor and carrying a sword. On the Carroccio a chaplain was also present, whose function was to celebrate Mass on the altar placed on the Carroccio. Also this religious figure, together with that of the cleric, was paid by the municipality. In the literature The first literary trace of the Carroccio appears in the poem by Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, French troubadour of the 12th century, entitled \\"Il Carros\\", where the man of letters, turning his flattery to Beatrice, daughter of Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat, states that the Lombard women rivals in beauty of the girl they use a Carroccio and other chariots to \\"fight\\" the growing fame of the girl.Voltmer, p. 6. Giacomo da Lentini, imperial official of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, dealt with the Carroccio in the song Ben m'√® venuto, which is a poetic piece of love inspired by the poems of the troubadours and probably composed before the battle of Cortenuova (between 1233 and 1237). The Carroccio in the modern era =Posthumous meaning= Reproduction of the Carroccio during the historical parade of the Palio di Legnano 2015 Since the Carroccio is a signum, in modern times it has become a symbol of ideas, hopes and different meanings, very often as anti-tyrannical propaganda during the period of the Signorias, up to Romanticism and the Risorgimento, where it became the symbol of the struggle against the occupation foreign. Important promoters of these ideas were Massimo d'Azeglio, Giovanni Berchet, Amos Cassioli, Francesco Hayez. Giosu√® Carducci first and Giovanni Pascoli then recalled, with the Canzone di Legnano and Canzone del Carroccio, the splendours and splendours of medieval Italian comunes, concepts that were later taken up also by the writings of Gabriele D'Annunzio. =Commemorations= In the festivals and historical re-enactments, very often, the pivotal figure is represented by the Carroccio: Reproduction of the Carroccio of Siena during the Palio 2006 *In the Palio di Siena (2 July - 16 August) the Carroccio, which parades with the black-and-white sock of the municipality, carries the Palio (also known as \\"cencio\\"), or a painted silk drapery, prize of the horse race (called also \\"carriera\\") which closes the event. The bell and the heralds represent the final moment of the Corteo Storico, before the carriera for the conquest of the rag. *In the Palio di Legnano (last Sunday of May), a copy of the Carroccio parades through the streets of Legnano pulled by oxen. This wagon, which concludes the historical procession, carries the Cross of Aribert, the coveted prize of the horse race in which the eight contrade in which Legnano is divided compete in the stadio Giovanni Mari. The Carroccio, during the historical procession, which closes at the stadio Giovanni Mari, is escorted by some figurants who impersonate Alberto da Giussano and the Company of Death. The latter, before the horse race, recall the charge made, according to legend, by the Company of Death and Alberto da Giussano during the battle of Legnano. *In the Palio di Asti (third Sunday of September), the Carroccio is pulled by three pairs of oxen and brings, as tradition dictates, the insignia of the city (a white cross on a red field), a wrought iron rooster (symbol of freedom municipal), and the Palio di Asti, the coveted prize of the winner of the horse race. It is a historical reconstruction of the medieval Asti Carroccio and bears the altar with a reproduction of Secundus of Asti, present in the Gothic choir of the Asti Cathedral. On the Carroccio di Asti there is also the \\"martinella\\", or the bell that once served to call the municipal troops to pray before the battle. It is kept in the Collegiate Church of San Secondo, from which it comes out only once a year, on the occasion of the Palio race, on the third Sunday of September.

Growing originally in the 19th century around mills located on the Shawsheen River, the village is a local historic district, boasting many varieties of historic architecture and a rich industrial heritage.  History  Ballardvale, Massachusetts In the 18th century, the Shawsheen River and its water power attracted the Ballard Family, who came and built grist and saw mills. At this time the area became known as Ballard's Vale, eventually Ballardvale. In 1836 John and William Marland established the Ballardvale Manufacturing Company. The company produced the first wool worsted made in America, as well as the first wool flannel. Additional mills were built and shoes, carriages, locomotives, and stoneware pottery were also made in Ballard Vale. However, it was white flannels that made the village famous: Ballard Vale white flannels won prizes at the Columbian and Louisiana Purchase expositions. By 1848, two mills, the Ballardvale Manufacturing Company and Whipple File Company, a factory-owned store, a schoolhouse, a railroad depot and houses were nestled in the Vale. Streets were laid out and previously undeveloped land was subdivided into house lots and many residences were built. The village continued to revolve around manufacturing for many years, until the mid-20th century when most manufacturing, especially fabric mills, moved out of New England.  Shawsheen River  The Shawsheen River has always played an important role in Ballardvale, powering its earliest mills. The Ballardvale Millpond and dam on Andover Street are focal points of the area. By the start of the 20th century, Ballardvale had become a center for river outings. Couples paddled canoes along the Shawsheen or took rides on the motor yacht William Ballard. The river remains popular with canoeists. A prominent access point is adjacent to the dam. Today the Shawsheen River Reservation, owned and operated by the Andover Village Improvement Society (A.V.I.S.), runs along the river from the village towards central Andover. The reservation is designed both to preserve natural resources and to provide space for passive reservation, such as walking. The Shawsheen River is home to many animals like geese, swans, and many kinds of fish.  Historic architecture  Ballardvale is home to many fine examples of 19th-century architecture. Styles represented include Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne style Victorian. Historic homes include both those originally occupied by mill workers as well as mill owners. Ballardvale is a locally recognized Historic District, with specialized zoning regulating changes made to properties in the area.  Transportation  The railroad has always been important to Ballardvale, with a rail line running north‚Äìsouth through the village. Local as well as distance trains ran through the village starting on July 3, 1848. According to Boston & Maine railroad reports, a 'large and commodious station house' was built. In 1881, 56 feet of the original 135 feet of the station was turned 90 degrees and moved to 174 Andover Street, where it still exists. This portion of the station remained the property of B&M; railroad until 1925. The other 78 feet was torn down around 1950. Today \\"Ballardvale\\" is a stop on the Haverhill line of the commuter rail operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Pan Am Railways freight trains also run regularly through the village. There is a gated railroad crossing at the intersection of Andover and Tewksbury Streets.  Other village features  Despite being located within the larger town of Andover, Ballardvale is still a functioning village, with its own local resources. A U.S. Post Office, fire station, pizza parlor, and retail shops are all located along Andover Street. The village is home to two churches. The historic St. Joseph's on High Vale Street, built in 1881, is a \\"mission church\\" of St. Augustine's in downtown Andover, and remains open for Sunday Mass. Ballardvale United, on Clark Road, was formed in 1955 after the union of two smaller churches, the Union Congregational Church and Methodist Episcopal Church. The Ballardvale Green is a small park located at the intersection of Andover Street and Center Street. Across the way is a large playground, where generations of children have played. The site was for many years occupied by a large public boarding house. Located around the corner on Clark Road, the Burns Reservation, owned and operated by the Andover Village Improvement Society (A.V.I.S.) is tract of undeveloped woods and wetland. The Union Congregational Church still stands, though it has been altered by multiple fires. In the 1970s it was used as a paint/hardware store. After another fire it was rebuilt as a residence.

Biography Johann Adolf Freiherr von Thielmann Thielmann was born at Dresden. Entering the Saxon cavalry in 1782, he saw service against the French in the Rhine campaigns and served on the side of Prussia in the Jena campaign. After the disaster of Jena, Thielmann was sent by Saxony as ambassador to Napoleon I, became his ardent admirer, and did much to bring about the Franco- Saxon alliance. Thielmann accompanied the Saxon contingent which fought at the siege of Danzig and at Friedland. In 1809, as colonel of Free-Corps, he opposed the advance of the Austrians into Saxony, and was rewarded for his services with the grade of major-general, further promotion to lieutenant- general following in 1810. As commander of the Saxon Heavy Cavalry Brigade he took part in the advance on Moscow two years later, and his exceptional bravery at Borodino attracted the attention of Napoleon, who took Thielmann into his own suite. His own sovereign at the same time made him Freiherr. In the war of the Sixth Coalition, Thielmann, now von Thielmann, took a prominent part. As governor of Torgau, by his king's orders he at first observed the strictest neutrality, but on receipt of an order to hand over the fortress to the French he resigned his command and, accompanied by his staff officer Aster, joined the Coalition. As a Russian general he was employed in reorganizing the Saxon army after Leipzig, and in 1814 he commanded the Saxon corps operating in the Low Countries. Graves of three Prussian generals at the cemetery of Coblenz ‚Äî von Thielmann's is in the foreground to the right Early in the following year he became a lieutenant-general in the Prussian service, and in command of the III Corps (with Carl von Clausewitz as his chief of staff) he took part in the Waterloo campaign. From the field of Ligny he retired with the rest of Bl√ºcher's army on Wavre, and when the other corps marched towards Waterloo, von Thielmann defended this movement against Grouchy, fighting in the Battle of Wavre (18‚Äì19 June 1815), thus contributing materially to the victory at Waterloo. Later in life, he was a corps commander at M√ºnster (VII Corps) and at Coblenz (VIII Corps), and at the latter place he died in 1824, as a general of cavalry.

He was a leading member of the New Sculpture movement in his early career when he created sculptures with elements of Art Nouveau and Symbolism, often combining different materials such as marble and bronze in a single piece. While his later works were more traditional in style, Frampton had a prolific career in which he created many notable public monuments, including several statues of Queen Victoria and later, after World War I, a number of war memorials. These included the Edith Cavell Memorial in London, which, along with the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens are possibly Frampton's best known works. Biography =Early life= Frampton was born on 18 June 1860 in London, where his father was a woodcarver and stonemason. George Frampton began his own working life as a stone carver in 1878, working on the H√¥tel de Ville in Paris. Frampton returned to London to study under William Silver Frith at the South London Technical School of Art during 1880 and 1881. He went on to the Royal Academy Schools where, between 1881 and 1887 he won a gold medal and travelling scholarship. While still studying at the Royal Academy, Frampton undertook a number of sculpture commissions including, in 1885, pieces for the facade of both the Constitutional Club in Northumberland Avenue and for the Chelsea Conservative Club. He also created a alterpiece for Manchester Cathedral, some decorative pieces for the Henry Fawcett Memorial in London and a pair of terracotta figures representing Concord and Industry which were exhibited in Paris and purchased for the Municipal Building in Christchurch, New Zealand. From 1887 to 1890 Frampton studied and worked at the studio of Antonin Mercie in Paris, where he also studied painting under Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret and Gustave Courtois. =Early works= Lamia (1899‚Äì1900 St Mungo as the Patron of Art and Music, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum Frampton returned to England and, briefly, worked in the studio of Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm. He then took up a teaching post at the Slade School of Art in 1893 and was also, for a year, the joint head of the Central School of Arts and Crafts. By this time, Frampton was, according to the critic M.H. Spielmann \\"in open rebellion against white sculpture\\". In 1893 he showed Mysteriarch, a polychromatic plaster bust with Symbolism motifs at the Royal Academy and, two years later he showed another polychromatic work, Mother and Child at the same venue. Mother and Child has bronze figures, of Frampton's wife and son, set against a copper plaque, and a white enamel disc behind the mother's head. In his statue of Dame Alice Owen (1895) Frampton combined bronze and marble, and, later, with the bust Lamia (1899-1900) he contrasted an ivory head and neck with bronze clothing inlaid with opels. In 1896 Frampton exhibited, with the architect Charles Harrison Townsend, a large fireplace in American walnut at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. The fireplace was decorated with an innovative tree and foliage design by Frampton that was subsequently much imitated by Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts designers and became known as the 'Frampton tree'. Frampton used a similar design in his 1897 memorial to Charles Mitchell for St George's Church in Jesmond in Newcastle upon Tyne. These works, and others, brought Frampton considerable recognition. The University of St Andrews awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1894. In 1897 examples of Frampton's work featured at the Venice Biennale and at the Vienna Secession the following year. He exhibited at the La Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels and showed four pieces at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900 for which he was awarded the Grand Prix. Recognition also brought Frampton two significant public commissions at this time. The architect John William Simpson appointed Frampton as master sculptor for the decoration of the facade of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. As well as overseeing the work of several other sculptors, Frampton created a bronze sculpture group and three sets of stone spandrels for the north porch of the new building. The sculpture group, of St Mungo attended by the muses of Art and Music, in the central arch of the porch contains Symbolism style motiffs featuring trees, bells and fishes similar to those Frampron had used in some of his earlier smaller pieces. Frampton's other commission was for a frieze on the facade of the Lloyd's Register building in Fenchurch Street in London. There, Frampton created, at first floor level, a frieze in Portland stone of female figures representing Trade, Commerce and Shipping with four bronze statuettes at key points. Both commissions, but especially the Fenchurch Street frieze, were widely praised at the time. =Later career= In April 1897 a public meeting in Kolkata agreed to raise funds to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria and, eventually, commissioned Frampton to create a statue of the monarch. Photographs of Frampton's model for the statue were published in the July 1898 edition of The Studio. The accompanying text described a figure over twice life-size, seated under a canopy, wearing the robe of the Order of the Star of India, decorated in gold, ivory and lapis lazuli. The completed statue, which was considerably less ornate and without a canopy, was shipped to India early in 1901 and erected on a temporary site in March 1902. The statue was subsequently moved to a location in front of the Victoria Memorial, where it was sited on a large architectural podium. The death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 led to Frampton receiving several commissions for memorials to the Queen. Frampton based several of these on his design of a seated figure he used for the Kolkata statue but with some variations. He used the same cast for the Leeds and St Helens's statues but changed the style of the decorative details and pedestals between them. A further version was created for the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg in 1904. A different design of a much younger, standing Victoria was created for the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1906 and was unveiled by her son King Edward VII in the same year. Sir George James Frampton in 1915 Among Frampton's other notable public sculptures are the figures of Peter Pan playing a set of pipes, the lions at the British Museum and the Edith Cavell Memorial that stands outside the National Portrait Gallery, London. The original Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens, London, was commissioned by J.M. Barrie in 1912. Barrie was said to be disappointed at Frampton's depiction of Peter Pan, in particular at his choice of model for the figure of the boy. However such was the popularity of the statue, six more casts were made which are now situated in: * Perth, Western Australia, Australia * Parc d'Egmont, Brussels, Belgium * Bowring Park, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada * Toronto, Canada * Sefton Park, Liverpool, England * Camden, New Jersey, United States. A number of his works can be seen at the restored St James' Church, Warter in East Yorkshire. Frampton created Dr Barnardo's Memorial, in Barkingside, London, in 1908, a work he undertook without claiming a fee. Frampton worked with Sir Edwin Lutyens on two of the architect's war memorials in the aftermath of the First World War‚ÄîHove War Memorial in East Sussex and Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire (unveiled in February and August 1921 respectively). Both feature a bronze statue of Saint George, sculpted by Frampton atop a column designed by Lutyens. Personal life Frampton's first house and studio was at 32 Queen's Grove (where a blue plaque to his name has been erected), but he later built a larger house nearby in Carlton Hill, both in St John's Wood, London. He was married to the artist Christabel Cockerell and had one son, the painter and etcher Meredith Frampton. He was an active member of The Art Workers' Guild and became Master in 1902. He sculpted the Art Workers' Guild's Master's Jewel in silver representing 'Art is Unity' He died on 21 May 1928 aged 67 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 25 May. His ashes lie in a niche on the ground floor of the east wing of the Ernest George Columbarium. A memorial sculpted by Ernest Gillick in 1930 depicting a bronze child holding a miniature copy of Frampton's statue of Peter Pan is located in the Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral.

General Totleben agreed to help. As soon as the small army of Erekle and large army of Totleben were about to meet and merge, Totleben and his army changed course and returned to Russia.

The validity of the program has been disputed, as it has not been subject to any conclusive study that meets the criteria for a randomised controlled trial. Origin Dore, previously known as DDAT (Dyslexia Dyspraxia Attention Treatment), was initiated by businessman Wynford Dore for his daughter Susie who was diagnosed as severely dyslexic and became depressed and suicidal. After being told that there was no cure for dyslexia, Wynford began working with a team of researchers to investigate Harold Levinson's claim that the cerebellum is linked to the types of symptoms Susie was experiencing. Roy Rutherford, a friend of Wynford's, suggested that an underdeveloped cerebellum may be the cause of Susie's symptoms. The Dore programme was subsequently developed for Susie and, after she began to read and write, then made available to others. According to a video released by Dore, conditions such as dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADD, Autism, Asperger syndrome and ADHD are linked to cerebellar function. Dore Program Practitioners believe that it is possible to treat difficulties in areas such as reading, attention, coordination, and social skills by developing these neural pathways. The Dore method The theory behind the Dore method is that skills such as reading and writing are learned through practice and become automatic because the cerebellum allows the learning process to occur at the maximum rate of efficiency. The Dore method alleges that, as skills become more automatic, the working memory required to perform a task decreases. The Dore Programme aims to stimulate the development of the cerebellum and hence to strengthen the communications between the cerebrum and cerebellum. =Suitability= The Dore programme stipulates that clients must be 7 years of age or older; younger clients would be more difficult to accurately assess. Adults of all ages are believed to be suitable for Dore. Dore Programme effectiveness The effectiveness of the Dore Programme is disputed. The first study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dore programme was published in Dyslexia in 2003, which reported improvements in writing, reading, and comprehension of 35 school-aged students at Balsall Common School in Warwickshire, UK on standardised testing. Most of the study participants did not have any diagnosed learning difficulties: six had dyslexia, two had developmental coordination disorder and one had ADHD. Some of the remainder were identified as 'at risk' on the basis of the Dyslexia Screening Test, but the majority of children did not have severe difficulties. A follow-up to this study was published in Dyslexia in 2006, and, upon reevaluating the students, the authors report significant improvements in writing, reading, and comprehension, as well as ADHD attention skills. Studies on efficacy with the target clinical groups have yet to be replicated in a peer-reviewed medical journal, and where control data are available, the evidence of gains in literacy associated with the Dore programme needs to be further validated. Research =Of the treatment= The Dore Programme treatment has been studied and continues to be the subject of further research. The study by Reynolds et al. has been challenged. For example, a control group was included only for a subset of assessments, and not for follow up; little information was provided on the test scores or treatment status of children in the experimental group who were not followed up.http://www.mentalhealthwatch.org/reports/dore2.shtml The two authors of the research defended it as showing significant and maintained gains in coordination after treatment. A number of papers published in the British Dyslexia Association's journal have found the apparently independent academic research Dore initially offered in support of the treatment to be the subject of some debate. According to an article published in the Times Educational Supplement in 2004, many of Britain's foremost academics maintain that the results need to be replicated. =Into early claims= The UK's Independent Television Commission and Ofcom upheld complaints made about a 2002 news item on British television in which Sir Trevor McDonald hailed DDAT as a \\"breakthrough in the treatment of dyslexia.\\" It repeated this decision about a later item on Richard & Judy, and found a television commercial made by DDAT to be in breach of Advertising Standards Code Rules for creating a false impression of the medical evidence, and implying that professional medical advice and support would be part of the treatment. In all these cases, however, they stated that: \\"the ITC does not express, nor does it seek to express, any view whatsoever on DDAT as an organisation or the relative efficacy of its treatment for dyslexia, neither of which was the subject of this finding.\\" The complaints were mainly about claims that this was new and pioneering research when many elements date back to at least 30 years before the DDAT was founded. =Controversy= After the British journal Dyslexia published one paper about the Dore programme in 2003, the paper was followed by ten critical commentariesCritical commentaries of Reynolds et al. 2003:   and one commentator resigned from Dyslexia's editorial board. In 2006, five members of the board of directors resigned in protest of the publication of a follow-up article highly favorable of Dore, citing concerns about the methodology used in the study and financial conflicts of interest due to Dore's involvement in funding the research. The editor of Dyslexia defended the decision to publish,EL(3)-09-07 : Paper 2 : Evidence to the Committee on Dyslexia Support in Wales - Professor Angela Fawcett - Director of the Centre for Child Research, Swansea University and the authors of the original Dore research paper responded vigorously to these criticisms and continued to support their findings and conclusions.** =Advertising Standards Authority rules against Dore= In December 2009, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered Dore to take down advertisements it posted via Google links that claimed the program offered help for dyslexia, Asperger syndrome, and ADHD developmental coordination disorder. Dore attempted to defend the ads by citing two studies supporting its claims, but the ASA ruled that the advertisements' claims were unsupported by the studies and were misleading.ASA ruling on Dore advertisements: Financial history In May 2008 the DDAT company (Dyslexia Dyspraxia Attention Treatment), went into liquidation in the UK. On 23 January 2009, Dynevor Ltd acquired the intellectual property rights and the assets of the Dore programme from Wynford Dore and CDT Ltd.

Born Jean √âmile Louis Scutenaire in Ollignies, Belgium; died in Brussels. Life Louis Scutenaire is chiefly remembered as a central figure in the Belgian Surrealist movement, along with Ren√© Magritte, Paul Noug√©, Marcel Lecomte and his own wife Ir√®ne Hamoir. He studied law at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and was a criminal lawyer from 1931 to 1944. In 1926 he discovered surrealism and was a primary contributor to the Revue surr√©aliste. He was sympathetic to communism during the 1930s and 1940s but as the truth about Joseph Stalin's regime became more apparent, he grew disenchanted with it and became an anarchist. After the Second World War he became a civil servant in the Belgian Ministry of the Interior, a job he kept for the rest of his life. Scutenaire grew disillusioned with the increasing commercialisation of Surrealism after the Second World War, but this did not apparently impair his close friendship with the most famous Belgian surrealist Ren√© Magritte. Scutenaire and his wife would visit the Magritte home on Sundays, where Scutenaire would be invited to give titles to Magritte's recent paintings; 170 of the paintings still bear the titles that Scutenaire suggested. (He is also the model for the figure in Magritte's canvas Universal Gravitation.) Scutenaire's published works include a series of books entitled Mes Inscriptions, collections of gnomic and mischievous aphorisms, as well as one of the earliest and most entertaining monographs on Magritte. He was awarded in 1985 the Grand Prix sp√©cial de l'Humour noir in recognition of his achievements as a writer with a lifelong distrust of authority and institution. He died twenty years to the hour after his friend Magritte, just after watching a television programme on the painter.

Black describes noise as the opposite of information: hype, inaccurate ideas, and inaccurate data. His theory states that noise is everywhere in the economy and we can rarely tell the difference between it and information. Noise has two broad implications. *It allows speculative trading to occur (see below). *It is indicative of market inefficiency. Loudon and Della Bitta (1988) refer to noise as ‚Äúa type of disruption in the communication process‚Äù and go further stating that \\"each state of the communication process is susceptible to (this) message distortion.\\" (As cited in Wu & Newell, 2003). Therefore, we can say that noise is a disruption within the communication process and can be found in all forms within the communication process. Some examples of noise could be distortion of a television advertisement or interference of a radio broadcast. This therefore would mean that your reception of the information could be misunderstood as your reception of the information has been interfered with, meaning you may not receive the message in the way the sender is implying. Another, and probably more likely, example of noise is whilst an ad break is occurring on television, the reception of the ad has been interrupted by your mobile phone, meaning you do not fully and clearly receive and decode the information the advertisement is trying to deliver. What also must be considered when looking at the idea of noise is the understanding that the more the sender and receiver have in common, the less likely it will be for noise to have an effect on the encoding of the message. For example, if the receiver did not understand a symbol or the symbol had a different meaning to the receiver then it did to the sender, this would mean the receiver could encode the message in a different way to how the sender had intended.  Types of Noise  Environmental or External Noise. ‚ÄúThis consists of sounds and visual distractions that are present in the environment where the viewing takes place.‚Äù (Wu & Newell, 2003) An example of this is using a mobile phone whilst watching a television advertisement, as the mobile is within the external environment and could have an impact, as a distraction, on how the receiver decodes the message. Clutter is another type of noise. Russel and Lane (1996) define clutter as ‚Äú\\"non-program material carried during or between shows including commercials, public service announcements, and program promotional spots‚Äù (as cited in Wu & Newell, 2003). Therefore, if the television advertisement had been shown after a public service announcement, the receiver could be distracted, thinking about what was discussed within the announcement, as opposed to being fully focused on the television advertisement. Internal Noise is the third type of noise to be considered. MacInnis and Jaworski (1989, as cited in Wu & Newell, 2003) and MacInnis, et al. (1991 also cited in Wu & Newell, 2003) imply that the decoding of a message within an advertisement could be affected by the internal noise of the receiver. Internal noise being thoughts and concerns. The relationship between internal noise and the decoding of messages as a receiver does not yet have evidence through market research. (As cited in Wu & Newell, 2003). Continuing on from this, it is clear that if the audience of an advertisement was focused on a thought or concern in their mind, they would not decode the message within the advertisement in the same way.  Finance  People trade speculatively because they disagree about the future, making different predictions about the fate of companies and commodity prices, among other economic variables. These disagreements stem from the fact that everyone interprets information or data differently and subjectively. But because of the complex nature of the world's markets, not all market data is \\"information.\\" Much of the daily price fluctuation is due to random change rather than meaningful trends, creating the problem of discerning real information from noise. This problem is what drives trading in a market; if everyone knew all things, then no speculative trades would occur because it is a zero-sum game. In real life, however, trades occur as a kind of bet on what is noise and what is information; generally the more skillful, and technologically advanced, \\"gambler\\" wins. This trade takes place between what Black calls information traders and noise traders, where the former operates based on accurate information and the latter trades based on noise. Unfortunately, there is no way of precisely parsing the noise and information from a data stream or signal, so the so-called noise traders tend to think that they, in fact, trade on information that others in the market simply reject as noise. Thus, methods of parsing noise and information from a signal are becoming increasingly important in the market-place, especially as strategies used by high-tech alternative investment firms, such as some hedge funds.  Business Cycles  A particular type of trader Black makes special mention of is the entrepreneur. Like the above-mentioned traders, entrepreneurs have theories about what will happen and what is happening. In this case, though, they have theories as to what people want. When they are correct, there is a little boom; I make what you want, you make what I want, we trade and we are happy. But the world has noise and entrepreneurs make mistakes. They make things others don't want. Thus, they don't work as hard, money is wasted and the economy is harmed. When this happens on a massive scale, there is a bust. Critics argue that this disobeys the law of large numbers; with so many entrepreneurs trying, the aggregate success rate will be constant. (This assumes that producers are more or less independent; critics say they are, proponents say they're more interconnected.)  Econometrics  Black argues that econometrics is filled with it in the forms of unobservables and mis-measurement. No matter how many variables one puts into a model, there are always more to add but can't (ones you can't observe) and the ones you have will always have error. This is how noise manifests in econometrics (as well as poor interpretation of regressions, such as assuming correlation means causation).  References  * Noise. Fischer Black.

He was also commander of the organisation's cover name, the \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF), overseeing an assassination campaign against prominent republican figures whose details were included in a notorious \\"shopping list\\" derived from leaked security forces documents. The UDA used the UFF name when it wished to claim responsibility for attacks, thus allowing it to remain a legal paramilitary organisation until August 1992 when it was proscribed by the British Government. McMichael held political office as leader of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) from 1981 until his death. He was killed outside his home by a booby-trap car bomb which was carried out by the Provisional IRA. Ulster Defence Association John McMichael was born in Lisburn, County Antrim on 9 January 1948, one of the children of John and Annie McMichael. He came from a working-class background,Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: a History of the UDA. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p.92 and was brought up in the Church of Ireland religion. He had married twice and was the father of two sons, Gary and Saul.McMichael, Gary (1999). Ulster Voice: In Search of Common Ground in Northern Ireland. Colorado: Roberts Rinehart. p.27 McMichael, who owned and operated the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" pub in his native Lisburn,Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.169 initially rose to prominence in the UDA in the 1970s as the commander of the South Belfast Brigade and a member of its Inner Council, where he became known for his belief in the unique identity of Ulster Protestants, as well as his talent as an organiser. He had taken over command of the South Belfast UDA from Sammy Murphy, who had also led the Sandy Row unit. According to McDonald and Cusack, Murphy appeared to have been a commander rather than brigadier.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p.31 Described as the UDA's most \\"effective and strategic leader\\",Horgan, John (2009). Walking Away From Terrorism: Accounts of Disengagement from Radical and Extremist Movements. New York: Routledge. p.100 McMichael helped establish a political think tank called the New Ulster Political Research Group in 1977, and served as its chairman.Cain Web Service: Common Sense Retrieved 27 March 2011 He also assisted in the composition of a document entitled Beyond the Religious Divide which promoted independence for Northern Ireland along with a constitutional Bill of Rights‚Äîacceptable to both nationalists and unionists‚Äîas the \\"only hope of achieving a united Northern Ireland\\". This was the first step on the UDA's road to political development.Taylor, p.162 He was a supporter of the ideas of Ian Adamson a paediatrician, and subsequently a Unionist politician, who self-funded a series of books and pamphlets about the alleged ancient origins of Ulster people as a separate ethnic group to the Irish.McDonald & Cusack, p. 106 By 1979 he had emerged as the leading figure within the UDA and the organisation's most charismatic senior member. According to the Belfast Telegraph, he drew up a 'shopping list' of targets (mostly members of Sinn F√©in and other republican groups) that he felt the UDA should eliminate. Information about the individuals had been supplied to the UDA by individuals within the security forces who leaked the information.McDonald & Cusack, p. 116 McMichael hand-picked his own squad for this task and throughout 1980 a number of the targets were assassinated.\\"The UDA's killer wing: murder goes by any name\\". Belfast Telegraph. 12 November 2007 Retrieved 16 March 2011 The new commando unit, which was known internally in the UDA as the Ulster Defence Force, carried out four murders in 1979, three of which were from the \\"shopping list\\". McMichael then turned his attention to members of the Relatives' Action Committee and on his orders Irish Independence Party leader John Turnley and Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) activist Miriam Daly, both prominent within this republican prisoners' rights group, were killed. Rodney McCormick, a less prominent IRSP member, was killed in Larne soon afterwards before McMichael's team struck again, killing Irish republican Ronnie Bunting and his friend Noel Lyttle at Bunting's Turf Lodge home on 15 October 1980.McDonald & Cusack, p. 117 However the attacks came to an end in 1981, following an ambush by the Parachute Regiment after a failed attempt by the UFF on the lives of former MP Bernadette Devlin McAliskey and her husband, Michael McAliskey, at their home in Coalisland, County Tyrone, during which the three-man unit (including Ray Smallwoods who acted as the getaway driver) were captured and later imprisoned. Devlin McAliskey, who was shot seven times in front of her children, survived, as did her husband. McMichael himself was arrested in April 1981 in the wake of a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) raid on UDA headquarters. He was brought before the court as it was alleged he and his men had organised the McAliskey shootings.Taylor, p.168 Raymond Murray in his book SAS in Ireland claimed that the McAliskey shootings were planned in a room above McMichael's \\"Admiral Benbow\\"pub.Raymond Murray(1990). The SAS in Ireland. Ireland: Mercier Press. p.263 Ultimately charges relating to McMichael's involvement, as well as his possession of classified information in the form of the details of republican activists leaked to him, were dropped along with similar charges against fellow arrestees Sammy McCormick, John McClatchey, Eddie Martin and Bobby McDevitt.McDonald & Cusack, p. 124 McMichael's \\"shopping list\\" was published in the press soon after the failed assassination attempt on McAliskey, apparently leaked by his internal opponents within the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, p. 118 Michael Farrell was named as the next target, although he moved to Dublin before any attack could occur. The IRA responded to the revelations by killing two prominent Unionist figures, James Stronge and his father Norman at their Tynan Abbey home. McMichael would return to the idea at later times and during the mid to late 1980s had Michael Stone working directly under him as a lone gunman with a remit to kill alleged republicans.McDonald & Cusack, p. 148 Electoral politics McMichael depicted on a mural in the \\"Village\\" area of Donegall Road with the titles of the two documents he was involved in producing McMichael came to support the ideas of republican Danny Morrison regarding the Armalite and ballot box strategy and felt that the UDA should also build up a political wing to this end. As a result, following the murder of Robert Bradford, he stood as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party candidate in the by-election for Bradford's South Belfast seat and ran the most high-profile ULDP campaign ever seen, calling for a long term strategy of negotiated independence for Northern Ireland. Despite fears from mainstream unionists that McMichael might split their vote, he ultimately only captured 576 votes. McMichael's failure to make any inroads into the popular vote led to the UDA largely abandoning electoral politics outside of the occasional local foray for over a decade.McDonald & Cusack, p. 122 After the failure of his political strategy, McMichael returned to his work with the UDA and, after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he co-wrote another document Common Sense: Northern Ireland ‚Äì An Agreed Process, which outlined plans for a future political settlement in Northern Ireland.Taylor, p.198 Under the guidance of David Trimble, at the time a law lecturer in Queen's University Belfast, the document attempted to set out a legal framework for a power-sharing system under British rule.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 363-364 The paper was viewed positively by some politicians including SDLP leader John Hume and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King.\\"The UDA Plan: Opening For Dialogue Or Sectarian Fix?\\". Fortnight: An Independent Review For Northern Ireland. Belfast: Fortnight Publications, Ltd. No.249. March 1987. pp.14‚Äì15 McMichael and the UDA's Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie set up an elite group of men carefully selected from within the UDA; this unit, called the 'Ulster Defence Force' (UDF), was formed to make the organisation capable of meeting any \\"Doomsday\\" situation (such as a civil war) that might occur as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The group's motto was Sans Peur (French for \\"fearless\\".), and the men received training by former British soldiers.Taylor, p.203 McMichael was also allegedly put in charge of a UDA/UFF bombing campaign that was to be waged against the Republic of Ireland.McDonald & Cusack, p. 134 Ultimately the proposed campaign was unsuccessful. The four incendiary bombs planted in the city centre of Dublin in November 1986 failed to inflict much damage. McMichael himself put the failure down to the lack of bombing expertise in the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, p. 135 McMichael sat on the Ulster Clubs executive and its security committee.Taylor, p.188 In June 1985, he instructed UDA Intelligence chief Brian Nelson to travel to South Africa to investigate the possibility of obtaining weapons by proposing an exchange of arms. Nelson, who was a British military intelligence agent recruited by the Force Research Unit, made the journey.Collusion: British Military Intelligence and Brian Nelson 21 December 1997 Retrieved 30-03-11 When he returned from the trip he reported his findings to McMichael, who had previously received reports regarding Nelson's unsatisfactory conduct in South Africa. Four years earlier, McMichael had hoped to draw Catholic support for Beyond the Religious Divide, having made the following statement > We'll just continue what we've been doing during the past year. It will > become more and more obvious that the UDA is taking a very steady line, that > we're not willing to fall into line behind sectarian politicians. It will > take time. What people forget is that we also have to sell the idea to > Protestants.Wood, p.73 Paul Arthur, professor of politics at the University of Ulster, called him an \\"astute thinker\\".\\"Too many chiefs led to Loyalist bloodshed\\". The Guardian. Rosie Cowan. 4 February 2003. British journalist Peter Taylor, who met McMichael, described him as having been \\"articulate and tough\\", and his son by his first marriage, Gary, said of his father: > I think it was recognised that my father was no angel. He was a leader in a > paramilitary organisation. Perhaps he'd been there and done that and bought > the T-shirt. He was a well-respected person within the loyalist community > and his credentials were extremely strong. People saw my father as someone > who said that loyalism was at war with militant republicanism and he was > unashamed about that. At that same time, he was also making a contribution > to trying to push not just loyalism but everyone beyond conflict. Killing McMichael's name heads a list of South Belfast UDA on this Sandy Row plaque McMichael was killed by a bomb attached to his car outside his Hilden Court home, in Lisburn's loyalist Hilden estate on 22 December 1987, just eighteen days before his fortieth birthday. He was on his way to deliver Christmas turkeys to the families of loyalist prisoners.Wood, p.128 At 8.20 p.m. after he had turned on the ignition of his car and the vehicle slowly reversed down the driveway, the movement-sensitive switch in the detonating mechanism of the five pound booby-trap bomb attached to its underside was activated, and the device exploded. McMichael lost both legs in the blast and suffered grave internal injuries. He was rushed to Lagan Valley Hospital but died shortly afterwards. His 18-year-old son, Gary had been attending a Stiff Little Fingers concert in Belfast's Ulster Hall at the time the bomb detonated. During the performance, a note was passed to the band's lead singer, Jake Burns, who then made an announcement that Gary McMichael was to phone his home. McMichael had initially planned to take his two-year-old son Saul with him to deliver the turkeys, but had changed his mind at the last minute. McMichael's wife, Shirley and son were inside the house at the time of the explosion. She later told the inquest into his death that he had been away from home for two weeks and had returned the day he was killed. In the hours proceeding McMichael's funeral on Boxing Day 1987, the UDA sealed off Dromore to enable a volley of shots to be fired into the air in the town square.McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, p. 1103 The funeral was attended by 5,000 people; among the mourners were many unionist politicians including Rev. Ian Paisley. Representatives from the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were also in attendance. A large number of UDA members wearing combat uniforms marched in the procession behind the coffin which was preceded by the RUC and a bagpiper. The local Apprentice Boys of Derry formed a guard of honour with some carrying UDA wreathes as they escorted the coffin which was draped in UDA and Ulster flags. The UDA's commander Andy Tyrie was one of the pallbearers along with DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson.The family had wanted a loyalist flute band to lead the cort√®ge but the request was rejected by the police. \\"News video of John McMichael's funeral\\" The funeral was held at the Lambeg Parish Church.Newsline ‚Äì Inside Ulster At the burial service, Rev. Canon R. H. Lowry eulogised McMichael as \\"a man of great intelligence and ability, and a man of great kindness and one who had been working towards peace\\". Cardinal Tom√°s √ì Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland described him as having been \\"untiring, fresh and constructive and ready to cross the religious divide to find a solution for Northern Ireland\\".Wood, pp. 128‚Äì29 McMichael was buried at the New Blaris Cemetery in Lisburn. The People newspaper later summed up his death as having been a \\"blow to peace hopes in Northern Ireland at the time\\". =Allegations= The attack was claimed by the Provisional IRA, and carried out by a unit led by Se√°n Savage, who would himself be shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar three months later in \\"Operation Flavius\\". At the time, however, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) hinted that some within the UDA may have had knowledge that the assassination was about to happen. The UDA backed the killing of racketeer and UDA fund-raiser James Pratt Craig by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) in 1988, claiming that he had been involved in planning the murder of McMichael.Taylor, pp. 170‚Äì71, 199\\"Building bridges with the UDA\\" , Irish Tribune 23 November 2008; retrieved 6 March 2011. According to author Martin Dillon, McMichael had begun an inquiry into Craig's racketeering business, and Craig, fearing McMichael would put a stop to his lucrative protection operation, passed on information to the IRA which led to the assassination.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. p. 266. Prior to his death, McMichael had his own personal bodyguard and changed his car every two weeks.Tony Geraghty. The Bullet Catchers: Bodyguards and the World of Close Protection, p. 391 McMichael had been warned that the IRA had already made an attempt to kill him just one week before his assassination. McMichael's son, Gary is firmly convinced that Craig was involved in his father's killing.Wood, p. 135 Another suspect was West Belfast brigadier Tommy Lyttle, who it was alleged helped set him up under orders by the security forces after it was rumoured McMichael was planning to carry out a bombing campaign against the Irish Republic. McMichael's close friend and second-in- command, Jackie McDonald, who was appointed leader of the South Belfast Brigade following his death, opined that it was possible Lyttle had a hand in the killing rather than Craig. However, he added, \\"We just may never know\\". Later, it emerged that Lyttle was an RUC Special Branch informer. Lyttle in his turn placed the blame on Craig.\\"Set Up For Murder?\\" News Letter, 21 December 2007; retrieved 29 March 2011. In response to a question put to him at a press conference held after McMichael's killing, Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon gave the following statement: > The murder of John McMichael, whoever caused it, or whoever orchestrated it > regardless of who may have committed it, was designed to cause grievous > dissention and disruption and to eliminate a threat to whosoever that threat > may have existed. I would not wish to take it further than that. But think > of my words very carefully.Coogan, Tim Pat (1995). The Troubles. Ireland's > ordeal 1966‚Äì1995 and the Search for Peace. New York: Palgrave. pp.338‚Äì339 Andy Tyrie was not convinced of Craig's complicity in McMichael's killing; he instead put the blame on John Hanna,Note: In June 1990 Christopher John Hanna (c. 1947 ‚Äì 27 December 1992) was convicted of helping the IRA to kill a fellow prison officer and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Former IRA member Sean O'Callaghan, who met Hanna while in prison, described him as a \\"dangerous man\\", and recounted his personal experiences with Hanna's duplicity on pages 340‚Äì41, and 343-44 of his autobiography The Informer. a prison officer in the Maze Prison, who obtained information about McMichael when the latter visited loyalist inmates and then supplied the IRA with the gathered information through Belfast Catholic actress, Rosena Brown with whom Hanna (a Protestant) was reportedly infatuated. Brown was a PIRA intelligence operative.Wood, pp. 135‚Äì36; retrieved 18 March 2011 According to Tyrie, Brown was introduced to McMichael in the \\"Admiral Benbow\\"; McMichael was warned he was \\"being watched\\". Tyrie himself narrowly escaped an attempt on his life by a car bomb in March 1988. Shortly after the failed attack, Tyrie tendered his resignation as UDA commander. In an interview with Peter Taylor, Tyrie explained the IRA's possible motive for assassinating McMichael: > John was killed because he was the best person we had and the Republican > Movement didn't like him. I didn't have anybody as astute in politics as he > was. They also didn't like him because he was being listened to and they > knew the loss we would incur with John being killed.Taylor, p. 199 Tyrie said that on another occasion, McMichael, prior to being interviewed, would practice his replies to likely questions in front of a mirror.Wood, p. 127 =Legacy= John McMichael Centre (Belfast South Community Resources) McMichael's eldest son, Gary, followed in his father's footsteps of trying to build up the Ulster Democratic Party as a strong political wing for the UDA, but following the collapse of the party he dropped out of politics. His widow, Shirley McMichael (n√©e McDowell) is a member of the Forum For Victims and Survivors, a group established to bring healing to those who were themselves victims or lost loved ones in The Troubles. A community engagement worker for the Northern Ireland Policing Board, she is an adherent of Contemporary Paganism and a member of the Police Pagan Association.Widow of UDA leader: I'm spellbound by pagan way of life, belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 4 November 2015. The John McMichael Centre, a community centre in Belfast's Sandy Row area, is named in honour of McMichael. Its principal organiser is the UDA's incumbent leader and McMichael's successor, Jackie McDonald, who for a period had acted as one of McMichael's bodyguards.Wood, p.119 In a 2012 interview he recalled McMichael as having been \\"a very, very powerful man...had a great presence and great ideas ‚Äì far, far ahead of his time\\".Brian Rowan. \\"UDA mourns lost leader and aims to lose another\\".

Henry first published in the July 6, 1907 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. It follows two men who kidnap, and demand a ransom for, a wealthy Alabamian's son. Eventually, the men are driven crazy by the boy's spoiled and hyperactive behavior, and they pay the boy's father to take him back. The story and its main idea have become a part of popular culture, with many children's television programs depicting versions of the story as one of their episodes. It has also been often used as a classic example of two ultimate comic ironies ‚Äì a supposed \\"hostage\\" actually liking his abductors and enjoying being captured, and his captors getting their just deserts by having the tables turned on them, and being compelled to pay to be rid of him. Summary Two small-time criminals, Bill and Sam, kidnap Johnny, the 10-year-old red-haired son of Ebenezer Dorset, an important citizen, and hold him for ransom. But the moment that they arrive at their hideout with the boy, the plan begins to unravel, as the boy actually starts to enjoy his kidnappers. Calling himself \\"Red Chief\\", the boy proceeds to drive his captors to distraction with his unrelenting chatter, malicious pranks, and demands that they play wearying games with him, such as riding 90 miles on Bill's back pretending to be an Indian scout. The criminals write a ransom letter to the boy's father, lowering the ransom from $2,000 to $1,500, believing that the father won't pay much money for his return. The father, who knows his son well and realizes how intolerable he will be to his captors and how eager they will soon be to rid themselves of the delinquent child, rejects their demand and offers to take the boy off their hands if they pay him $250. The men hand over the money and the howling boy ‚Äì who had actually been happier being away from his strict father ‚Äì and flee while the father restrains his son from following them. The ironic situation is where the kidnappers have to pay the father to get his son back instead of the father paying the kidnappers for his son. Influence \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\" has been adapted many times, directly and indirectly. Direct adaptations include the 1952 movie The Ransom of Red Chief starring Fred Allen and Oscar Levant (part of O. Henry's Full House), the segment \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\" in the 1962 Soviet black-and-white comedy film Strictly Business by Leonid Gaidai, the 1977 \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\" episode of the ABC Weekend Special series, the 1984 opera Ransom of Red Chief (libretto, music, and orchestration by Brad Liebl), and the 1998 television film The Ransom of Red Chief; there is also Le Grand Chef, a French direct adaptation made in 1959 by Henri Verneuil, with Fernandel and Gino Cervi. Indirect adaptions include the 1929 Japanese silent comedy Straightforward Boy by Yasujir≈ç Ozu * *, the episode \\"The Ransom of Red Chimp\\" of the 1990s Disney animated series TaleSpin, the films Too Many Crooks (1959) and Ruthless People (1986) (which take the story a step further), and \\"The Ransom of Rusty Rex\\", a segment of the 2015 anthology film Tales of Halloween. A 2015 episode of the radio comedy anthology Stanley Baxter's Playhouse, titled \\"Two Desperate Men\\" after how the kidnappers sign their note, relocated the story to rural Scotland in the 1930s.
