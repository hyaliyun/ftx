Södertälje lock. The Södertälje Canal () is a canal connecting the lake Mälaren with the Baltic Sea, at the city of Södertälje. It is 5.2 km long, and it has one lock. The size of this lock is the largest in Scandinavia by allowed ship size. The lock is 135 m long and 17 m wide. The water level difference between Mälaren and the Baltic Sea is not large, on average 0.6 m (2 ft). This is the main shipping route into the lake Mälaren.  History  In the Viking age the passage was navigable by boats, but the Post-glacial rebound made it unusable. In the year 1819 a lock was finished, so boats could use the canal. In 1924 a much larger lock (that remains in use today) was built and the canal was widened and deepened.  Recent events on the main bridge over the approach to the canal On the approach from the Baltic Sea to the canal itself there is the Bridge of Södertälje, actually 4 bridges (2 for the Motorway E4/E20, 1 for the local traffic and 1 for the trains). * On 13 February 2016 all 4 members of the British band Viola Beach, along with their manager, were killed when their van struck the middle section of the bridge as it was being raised for a large ship passing through the canal. * On 24 June 2016 an accident involving two trucks damaged the bridge so much that it had to be closed in one direction for a long time, creating traffic problems because it is the only connection directly southwards from Stockholm apart from 2 smaller bridges in the city of Södertälje itself.

He is the creator of all things in heaven. The legend In the legend, two of Ggulu's daughters discover Kintu, the first human being according to Gandan myth. When Kintu declines to follow the daughters to heaven, they tell Ggulu who promptly tells his son to steal Kintu's cow, his only source of nutrition. When Kintu is brought to heaven by Nambi, Ggulu's daughter, Ggulu tests him by ordering Kintu to eat ten thousand meals to prove that he is a man. Kintu secretly disposes of the food into a hidden cavern and Ggulu tests him yet again. When Kintu succeeds in the second test of cutting stones through the use of a magical bronze axe, Ggulu orders Kintu to fetch him a bucket of dew to drink. Kintu is able to do this as the bucket itself has magical powers. Ggulu then tests Kintu one final time by herding three herds of ten thousand of cows before him. Kintu's job is to retrieve his cow and when the third herd is driven by, a magic hornet aids him in identifying his cow and two calves born while in captivity. Upon passing all of Ggulu's tests, Ggulu gives Kintu his daughter, Nambi, to take back to Earth. He also gives them multiple vegetable plants, a hen, and some millet. He warns them then to hurry back to Earth to avoid gaining the attention of Warumbe (meaning \\"disease or death\\"), Nambi's brother. He tells them not to come back for anything, but when Kintu forgets the hen's millet, he returns for it. Upon Kintu's return, Warumbe discovers the situation and confronts Kintu and Nambi. After much deliberation, Kintu and Nambi allow Warumbe to stay with them on Earth for a time. When Warumbe begins killing children on Earth, Kintu returns to Ggulu. Ggulu sends his son, Kaikuzi, to aid in ridding Earth of Warumbe. Finally, when humans ruin Kaikuzi's plan for capturing Warumbe, Kaikuzi returns to heaven and Ggulu allows Warumbe to remain on Earth. References *Thury, Eva M. & Devinney, Margaret K. (2005).

Specifically, it is a hydroxylase, and is one of the most studied enzymes and catalyzes reactions involved in soil detoxification, metabolism, and other biosynthetic processes. 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooygenase catalyzes the regioselective hydroxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate, giving 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate as the product. The mechanism consists of the following general steps: (1) reduction of the flavin, (2) reaction of the flavin with O2, producing C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, and (3) binding and activation of the substrate, leading to product formation and release. Throughout the mechanism, the flavin changes between “open” and “closed” conformations, thus altering the substrate reaction environment. The open conformation allows solvent access to the active site; the enzyme adopts this conformation for substrate binding and product release. A closed conformation isolates the reaction from solvent, which helps to stabilize the reaction intermediates. The enzymatic conversion of 4-hydroxybenzoate to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate  Structure  4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase is a homodimer with a flavin bound to each monomer. The active site is composed of the flavin and amino acids on the monomer. The structure of this enzyme often serves as a model for structure-reactivity interdependence of other flavin- dependent hydroxylases. The active site limits potential substrates to substituted benzenes, namely 4-hydroxybenzoate (the native substrate), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 4-mercaptobenzoate, and several halogenated aromatic compounds.  Mechanism  The substrate is held in place by several non- covalent interactions with the protein scaffold. The hydroxylase, 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase, proceeds through a catalytic process that begins with the entrance of NADPH and 4-hydroxybenzoate (the native substrate) into the active site of the enzyme. This results in formation of an enzyme- flavin-substrate-NADPH complex, after which the flavin cofactor, FAD, is reduced by NADPH. NADP+ is lost and O2 enters into the complex, followed by oxidation of the flavin to form a hydroperoxide, which acts as the hydroxide transfer reagent. It is important to note that while the group transferred is referred to as hydroxide it is formally an OH+ group. This hydroxide is transferred to the substrate from the hydroperoxide flavin, flavin-C4a-hydroperoxide, via an electrophilic aromatic substitution-type reaction. Finally, the product exits from the complex and the hydroxy-flavin is dehydrated, regenerating FAD and allowing the process to repeat. The substrate binds in the active site of the enzyme via non-covalent interactions with proximal amino acid side chains. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine 201 and 222, in addition to the hydroxyl group of serine 212, interact with the carboxylate and hydroxyl group on the substrate. This allows for proper orientation within the active site in order to achieve reactivity. Once the substrate is bound, the flavin shifts from an “open” to a “closed” conformation. This shields the active site and substrate from solvent, preventing the premature breakdown of the flavin hydroperoxide. Binding of both NADPH and substrate shifts the enzyme to an “out” conformation. This occurs through an intricate proton network within the enzyme that allows for deprotonation of the phenol and a subsequent dynamic shift of the enzyme. The “out” conformation aligns the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin so that it can be reduced rapidly by NADPH. Following the reduction, NADP+ is released from the enzyme. Reduction of the flavin generates a negatively charged species, FADH−, which is attracted to the positively charged active site. This attraction shifts the flavin back to the “closed” conformation, isolating it from the solvent environment. This isolation provides an optimal environment and position for O2 to hydroxylate the substrate. The oxygen binds to FADH− via a single electron transfer, which is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This forms an FAD radical and flavin hydroperoxide. Reaction between these generates C4a-peroxyflavin, which is quickly protonated to form flavin-C4a-hydroperoxide. Tautomerization leads to the formation of 3,4-dihydoxybenzoate. The final step in the mechanism is dissociation of the product and water from FAD, causing the flavin to return to the open conformation.

He was baptized a six months after the 1978 Revelation on Priesthood among the first to be baptized in the church in Ghana. Early life in the church Johnson was born in Lagos, Nigeria and grew up in the Roman Catholic faith. In 1964, Johnson learned about the Book of Mormon from Frank A. Mensah. Upon receiving a copy of the Book of Mormon, Johnson started \\"Latter-Day Saint\\" congregations in Ghana, independent from any other \\"Mormon\\" sect. Although he was not able to be baptized at the time, Johnson received support and encouragement in sharing the faith with others from Latter-day Saints who were expatriates that occasionally lived in or visited Ghana. This began primarily with Virginia Cutler, who was a visiting professor at the University of Ghana. Merrill J. Bateman also visited, along with M. Neff Smart, Edwin Q. \\"Ted\\" Cannon and Lynn M. Hilton. During these visits new literature was brought and members were encouraged to continue in faith. These visits all happened unofficially. His leadership prior to baptism In 1976, Johnson set out to contact all Latter- day Saints within Ghana and found the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). However, no further contact was established with the RLDS Church. After sharing the message of Mormonism with many in Accra, Johnson moved to Cape Coast, Ghana, where he set up at least ten congregations there and in the surrounding areas. Some of the Cape Coast group of these independent congregations in Ghana schismed when ongoing contact was not established with the LDS Church or RLDS Church in 1976. Some of the individuals in this group formed the Apostolic Divine Church of Ghana, however, this sect only lasted a few months. During this time he also helped establish a primary school called the Brigham Young Educational Institute.Johnson stated that Brigham Young had appeared to him in a dream and encouraged him to continue in his work. He named one of his children Brigham Young Johnson, see Salt Lake Tribune article on Brigham Young and the priesthood restriction, June 2018 That same year, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball announced Official Declaration 2 which extended the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church regardless of race or color. In gratitude, Johnson sent a letter to Kimball, explaining that God had prepared the people in Ghana, asking him to send missionaries to the members. Kimball responded to his pleas and sent the first called missionaries Rendell N. Mabey and Rachel Mabey. They joined Edwin Q. Cannon and Janath R. Cannon. Baptism and later religious achievements Johnson was finally baptized into the LDS Church on December 9, 1978. The previous October a letter from Johnson had been among those read by Spencer W. Kimball in his speech to the training meeting for the Regional Representatives of the 12 and other Church leader urging that the sending of missionaries to Ghana and Nigeria be done quickly.Mabey, Brother to Brother He was ordained as a priest and called to be the first branch president. He later served as a district president. In 1990, the Ghanaian government decided to suspend the activities of the church in the country, claiming they thought it was a CIA plot.Most analysts at the time and since have felt that the reasons given publicly by the government did not reflect its true thinking, and its actions were mainly motivated to exert more power During this time, the church functioned very differently in Ghana. Foreign missionaries had to quickly withdraw from the country, including the acting mission president. Members held sacrament meetings in their homes on a family basis, instead of at formal meetinghouses. Johnson and his wife were called as the only missionaries at the time. After the end of the freeze, stakes were organized in Accra and Cape Coast. Johnson was called as the first stake patriarch in Ghana. In 2004, the Accra Ghana Temple was completed, the LDS Church's second temple to be built in Africa. Johnson served as a temple worker in this temple from the time it started operation.

He was at the University of Michigan until 1969, when he moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Beginning in 1986 he moved into university administration, eventually becoming Vice Provost at Stony Brook in 1990, and Provost at Texas A&M; University from 1996 until 2002. At the time of his death, he was Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&M.; He is survived by three children, including Michael R. Douglas, a noted string theorist. Among his best-known contributions to science is a 1977 paper with Lawrence G. Brown and Peter A. Fillmore (BDF theory), which introduced techniques from algebraic topology into the theory of operator algebras. This work was an important precursor to noncommutative geometry as later developed by Alain Connes among others. In addition to BDF theory, two other influential theories bear his names: Douglas algebra and Cowen-Douglas operators. In recent decades, he was a prominent advocator of multivariable operator theory. His coauthored book with V. Paulsen \\"Hilbert modules over function algebras\\" introduced an analytic framework for studying commuting operator tuples. Douglas-Arveson conjecture is a well-known unsolved problem in this field. Douglas directed 23 Ph.D students, some of whom became renowned mathematicians, and his book Banach Algebra Techniques in Operator Theory in the series Graduate Texts in Mathematics is one of the classics in operator theory.

While most known flavin monooxygenases use NADH or NADPH as substrates (and use the flavins FAD or FMN as prosthetic groups ), this enzyme is part of a two-component system, in which a flavin oxidoreductase partner () regenerates FADH2 by oxidizing NADH to NAD+. hpaB and hpaC, the 4-HPA oxygenase and reductase partner proteins (respectively) of E. coli strain W, were the first two-component flavin monoxygenase system identified. While known examples of this enzyme share a common catalytic mechanism and likely evolutionary origin, they differ with respect to regulation and ability to substitute FMNH2 for FADH2 as a substrate.  Structure  Active site of T. thermophilus hpaB, showing hydrogen bonding of hpaB catalytic residues to 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and to the peroxide bound to FADH2. (Note: this structure was generated using oxidized FAD in place of FADH2; the magenta sphere representing oxygen here is actually a water molecule believed to occupy the space oxygen does when the flavin hydroxyperoxide is present.) This enzyme is a tetramer which forms as a dimer of dimers. Sequence alignments of the Thermus thermophilus and E. coli hpaB enzymes show structural similarity to each other and to the oxygenase components of other bacterial two-component monooxygenases for compounds such as phenol and chlorophenol. Each monomer of this protein consists of an N-terminal alpha-helical domain, a middle beta barrel domain, and a C-terminal \\"tail\\" helix. FADH2 is bound by a groove between these domains; this binding event causes a loop in the middle domain to change position, preforming a binding site for 4-HPA. At this point, multiple residues act to stabilize catalytic intermediates by hydrogen-bonding to the peroxide bound to FAD, as well as to the hydroxyl group of 4-HPA's phenol moiety (stabilizing its dienone transition state - see Mechanism). The loop which moves to form the 4-HPA binding site when FADH2 binds provides catalytic specificity by hydrogen-bonding to 4-HPA's carboxylic acid moiety. Mechanism While many flavin-dependent monooxygenases retain FMN or FAD in their active sites throughout their catalytic cycle, this enzyme binds FADH2 at the start of its catalytic cycle and releases FAD at the end. After FADH2 binds, dioxygen attacks it at the C4a carbon, leading to a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. 4-HPA then binds, and a conformational change sequesters the enzyme's active site from solution, preventing the oxygen from escaping as toxic hydrogen peroxide. 4-HPA is then hydoxylated via a dienone intermediate and released as 3,4-DHPA; with the peroxide bond broken, C4a-hydroxyflavin releases the remaining oxygen atom by eliminating water and is released from the enzyme as FAD. Catalytic cycle of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase, also showing FADH2 regeneration by flavin oxidoreductase partner (hpaC is E. coli nomenclature). The mechanism of 4-HPA deprotonation is simplified; multiple residues likely participate in the actual enzyme (see above). Biological Function To cope with the wide variety of phenolic compounds found in nature, bacterial pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds generally begin by channeling these diverse substrates towards a few common intermediates, which are then further degraded. Pathways for catabolizing aromatic compounds generally begin by adding two hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring, most often on adjacent carbons. This product then undergoes ring cleavage to produce a linear molecule which is ultimately degraded to intermediates of central metabolism, such as succinate, pyruvate, and carbon dioxide. In the case of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, which only needs one hydroxyl group to be added, a monooxygenase is required. Among common E. coli laboratory strains, the 4-HPA degradation pathway is not found in the commonly used K-12 strain, but it does appear in strains B, C, and W (the strain in which most research into the pathway has been done). Only strains containing this pathway are able to survive by metabolizing 4-HPA as the sole carbon source, showing that this pathway is required for catabolism of this compound, and likely for similar phenolic compounds as well. Evolution In addition to the exclusively FADH2-dependent monooxygenase found in species such as E. coli and T. thermophilus, a version of the enzyme which can use either reduced FAD or reduced FMN has been described in Acinetobacter baumannii. Although these enzymes catalyze similar reactions and share a similar acyl-CoA dehydrogenase fold, the FMN-dependent enzyme is allosterically regulated by 4-HPA while the FADH2-dependent enzyme is likely regulated by a simpler kinetic mechanism, in which low concentrations of 4-HPA lead the enzyme to bind and sequester FADH2 as part of the normal catalytic cycle, causing the free concentration of FADH2 to drop until the flavin oxidoreductase's reaction is indirectly inhibited as well. Along with other differences in regulation and substrate binding despite a shared fundamental catalytic mechanism, this has led to speculation that these enzymes collectively represent an example of convergent evolution. Potential Applications In addition to 4-HPA, the enzyme has been reported to have activity on a number of other phenolic substrates. Metabolic engineers have demonstrated that microbes expressing the E. coli enzyme can catalyze reactions such as hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-dopa and hydroxylation of the pharmacologically interesting phenylpropanoids umbelliferone and resveratrol. However, these approaches are not currently used commercially.

C sopranos are the same shape as B sopranos and differ in length by only around 3 centimeters. C soprano saxophones usually have a \\"C\\" stamped on them, close to the serial number. The same companies that made C melody instruments manufactured C soprano saxophones (e.g. Conn). As with C melody instruments, production of C sopranos commenced circa 1919 and ended around 1929.  In classical music  The C soprano saxophone was used by Richard Strauss in his Sinfonia Domestica, where included in the music are parts for four saxophones including a soprano saxophone in C.

It was the site of two major battles during World War II. These battles are tied to the Siegfried Line Campaign, the Battle of the Huertgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge, and the assault on the Roer River dams at the outset of Operation Lumberjack.  Kesternich  Kesternich is a small village, which in 1944-1945 consisted of about 112 houses constructed in a method of timber- frame and stucco construction called fachwerkhäuser. Poised on top of a spur ridge, the land inside the village along the main east–west road is relatively flat. The land falls off sharply to the north into a gorge known as the Weidenbachtal, and to the south into a gorge called the Tiefenbachtal. To the east, at the end of the village, the terrain slopes down to the Roer River gorge. Surrounding the village along the ridge was a series of small fields. The houses were not tightly packed, but were surrounded by small yards containing many outbuildings and sheds. The yards, like the farm fields, were often separated by a form of traditional tall, dense hedge that is used as a windbreak. Defenders inside the village commanded excellent fields of fire. The First Battle for Kesternich The First Battle for Kesternich took place from 13 to 16 December 1944. This battle pitted the 2nd Battalion of the 309th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 310th Infantry Regiment of the 78th Infantry Division against units from the 272. Volksgrenadier-Division, including elements of the 326. Volksgrenadier-Division. This attack was part of a greater attack by the First Army's V Corps in an effort to capture the Roer (Rur) River Dams that included the 78th Infantry Division as well as the 2nd Infantry Division to the south. The attack by the 78th Division interrupted Hitler's plans for the northern (right) shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge. While it may be questionable that the Germans had enough strength to push the attack west of Simmerath and Kesternich, plans were disrupted as the American attack hit the German lines on 13 December. As a result, the northern pivot-point of the German offensive was pushed from Simmerath to south of Monschau. The 78th Division's Mechanized Reconnaissance Troop and its 311th RCT (Regimental Combat Team) had been attached to the 8th Infantry Division just to the north. For the offensive operations against Kesternich, the 78th Division had the 309th and 310th RCTs, as well as the attached, combat-experienced, 709th Tank Battalion and 893rd Tank Destroyer Battalion. The 1st Battalion of the 309th RCT was to attack in the direction of Witzerath and Simmerath. The 3rd Battalion was to move on Bickerath and seize the ridge near Simmerath. The 2nd Battalion with its attached tanks was to capture Kesternich. The 2nd Battalion, 310th RCT, was to wait in the woods near Lammersdorf as a reserve. Since the key objective of Kesternich was considered a tougher assignment, the 2nd Battalion of the 310th was attached to the 309th, giving it four battalions. This left the 310th with two battalions for their blocking assignment at Rollesbroich. A storm the night before left 12 inches of snow on the ground. Temperatures were below freezing. A thick ground fog permeated the landscape making visibility difficult until mid-day. The attack by the 309th Infantry Regiment was a surprise to the Germans defending the vaulted Siegfried Line and the Americans quickly took Bickerath, Paustenbach, Witzerath, and Simmerath. In taking Simmerath, the Americans finally cut the Monschau-Düren highway and severed the Monschau Corridor. They reached the outskirts of Kesternich as darkness fell on 13 December and dug in. However, they were unable to retain their small purchase and withdrew. The 310th was also held at bay, unable to penetrate past the entrance to Rollesbroich. The advance had gone decently on the first day and optimism for operations on the next day ran high. The 2nd Battalion, 309th Infantry Regiment started their assault on Kesternich on the morning of 14 December. Company E led the attack mounted on one platoon of tanks from the 709th Tank Battalion, Company F followed the tanks, and Company G outposted a hill next to the town. The tanks became bogged down, and Company E dismounted and moved near the village. The attack turned into a stalemate when the Germans pounded all attempted advances with machine gun fire and indirect fire from mortars. The battalion commander Lt. Col. Wilson L. Burley and assistant battalion commander Maj. Mark H. Hudson were both killed, and Capt. Douglas P. Frazier of Company H assumed command of the attack. The murderous fire on the 309th was relieved somewhat when the 2nd Battalion of the 310th Infantry moved on Kesternich as ordered after noon the same day. The tenacity of the German defense obstructed this attack and it stalled as darkness fell. Results at Rollesbroich were much better for the Americans as the other two battalions of the 310th were able to fully enter the village, capture the pillboxes guarding the village, and consolidate their positions. At 0600 on 14 December the 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry jumped off from Simmerath with the mission of assisting the 2d Battalion, 309th Infantry in the capture of Kesternich. Company E, followed by Company G, advanced on the left (north) side of the Simmerath-Kesternich road. Company F, at dawn, with the support of two M10 tank destroyers, attacked a stubborn pillbox at the west edge of Simmerath which had not been defeated the day before. Following this action Company F proceeded toward Kesternich on the right (south) side of the Simmerath- Kesternich road and to the right of E and G Companies. As Company F came abreast of Company E, approximately nine-hundred yards east of Simmerath, it came upon an antipersonnel minefield. In the meantime E and G Companies had been pinned down by fire from a previously unknown large pillbox at the west edge of Kesternich. All requests by the 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry to bring artillery fire on the enemy positions were denied for the reason that it was believed that friendly troops from the 2d Battalion, 309th Infantry were in Kesternich. The situation was so fluid that the 309th's commander did not even know whether or not he had any troops within the town (he did not) The 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry, made no further gains on 14 December, and dug in for the night approximately five-hundred yards west of Kesternich. At 0100 hours on 15 December, Lt. Col. Creighton E. Likes, Executive Officer, 309th Infantry Regiment, was placed in command of the 2d Battalion, 309th Infantry, and the 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry. These battalions, with a platoon of tanks and a platoon of tank destroyers attached, were, as a task force, to launch a coordinated attack to seize the town of Kesternich commencing at 0700 hours on the morning of 15 December. The plan for the attack, was to have the tank destroyers improve their positions before daylight so as to bring direct fire on the pillbox at the western outskirts of Kesternich. Following the reduction of the pillbox by a team of engineers, they were to support the attack on Kesternich. Immediately following a preparation of the town by two battalions of field artillery, Company E, 310th Infantry, was to move rapidly, on the road, through Kesternich to the northeast edge of town. Company G, following Company E into town, was to clear the northern portion, then move to the right of Company E and secure the southeast edge of town. Company F was to advance from its present position, south of the Simmerath-Kesternich road, clear the southern portion of the town, then dig in. Tanks were to support the infantry in the attack and then move to the east portion of town where they were to be utilized in defense of any German counterattack. The 2nd Battalion, 309th Infantry, (still not actually in Kesternich as their objective stated) was to advance and tie in with Company E, 310th Infantry, northeast of Kesternich. Fire by the tank destroyers kept the pillbox crew from harassing the engineers as they moved into position, and they used a large charge in an effort to reduce the pillbox. The explosion had little penetrating effect on the thick concrete walls, however, the concussion caused the occupants to surrender. The remaining tanks moved to the west edge of town, but did not advance to the east side, or participate in the upcoming house to house fire fights; they encountered Teller mines and two tanks were disabled by German anti-tank fire. The other three tanks retreated. The attack by the foot troops of the 310th commenced on schedule following the artillery preparation. E and G Companies proceeded up the road and into the town. Company E encountered sniper and automatic weapons fire which slowed its progress considerably. It reached its objective, however, about midday. Company G encountered a determined enemy set up in fortified houses. Intense house-to-house fighting resulted in the Company becoming disorganized. Small groups became isolated in separate firefights. Casualties, especially among leaders, were high. Manpower was further weakened by soldiers returning to the rear area with German prisoners. Company G, however, succeeded in clearing the north portion of town and moved to its objective in the southeast edge of town at about 1400 hours. Company F moved east and encountered a minefield in the vicinity of the pillbox that was cleared earlier in the day. It skirted the minefield to the south, entered the town and experienced the same house to house fighting as did Company G. It cleared the south portion of town by 1400 hours. The German plans for the Battle of the Bulge were threatened by the loss of Kesternich. Generalleutnant Eugen König's 272. Volksgrenadier-Division had begun planning a counterattack the day before. Since they had been assembling for their participation in the Bulge, not all of his strength was available. His organic II. Battalion of the 982. Grenadier-Regiment provided troops for the attack, and the 272. Panzerjägerabteilung provided some armored vehicles (Hetzer tank destroyers and Sd.Kfz. 7/2's). The I. Battalion of the 753. Grenadier-Regiment of the 326. Volksgrenadier-Division, assembling to the south in front of Höfen and Monschau, was loaned to König for the attack and provided additional manpower. The German counterattack against the 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry consisting of at least 500 Volksgrenadiers began at approximately 1615 hours and continued sporadically until the early morning hours of 16 December. At first, the Americans held firm, driving off the frontal attack by the I. Battalion, 753. Volksgrenadier-Regiment. In a classic envelopment maneuver, the II. Battalion, 982. Volksgrenadier-Regiment infiltrated behind the companies of the 310th Infantry inside the village to cut them off from the rear. Those GIs trapped in Kesternich faced German armored vehicles with no means to combat them. Outnumbered, with little ammunition, and cut off from their supplies, the fate of the Americans inside the village was sealed. As darkness fell, the attack by the 753. Grenadier-Regiment gained momentum, advancing steadily on the isolated companies. Once the battalion commander was captured, nearly all of the surviving Americans surrendered, although some men hid away in the houses. After the attack, over one-hundred and fifty German soldiers lay dead in and around Kesternich. While the American casualties were not nearly as great, virtually the entire fighting strength of the 2nd Battalion of the 310th Infantry were now German POWs. In the end, the fight for the village was described by one GI with the simple statement, \\"Kesternich was very bloody.\\" The attached troops of the 326. Volksgrenadier-Division were returned to their division for participation in the Battle of the Bulge. With the knowledge that they didn't have the strength to hold the ground they gained, the German force retreated to the east side of the village by early light the next day. Only a small force at the large bunker near the entrance to the village remained to guard their conquest. Late on 15 December, a counterattack by the 3rd Battalion, 309th Infantry was sent to retake Kesternich and reach any survivors of the 2nd Battalion, 310th Infantry. Isolated fighting by small groups of Americans continued throughout the night. None of the patrols sent out by the 310th Infantry to contact friendly elements to the west returned. When the 309th Infantry entered the town on the morning of 16 December, One officer said later, \\"Very few men from the [2nd of the 310th] were found in any of the houses, none [of them] were alive.\\" It was a bloody baptism of fire for the green American division. During the seven days of fighting for the village between 13 and 19 December, the 78th Infantry Division lost approximately 1,515 dead, wounded, missing and injured, according to the division's records. German losses in dead and captured, as confirmed by the 78th Infantry Division, were approximately 770, not counting wounded or missing. The Second Battle for Kesternich The Second Battle for Kesternich took place from 30 January 1945 to 1 February 1945. In the battle, the American 311th Infantry Regiment fought against the 272. Volksgrenadier- Division. This time the offensive was conducted under William H. Simpson's Ninth Army. Over the preceding weeks the volksgrenadiers had infiltrated back into and created strongpoints throughout the village. While this battle was no less a struggle than the earlier battle, the entrenched Germans inside the village could not stave off the unrelenting American attack and the village of Kesternich fell into American hands. The 78th Division's plan of operations was quite ambitious. All three RCTs were to be engaged with support from the 5th Armored Division's Combat Command A. To the south, the 310th was assigned the objectives of Am Gericht, Konzen, and Imgenbroich. To the north, the 309th was to hold in place as the initial operations kicked off, later they would be called on to sweep up the Monschau Corridor, taking Strauch, Steckenborn, Hechelscheid, Woffelsbach, Silberscheidt, Kommerscheidt, and Harscheidt on their way to their final objectives of Schmidt and the Schwammenauel Dam. The 311th RCT was given the center, assisting the 5th Armored's CCA with their objective at Eicherscheid as well as taking their own objectives of Huppenbroich and Kesternich. The 2nd Battalion of the 311th was to take Kesternich. The high ridge at Kesternich dictated that the town could not be fully enveloped in an attack from the west. As with the earlier attack, operations had to go straight down the center of the village. The Germans were prepared to block that route. As the GIs jumped off in the darkness, a slight snow shower helped to conceal their movement. Still, the Americans did not achieve surprise and as they met the initial German defenses mid-way into the village, they were assailed by automatic weapons fire and panzerfaust fire directed into the trees to create tree bursts. Tank support proved problematic. Once again, ineffective tank support seemed to be the order of the day. This time, the attached company of the 736th Tank Battalion had not even seen combat action yet. One tank platoon was attached to Company E, and one to Company F, which also had a section of tank destroyers. The third tank platoon and the other section of tank destroyers acted as a battalion reserve. The infantry went into combat without knowledge that their armor support had not been blooded. One platoon leader later remarked that timid tank support was worse than none at all. Squad leaders in highly exposed positions on the back of tanks became a common sight as they attempted to guide the armor forward into firing positions. With ample time to develop their defense, the Volksgrenadiers had emplaced machine gun positions in houses and in the rubble behind mine fields and wire. Each of these strong points became an exercise in and of itself in order to advance. It took actions like those of squad leader Jonah Edward Kelley, who singlehandedly destroyed several machine-gun emplacements before being killed, to push the attack. At the end of the first day, the battalion had only advanced a couple of hundred yards into the rubble. The quagmire continued the second day. Bitter house-to-house and rubble pile to rubble pile was the order of the day. Eye-to-eye contact was more common than not.Life and Death in the Huertgen Forest with the German 216/272 Infantry Division The advance made about as much gain as during the first day. However, this left the German defenders with a mere toehold on the village's eastern side. On the third day, the 2nd Battalion finally wrestled the village from the grasp of the defenders by noon. The Americans now held a key position along the Kesternich ridge; in the first week of December, they had captured the Brandenburg-Bergstein ridge. They now held the two ridgelines on either side of the Schmidt ridge. This opened the way for the 309th RCT in conjunction with portions of the 310th RCT to push down that ridgeline to capture the Schwammenauel Dam. At this point, on 2 February 1945, the 78th Division was returned to the command of the First Army and V Corps. Progress wasn't as speedy as desired by the commanders, and through a series of directives from General Huebner, Commander of V Corps, the 78th Division reorganized their attack. In the end, these adjustments proved to add difficulty to the operation.  Notable Participants  * S/Sgt. Jonah Edward Kelley - Awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his service at Kesternich.

Other names in common use include stearyl acyl carrier protein desaturase, and stearyl-ACP desaturase. This enzyme participates in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, ferredoxin. Reaction The 3 substrates of this enzyme are stearoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein), reduced acceptor, and O2, whereas its 3 products are oleoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein), acceptor, and H2O. The precise mechanism of this class of enzymes is not known, however recent studies using the kinetic isotope effect suggest that the rate limiting step is the removal of a hydrogen from the carbon nearest the carboxylic acid group. The diiron cluster moves through to a peroxo intermediate which can then dehydrate the short-lived alcohol intermediate, liberating water. There are a variety of specific enzymes within this class that attack using this mechanism, but do so at different points along the carbon chain of their respective fatty acids Biological Function This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with oxidation of a pair of donors resulting in the formation of H2O. This family of enzymes is found only in the plastids of higher plant cells, unlike other desaturases such as acyl-lipid desaturases and acyl-CoA desaturases. The regiospecific role of stearoyl-ACP desaturase is to initialise multiple desaturations by acyl-lipid desaturases. Oleic acid is formed from this reaction is transported to either the thylakoid or cytoplasm to complete desaturation. Structural studies As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .2XZ1. and show the dramatic change in conformation of the enzyme when bound (2XZ1) and unbound (2XZ0). As a dimer, the fatty acid chain binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the two dimers,. This central channel is mirrored by binding sites for the electron donors on either side. The stabilisation of the diiron-oxo element required to catalyse the reaction has been of particular interest. Crystallographic studies suggest that the iron groups are held in place by the desaturase using aspartate and glutamate. A structure of aspartate-X-X-histidine was found to be a common motif in several plant species. This desaturase family can be further divided by the consensus motif used to hold the iron clusters in place. Of particular note are the \\"soluble\\" desaturases, which use carboxylic acid groups, whereas it is possible for some variants to use histidines instead. The histidine rich desaturases tend to be integral membrane proteins. Structural studies strongly suggest that the animal form of this enzyme (Stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase) is evolutionarily divergent from the forms found in plants and fungi. This is to be expected as the roles of the enzymes are different in both. For example, in insects, the desaturase is critical in the formation of ceramide, and for complex signalling molecules (pheremones), while in fungi, the function of the enzyme, and concentration of unsaturated lipids is regulated in response to function of growth temperature by controlling membrane fluidity in cells.  Potential Industrial Relevance This enzyme class plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in plants, and are very specific to their substrates. A common theme in recent research has been to identify uncommon desaturases in various plants and isolate their genetic code. In particular, this can then be inserted into model cells (such as Escherichia coli) and up-regulated through metabolic engineering to skew the composition of oils produced by the model cells. This becomes a particularly lucrative endeavour if it becomes possible to successfully synthesise so-called Omega-3 fatty acids or other nutraceutical products from basic saturated fatty acids, and extract them from their hosts.

It has a rusty orange spore print and a bitter taste. It is unclear whether this species or its relatives contain the hallucinogen psilocybin. Taxonomy Speciation in Gymnopilus is not clearly defined. This is further complicated by the macroscopic morphological and ecological similarities between members of the G. sapineus complex such as G. penetrans and G. nevadensis. Michael Kuo explicates upon this by speaking of the arbitrary distinction made between G. sapineus and G. penetrans made by Elias Fries.Gymnopilus sapineus at MushroomExpert He, at first labeled G. penetrans to merely be a form of G. sapineus in 1815, but then recanted and labeled them separate in 1821. Description This mushroom is often mistaken for Gymnopilus luteocarneus which grows on conifers and has a smoother and darker cap. Another lookalike is Gymnopilus penetrans which grows in the same habitat and has minor microscopic differences. Cap: The cap is across, is convex, and is golden- yellow to brownish orange, darker at the center with a dry scaly surface which is often fibrillose and may have squamules. The cap margin is inrolled at first and curves outward as it matures, becoming almost plane and sometimes developing fibrillose cracks in age. The flesh is yellow to orange and delicate as compared to larger and firmer members of Gymnopilus, such as G. junonius. Gills: The gills are crowded, yellow at first, turning rusty orange as the spores mature, with adnate attachments. Microscopic Features: Gymnopilus sapineus spores are rusty orange to rusty brown, elliptical, rough, and 7 - 10 x 4 - 6 μm. Stipe:: The stipe is long and thick. It has an equal structure or becoming thinner near the base. It is light yellow, bruising rusty brown. The stipe has an evanescent veil which often leaves fragments on the upper part of the stipe or the margin of young caps. Taste: Gymnopilus sapineus sometimes tastes bitter, sometimes it does not, and it has a fungoid or sweet smell.

It is an ancient water outflow channel with light-colored clay-rich rocks. Prior to the selection of Gale Crater for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover mission, Mawrth Vallis was considered as a potential landing site because of the detection of a stratigraphic section rich in clay minerals. Clay minerals have implications for past aqueous environments as well as the potential to preserve biosignatures, making them ideal targets for the search for life on Mars. Although Mawrth Vallis was not chosen as a landing target, there is still interest in understanding the mineralogy and stratigraphy of the area.

These orbiters consist of a number of spectrometers that contribute to our knowledge of Mawrth Vallis and the rest of the Martian surface. Overview and geology One of the oldest valleys on Mars, Mawrth Vallis holds special interest because of the presence of phyllosilicate (clay) minerals which form only if water is available, first identified in data from the OMEGA spectrometer on the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars has identified aluminium-rich and iron-rich clays, each with a unique distribution. Some of the clays recently discovered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are montmorillonite and kaolinite, alunite, and nontronite. Since some clays seem to drape over high and low areas, it is possible that volcanic ash landed in an open body of water. On Earth such clays occur in (among other environments) weathered volcanic rocks and hydrothermal systems, where volcanic activity and water interact. Mawrth Vallis was at one point considered as a landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory, which ultimately landed at Gale Crater. Clay minerals easily preserve microscopic life on Earth, so perhaps traces of ancient life may be found at Mawrth.Feature Image: Mawrth Vallis. Mars Odyssey Mission THEMIS. It was considered a potential landing site for the Mars 2020 rover, but did not make the final cut.Gross, C., et al. 2016. MAWRTH VALLIS – PROPOSED LANDING SITE FOR EXOMARS 2018/2020. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 1421.pdf. The region is well studied with more than 40 papers published in peer-reviewed publications. Near the Mawrth channel is a 200 meter high plateau with many exposed layers. Spectral studies have detected clay minerals that present as a sequence of layers. Clay minerals were probably deposited in the Early to Middle Noachian period. Later weathering exposed a variety of minerals such as kaolin, alunite, and jarosite. Later, volcanic material covered the region. This volcanic material would have protected any possible organic materials from radiation.Gross, C. et al. 2016. MAWRTH VALLIS – PROPOSED LANDING SITE FOR EXOMARS 2018/2020. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 1421.pdf Exploration and investigations =Mars Global Surveyor= Mars Global Surveyor was the first orbiter launched by the US since 1976 when the Viking lander was sent to Mars. The purpose of Global Surveyor was to map the surface of Mars using the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), and a Magnetometer. MOC could capture high resolution images ranging from 1.5 to 12 m per pixel. MOLA was used to provide topographic maps of Mars. TES uses six detectors to measure both thermal infrared and visible near infrared data which is used to identify the composition of the surface of Mars. TES has a resolution of 3 x 6 km, this is a much larger field of view when compared to future orbiters. This resolution does not provide detailed composition maps but does serve as a good baseline for understanding the makeup of martian rocks. TES was able to provide thermal inertia information at Mawrth Vallis despite the low resolution. Thermal inertia compares daytime and nighttime infrared data to determine how well a surface holds heat. Objects with high thermal inertia (hold more heat) are either highly indurated, very dense, or have a large particle size while low thermal inertia represents fine grain particles such as dust. Mawrth Vallis has a thermal inertia that indicates the size of surface particles range from dusty to larger rocks. =2001 Mars Odyssey= Odyssey is currently NASA's longest serving spacecraft at Mars and has been orbiting Mars since October 2001. Odysseys primary purpose is to map the mineralogy of martian surface but is also used to assess potential landing sites for rovers and landers. Odyssey consists of three instruments for measuring the surface of Mars; a Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), and Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE). MARIE was damaged in 2003, most likely by a solar particle, and GRS is not in use after Odyssey changed its orbit in 2008 to increase THEMIS sensitivity. In addition to the onboard spectrometers, Odyssey serves as a communication relay between Earth and the rovers and landers on Mars’ surface. THEMIS THEMIS detects infrared reflectance of ten spectral bands which are used for identifying the composition of the martian surface. Using multiple-spectra allows Odyssey to better characterize the minerals found on Mars. THEMIS is similar to TES on the Mars Global Surveyor but has a lower spectral resolution (10 bands compared to TES's 143 bands) but has an increased spatial resolution (100 m compared to 3 x 6 km on TES) Odyssey is searching for terrains that represent past water, so the increased special resolution and narrow spectral resolution are targeting hydrated minerals. Comparison of TES and THEMIS spatial resolution. Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) The GRS is used to measure the abundance of elements on the surface of Mars. Gamma rays can be measured when cosmic rays hit the surface and cause elements to emit identifiable signatures of energy (gamma rays). Measuring these gamma rays allows for the calculation of various element abundances. Water has been inferred by calculating the abundance of hydrogen . The GRS is separated from the main body of Odyssey by a 20 ft boom to reduce interference caused by the orbiter. Odyssey at Mawrth Vallis Colour variations in Mawrth Vallis are among the most spectacular on Mars. THEMIS detected hydrated minerals at Mawth Vallis and also provided images of a large outflow channel which stretches over 400 miles and 9 miles wide. The evidence for past water documented by Odyssey generated interest in landing the Mars Science Laboratory within Mawrth. Although Gale Crater was chosen, there is still interest in landing a rover at Mawrth Vallis and it had been suggested for the future 2020 rover landing site. =Mars Express= Mars Express was a two-part mission consisting of the Mars Express Orbiter and Beagle 2 lander launched in June 2003. While the lander portion of the mission failed, the orbiter is still in use. The Mars Express Orbiter consists of three instruments with the purpose of analyzing the surface and subsurface of Mars: the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité (OMEGA), and the Mars Advance Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS). Additionally there are three instruments used for atmosphere analysis. OMEGA OMEGA is a mineralogical mapping spectrometer that has channels to detect visible (0.5–1.0 µm) and infrared (1.0–5.2 µm) wavelengths with a special resolution of 100 m. Both channels have a telescope, a spectrometer, and an optical device which focuses light. Visible light is focused onto a charge coupled device and infrared is focused to an InSb multi detector. OMEGA was designed to work in collaboration with the other instruments on Mars Express, specifically the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS). OMEGA has been used to identify the mineralogy and understand the stratigraphy of Mawth Vallis. Large outcrops of phyllosillicate-rich units have been discovered and are exposed throughout the Mawrth Vallis region at a meter scale. OMEGA has distinguished two types of phyllosilicates which are likely to be montmorillonite and nontronite based on known spectra. From OMEGA's perspective, Mawrth Vallis contains the highest abundance of phyllosilicates on Mars and has up to 65% of smectites in volume. =Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter= CRISM Visible and IR images of Mawrth Vallis. Top left: True color visible image of Mawrth Vallis. Top right: False color infrared reflectance. Bottom left: Detection of an Fe-rich smectite, nontronite, found primarily in the lower elevations of Mawrth Vallis. Bottom right: Detection of an Al-rich smectite, montmorillonite, found primarily at higher elevations than nontronite. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter consists of radar, three cameras, and two spectrometers. The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) is a visible and near infrared spectrometers that is designed to map the surface mineralogy of Mars at a resolution of 18m. The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) is MRO's second spectrometer and uses visible and near infrared light and take measurements in 5 km strips which are compiled into daily maps used to monitor weather conditions on Mars. CRISM CRISM's mission is to detect aqueous and hydrothermal deposits while mapping the geology, stratigraphy, and composition of the Martian surface. Mawrth Vallis is a prime target because of the clay minerals previously detected by OMEGA. CRISM has the ability to map these clay minerals at a higher resolution, providing more detailed maps of aqueous minerals detected on Mars as well as detection of minerals which are undetectable at OMEGA's resolution. Fe/Mg-smectites are the dominant spectra detected by CRISM at Mawrth Vallis with spectra falling between nontronite, an Fe-smectite, and hectorite, a Mg-smectite. Montmorillonite, an Al-smectite, and hydrated silica have similar infrared reflectance spectrums and both were detected by CRISM at Mawrth Vallis. CRISM data is used in conjunction with visible images and elevation data recorded by MRO, detailed maps of the surface mineralogy have been produced. These maps show a nontronite and hectorite are found commonly in the lower elevations of Mawrth Vallis while montmorillonite and other hydrated silicates are at higher elevations surrounding nontronite and hectorite. These observations suggest nontronite and hectorite were formed as alteration products in an aqueous environment but montmorillonite was likely to form at a later time during a separate aqueous event. =Future missions= In the year 2020 NASA plans to land a rover based on the Mars Science Laboratory that landed at Gale Crater. A landing site has not been chosen but will rely on orbiter data to choose a site that can contribute to NASA's overall goal of understanding the potential for life on Mars. Mawth Vallis was considered as a landing site, but was not among the final three potential landing sites. Orbiter observations have shown that there are hydrated minerals at Mawrth Vallis which indicate an aqueous past. Mawrth Vallis was also one of two finalist in the landing site selection process for the European Space Agency's future ExoMars Rover. As Exomars Rover will look for past life indicators, it was a good candidate, but it was deemed that Oxia Planum site would provide an equally interesting science ground while being a safer place to land and explore.

Reaction Mechanism Mechanistic and structural studies support binding of ACC and oxygen to an iron center located in the active site of ACC oxidase. The ring-opening of bound ACC is believed to result in the elimination of ethylene together with an unstable intermediate, cyanoformate ion, which then decomposes to cyanide ion and carbon dioxide. Cyanide ion is a known deactivating agent for iron- containing enzymes, but the cyanoformate ion intermediate is believed to play a vital role to carry potentially toxic cyanide away from the active site of ACC oxidase. Cyanoformate was recently identified in condensed media as a tetraphenylphosphonium salt with a weak carbon-carbon bond.

The building, first named \\"University Hall\\", was built between 1900 and 1902 and served as the administrative center for the 1904 World's Fair. The first cornerstone was laid on November 3, 1900. In 1899, after holding a national design competition, Washington University's administrators selected the Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson (represented by James P. Jamieson) to design the building as the centerpiece of an extensive new campus master plan. The general contractor was Bright Construction Company. A large square tower with corner turrets and an arched passageway below was a favorite motif of the architects that they also used at Blair Hall of Princeton University (1897),,the Quadrangle dormitories at the University of Pennsylvania (1894-1912), and Rockefeller Hall at Bryn Mawr College (1904) and was likely inspired by the Great Gates of Trinity and St. John's colleges at Cambridge University in England, where Cope & Stewardson are known to have visited. Brooking's Hall during the 1904 World's Fair Since 1905, the building has served as Washington University's administrative center. Initially known as University Hall, the building was renamed Brookings Hall on June 12, 1928, in honor of board president Robert S. Brookings. There are numerous inscriptions on the building; most prominent is the inscription above the clock on the Western side which reads Cedunt Horae, Opera Manent (The hours go by, the works remain). The inscription on the east facade reads Discere Si Cupias Intra: Salvere Iubemus (If you wish to learn, enter: we welcome you). Alumnus Steve Fossett used Brookings Hall as a mission control center for two of his attempts at circumnavigating the globe in a balloon, including his sixth and ultimately successful attempt in the Spirit of Freedom in 2002. Currently, South Brookings houses the Admissions Office and the administrative offices for the College of Arts and Sciences. North Brookings houses the Office of Student Financial Services, the Office of the Chancellor, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The diameter of the crater is about . Thought to have once been flooded with water, the crater contains a fan-delta deposit rich in clays. The lake in the crater was present when valley networks were forming on Mars. Besides having a delta, the crater shows point bars and inverted channels. From a study of the delta and channels, it was concluded that the lake inside the crater probably formed during a period when there was continual surface runoff.Goudge, T., et al. 2017. Stratigraphy and Evolution of Delta Channel Deposits, Jezero Crater Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 1195.pdf. In 2007, following the discovery of its ancient lake, the crater was named for Jezero in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of several eponymous towns in the country. In several Slavic languages, including Czech, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian and Slovene, the word jezero means 'lake' and is correctly pronounced as ['je.ze.ro], not [ˈjɛ.zə.ɹoʊ] or ['dʒɛ.zə.ɹoʊ]. In November 2018, it was announced that Jezero crater had been chosen as the landing site for the Perseverance mission. Crater Life may have developed in the crater since it is believed the lake was long-lived; the delta may have required a period of 106–107 years to form.Schon, S., J. Head, C. Fassett. 2012. An overfilled lacustrine system and progradational delta in Jezero crater, Mars: Implications for Noachian climate.

Phyllosilicates on Mars and implications for early martian climate. Nature, 438. doi:10.1038/nature04274. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified smectite clays. Clays form in the presence of water, so this area probably once held water and maybe life in ancient times. The surface in places is cracked into polygonal patterns. Such shapes often form when clay dries out. These patterns can be seen in the image below. The image shows a channel that carried water and sediments into Jezero crater. Researchers described in a paper, released in March 2015, how an ancient Martian lake system existed in Jezero Crater. The study advanced the idea that water filled the crater at least two separate times. There are two channels on the northern and western sides of the crater that probably supplied it with water; each of these channels has a delta-like deposit where sediment was carried by water and deposited in the lake. Craters of a given diameter are expected to have a certain depth; a depth less than expected means sediment has entered the crater.Garvin, J., S. Sakimoto, J. Frawley. 2003. Craters on Mars: Global geometric properties from gridded MOLA topography. In: Sixth International Conference on Mars. Abstract no. #3277 Calculations suggest that the crater may hold about one kilometer of sediments. Most of the sediments may have been brought in by channels.

Jezero crater, once considered a site for the Mars Science Laboratory, was later proposed as a landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission.http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/msl/workshops/2nd_workshop/talks/Fassett_Nili.pdf In early 2017 it was selected to be among the top three candidate sites for the landing, along with Northeast Syrtis, 30 km to the southwest. A primary aim of the Mars 2020 mission is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12-mile (20 km) wide, smooth, flat circular area is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded. They would like to examine sediment layers. In November 2018, Jezero crater was selected as the target landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission.

It is responsible for the majority of cholesterol turnover in the human central nervous system. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cholesterol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (24-hydroxylating). This enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes. Like many other CYP enzymes that act on cholesterol, cholesterol-24 hydroxylase is a monooxygenase that hydroxylates the side-chain of cholesterol. Because 24S-hydroxycholesterol is more polar than cholesterol, it can more easily pass the blood-brain barrier to exit the brain and pass into the bloodstream, where it can then travel to the liver to be further degraded. This enzyme has also been found at low quantities in the retina, where it performs the same function to a lesser degree. Genetic cloning of the encoding gene (CYP46A1) was first accomplished in 1999 and an extensive E. coli expression and purification system was later developed in 2003. Molecular structure The enzymatic structure of the human cholesterol-24 hydroxylase was determined via crystallography at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, and was shown to be a 57kDa (500 residue) monomeric heme-containing protein bound to the endoplasmic reticulum in neurons. Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase active site and heme molecule with bound cholesterol 3-sulfate. Hydrophobic residues interacting with the aliphatic tail of the cholesterol are labelled in white. Created in pyMOL from PDB 2Q9F Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase is similar in structure to many other cytochrome P450s, possessing, for example, the conserved stretch of 23 hydrophobic residues in the N-terminus that make up a transmembrane-anchoring domain (residues 3-27). Cholester-24 hydroxylase (CYP46A1) with placement of active site shown in red. created in pyMOL from PDB 2Q9F. Even so, the cholesterol-24 hydroxylase C-terminus has a unique proline-rich region of 5 repeated proline residues, a structural motif absent in all other related cytochrome p450 enzymes. While the exact function of these proline residues remain highly speculative, it has been shown that the deletion of this region results in a two-fold decrease in the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency. Binding of cholesterol results in an enzymatic conformational change and a subsequent induced fit of the active site around the cholesterol molecule, anchoring the hydroxylation site (C-24, C-25) near the catalytic center of the enzyme (5.7Å from the iron core of the heme molecule to allow oxyferryl intermediates to perform the cholesterol hydroxylation). A loop region, known as the B'-C loop, has a series of 5 residues (residues 116-120) unique to cholesterol-24 hydroxylase that contribute to the positioning of the cholesterol molecule within the active site. A single cholesterol molecule takes up the entirety of the active site, with the aliphatic tail of the cholesterol held in place by interactions with the following hydrophobic residues: Phe-121, Val-126, Ile-301, Ala-302, Ala-367, Thr-475. The active site is accessed via a single entrance created by two helices (B' and F) and the β1-sheet. There are no known allosteric regulatory sites. Enzyme mechanism Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase mechanism. The heme molecule forms an oxyferryl intermediate that abstract a hydrogen from cholesterol. The subsequent alkyl intermediate then reacts with the activated oxygen to form the final product. Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase catalyzes the following reaction: :cholesterol + NADPH + H+ \\\\+ O2 \\\\rightleftharpoons (24S)-24-hydroxycholesterol + NADP+ \\\\+ H2O The 4 substrates of this enzyme are cholesterol, NADPH, H+, and O2, and its 3 products are 24S-hydroxycholesterol, NADP+, and H2O. Like all other cytochrome P450s, cholesterol-24 hydroxylase utilizes an oxyferryl intermediate to hydroxylate cholesterol. The oxyferryl radical takes the hydrogen from carbon-24 to create an alkyl radical intermediate. The cholesterol alkyl radical then combines with the activated oxygen on the heme to create 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Function Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase contributes to brain cholesterol homeostasis by hydroxylating cholesterol at carbon-24 to 24S-hydroxycholesterol to allow for elimination of cholesterol from the brain to the liver. Only around 6–7 mg of cholesterol, however, are hydroxylated by this enzyme on a daily basis, suggesting the existence of alternative functions – presently unknown. In vitro experiments have shown that it is also capable of further metabolizing 24S-hydroxycholesterol into 24,25- and 24,27-dihydroxycholesterols. Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase has a variety of possible substrates, including: elongated steroid chains, cholesterol derivatives, and a variety of drug candidates. As such, it is also likely that it plays a role in lipid metabolism in the brain beyond cholesterol breakdown. Because 24S-hydroxycholesterol (main product of this enzyme) is a major activator of oxysterol liver X receptors (LXR), it is possible that cholesterol-24 hydroxylase may play an indirect regulatory role in the metabolism of lipids in the liver. 24S-hydroxycholesterol also regulates the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the brain, with high levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol shown to reduce mRNA levels of the following cholesterol synthesis enzymes: HMG CoA reductase, squalene synthase, and FPP synthase. Clinical significance Variable expression of cholesterol-24 hydroxylase has been linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. Studies have shown that in AD patients, there is significant decreased expression of cholesterol-24 hydroxylase in neurons. As a result, there is a marked increase of cholesterol in the brain tissue, consistent with the trend observed in AD patients.Substrates metabolized by cholesterol-24 hydroxylase. The red box contains a list of xenobiotics the enzyme can metabolize. The reactions in blue are commonly observed in the brain as part of maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Neuron degradation in AD has often been attributed to the imbalance in cholesterol homeostasis, and many scientist hypothesize that the lowered expression of cholesterol-24 hydroxylase may be the main cause of this imbalance. On the other hand, while there is decreased expression in the neurons, there is a contrasting increase of expression in the AD patients' astrocytes, where there is a consequent build-up of the product, 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Recent studies have shown that the increased levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in astrocytes may lead to a loss of glial glutamate transporters (EAAT2) and the consequent loss of the glutamate uptake function in the brain, another common symptom observed in AD patients. Still, the link between expression levels of cholesterol-24 hydroxylase and Alzheimer's Disease remain disputable. While some studies have shown that polymorphisms in the encoding gene for cholesterol-24 hydroxylase have an established positive correlation with AD onset, other publications did not find such an association. Increased expression of cholesterol-24 hydroxylase has also been observed in patients of traumatic brain injury, leading to decreased levels of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. This is hypothesized to be the brain’s typical response to injury. Cholesterol-24 hydroxylase is easily inhibited by many drugs due to its broad substrate specificity. It has been shown to metabolize Bufuralol, progesterone, Dextromethorphan, methoxyresorufin, cortisol, Diclofenac, Phenacetin, and testosterone. The ability for inhibition by various xenobiotics makes this enzyme a prime candidate for drug therapy for AD or other brain injuries.

It focused on high-performance custom V8 drivetrain swaps, the modification and production of rear and mid-engined cars, and custom-built turn-key automobiles (the Kelmark GT). Until 1986, Kelmark Engineering manufactured kits and complete, finished, turn-key vehicles which were either Volkswagen-based or built on tubular race car-type frames. The outfit gained its name from Russ Keller and Randy Markham, the two co-creators who started the operation. Up until at least 1989, the Kelmark GT was still available as a kit albeit the manufacturer was Kelmark Motors in Holt, Michigan. The cars are all \\"rare\\" models, but the Volkswagen-powered Kelmark GT was the most popular. Models ;Kelmark Sleeper : Early on Kelmark gained a reputation as an innovator starting with V8 conversions for Volkswagen Beetles and Chevrolet Corvairs. They produced a unique car for the time period: a V8-powered Volkswagen Beetle. It was marketed as the Sleeper, and was meant to look like a stock Beetle. It was this style chassis that the original Kelmark GT Coupe was designed around. ;Kelmark V8-Vair : a mid-engine V8 conversion for the Chevrolet Corvair. This mid-engine conversion turned the rear engined Chevrolet Corvair transaxle around 180 degrees and used a special bell housing and input shaft to bolt the V8 where the stock air-cooled engine would normally be connected. This makes the rotation of the differential backwards. :The main advantage of the Kelmark Conversion is increased power and good engine placement in terms of weight distribution. The setup has a 40/60 front to rear weight distribution ratio. The main disadvantage of the Kelmark Conversion is that it requires the turning of the trans-axle 180 degrees, flat, and connecting it to the engine with a bell housing adapter. A stronger shaft is needed to withstand the torque of the V8 engine. Also, since the ring gear turns backwards it requires a free flow oil system or a reverse cut ring and pinion gear set. They also required a heavy duty differential or differential modifications. The Corvair differential was not designed to handle more than . When you put the power and torque of even a mild V8 to the stock differential, it tries to split the case from the pinion gear being forced against the ring gear. :In the early days, Crown created a modified Volkswagen differential carrier by adding two extra pinion gears to the existing two gears which in effect lessened the load and made the differentials last longer. It was called a Beef-a-diff. When Corvair transaxles started to be used in high performance applications the differential again being a weak spot was modified by adding two more pinion gears. This created a cross legged look whence the \\"spider\\" nickname was derived. :Back then a CIDCO transaxle could be purchased, this stands for Corvair Improvement Distributing Company as owned by Bob Anderson. At one time he developed Corvair transaxles with many improvements, not only for Corvairs but the kit car industry as well. Bob improved the longevity of the differentials thru many modifications, re-manufacture and re-engineering, along with careful assembly. This included having reverse cut ring and pinion gears made for the Kelmark transaxle setup which ran in reverse. His setup was in great demand by the mid-engine Corvair enthusiasts. One of the trademarks of the CIDCO diff is the shoulder bolted steel plate cover on top of the differential in place of the tin cover. ;Kelmark 1 GT : initially constructed as a V8 engine special. The car had exterior styling that was distinctive for its debut in the beginning of '74. The style of the Kelmark 1 GT Coupe was copied directly from a Dino 206 / 246. ;Kelmark II GT : In late '74 Kelmark Engineering decided to adapt it to fit the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle chassis. This revised car was introduced as the Kelmark II. The Kelmark 1 GT Coupe was partially restyled into the Kelmark II utilizing styling cues from the experimental Two Rotor Corvette to make production easier/cheaper/better.\\"Kelmark History at Bugoholics\\" The Kelmark II had a large in-set hood scoop. The Kelmark GT went back to the smooth hood similar to what it used before on the Kelmark 1 GT. Rear view of a V8-engined Kelmark GT ;Kelmark GT : The next model iteration after the Kelmark II GT. The Kelmark GT was featured in the magazine Car and Driver in 1977Car and Driver, November 1977. and 1979.\\"Going for it\\", Car and Driver, 1979. The final body design of the Kelmark GT, as well as the Kelmark II, was 5 inches wider than an original Ferrari-built Dino 246 GTS in order to allow it to fit over a VW chassis. The windshield came from a Ford Pinto, and the side glass was the rear windows of a Chevoolet Caprice/Impala turned backwards. The Kelmark GT was offered in the following packages and could be ordered as a basic kit, partially assembled, or turn-key automobile: ;Kelmark GT Independence : a fiberglass body kit for a Standard Volkswagen Beetle chassis using a VW or Porsche Type 4 engine. Many used Hot Rod VW engines such as the 1679, 1835, 1915, 2076 and 2332cc displacement engines with twin carburetors for 'mild' to 'wild' performance increases. A few also utilized the Porsche 356 and Porsche 912 engines. ;Kelmark GTS : the same as the Kelmark GT Independence except it was finished in metallic silver. Most had the optional rear high-rise scoop installed at the factory. This allowed clearance to install a Buick 231 Cubic inch V6 using an engine adapter to fit the VW transaxle, such as those sold by Kennedy Engineering. ;Kelmark GT Liberator : more customized, and could be mounted on a tube frame, Porsche or heavily modified VW chassis or even a custom combination with Mazda Rotary, Chevy Corvair, Porsche 6, Buick V6 or small- block V8 power.Company marketing brochure, scanned copy available here and here. It is estimated that only 200 Kelmark GT's were built as Liberator cars. ;Kelmark GT Chairman : a fully loaded Kelmark GT with all luxury options such as leather interior, air conditioning, and high-end stereo equipment as offered by \\"Kelmark Motors\\" in Holt, Michigan. The cars were mostly powered by a rear engine, Buick 3.8 litre V6. This caused the car to be tail end heavy; which, unfortunately affected the handling of the car. ;Kelmark Toronado GT : a big-block V8 \\"Super Car\\" utilizing a custom tube frame to accept an Oldsmobile Toronado drive unit mounted in the mid-engine position driving the rear wheels. Typically, these rare GT's were powered by the Olds 425 or 455 cubic inch (7.5 litre) engine. One of these models was outfitted with a highly tuned, Chevrolet big-block 454 cubic inch engine and was tested by Car and Driver and broke the 200 mph barrier. Thus, becoming the world's fastest street-legal sports car in 1977. Car & Driver reported this as the “Fastest documented speed ever attained by a street machine”, clocked at 202.7 by Car & Driver at the former Transportation Research Center in Ohio (now a part of Honda's US test facility). This proved the cars advanced aerodynamic and performance capabilities. :Bill Porterfield, a former Oldsmobile engineer, was responsible for the record breaking car. Later, he was the design engineer at GM for the Pontiac Fiero. He used a custom tubular frame built by his company Mid-Engineering. This special chassis utilized the Oldsmobile Toronado Turbo- Hydamatic 425 transaxle behind a 700 hp Chevrolet ZL-1, 454 big-block motor. The Mid-Engineering chassis used Chevrolet Corvette rear suspension arms and custom half shafts to allow wide performance tires. To put this accomplishment into perspective one should consider that it took Ferrari until March 1987 to come out with a 200 mph street legal sports car, the Ferrari F40. The F40 was a low production volume special which was not a mainstream Ferrari. Just a few months later Road and Track tested several specialty sports cars. The Ruf CTR Porsche 911 Yellow Bird and the Koenig RS Porsche 911; which, broke 200 mph. These two ran at 211 and 201 mph, respectively. Again, these were low volume custom sports cars. In these same tests, which were completed by Road and Track, with Le Mans winning Paul Frere and Formula One champ Phil Hill driving, the Ferrari Testarossa, Lamborghini Countach 5000S and AMG Hammer Mercedes-Benz 300E all failed to break 200 mph.

He was a member of a select circle of innovative researchers that included George Dantzig, Abraham Charnes, W.W. Cooper, William Orchard- Hays, Martin Beale and others. He worked and taught as an actuary and as a mathematician in operational research from 1925 to 1995. From 1939 until his death in 1995, he lived in the U.K. where he was a defence scientist with the Royal Naval Scientific Service, and a Professor at Birmingham and Sussex Universities. He was a Companion of the Operational Research Society, a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and a member of the Mathematical Association. He is the author or coauthor of at least a dozen books on mathematical programming, game theory, manpower planning and statistics and of many journal publications and conference papers. Early life Steven (originally István) Vajda was born in Budapest in 1901, to Josef and Aurelia Wollak. His family moved to Vienna in 1903, and it was in this city that Steven was raised and educated. He read mathematics and received a Dr. Phil. Degree in 1925 from the University of Vienna. One of his first appointments was in Romania where he was an actuarial advisor to the Romanian government. He eventually returned to Vienna to continue his work as an actuary and was married there in 1929. In 1939, Steven, wife Eva and their two children, Hedy and Robert, fled the Nazi regime that had taken over Austria in the 1938 Anschluss. The children were sent to Sweden and Eva was admitted to the UK as a domestic servant. Steven’s friend Karl Popper had already left Austria and, as a New Zealand resident and lecturer in philosophy at Canterbury University College, he found Steven a job and helped him to obtain the necessary travel documents. Steven was then able to enter England because he was merely in transit. The plan was to reunite the family in England and then leave for New Zealand, but before that could happen, the Second World War started and the Vajdas were briefly interned as “enemy aliens”. They were housed in a camp on the Isle of Man with other refugees from across Europe. The internees organized a school for their children and, of course, Steven taught mathematics. Most of the internees were released after several months and Steven found employment as an actuary. Career in the United Kingdom Meanwhile, mathematicians were in demand to staff the newly formed military operational research groups. H. Seal who was with the Admiralty O.R. group, had read Steven’s research publications in the Bulletin des actuaires suisses, and when he found that Steven was in England he sought him out and proposed that he join the war effort. After much bureaucratic manoeuvring, Steven joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service of the British Admiralty. When the war ended, Seal saw to it that Steven was one of the first “aliens” to be given British citizenship. Steven stayed with the Admiralty until 1964, holding such appointments as Assistant Director of Operational Research and Head of the Mathematical Group. In 1964, he “retired” for the first time. In 1964, Steven became Professor of Operational Research at the University of Birmingham. Upon his second “retirement” in 1967 he continued at Birmingham in a research appointment in mathematical statistics, working with Henry DanielsThe Guardian, David Wishart and Vic Barnett. He stayed until 1973, when, at the behest of Professor Pat Rivett, he once again “retired” in order to become Visiting Professor of Mathematics at Sussex University. He remained an active member of the Sussex staff until he died in 1995 in Brighton, two years after the birth of his first great grandchild Alexandra Eva (named after his wife).

They were created by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch.The Ultimates #8 They were created for the Ultimate universe franchise in place of the existing Marvel Comics alien species, the Skrulls, which play a similar role in the franchise's mainstream continuity. Later, Marvel would choose to distinguish between the Skrulls and Chitauri of the Ultimate universe. The race first appeared in Ultimates #8 (Nov 2002). The Chitauri would later go on to have counterparts on Earth-616. The species would later be adapted to other media, most notably appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Fictional species biography =Earth-1610= The race called Chitauri appeared as Ultimate Marvel's (Earth-1610's) counterpart to the Skrulls. They are a shapeshifting alien species who have attempted to conquer the Earth, most notably during World War II and again in the early 21st century. The Chitauri claim to be part of \\"the immune system of the Universe\\", wiping out disorder and free will wherever they find it. They seem to prefer to act behind the scenes, mimicking and influencing the social and military methods of the species they are currently infiltrating. For example, they aided the Nazis in their attempt at world conquest by providing them with the technology to create a nuclear bomb carried by an intercontinental ballistic missile. However, this attempt was thwarted by the prototype super-soldier codenamed Captain America. Through the entire conflict of World War II, the Chitauri were being driven out of their operations in Africa and Europe, even from their main Japanese training camps in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following the end of the war, the Chitauri withdrew to make new plans. The next attempt at conquest was more subtle (at first), involving long-term methods of manipulation such as will-inhibiting drugs in many nations' water supplies, influencing the media, and R.F.I.D. (radio-frequency identification) microchips to be implanted in schoolchildren, among other means. The Chitauri also infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., particularly the Psi-Division which could telepathically ferret out Chitauri agents. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to detect some of the low-ranking \\"drone\\" staff of the aliens, disguised as common office workers, and wiped them out in an assault led by Black Widow and Hawkeye. The Chitauri planted false information through the compromised Psi- Division that led S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates into a trap on a small Micronesian island; due to the combined efforts of Iron Man and Thor, the Ultimates, Nick Fury and a handful of S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers survived, but thousands of S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers were killed and dozens of Helicarriers were destroyed. The Chitauri then counterattacked by infiltrating the Triskelion and capturing The Wasp. The Chitauri leader (known only by his former Nazi identity as Herr Kleiser) took the Wasp to a hidden Chitauri base in Arizona. However, their location was given away when a fleet of damaged Chitauri starships suddenly entered Earth's atmosphere to hover above the formerly secret base, claiming that they were fleeing major defeats across the galaxy by their intergalactic enemies and that the remainder of their forces are forced to the \\"backwaters\\" of the Milky Way Galaxy (i.e. Earth's solar system). Disregarding Herr Kleiser's long efforts, the Chitauri ordered him to destroy Earth and its solar system with a doomsday bomb as part of a scorched- earth policy and retreat to the \\"lower fourth-dimension\\". The Ultimates and all available S.H.I.E.L.D. and military forces immediately converged on the alien fleet. At the same time, Captain America battled his old enemy Kleiser, but was unable to defeat him alone. At Captain America's urging/mocking of Kleiser touching Betty Ross (Hulk's crush), the Hulk was able to beat, chop, and devour Kleiser. It is presently presumed that the combination of the Chitauri's series of intergalactic defeats and the destruction of the Chitauri fleet on Earth spelled the complete and total defeat of the alien race.The Ultimates #8–13. Marvel Comics. During the Chitauri-Kree War, an entire Chitauri (whose true forms resemble their Avengers counterparts) armada was fighting their enemies when they encountered Gah Lak Tus. When their ships were being heavily damaged by the entity, a rift in the fabric of reality brought a being from another universe, which called itself Galactus. Gah Lak Tus merged with the visitor, and created an even more powerful Galactus with need to feed.Hunger #1. Marvel Comics. =Earth-616= A new iteration of the Chitauri (inspired by their portrayal in The Avengers film) first appeared in the mainstream Earth-616 continuity and unlike their Earth-1610 counterpart, they are a distinct species from the Skrulls. Most of them are simple-minded dogged creatures, similar to insects, to the point of following a queen.Captain America: Steve Rogers #8. Marvel Comics. The Chitauri first appeared as enemies of the new Nova. Nova was able to defeat an entire Chitauri armada and Titus with the Ultimate Nullifier that he stole from them in the first place. They are currently holding Nova's father Jesse as an hostage on a planet similar to Saturn.Nova vol. 5 #5. Marvel Comics. The Chitauri have Jesse Alexander captive on their planet Chitauri Prime as one of the Chitauri's slaves that fight in their gladiatorial arena.Nova Vol. 5 #25. Marvel Comics. The Chitauri are revealed to have made a Chitauri clone of Jesse Alexander which also has Jesse's memories.Nova Vol. 6 #5. Marvel Comics. At the time when Captain America's memories were rewritten by Red Skull's clone using the powers of Kobik to be a Hydra agent, Red Skull's clone had Captain America steal some Chitauri eggs in order to lure the Chitauri to Earth so that they can raze it. The Alpha Flight Space Program had to fight the Chitauri swarms where they took out four different swarms in a month.Captain America: Steve Rogers #8-10. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, a larger Chitauri swarm was defeated by Quasar where it was predicted that a much larger Chitauri swarm will appear that will be larger than the Annihilation Wave.Civil War II: The Oath #1. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, the Chitauri arrived at Earth where the Alpha Flight Space Program, the Ultimates, Quasar, and Hyperion of Earth-13034. As Hydra began its takeover, Captain America activated the Planetary Defense Shield trapping the Chitauri and those fighting them outside of Earth.Secret Empire #0. Marvel Comics. As those trapped outside of Earth continue fighting the Chitauri, they are unable to convince the representatives on the Galactic Council into helping them against the Chitauri.Secret Empire #3. Marvel Comics. As Spectrum tells Captain Marvel that they are able to make inter- dimensional supply runs and have found the location of the Chitauri Queen Eggs, the waves of Chitauri and their Leviathans are increasing in size and frequency leaving the technicians without enough time to fix the severe structural damage to the station. Monica suggests that America Chavez relocate the heroes and people stuck outside the Planetary Defense Shield to an alternate reality given the Intergalactic Council in their reality are unsympathetic to Earth's plight. Captain Marvel rejects this idea stating the heroes were charged with a mission to protect the Earth against the Chitauri invasion and they are the only thing standing in the way if the Planetary Defense Shield were to go down for some reason. Captain Marvel then turns her attention to a comatose Avril Kincaid who we find out did survive being swallowed by the Leviathan and was pulled out of the wreckage by Nova. Captain Marvel admits her fault in the situation and the raising of the Planetary Defense Shield and pleads for Avril to wake up because the team desperately needs the strength of her powers.Secret Empire #7. Marvel Comics. After Quasar awakens from her coma thanks to Sam Wilson using the Cosmic Cube fragment he had in order to find a way to take down the Planetary Defense Shield, she takes down the Planetary Defense Shield allowing Captain Marvel to fly to the location of the Chitauri eggs which she destroys.Secret Empire #8.

Marvel Comics. – A Chitauri Warlord kept in hibernation due to his brutal methods. He would go on fight Nova, the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Champions. Powers and abilities The Chitauri were able to mimic human form and absorb human knowledge, by sucking the organs or brains out of the humans they imitated. As seen in the scene from the first movie, where one pulls a military officer onto the roof of a building and stabbing the officer's gut and starts to suck something out. In their natural form, they appear to be large, and reptilian, but no clear images of their native form have been shown. Inspiration Millar's conception of the Chitauri was inspired by the British conspiracy theorist David Icke. Icke believes the world is secretly run by an elite called the Illuminati who are in reality shape-shifting reptilian humanoids. The term Chitauri to describe these shape-shifting reptilian humanoids gained notoriety from “The Reptilian Agenda”, where Zulu Shaman and historian Credo Mutwa and David Icke reveal the story of the Chitauri (how Credo Mutwa and Africans refer to reptilians) takeover of planet Earth and how a shape-shifting Chitauri (which can also mean “Talker”) race has controlled planet Earth for thousands of years.  Comparison with Skrulls  Another race called Skrulls, physically resembling the Skrulls of the mainstream Marvel universe, appear later (led by the billion-year-old Skrull Emperor, Kl'rt); these Skrulls dislike being confused with the Chitauri, whom they call terrorists. They have extremely advanced technology, but have not been observed to shapeshift. These Skrulls were seen only in an alternate timeline in which Reed Richards contacted their world via his teleporter. The events leading to that timeline were altered in Ultimate Fantastic Four #29, and contact was never made.Ultimate Fantastic Four #27–29 (2004) In other media =Television= * The Chitauri appear in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\". This version of the Chitauri is led by Korvac and their appearance resembles their portrayal in The Avengers film. When Rocket Raccoon's ship is pulled into the Chitauri ship, Rocket Raccoon fakes surrender so that they can free the captive members of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Afterwards, Spider-Man discovers that the Chitauri are planning to destroy the Earth. The Guardians of the Galaxy plan to run the Chitauri ship into the Sun while fighting the Chitauri forces. When their plan does not work, the Guardians of the Galaxy end up making their way towards the Dark Matter Cannon. While Nova and Spider-Man head to the Dark Matter Cannon, the Guardians of the Galaxy fight the Chitauri and Korvac. After Korvac is defeated by Groot, Nova destroys the Dark Matter Cannon and the Chitauri ship is destroyed. In \\"The Return of the Guardians of the Galaxy\\", Titus leads the Chitauri into targeting Nova's helmet while ending up in conflict with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider-Man. After Titus is defeated, the remaining Chitauri escape from Earth. * The Chitauri appear in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"Avengers: Impossible\\". Impossible Man was working on a documentary on the Chitauri until they spotted him and chased him across the galaxy. Impossible Man made a television series starring Falcon so that he can be ready to fight off the Chitauri. When a Chitauri scouting party arrived on Earth, Falcon and the rest of the Avengers ended up fighting the Chitauri to keep them from getting to Impossible Man. Falcon then convinces Impossible Man to send the Chitauri far far away from Earth by deputizing him in one scene as an Avenger. Impossible Man shapeshifts into an intergalactic missile to send the Chitauri far far away from Earth. * The Chitauri appear in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode \\"The Backstabbers.\\" Some Chitauri are shown to make up Nebula's spaceship crew. * The Chitauri have been referenced in the TV shows taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: ** The Chitauri from The Avengers film are referenced several times in the live-action television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In the pilot episode, the Chitauri appear via archive footage from The Avengers as Skye outlines public knowledge of superheroes and supernatural events. Additionally in the episode, Agent Grant Ward recovers a Chitauri \\"neural link\\" from an illegal arms dealer named T. Vanchat. In the episode \\"F.Z.Z.T.\\", it was mentioned that a lot of firefighters were sent to New York after the Avengers had stopped the Chitauri invasion. Some of these firefighters from Wrigley, a small Pennsylvanian town, discovered a Chitauri helmet and brought it back home as a souvenir. Unknown to them the helmet had a rust-like alien virus in it that slowly killed off those that were exposed to it through static electricity. Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons were able to come up with an antiserum to be the cure for the alien virus after testing it on some rats using Chitauri DNA residue found on the helmet. The Chitauri helmet was placed in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Sandbox base for safekeeping. In the episode \\"The Magical Place\\", salvaged Chitauri metal appears and is stated to be a component of the Project Centipede devices seen on the series. In the episode \\"Broken Promises,\\" it is revealed that Senator Ellen Nadeer's parents were killed during the Chitauri invasion. ** The Chitauri are mentioned in the Jessica Jones episode \\"AKA It's Called Whiskey.\\" ** In Luke Cage, salvaged Chitauri metal is used by Hammer Industries to create the Judas bullets, shrapnel-like ammunition capable of piercing Luke Cage's bulletproof skin and wounding or even killing him. Willis Stryker uses them against Luke on several occasions and uses an alliance with Mariah Dillard to manipulate the NYPD into arming the Emergency Service Unit with mass-produced Judas bullets. =Film= * The Chitauri appear in the 2006 animated movies Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2 as the main antagonists of the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. like P.E.T.I.R appearance in The Ultimates, they do show their true form: one feet tall reptilian creatures with green skin, and fire blasts from their hands. Primary antagonist Herr Kleiser has the ability to shapeshift; he is referred to as their Super Soldier and compared to Captain America.Ultimate Avengers * The Chitauri appear in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe. They are in league with Thanos through his vizier, a hooded being called \\"the Other\\" (played by Alexis Denisof). Lacking their ability to shape-shift, they are presented as a race of grey-skinned, six-fingered reptilian humanoids that have a bio-mechanical physiology and superhuman attributes. Their technology ranges from hovercraft- like skimmers and Necrocraft, to living airborne troop carriers called Leviathans all neurally linked with a mothership. ** The Chitauri first appear in the 2012 film The Avengers, where the Other, acting on behalf of Thanos, lends the Chitauri to Loki for the invasion of Earth. While they eventually overwhelm the Avengers, Iron Man destroys the mothership with a hijacked nuclear missile with the invading forces dropping dead instantly. ** The Chitauri appear in the 2014 film Guardians of the Galaxy. The Other briefly appears where he contacts Ronan the Accuser and Nebula about Gamora's betrayal, and calls them to the Sanctuary on behalf of Thanos. Once the two of them appear, Ronan argues his case to Thanos while The Other scolds him for his failure, and is then promptly killed by Ronan.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=327678157386643&set;=vb.272887986198994&type;=2&theater; A Chitauri soldier is also seen as a prisoner in the Collector's museum. ** Chitauri technology appears in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It is being studied and used by a Hydra faction led by Baron Strucker – many of his troops wear suits and use weapons made of Chitauri armor, and Strucker's hidden lab houses the remains of a Leviathan. Furthermore, as first hinted in the psychological trauma shown in Iron Man 3 and augmented by Scarlet Witch's powers giving him a nightmarish vision, Tony Stark has been fearful that the Chitauri may eventually return to Earth, which leads to his rash actions in creating Ultron. ** Chitauri technology appears in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Alongside the technology of the Dark Elves and Stark Industries, the Chitauri technology is used by Adrian Toomes and his cohorts, who steal it from Damage Control and modify it into weapons to sell on the black market, and to forge technology such as Vulture's flight suit and Shocker's gauntlets. ** The Chitauri appear in Avengers: Infinity War. They appear as Thanos' enforcers in his mission to obtain the Infinity Stones. It is also revealed in a flashback that the Chitauri took part in the invasion of Gamora's home planet when she was a child, resulting in her being taken in by Thanos. ** The Chitauri appear in Avengers: Endgame. They are shown in a flashback that took place during the events of The Avengers where some of them were shot down by the Ancient One. In the present, the Chitauri and their Leviathans are among the members of Thanos' army that the Nebula of the past brings to the present. While some Chitauri and Leviathans are slain, the rest are taken out by Iron Man using the Infinity Gauntlet where he reduces Thanos and his army to dust. * The Chitauri appear in Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Maximum Overload with their vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker. They appear as servants of Loki. =Video games= * The Chitauri appear in Lego Marvel's Avengers, based on the first two Avengers films. * The Chitauri appear in Marvel Avengers Academy. * The Chitauri appear in Fortnite Battle Royale as part of the Avengers: Endgame tie-in event. The players as the Chitauri have to help Thanos collect the Infinity Stones in order to defeat the Hero team. =Live performance= * The Marvel Cinematic Universe version of the Chitauri will appear in the Marvel Universe LIVE! arena show.

Gamma- butyrobetaine dioxygenase catalyses the formation of L-carnitine from gamma- butyrobetaine, the last step in the L-carnitine biosynthesis pathway. Carnitine is essential for the transport of activated fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane during mitochondrial beta oxidation. In humans, gamma- butyrobetaine dioxygenase can be found in kidney (high), liver (moderate), and brain (very low). BBOX1 has recently been identified as a potential cancer gene on the basis of a large-scale microarray data analysis. Reaction Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. It catalyses the following reaction: :4-trimethylammoniobutanoate (γ-butyrobetaine) + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 \\\\rightleftharpoons 3-hydroxy-4-trimethylammoniobutanoate (L-carnitine) + succinate + CO2 The three substrates of this enzyme are 4-trimethylammoniobutanoate (γ-butyrobetaine), 2-oxoglutarate, and O2, whereas its three products are 3-hydroxy-4-trimethylammoniobutanoate (L-carnitine), succinate, and carbon dioxide. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation. Iron is a cofactor for gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. Similar to many other 2OG oxygenases, the activity of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase can be stimulated by reducing agents such as ascorbate and glutathione. The catalytic activity of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase can be stimulated with different metal ions, especially potassium ions. Both the apo (PDB id: 3N6W); and the holo (PDB id: 3O2G); structures of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase have been solved, demonstrating an induced fit mechanism may contribute to the catalytic activity of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase is promiscuous in substrate selectivity and it processes a number of modified substrates, including the natural catalytic products L-carnitine and D-carnitine, forming 3-dehydrocarnitine and trimethylaminoacetone. Gamma- butyrobetaine dioxygenase also catalyses the oxidation of mildronate to form multiple products including malonic acid semialdehyde, dimethylamine, formaldehyde and (1-methylimidazolidin-4-yl)acetic acid, which is proposed to be formed via a Stevens rearrangement mechanism. Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase is unique among other human 2OG oxygenases that it catalyses both hydroxylation (e.g.: L-carnitine), demethylation (e.g.: formaldehyde) and C-C bond formation (e.g.: (1-methylimidazolidin-4-yl)acetic acid). Inhibition Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase is an inhibition target for 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl)propionate (mildronate, also known as THP, MET-88, Meldonium or Quarterine). Mildronate is offered, clinically, to non-U.S. markets, in treatment of angina and myocardial infarction. Some studies suggested that mildronate may also be beneficial for the treatment of neurological disorder, diabetes, and seizures and alcohol intoxication. Mildronate is currently manufactured and marketed by Grindeks, a pharmaceutical company based in Latvia. To date, at least five clinical trial reports were published in peer-reviewed journals documenting the efficacy and safety of mildronate on the treatments of angina, stroke and chronic heart failure. However, there have been no randomized clinical trials to support the use of mildronate to treat any cardiovascular disease. Mildronate has a similar structure to the natural substrate gamma-butyrobetaine, with a NH group replacing the CH2 of gamma-butyrobetaine at the C-4 position. A crystal structure of mldronate in complex with gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase was published, and it suggests mildronate bind to gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase in exactly the same way as gamma-butyrobetaine (PDB id: 3MS5). To date, most enzyme inhibitors for human 2OG oxygenases bind to the cosubstrate 2OG binding site; mildronate is a rare example of a non-peptidyl substrate mimic inhibitor. Although initial reports suggested mildronate is a non-competitive and non-hydroxylatable analogue of gamma-butyrobetaine, further studies have identified mildronate is indeed a substrate for gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. Similar to other 2OG oxygenases, gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase can be inhibited by 2OG mimics and aromatic inhibitors such as pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate. Other reported gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase inhibitors include cyclopropyl-substituted gamma-butyrobetaines and 3-(2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl)propanoic acid, which is a mechanism-based enzyme inhibitor. Assay Several in vitro biochemical assays have been applied to monitor the catalytic activity of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. Early methods have mainly focused on the use of radiolabeled compounds, including 14C-labelled gamma-butyrobetaine and 14C-labelled 2OG. Enzyme-coupled method have also been applied to detect carnitine formation, by using the enzyme carnitine acetyltransferase and 14C-labelled acetyl-coenzyme A to give labelled acetylcarnitine for detection. Using this method, it is possible to detect carnitine concentration down to the pico-molar range. Other analytical methods including mass spectrometry and NMR have also been applied, and they are in particularly useful for the study of the coupling ratio between 2OG oxidation and substrate formation, and for the characterisation of unknown enzymatic products. However, these methods are often not suitable for high- throughput screening and require expensive instrumentation. A potentially high-throughput fluorescence-based assay has also been proposed by using a fluorinated-gamma-butyrobetaine analog. The fluoride ions released as a result of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase catalyses can be detected by using chemosensors such as protected fluorescein.

He was eminent in his profession, and for thirty-three years, from 1784 to 1807, was surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He was appointed Master of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800 and was among those who gave a donation to help fund their new surgical library. He was also on the College's list of first Governors, first Examiners of Surgeons and the first Court of Assistants.A Treatise on Pleading and Parties to Actions - By Joseph Chitty, Henry Greening, John A. Dunlap, Edward Duncan Ingraham, Jonathan Cogswell Perkins - 1851 He wrote several papers, including one (unpublished) entitled \\"The Effects of Cancer\\". He lived in London's Chancery Lane, and later at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and developed close friendships with the painter George Romney, sculptor John Flaxman, and writers William Hayley, Isaac Reed and William Blake, who, like Long, were members of the Unincreasable Club, at nearby Queens Head, Holborn, London. Long sat for Romney as his first subject for a portraitThe Letters of William Blake - Page 118 by William Blake, Geoffrey Keynes - 1956 which was done for his friend Hayley.George Romney by Arthur Bensley Chamberlain - 1910 Subsequently Long acquired many of Romney's paintings, which were eventually sold by Christie's on behalf of the family, in 1890. Marwell Hall William Long purchased Marwell Hall near Winchester, Hampshire about 1798, and between 1812-1816 made considerable alterations, resulting in what is now the house as it stands today. He was a man of compassion and generosity, and when resident at his country seat away from London, he always gave his advice and medicine gratuitously to the poor of the surrounding neighbourhood.Salisbury and Winchester Journal, 28 March 1818 He and his wife Alice (daughter of Edmund Dawson of Wharton, Lancaster) had no children, and in his will Long made generous bequests to his nephews and nieces.The Grove Diaries: The Rise and Fall of an English Family, 1809-1925 By Desmond Hawkins - 1995 After his death on 24 March 1818 his collections of preserved medical specimens and surgical instruments were donated by his executors to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum in London.A Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Calculi and Other Animal Concretions etc; by Thomas Taylor, Royal College of Surgeons of England Museum Alice continued to live at Marwell Hall, and during the Owslebury riots of 1830 a mob of rioters, accompanied by John Boyes, a local farmer, arrived at the house. The mob demanded money from Alice and John Boyce demanded a reduction in the rents of her farm tenants, so they could pay their agricultural labourers higher wages. (Afterwards 245 men were arrested and brought to trial at Winchester. Two of the prisoners were hanged and Boyes was transported to Tasmania for seven years but was pardoned and returned home in 1835). William Long is buried in Salisbury Cathedral and his widow erected a monument to 'perpetuate the memory of a much esteemed husband'. Part of the epitaph, written in Latin, says: Alice died 18 September 1840, leaving numerous charitable bequests.

The systematic name of this enzyme class is -kynurenine, NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include kynurenine 3-hydroxylase, kynurenine hydroxylase, and -kynurenine-3-hydroxylase. It participates in tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine catabolic pathway. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on paired donors, with O2 as the oxidant. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase catalyzes the insertion of molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring of kynurenine to produce 3-hydroxy--kynurenine. It employs one cofactor, FAD. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase serves as an important branch point in the kynurenine pathway and, as a result, is an attractive drug target for immunological, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory diseases. Currently, most research on the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase enzyme has been focused primarily on rat models and in yeast, both of which have been demonstrated to have high sequence homology with the human kynurenine 3-monooxygenase protein. Studies have shown the beneficial effects of enzyme inhibition in these eukaryotic kynurenine 3-monooxygenase active sites, thus making this enzyme an attractive target for human drug design.  Structure  Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase is a dimer containing asymmetric subunits and has one FAD- binding domain as its prosthetic group. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase contains a linker region involved in substrate binding following a second strand of an antiparallel β-sheet, a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet domain, and an α-helix at the carboxy-terminal. The hydrophobic C-terminus acts as the mitochondrial anchoring domain and participates in enzymatic activity.  Active site  While no scientific literature reports a crystal image of a kynurenine 3-monooxygenase complex with -kynurenine, structural studies of the enzyme in yeast co-crystallized with UPF 648 reveal how the FAD cofactor and substrate are bound in the active site. Chemical similarities between UPF 648 and -kynurenine suggest that the substrate binds adjacent to the Re-face of the flavoprotein. A loop containing the residues Pro321–Gln325 is believed to be the oxygen-binding site above the re-side of the FAD prosthetic group. Each monomer contains a conserved hydrophobic pocket (residues Leu221, Met230, Ile232, Leu234, Phe246, Pro321, Phe322) positioned around the substrate’s aromatic benzene moiety. A conserved Gln325 polar residue is also involved in hydrogen bonding on the -kynurenine carbonyl group, as well as on the hydrogen on the FAD N3 atom. Arg83 and Tyr97 also form polar contacts with the carboxylate in the amino acid moiety on the substrate.  Mechanism  Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation of -kynurenine to 3-hydroxy--kynurenine with concomitant interconversion of NADPH to NADP+. The reaction mechanism is not entirely known, but is believed to follow mechanisms related to the flavin-dependent monooxygenases. After -kynurenine binds, NADPH reduces FAD and leaves as NADP+. Oxygen then binds and creates an -kynurenine- FAD-hydroperoxide intermediate. This intermediate is the electrophilic source for the hydroxylation reaction, yielding a primary ketimine form of the product and the C4a-hydroxy-FAD. Tautomerization yields 3-hydroxy--kynurenine in complex with the enzyme (E Fl HOH-P). Dissociation of 3-hydroxy--kynurenine and H2O leads to the free enzyme (E Flox). The mechanism of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase FAD is shown in blue. The substrate, intermediate, and product are depicted in black.  Biological function Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase catalyzes the conversion of -kynurenine to 3-hydroxy--kynurenine, an important bioactive metabolite in the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway is responsible for over 95% of tryptophan oxidative degradation. -Kynurenine is an important branch point of this metabolic pathway, being converted into the neurotoxin 3-hydroxy--kynurenine via kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, the neuroprotectant kynurenic acid through kynurenine amino transferases, or anthranilic acid by kynureninase. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase regulates the downstream production of quinolinic acid, which can generate reactive free radicals and activates the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors, producing excitotoxic lesions in the central nervous system of mammals. Quinolinic acid is also the bioprecursor of NAD+. Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase leads to an increase of kynurenic acid in the kynurenine pathway. This metabolite functions as an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and as an antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As a result, regulation at the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase enzyme determines the neurotoxic and neuroprotective potential of the kynurenine pathway. Disease relevance Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase is an attractive drug target for several neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, especially Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Administration of potent enzyme inhibitors has demonstrated promising pharmacological results. Specifically, genetic elimination of the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase enzyme has been shown to suppress toxicity of the huntingtin protein in yeast and Drosophila models of Huntington's disease. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase deficiency, which can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both, leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenic acid and anthranilic acid. Recent research suggests that hyperphysiologic concentrations of kynurenine in kynurenine 3-monooxygenase-deficient patients results in a shift towards kynurenic acid production, believed to be related to cognitive deficits in predictive pursuit and visuospatial working memory. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver.

The plan entailed the death by starvation of millions of Slavs following Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union (see Generalplan Ost). The premise behind the Hunger Plan was that Germany was not self-sufficient in food supplies; to sustain the war and keep up the domestic morale it needed to obtain the food from conquered lands at any cost. It was an engineered famine, planned and implemented as an act of policy. This plan was developed before the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) invasion and provided for diverting of the Ukrainian food stuffs away from central and northern Russia and redirecting them for the benefit of the invading army and the population in Germany. The plan resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The plan as a means of mass murder was outlined in several documents, including one that became known as Göring's Green Folder, which quoted a number of \\"20 to 30 million\\" expected Russian deaths from \\"military actions and crises of food supply\\".  Plan  Herbert Backe The architect of the Hunger Plan was Herbert Backe. Together with others, including Heinrich Himmler, Backe led a coalition of Nazi politicians dedicated to securing Germany's food supply. The Hunger Plan may have been decided on almost as soon as Hitler announced his intention to invade the Soviet Union in December 1940. Certainly by 2 May 1941, it was in the advanced stages of planning and was ready for discussion between all the major Nazi state ministries and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) office of economics, headed by General Georg Thomas. The lack of capacity of the Russian railways, the inadequacy of road transport and the shortages of fuel, meant that the German Army would have to feed itself by living off the land in the territories they conquered in the western regions of the Soviet Union. A meeting on 2 May 1941 between the permanent secretaries responsible for logistical planning for the invasion of the Soviet Union, as well as other high-ranking Nazi party functionaries, state officials and military officers, included in its conclusions: The minutes of the meeting exemplify German planning for the occupation of the Soviet Union. They present a deliberate decision on the life or death of vast parts of the local population as a logical, inevitable development. Christopher Browning: The Origins of the Final Solution. The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942. With contributions by Jürgen Matthäus. Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press and Jerusalem, Yad Vashem 2004, , p. 235 Three weeks later, on 23 May 1941, economic policy guidelines for the coming invasion appeared that had been produced by Hans-Joachim Riecke's agricultural section of the Economic Staff East, which had direct responsibility for the economic and agricultural exploitation of the soon-to- be occupied Soviet territories: The perceived grain surpluses of Ukraine figured particularly prominently in the vision of a \\"self-sufficient\\" Germany. Hitler himself had stated in August 1939 that Germany needed \\"the Ukraine, in order that no one is able to starve us again as in the last war\\". Ukraine did not produce enough grain for export to solve Germany's problems. Scooping off the agricultural surplus in Ukraine for the purpose of feeding the Reich called for: # the annihilation of what the German régime perceived as a superfluous population (Jews, the population of Ukrainian large cities such as Kiev which did not receive any supplies at all)On Kiev, see Karel C. Berkhoff: Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine under Nazi Rule. Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2004, pp. 164–186. # the extreme reduction of the rations allocated to Ukrainians in the remaining cities # a reduction in the foodstuffs consumed by the farming population In the discussion of the plan, Backe noted a \\"surplus population\\" in Russia of about 20 to 30 million. If that population was cut off from food, it could be used to feed the invading German Army and the German population. Industrialization had created a large urban society in the Soviet Union. The Backe plan envisioned that this population, numbering many millions, would be cut off from their food supply, thus freeing up the food produced in the Soviet Union, now at Germany's disposal, to sustain Germans. Great suffering among the native Soviet population was envisaged, with tens of millions of deaths expected within the first year of the German occupation. Starvation was to be an integral part of the German campaign. Planning for starvation preceded the invasion and became an essential condition of it; the German planners believed that the assault on the Soviet Union could not succeed without it.Kay, Exploitation, Resettlement, Mass Murder, pp. 133–139 According to Gesine Gerhard, German agricultural officials saw the Hunger Plan as a solution to the European food crisis and a method for exterminating the \\"undesirable\\" Soviet population.  Effects of the plan  The Hunger Plan caused the deaths of millions of citizens in the German-occupied territories of the Soviet Union. The historian Timothy Snyder estimates that \\"4.2 million Soviet citizens (largely Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) [were] starved by the German occupiers in 1941–1944\\".Timothy Snyder: Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin. Basic Books, New York 2010, p. 411. Among the victims were many Jews, whom the Nazis forced into ghettos and Soviet prisoners of war, whose movement was most easily controlled by the Germans and thus easily cut off from food supplies. Jews were prohibited from purchasing eggs, butter, milk, meat or fruit. The so-called \\"rations\\" for Jews in Minsk and other cities within the control of Army Group Centre were no more than per day. Tens of thousands of Jews died of hunger and hunger-related causes over the winter of 1941–1942. Naked Soviet POWs in Mauthausen concentration camp. Unknown date The most reliable figures for the death rate among Soviet prisoners of war in German captivity reveal that 3.3 million died from a total of 5.7 million captured between June 1941 and February 1945, most directly or indirectly as a result of starvation.Christian Streit: Keine Kameraden: Die Wehrmacht und die sowjetischen Kriegsgefangenen, 1941–1945, 4th rev. ed. Dietz, Bonn 1997, pp. 128–190 and 244–253, esp. 244–246; Christian Gerlach: Kalkulierte Morde: Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland, 1941 bis 1944. Hamburger Edition, Hamburg 1999, pp. 788–855 (for Belarus). Of these 3.3 million, 2 million had already died by the beginning of February 1942.Streit: Keine Kameraden, pp. 128 and 357, note 5. The enormous number of deaths was the result of a deliberate policy of starvation directed against Soviet POWs. The German planning staffs had reckoned on capturing and thus having to feed up to two million prisoners within the first eight weeks of the war, i.e. roughly the same number as during the Battle of France in 1940.Streit: Keine Kameraden, p. 76; Alex J. Kay: \\"Ausbeutung, Umsiedlung, Massenmord. Die NS-Zukunftspläne für den Osten: Hungerplan und Generalplan Ost\\", in: Predigthilfe und Materialien für die Gemeinde, Ökumenische Friedensdekade 2012, pp. 44–50, here pp. 47-48. The number of French, Belgian and Dutch POWs who died in German captivity, was extremely low compared with the number of deaths among Soviet POWs. In spite of the exorbitantly high death rate among Soviet POWs, who constituted the main group of victims of the Hunger Plan, the plan was never fully implemented due to the failure of the German military campaign. The historian Alex J. Kay wrote, \\"what one is dealing with here is the blueprint for a programme of mass murder unprecedented in modern history\\".Alex J. Kay: \\"Germany's Staatssekretäre, Mass Starvation and the Meeting of 2 May 1941\\", in: Journal of Contemporary History, 41/4 (October 2006), p. 689. Except in isolated cases, the Germans lacked the manpower to enforce a 'food blockade' of the Soviet cities; neither could they confiscate the food the Germans were able to significantly supplement their grain stocks, particularly from the granaries in fertile Ukraine and cut off the Soviets from them, leading to significant starvation in the Soviet-held territories (most drastically in Leningrad, encircled by German forces, where about one million people died during the Siege of Leningrad).On the Leningrad blockade see Alex J. Kay: \\"Hungertod nach Plan\\". In: Der Freitag, 23 January 2009, p. 11. Germans also tried to starve Kiev and Kharkov in German-occupied Ukraine. During the German occupation, about 80,000 residents of Kharkov died of starvation. The lack of food also contributed to the starvation of slaves and concentration camp inmates in Germany.  Starvation in other German-occupied territories  The Hunger Plan directed against the population of Soviet cities and grain-deficit territories was unique—the Nazis formulated no other plan against the inhabitants of other German-occupied territories. Starvation affected other parts of German- occupied Europe, including Greece (more than 300,000 Greeks died of starvation during the Great Famine) and Poland (the General Government). Unlike in the Soviet Union, in Poland the Jewish population in ghettos (especially in the Warsaw Ghetto) suffered worst, although ethnic Poles also faced increasing levels of starvation. Raul Hilberg estimated that \\"in the whole of occupied Poland 500,000 to 600,000 Jews died in ghettos and labor camps\\", in part due to starvation. In early 1943, Hans Frank, the German governor of Poland, estimated that three million Poles would face starvation as a result of the Plan. In August, the Polish capital Warsaw was cut off from grain deliveries. Only the bumper harvest of 1943 and the collapsing Eastern Front of 1944 saved the Poles from starvation. Western Europe was third on the German list for the re-distribution of food, which was also shipped to Germany from France and other occupied territories in the West but these were never subjected to the genocidal starvation experienced in the East. As many as 22,000 people died during the Dutch famine of 1944 as a result of an embargo placed by the Germans on transporting food into the country. By mid-1941 the German minority in Poland received per day, while Poles received and Jews in the ghetto . The Jewish ration supplied a mere 7.5 percent of human daily needs; Polish rations only 26 percent. Only the rations allocated to Germans fulfilled the full needs of their daily caloric intake.{{cite web url = http://www1.yadvashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206286.pdf title=Ghetto publisher=Yad Vashem location=Jerusalem} See also * Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city * Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany * Final Solution * Late Victorian Holocausts * Lebensraum * Operation Vegetarian * War crimes of the Wehrmacht  Notes  References * Wigbert Benz: Der Hungerplan im \\"Unternehmen Barbarossa\\" 1941.

From launch until a major refit in 2003, she was named MV Woodchurch. MV Woodchurch The Woodchurch was the sister ship of the MV Mountwood. Both ferries were built for Birkenhead Corporation and were based loosely on the designs of the Wallasey ferries Leasowe and Egremont. They were built by the same company, Messrs. Philip & Son Ltd. of Dartmouth and designed by naval architects Graham and Woolnough. There was some local surprise when the contract was awarded to Philip & Son because Cammell Laird Shipbuilders were \\"next door\\" to the Birkenhead Ferry Terminal and it was thought that Lairds would automatically build the new ferry boats. However, their price was not considered competitive. Named after an overspill post-war housing development of Birkenhead, the Woodchurch was the second of the new Birkenhead diesel ferries. Launched by Gwendoline M. McRonald, wife of the Birkenhead Transport Committee Chairman, Charles S. McRonald M.B.E., her hull left the Noss slipway at 3:45 pm and into the River Dart on Thursday 29 October 1959. Other Birkonian dignitaries attending the launch were Mrs Louisa Baker, Mayor of Birkenhead and Alderman Hugh Platt, Leader of the Council and the Mayor of Dartmouth was present. In the evening there was a formal dinner at the Grand Hotel, Torquay. After fitting out and sea trials, the ferry was delivered to the Mersey in 1960. The Woodchurch was a popular ship. She was externally and internally identical to the Mountwood. The vessel was , with a beam of , gross tonnage of 464 and a passenger capacity of 1,200 passengers. She was given Birkenhead Corporation's orange and black livery. The Woodchurch was powered by two medium speed Crossley diesel engines, which were fitted with air brakes for rapid speed change and could be controlled directly from the bridge via the three pairs of connected Chadburn Synchrostep engine order telegraphs. The Woodchurch remained in near constant operation up until 1980 when she was withdrawn from service and laid up in Morpeth Dock for reasons of economy. Up until this period there had been minimal maintenance work carried out on the vessel and at one point she even lost the forward port side rubbing strake. She was put up for sale, but no buyer was found. During this time she was cannibalised for parts to keep the other ferries running. By 1983, the ferry was re-painted and overhauled and returned to passenger service. Alongside her sister, the vessel was withdrawn from service for extensive refurbishment in 1989. The six-month absence from the river was the result of a major rebuild and life extension programme. During this, her bridge wings and wheelhouses were plated over to form one single bridge. Curiously she retained all her original navigation equipment. She returned to service in July 1990. MV Snowdrop The Woodchurch was again withdrawn in 2003. The ferry's superstructure was totally removed and replaced. New engines and electrical equipment were installed. The original funnel of Woodchurch was found to be suffering from rust upon removal, so a new funnel was installed on the vessel She was relaunched in 2004. A few months later it was revealed that she would be renamed Snowdrop, alongside the Royal Iris of the Mersey and Royal Daffodil. This renewed a 125-year-old link with the past, with all Mersey ferries now carrying traditional Wallasey \\"flower\\" names. The ferry’s redesign was not as well received as her two sisters. There appears to be stark contrast between the ships original fine lines and the harsh welding of the Mersey Heritage Ship Repair contractors. The ferry has a large square and box like wheelhouse which does not follow the contours of the ship. In December 2007, the Snowdrop featured in the Liverpool Nativity, which was broadcast live on BBC Three and repeated on BBC One. Gerry Marsden also made a cameo appearance as the ferry's captain. The ferry is the regular boat used on the Manchester Ship Canal cruises, held over most weekends during the summer months. MV Snowdrop in dazzle livery, in May 2015, departing from Seacombe In January 2015, the ferry was selected as a \\"dazzle ship\\"; she was given a unique new livery inspired by the First World War dazzle camouflage. Designed by Sir Peter Blake and entitled Everybody Razzle Dazzle, the livery was commissioned by Liverpool Biennial, 14-18 NOW and Tate Liverpool. Snowdrop is one of three vessels commissioned to carry a dazzle livery, the others being Induction Chromatique à Double Fréquence pour l’Edmund Gardner Ship / Liverpool. Paris, 2014 by Carlos Cruz-Diez on the museum ship Edmund Gardner located in the Canning graving dock adjacent to the Pier Head in Liverpool, and Tobias Rehberger’s Dazzle Ship London on HMS President in the River Thames. Snowdrop is the only one of these three vessels to be a working vessel.

Plot The story opens in the late summer of 1955. Nineteen-year-old Harry Preston, having been granted an early discharge from national service with the RAF, moves to London from a small English provincial town to find life and adventure. Fancying himself as a writer, he drifts towards the central district of Soho, and soon enough he is included in the destitute but creative environment of the new Beat Generation. Harry meets an out of work actor, James Street. Street introduces Harry to the bohemian way of life and the novel recounts their misadventures. Harry travels upwards through this new world of wannabe artists, poets and writers, that have set up camp in the bohemian and not so posh 50s Soho and Notting Hill, he begins to slowly understand his role in this world.

This enzyme belongs to the family of iron(II)-dependent oxygenases, which typically incorporate one atom of dioxygen into the substrate and one atom into the succinate carboxylate group. The mechanism is complex, but is believed to involve ordered binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the iron(II) containing enzyme followed by substrate. Binding of substrate causes displacement of a water molecule from the iron(II) cofactor, leaving a vacant coordination position to which dioxygen binds. A rearrangement occurs to form a high energy iron-oxygen species (which is generally thought to be an iron(IV)=O species) that performs the actual oxidation reaction. Nomenclature The systematic name of this enzyme class is phytanoyl-CoA, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase and phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase. Examples In humans, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is encoded by the PHYH (aka PAHX) gene and is required for the alpha-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids (e.g. phytanic acid) in peroxisomes. PHYH deficiency results in the accumulation of large tissue stores of phytanic acid and is the major cause of Refsum disease. Related enzymes Iron(II) and 2OG-dependent oxygenases are common in microorganisms, plants, and animals; the human genome is predicted to contain about 80 examples, and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana likely contains more. In plants and microorganisms this enzyme family is associated with a large diversity of oxidative reactions.

Purísima Concepción His recorded paternal baptismal surname was Corrales, however the surname Corral is commonly used. Image of Ramon Corral's baptism registration from 21 January 1854 Ramón Corral first gained public attention in 1872, when General Don Ignacio L. Pesqueira, Governor of the State of Sonora, an undefeated general who had provided many services to his state, created public outrage when he introduced state constitutional reforms. To avoid compliance with a law, Pesqueira introduced, among other reforms, a ban on re-election governor. The young Corral vigorously fought against the Pesqueira administration through the press, founding the newspapers El Fantasma (\\"The Phantom\\"), and La Voz de Álamos (\\"The Voice of Álamos\\"). His writings in the papers exhibited civil valor, love for democracy, and power as a political adversary of the Pesqueira administration. In the years that followed, Corral increasingly became involved in politics. While General Secretary of the Government of Sonora, Corral was involved with the capture of the indigenous Yaqui military leader José Maria Leiva, known as Cajemé. In La Constitución (Periódico oficial del gobierno del estado libre y soberano de Sonora), beginning with the issue of April 22, 1887, and ending July 8, 1887, Corral published biographical notes about Cajemé, which were recorded only a few days earlier during personal talks with the captured Yaqui. Cajemé was being held at the time in the house of the military chief of the area, Angel Martínez, who had personally arrested him while Cajemé was hiding in San Jose de Guaymas. Corral married Amparo V. Escalante on February 25, 1888. She was the daughter of Vicente Escalante, a well-known Mexican statesman of the time. The religious element of the twofold marriage ceremony was performed by Father Ortega of Hermosillo, with a civil ceremony performed by Civil Judge Bonito Méndez, of the Hermosillo District.A Wedding in Mexico.

Later life Ramón Corral and his family. Corral traveled with his family to Paris for medical care, where he was diagnosed with cancer. After his operation, the cancer was found to be incurable. In light of his own deteriorating health and the increasing revolutionary opposition to the Díaz government, Corral submitted his resignation, dated May 10, 1911, to Francisco León de la Barra, Díaz’s foreign secretary, which de la Barra held until Díaz submitted his own \\"Renuncia\\" on May 25, 1911.O'Shaughnessy, Edith. (1920). Intimate pages of Mexican history. pp.101-102. =Letter of Resignation= Corral's letter of resignation gave no doubt that he had foreknowledge of Díaz's intention to resign, and that the course of events would lead to a new government for Mexico: On the two occasions that the national convention advanced my candidacy as Vice-President of the republic, to figure in the elections with Gen. Diaz as President, I stated that I was prepared to occupy any office in which compatriots considered that I would be of use, and that if the public vote conferred upon me a position so far above my merits, then my intention would be to second in all respects Gen. Diaz's policy, in order to co-operate with him, as far as it lay in my power, toward the aggrandizement of the nation, which had developed so notably under his administration. Those who concern themselves with public affairs and have observed their progress during the last few years will be able to say whether I have complied with my intention. For my part, I can say that I have never endeavored to bring about the least obstacle either in the President's policy or his manner of carrying it out even at the cost of sacrificing my convictions, both because this was the basis of my programme and because this corresponded to my position and my loyalty, as well as that I did not seek any prestige in the office of Vice-President, so useful in the United States and so discredited in Latin countries. In the events which have shaken the country during these latter months, the President has been brought to consider that it is patriotic to resign from the high office that the almost unanimous vote of Mexicans had conferred upon him in the last election, and that it is advisable at the same time, in the interest of the country, that the Vice-President do likewise, so that new men and new energies should continue forwarding the prosperity of the nation. Following my program of seconding Gen. Diaz's policy, I join my resignation with his and in the present note I retire from the office of Vice-President of the republic, begging the chamber to accept the same at the same time as that of the President. I beg of you gentlemen to inform yourselves of the above, which I submit with the protests of my highest consideration. Liberty and Constitution, Paris, May 4, 1911.

These enzymes catalyze the incorporation of oxygen into organic substrates through a mechanism that requires alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, Fe2+, and ascorbate. This particular enzyme catalyzes the formation of (2S, 4R)-4-hydroxyproline, a compound that represents the most prevalent post- translational modification in the human proteome.  Enzyme mechanism  Procollagen-proline dioxygenase catalyzes the following reaction: L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 → (2S, 4R)-4-hydroxyproline + succinate + CO2 The mechanism for the reaction is similar to that of other dioxygenases, and occurs in two distinct stages: In the first, a highly reactive Fe(IV)=O species is produced. Molecular oxygen is bound end-on in an axial position, producing a dioxygen unit. Nucleophilic attack on C2 generates a tetrahedral intermediate, with loss of the double bond in the dioxygen unit and bonds to iron and the alpha carbon of 2-oxoglutarate. Subsequent elimination of CO2 coincides with the formation of the Fe(IV)=O species. The second stage involves the abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen atom from C-4 of the proline substrate followed by radical combination, which yields hydroxyproline. As a consequence of the reaction mechanism, one molecule of 2-oxoglutarate is decarboxylated, forming succinate. This succinate is hydrolyzed and replaced with another 2-oxoglutarate after each reaction, and it has been concluded that in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate, enzyme-bound Fe2+ is rapidly converted to Fe3+, leading to inactivation of the enzyme. Ascorbate is utilized as a cofactor to reduce Fe3+ back to Fe2+.  Enzyme structure  A closer view of the substrate binding domain of prolyl hydroxylase. Tyrosine residues, which form the binding groove, are displayed in yellow. Prolyl hydroxylase is a tetramer with 2 unique subunits. The α subunit is 59 kDa and is responsible for both peptide binding and for catalytic activity. The peptide binding domain spans residues 140-215 of the α subunit, and consists of a concave surface lined with multiple tyrosine residues which interact favorably with the proline-rich substrate. The active site consists of Fe2+ bound to two histidine residues and one aspartate residue, a characteristic shared by most 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The 55 kDa β subunit is responsible for the enzyme’s localization to and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. This subunit is identical to the enzyme known as protein disulfide isomerase.  Biological function  Prolyl hydroxylase catalyzes the formation of hydroxyproline, which is the most abundant post-translational modification in human body. The modification has a significant impact on the stability of collagen, the major connective tissue of the human body. Specifically, hydroxylation increases the melting temperature (Tm) of helical collagen by 16 °C, as compared to unhydroxylated collagen, a difference that allows the protein to be stable at body temperature. The enzyme acts specifically on proline contained within the X-Pro-Gly motif – where Pro is proline. Because of this motif-specific behavior, the enzyme also acts on other proteins that contain this same sequence. Such proteins include C1q, elastins, PrP, Argonaute 2, and conotoxins, among others.  Disease relevance  As prolyl hydroxylase requires ascorbate as a cofactor to function, its absence compromises the enzyme’s activity. The resulting decreased hydroxylation leads to the disease condition known as scurvy. Since stability of collagen is compromised in scurvy patients, symptoms include weakening of blood vessels causing purpura, petechiae, and gingival bleeding. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that allows the cell to respond physiologically to decreases in oxygen. A class of prolyl hydroxylases which act specifically on HIF has been identified; hydroxylation of HIF allows the protein to be targeted for degradation. HIF prolyl- hydroxylase has been targeted by a variety of inhibitors that aim to treat stroke, kidney disease, ischemia, anemia, and other important diseases.

According to its official website, CFFN is an organization of the Nepalese Diaspora and Friends of Nepal aspiring to see a peaceful, democratic, just, and prosperous Nepal. Established in January 2006 at Ottawa, Canada, it was a culmination of efforts by those individuals who were weighing on various alternatives to help the people of Nepal. The CFFN states to have simple objectives: raising awareness about Nepal in Canada; incubating research in Canada on solutions to Nepal's economic, social, and political issues; promoting cooperation between the grassroots people of Canada and Nepal for promoting collaborative development and international peace. Activities Since its inception CFFN has made significant amount of contribution towards the movement for peace, justice, and democracy in Nepal. In January 2006, CFFN initiated organized activities in support of the democratic movement of Nepal. Since then, some of the accomplishments of the organization are: submission of human rights complaints in the UN; petition campaign for peace and democracy and its submission to the UN and the Government of Canada; panel discussions with Nepal experts and Hon. Flora MacDonald – former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Besides, CFFN also raised fund for the victims during the popular uprising of 2006, provided radio interviews, organized a number of interaction programs and deliberated in conferences on contemporary issues of Nepal, and also brought academic thoughts on issues of Nepal through its newsletter \\"Concern Nepal\\" and other publications. After the Janaandolan II of April 2006, the organization shifted its focus more on research, knowledge, education of children, and raising awareness about Nepal in Canada. It organized \\"Himalayan Heartbeat\\" with renowned mountaineer Andrew Brash as a keynote speaker in 2006. And it organized the second annual Himalayan Heartbeat program with some of the most prominent living personalities in Nepal. Hon. Marion Dewar, the former Mayor of Ottawa, was the chief guest. CFFN is organized a series of interaction programs throughout 2006 and 2007. The first prominent program was held in February 2006 with a panel of Nepal experts and Hon. Flora MacDonald, the former Foreign Minister of Canada. The latest and largest conference organized by CFFN was academic conference titled \\"Unfolding Futures: Nepalese Economy, Society and Politics\\" on 5–7 October 2007 in Ottawa, Canada. This conference was addressed by Dr. Ronald Watts, a notable authority on federalism and the former Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University. The CFFN promotes critical thinking and scholarly exchanges between Canada and Nepal. In particular, the organization likes to position itself as a bridge between the Canadian public who are concerned about global issues and the most disadvantaged children, women and men of Nepal who are deprived of basic education, knowledge, and capacity required for overcoming poverty and for inculcating innovation and progress. This stance comes from a conviction that knowledge and education is the most profound requirement for building a just and prosperous Nepal. CFFN provides individuals of all ages, talents and abilities the opportunities to contribute in worthy endeavors that benefit both Nepal and Canada. Its programs stem from an awareness towards the needs of individuals, families, nations, and the world as a whole.

Rather, it was a private operation owned by Ronald Pellar, a professional hypnotist also known as Ronald Dante who performed on stage under the name Dr. Dante, and who had for a brief time in the late 1960s and early '70s been married to the well-known actress Lana Turner. In U.S. Senate hearings in 2004, a former employee testified that Columbia State had \\"no faculty, [...] no curriculum, no classes, no courses, no tests, no one to grade tests, no educational facilities, no library and no academic accreditation.\\" However, she testified that the school's promotional materials claimed that it was accredited, displaying a fake accreditation certificate in the university catalog. Also, the school logo and stationery falsely stated that Columbia State had been established in 1953. The stationery also listed a ten-member \\"Board of Advisors\\" that consisted of made-up names and titles. In her testimony, the former employee estimated that the operation had gross income of about $20 million between 1996 and 1998. However further investigation revealed that Columbia State University was licensed to operate by the State of Louisiana. Textbooks and course work were originally provided to students, many of whom completed the work and received degrees with the promise the school would soon achieve accreditation. One Florida law enforcement officer accomplished a complete course in Public Administration only to learn after receiving his degree the school would never be accredited. The State of Louisiana provided the Florida officer records of the school's license to operate in a settlement. Columbia State offered bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in a variety of fields. Its marketing targeted people who had not finished college or graduate school, advertising that they could qualify for a degree from Columbia State University in as little as 27 days based on their life, work, and academic experience. According to Senate testimony, at one time Columbia State's letterhead stationery listed Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, as a recipient of an honorary Ph.D. degree from Columbia State, but Dr. Salk's name was removed after he protested to Ron Pellar. In 1997 Pellar was convicted of criminal contempt for violating an earlier injunction against making false representations, issued in connection with a \\"permanent makeup\\" business and a paralegal training academy, and in 1998 he was sentenced to 67 months in prison for the contempt conviction.

Geology of Colombia refers to the geological composition of the Republic of Colombia that determines its geography. Most of the emerged territory of Colombia covers vast areas within the South American plate, whereas much submerged territory lies within the Caribbean plate and the Nazca plate. Geologic history As in the rest of South America, a combination of external and internal tectonic, volcanic, and glacial forces over the eons formed Colombia's present-day geology.Bushnell, David and Rex A. Hudson. \\"Geology\\". In Colombia: A Country Study (Rex A. Hudson, ed.), pp. 70-71. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (2010). Island-like outcrops of metamorphic rocks in the eastern Llanos are visible remnants of Precambrian times. During the 289-million-year-long Paleozoic Era, which began 541 million years ago, the ocean invaded the area which is exposed in Colombia's Andean zone, as subterranean volcanic eruptions in the western part of the country spouted lava. In the Triassic Period of the 186-million-year- long Mesozoic Era, which began 252 million years ago, the sea that occupied the Andean zone separated into two parts after the Cordillera Central rose. Large layers of sedimentary rock were deposited during the Jurassic Period, which ended with great igneous activity. During the Cretaceous Period, the sea to the east of the Cordillera Central extended to Putumayo region in the south, while subterranean volcanic activity continued to the west of the Cordillera Central. During the Cenozoic Era, which began about 66 million years ago, the seas withdrew from most of Colombia's territory, and enormous granite masses formed along the Cordillera Occidental. The three cordilleras began to take shape 12 million years ago. The Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Central form the western and eastern sides of a massive crystalline arch, which extends from the Caribbean lowlands to the southern border of Ecuador. The Cordillera Oriental, however, is composed of folded stratified rocks overlying a crystalline core. Seismic activity Tectonic movement of the cordilleras continues today, as evidenced by frequent seismic activity. Indeed, Colombia remains part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an active seismic area that surrounds the Pacific basin. The country is located where three lithospheric plates—Nazca, Caribbean, and South American—converge, and their movement produces different types of geologic faults. Almost all of the country's many earthquakes in recent centuries have occurred in the mountainous and coastal regions. Recent major earthquakes include those in Popayán on March 31, 1983, and in the nation's coffee-growing belt on January 25, 1999; and one on March 6, 1987, on the border with Ecuador, measuring 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. Recent earthquakes that struck Colombia's Pacific coast areas have included one accompanied by a tsunami in Tumaco, Nariño Department, on December 12, 1979, measuring 7.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, the largest in northwestern South America since 1942; another on November 15, 2004, with a magnitude of 6.7; and one on September 10, 2007, measuring 6.8. Although construction standards are high for new buildings in the main cities, smaller cities and rural zones are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Emerged and submerged zones Colombia is formed by two great territorial zones, one submerged in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean sea covering a total area of 828,660 km² and the second is the emerged land which is formed by the Andes mountain range and the Llanos plains that are shared with Venezuela and cover an area of some 1'143,748 km². =Emerged zone= In the emerged zone the region is washed by numerous rivers that include the Meta, Vichada and the Inirida rivers which contribute to other major rivers like the Orinoco River, Vaupés River, Caquetá River, Putumayo River and Apaporis River. This Llanos region is also divided into three subregions; Northern plains The northern area characterized by its wavy plains similar to a savanna and located between the Andes mountain range and the Guiana Shield formed during the Tertiary mostly covered with sand and clay, while the rivers contributed with sedimentary elements from the Andes during the Quaternary. Macarena Mountains area The second region is located in the central area of the Llanos with a more wavy topography and formations elevated like the Alto del Vaupés or the Serranía de la Macarena mountain range, isolated in the middle of the plains and towards the Guyana Shield. Southern area The southern area is made up by most of the Putumayo and Amazon River basins, while the topography is flatter than the other two regions, this area is covered by dense jungle and makes up most of the Amazon Region of Colombia. =The Andean region= The Andean Region of Colombia is the other emerged area of the two areas that compose the geology of Colombia. This area originated after a complex geological development that started in the Paleozoic era when the Nazca plate collapsed with the South American plate pushing it under the Caribbean plate that created volcanic islands off the Pacific coast off Colombia and the isthmus of Panama. The Colombian Massif, near the border with Ecuador formed and split into three mountain ranges: Cordillera Central (central mountain range), Cordillera Oriental (Eastern mountain range) and the Cordillera Occidental (Western mountain range), each product of three different formation processes and divided from one another by valleys. The Cordillera Oriental was the most recently formed mountain range of the three, developing by the end of the Tertiary period and consisting mostly of sedimentary elements. The formation of the Cordillera Oriental covered the continental platform with pelagic sediments with Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks bases. The area of the Bogotá Savanna and the highland of Cundinamarca and Boyacá tableland. To the northeast the volcanic metamorphic formed massif in Santander and Norte de Santander formed the Andes in Venezuela and the mountain ranges of Perijá and Motilones, between the border of Colombia and Venezuela during the Pleistocene and added sedimentary rocks during the Mesozoic. The Cordillera Central formed from the Guyana shield during the Paleozoic era with intrusions from granite and metamorphism. To the west presents basic volcanic rocks from the end of the Cretaceous period and diorite intrusive rocks from the Tertiary. To the west there are metamorphic Paleozoic rocks and two major massifs in Ibagué and the Serranía de San Lucas. Another important formation is the Baudó Mountains to the west of the country.

The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert. Gameplay These performers are out trying to get gigs (singing jobs) at the local venues. Appeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues. In the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert. Element of luck When the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects. The dice combination \\"A-1\\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \\"F-5\\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.

It is associated with the development of through-flowing drainage within the Red Deer River basin in particular, and the South Saskatchewan drainage network in general. Approximately 7,500 square kilometers of the Bassano basin is covered with lacustrine sediments. These sediments are bordered by the topographically higher Buffalo Lake Moraine to the west, the Suffield Moraine to the east and the Lethbridge Moraine to the south. The transmission of water through the basin was ultimately controlled by the regional topography and the position of the ice front. As the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, lower outlet channels were exposed. The lake levels at any given time were constrained by the elevation of the lowest drainage channel. As Glacial Lake Bassano, and the proglacial lake system as a whole developed, throughflow in individual channels waxed, waned and reversed, depending on the systemic controls. Proglacial Lake System The retreat of the late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet in Alberta was accompanied by the deposition of extensive areas of proglacial lake sediments associated with ice frontal positions.(St. Onge 1972; Quigley 1980; Shetsen 1987; Vreeken 1989) These lakes formed as a result of impoundment of the re-established proglacial drainage system and glacial meltwater. Quigley (1980) estimates that roughly 50% of Alberta was occupied by these short-lived lakes. The mapping of sediments deposited by lacustrine and related glacial processes allows the determination of ice-frontal positions at sequential recessional phases. St. Onge (1972), for example, constructed a detailed and comprehensive series of glacial-marginal positions for north-central Alberta. There are, however, a wide variety of chronological interpretations and problems related to the proposed ice-marginal positions in Southern Alberta.(Christiansen 1979; Clayton and Moran 1982; Shetsen 1984; Dyke and Prest 1987; Teller 1987; Teller and Moran 1980; Klassen 1994) Work on individual glacial lakes in Southern Alberta (Horberg 1954; Stalker 1973; Vreeken 1989) has not produced a definitive synthesis of the deglacial landscape. Early work was hampered by a lack of precise elevational control; later work has suffered from a paucity of chronological control and the lack of any detailed study of the integrated relationships between the proglacial lakes in southern Alberta. By topographic analysis, it is possible to accurately determine the sequence of formation and drainage, as well as the maximum and minimum elevations of the proglacial lakes In southern Alberta, the network of proglacial lakes lowered, with recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, from the 1100m maximum elevation of Glacial Lake McLeod to the final 680m elevation of Glacial Lake Empress. The confluence of flow through Glacial Lakes Drumheller, Gleichen and Lethbridge utilized Etzikom Coulee to enter the Missouri Drainage System. When Etzikom Coulee was abandoned at 915m (the height of the Lethbridge Moraine Divide) discharge from the lakes was entirely within Alberta. Glacial Lake Drumheller abandoned the Strathmore Channel at 945m, whereupon discharge was directed through the smaller Crowfoot channel until 915m. At this elevation, flow must have been diverted further to the east, over the Bassano basin. Glacial Lake Gleichen abandoned the southward- flowing McGregor Lake Channel at 860m and discharged eastward into Glacial Lake Bassano until channelization occurred at 850m. With recession of the ice, Glacial Lake Lethbridge lowered and extended eastward, forming Glacial Lake Taber, whose upper level was controlled by Chin Coulee (915m). Subsequent drainage flowed through Forty Mile Coulee until 792m and along the valley of the South Saskatchewan, which became channelized at 760m. Glacial Lake Medicine Hat formed at roughly 760m and ponding at that location was associated with the formation of Glacial Lake Empress to the north at roughly the same elevation. Glacial Lake Bassano existed from a maximum elevation of 915m until final drainage at690-700m. Its initiation coincides with the abandonment of southward-flowing drainage into the Missouri System and the beginning of drainage within Alberta. Together with Glacial Lake Tilley to the south, Glacial Lake Bassano received the discharge from over 1000 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and associated proglacial lakes.

Bob Hastings was the host for the first few weeks; afterwards, Jack Clark, who was better known at the time as an announcer for other game shows, took over as the host. Hastings and Clark, who wore tuxedoes as hosts of Dealer's Choice, were assisted by hostess Jane Nelson and by announcer Jim Thompson. The show was taped at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, but later moved to Los Angeles after its first season. Local stations normally aired the program in daytime slots which the networks did not feed; relatively few aired the show during the coveted Prime Time Access early evening slots before network prime time programming. As such, Dealer's Choice was not among the most popular off-network games of its time due to comparatively low audiences, but managed to survive over parts of three seasons nonetheless. The very next Monday after the show was removed from circulation, Clark moved over to a new game, The Cross-Wits, also a syndicated entry (but from a different packager).  Dealer's Choice game-play  = The main competition = Three contestants, chosen from the studio audience, competed in games of chance, all related to gambling. Three audience members' names were each hidden behind one of nine slot machine symbols on a gameboard. An audience member was selected and chose four symbols from the board. For each symbol that hid a contestant's name, the audience member received $25. If the audience member uncovered all three contestants' names, then the audience member won a bonus prize. After being seated behind one of three podiums onstage, each contestant was given 100 chips to wager in various casino-type games. Multiple games used playing cards, including \\"Blackjack,\\" \\"Any Pair Loses,\\" \\"In-Between,\\" etc. Other games included using a \\"Wheel of Chance\\" or a hopper filled with colored ping-pong balls. In some games contestants made a single bet which was then paid out at specific odds or subtracted from the contestant's chips depending upon the outcome of the game. Other games featured a compounded betting format in which the contestants made an initial bet, and the payout was doubled or tripled multiple times as the game progressed. The first three games featured limits for the number of chips allowed to be wagered. The first game usually featured a five- or ten-chip limit, and the second had a 25-chip maximum. Blackjack was always featured as the third game and had a 50-chip maximum. The third game also featured an audience member acting as the \\"house.\\" The audience member won $1 for each chip lost to the house in the game, and also won a bonus prize if the house's hand beat all three contestants's hands. The fourth game featured no limit on betting, and each contestant's wager was made in secret at the start of the game. After the fourth game, contestants chose one of three prizes from three different categories (1−100 chips, 101−300 chips, and 301-500 chips) based upon the final number of chips they held. If two or more contestants finished in the same level, the contestant finishing with the higher total received first choice of the prizes. In later episodes, a contestant who finished with more than 500 chips won a car. Additionally, the person with the highest chip total overall played a bonus game for an additional prize. = The Bonus Dice = The winning player rolled special \\"Bonus Dice,\\" whose faces represented sums of money from $50–$200. But one face on one Bonus Die had a spade on it, and if the contestant rolled the spade all bonus round winnings were lost and the game was over. The contestant continued to roll until he or she rolled the spade, quit with the money he or she had already won, or reached $1,000. In the last of those three possible cases, the contestants also won bonus prizes such as a car or trip.

The name Place Your Bets! was used instead of Dealer's Choice because Parker Brothers manufactured an unrelated board game on the market under the Dealer's Choice name, which was first launched in 1972.Board Game Geek: \\"Dealer's Choice\\" (Parker Brothers game) Episode status One episode of Dealer's Choice with Hastings and two with Clark are known to exist. The series' existence has not been confirmed. The possibility remains that most episodes were lost because of the wiping of videotapes. This remained a common practice as late as 1976, long after the invention of the videocassette, especially in syndication companies as opposed to networks; the fact that syndication practice at the time required tapes to be physically distributed to stations would suggest that episodes may have survived, but that they are not centralized in any archive.

It was authorised by an act of parliament in 2002, construction started in September 2002 and the port became operational in October 2009 when the MSC Catania docked at the port.  Overview  The Port of Ngqura is South Africa's newest port and the deepest container port in the country. It has an entrance channel -18 m Port Chart Datum in depth, a turning basin of 600 m in diameter and also at -18 m Port Chart Datum, 1 general cargo berth at -18 m Port Chart Datum, and 4 container berth and 2 general cargo berth at -16 m Port Chart Datum. The Port Chart Datum at the Port of Ngqura is 1.026 m below the South African Mean Sea Level. The biggest container vessels to have been handled at the port are MSC's 12,500 TEU vessels. The Port of Ngqura complements the existing ports of South Africa (mainly the twin sister port, Port of Port Elizabeth) and the deepwater ports in Richards Bay and Saldanha. The first phase construction of the Port of Ngqura Greenfields project commenced in September 2002. The MSC Catania, was the first commercial vessel to berth at the port. It off-loaded 275 containers on 4 October 2009. The Port of Ngqura forms part of the Coega Industrial Development Zone, but falls under the jurisdiction of the Transnet National Ports Authority. The main intended function of the Port of Ngqura is to service the industrial bulk commodity requirements of the regional and national hinterland. The port was also planned to serve as a container terminal that would relieve congestion in other ports and to serve as a transhipment hub serving primarily the African East and West coast traffic and also inter-line traffic from South America to Asia. The Port of Ngqura is a deepwater port and the medium to long term expectations are that: * The port would attract new transhipment volumes under the container hub principle as well as handle an increasing number of Gauteng containers. * The port will serve as a bulk port to handle commodities such as manganese, chemicals, oil and refined hydrocarbons. * Coega Industrial Development Zone generated cargoes be handled through the port (none of these potential cargoes have been finalized). The Port of Ngqura is the only port in South Africa that has an environmental authorization (Record of Decision or RoD) for its construction and operation.  Environmental considerations  Two of the physical characteristics that had the most significant influence on the lay-out of the port, were the paleo-channel that runs through the site and Jahleel Island that is situated 1 km off-shore. The paleo channel provided an opportunity to establish a deepwater port without the need to dredge large quantities of consolidated material. This dramatically reduced capital costs associated with dredging. The bay's birdlife, which includes a significant African penguin population was deemed to be environmentally sensitive, so construction was forbidden within 500 m of the island. The main breakwater was designed and constructed to meet the requirements of the Jahleel Island exclusion zone. = Sand bypass system = One of the coastal processes considered relevant during the design of the port was sediment transport. Littoral transport is maintained by a fixed embedded jet pump sand bypass that was a world-first. It mimics the natural long shore drift of sand along the coast of South Africa. This is achieved by pumping the sand from the updrift (west) section of the coast to the downdrift (east) section of the coast. Sand is captured in a sand trap and the sand is pumped via pipelines to a discharge point on the opposite end of the port. Both capturing and discharge occurs in the wave zones. The system serves to prevent accretion and erosion on the western and eastern sides respectively.  eMendi Admin Building  A new port administration building was launched by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) at the port on 23 June 2017. The five-storey, 10 000 m2 building was named eMendi in reference to the SS Mendi troop ship that sunk in the English Channel a hundred years before in 1917, carrying over 800 servicemen, the majority of whom were black South Africans. The name was unveiled by TNPA Chief Executive Richard Vallihu, Chief Operating Officer Phyllis Difeto and Ngqura Port Manager Tandi Lebakeng at an event attended by port employees. The building is a 4-star green rated building, incorporating into its design rainwater harvesting, solar panels and light motion sensors in certain areas. The building’s large window areas allow it to take advantage of the port’s panoramic views and natural lighting flowing into the building, thereby reducing the need for electrical lighting. It represents an investment of R255 million into the economy of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. A lime kiln, dating back some 65 years is located outside the port side of the atrium and was declared a heritage site and protected against damage during construction. The building has a capacity for 205 staff, and is divided into east and west wings, separated by an atrium which extends the full height of the building and is serviced by two circular scenic lifts. A porte-cochère at the entrance welcomes both staff and visitors. In addition to offices, other facilities include a gymnasium, canteen, boardrooms, training rooms, a Port Operations Centre and staff rest areas. The building includes a basement comprising parking bays as well as storage and plant rooms. There is also an open parking area outside.  Construction  New technological advancements in port building were made during the building of the quays (built in the dry), the building of the breakwaters, the use of 30 ton dolosse, and the implementation of the sand bypass system (one of only 3 in the world and unique in itself). = Breakwaters = The port is protected by two breakwaters. The western breakwater is 1.3 km in length and the eastern breakwater is 2.7 km in length. The breakwaters are rubble mound constructions with dolosse serving as armour protection. The main (eastern) breakwater is the longest in South Africa. The breakwaters and dolosse were constructed and placed from September 2002 to February 2006. The crest of the breakwaters at the Port of Ngqura has been formed by 26,500 30-ton dolosse. The dolosse used at the Port of Ngqura weighed 30 tonnes each and they were the largest in the world at their time of construction. They were designed and developed in-house by Transnet National Ports Authority. Approximately 26,500 units were placed- each one 13 m3 in volume. These structures combined used approximately 344,500 m3 of concrete (or 826,800 tons). A crane driver using a global positioning system (GPS) fitted to the end of his crane ensured that each of the two- storey tall structures was precisely placed to meet to the calculated coordinates of the model studies. The dolosse protect the breakwaters by dissipating rather than blocking the energy of incoming waves. Most of the wave action energy is deflected to the side by their angular design. Over time the structures settle and lock into place as the waves subtly shift them. Together, they form an interlocking yet porous wall that grows stronger with time. A double layer of 30 ton dolosse units was placed along the exposed side of the breakwaters and a single layer was placed along the leeward side of the main breakwater. The construction of the eastern breakwater water was a 24-hour operation with rock being tipped at a peak-time rate of a 40-ton truckload every three minutes. 800 ton crawler cranes mounted on portal crawlers were used to place the dolosse on the rubble mound breakwaters. The portal crawlers were constructed high enough to allow the haul trucks access to the construction face where back tipping and skip placement of rock was carried out on a 24-hour cycle. Rail links Transnet is upgrading a rail corridor which will connect Ngqura with manganese mines around Hotazel in the Northern Cape. The corridor would be 1,003 km long, and would mostly involve upgrades of existing rail lines; capacity is expected to increase from 5·5 million tonnes / year to 16 mpta.

A former academic, he was also a member of the Turkish parliament from 1987 to 1991. Early years Arif Sağ was born to a miller at Dallı village of Aşkale district in Erzurum Province, eastern Turkey. At the age of five, he learned to play the kaval, a simple traditional flute. One year later, he became interested in phonographs and phonograph records. He learned to play the bağlama in Erzincan when he was six years old. Until he was fourteen, he learned the ashik tradition, and started to sing folk poems. He then moved to Istanbul and took lessons from folk music artist Nida Tüfekçi at Aksaray Music Association. He was able to successfully build his musical understructure. He is friend with Iranian musician Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir. Music career The 1960s and 1970 were for Sağ the years of style searching. During this period, he focused on commercial and official musical application rather than on music for social movements. He continued with commercial music activities as a bağlama artist at TRT Radio Istanbul, where he began working in the late 1960s. Sağ accompanied diverse artists and also sang his own compositions with other artists during this time. He recorded music he played and sang. The genre of his music is classified in the music terminology today as Arabesque-Phantasy music, which contained folk- music motifs. This indicates that Sağ could not break off with folk music. Sağ recorded a number of cassette tapes with other musicians in addition to more than ten solo recordings. The serial album titled Muhabbet (\\"Small talk\\"), which he recorded with Musa Eroğlu, Muhlis Akarsu, and later Yavuz Top, helped introduce Turkish folk music to broad masses after 1980. Sağ survived the 1993 Sivas massacre, in which 37 were killed and 51 injured. He had gone to the city to attend a conference of left-wing Turkish intellectuals. With the support of Roman Herzog, then President of Germany, Sağ gave a concert together with Erdal Erzincan and Erol Parlak, accompanied by the Cologne symphony orchestra, at the Kölner Philharmonie on 5 May 1996. This performance played an important role in introducing Anatolian music by bağlama to the West. Between 21 January and 5 February 2000, Sağ went on a concert tour in twelve European cities with the Spanish roma flamenco guitarist Tomatito. Academic career In 1976, Sağ was appointed instructor at the newly- established State Conservatory for Turkish Music at Istanbul Technical University. He left this position in 1982 to devote himself to private activities. He co-authored the textbook Bağlama Metodu (\\"Method of Bağlama\\") together with Erdal Erzincan. Political career Sağ entered politics in the 1985-founded Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), and became a Deputy of Ankara Province in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey following the 1987 general election. He served as the first Turkish artist in parliament until 1991. Together with some parliament members of the SHP, he was a founder of the pro-Kurdish political party People's Labor Party (HEP) in June 1990. The party was banned in July 1993. Sağ, himself an Alevi, was harshly criticized by Alevi organizations for his participation in a workshop addressing political solutions for Alawites issues and for democracy, which was organized by the Government of Erdoğan in Istanbul in 2010. He responded that \\"the problems of Alevis can only be solved with diplomacy\\". Personal life Sağ married Yıldız Bayşu, daughter of composer Abdullah Nail Bayşu, in July 1970. The couple had a son and daughter. His wife died of cancer at the age of 60 on 18 October 2016. In May 2017, Sağ was diagnosed with lung cancer.

The NVR held the supreme command of the GDR's armed forces (including the internal security forces), and the NVR's chairman was considered the GDR's commander-in- chief.Moritz Michels, and Martin Wieser, \\"From Hohenschönhausen to Guantanamo Bay: Psychology's role in the secret services of the GDR and the United States.\\" Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 54.1 (2018): 43-61. Background The predecessor of the NVR, the Security Commission of the CC Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), met for the first time on 6 July 1954. With the enactment of the \\"Law on the Formation of the National Defense Council of the GDR\\" on 13 February 1960, the Security Commission was transformed into the NVR. When the Council of State of the GDR (Staatsrat der DDR) was created on 12 September 1960 to replace the office of President of the GDR, the law creating the Staatsrat (which amended the 1949 GDR Constitution) also acknowledged the role of the NVR in GDR defense policy. On 9 April 1968, when the 1968 GDR Constitution became effective, the NVR was designated as the supreme leadership body of the state in time of war or national emergency, with full legislative and executive authority. The first session of the NVR convened on 16 March 1960; the 78th, and last, session convened on 16 June 1989. Composition of the NVR The NVR consisted of a chairman and at least 12 members, all of whom were members of the CC of the SED; most were also members of the CC's Politbüro. Some of the members of the NVR also held leadership roles in the \\"armed organs\\" (bewaffnete Organe) of the state: the National People's Army, the Volkspolizei, and the Ministry of State Security. Subordinate to the NVR were the regional (Bezirk) and district (Kreis) operational directorates (Einsatzleitungen), whose chairmen were also the first secretaries of the regional and district party organizations of the SED. Leadership of the NVR The NVR strengthened Walter Ulbricht's claim as the leading political force in the SED, as he became the NVR's first chairman, even though Wilhelm Pieck was still president of the GDR at the time. Upon Erich Honecker's rise to power in 1971, he replaced Ulbricht as chairman of the NVR. Egon Krenz became chairman of the NVR on 24 October 1989 following Honecker's resignation as state and party leader, but held on to power himself for only a few weeks in the wake of the Wende and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Judicial Consequences Following German Reunification After German reunification in October 1990, individual members of the NVR were prosecuted in connection with their political responsibility for the regime's border policies, including the use of deadly force (Schießbefehl) and the deaths of escapees along the inner-German border and the Berlin Wall. As an example, in 1997, Krenz was convicted and sentenced to 6½ years in prison for his role in the deaths of four escapees, although he actually served just under four years (13 January 2000 to 18 December 2003) before being released on parole. Security Arrangements for Members of the NVR An underground bunker was built in Prenden, near Wandlitz, for the members of the NVR; this was the largest bunker complex in the GDR.

Ney's VI Corps made up part of a 65,000-strong army commanded by André Masséna, who was bent on a third French invasion of Portugal. Forces Ney's VI Corps included Jean Marchand's 1st Division (6,500), Julien Mermet's 2nd Division (7,400), Louis Loison's 3rd Division (6,600), Auguste Lamotte's corps light cavalry brigade (900), Charles Gardanne's mounted dragoon brigade (1,300) and 60 cannon. Herrasti commanded 3 regular battalions from the Avila, Segovia and 1st Majorca Infantry Regiments, 375 artillerymen and 60 sappers. These troops were supplemented by 3 battalions of the Volunteers of Ciudad Rodrigo and 1 battalion of the Urban Guard. Siege Initially hoping to be relieved by the British Light under Brigadier General Robert Craufurd, which was nearby, in accordance with the aid that had been promised, Herrasti refused the initial offer to surrender. Viscount Wellington was not however prepared to meet the French in open battle, as he was greatly outnumbered, resting on the Portuguese frontier to await the outcome of the siege. Herrasti's 5,500-man Spanish garrison put up a gallant and sustained defence, for over 10 weeks, surrendering only after the counterscarp had been blown in, Ney's artillery opened practical breaches in the walls and the French infantry were poised for an assault. Herrasti met Ney at the foot of the breach and having been offered the chance of an honourable capitulation, accepted. \\"Ney promised that the people and property of the inhabitants of the city would be respected. However, all the men who had participated in the defence, and the members of the Central Junta who had encouraged it, would be taken as prisoners to France.\\" The Spanish suffered 461 killed and 994 wounded, while 4,000 men and 118 cannon were captured. Ney's VI Corps lost 180 killed and over 1,000 wounded during the siege. The French soldiery then pillaged the city, breaking Ney's promise. The siege delayed Masséna's invasion of Portugal by over a month. Aftermath French troops advanced, following up the retreating British fought the Battle of the Côa soon after. The Siege of Almeida was started and ended suddenly with a massive explosion of the fortress magazine on 26 August. With all obstacles cleared from their path, the French could march on Lisbon in strength. A defensive battle, the Battle of Bussaco, was fought, which gave the French a bloody nose, before the British and Portuguese fell back on the Lines of Torres Vedras which were completed as the troops arrived. The lines were designed to enable a successful defence of Lisbon and avoid a British evacuation of the peninsular, as had happened after the Battle of Corunna in January 1809. The delay in capturing Cuidad Rodrigo gave many precious weeks of time to enable the Lines of Torres Vedras to be completed and therefore contributed greatly to the Allied victory of the Peninsular War. A second Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo occurred in January 1812, with the French being besieged this time, losing the town after a short two-week siege.

He was Vice-President of the Illinois Anti- Slavery Society and a conductor of the Underground Railroad. Biography Thomas Galt was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to James Galt and Mary Martin Galt. He graduated from Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania and later attended Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. Although licensed by the Presbytery of Ohio on June 18, 1834, he was ordained and installed as pastor in 1836 at Farmington Presbyterian Church in Farmington, IL, now known as Farmingdale in Sangamon County west of Springfield. The church's name changed from Farmington to Farmingdale around 1905, perhaps due to duplication and not to be confused with the city of Farmington, IL, in Fulton County west of Peoria which was founded in 1827. In 1837 Galt answered the call by Elijah Lovejoy (American abolitionist and newspaper publisher) to attend the Anti-Slavery Convention in Upper Alton, Illinois. At the convention, Galt, Edward Beecher (brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe) and other attendees countered attempts by Illinois Attorney General Usher Linder to derail the proceedings. The Anti-Slavery Convention ended sine die (without further plans) on October 28, 1837; however, the convention attendees reconvened the same day to form the Illinois Anti-Slavery Society. Galt was elected Vice-President. As a \\"new school\\" Presbyterian, Galt favored an early end of slavery. Owing to \\"old school\\" sentiment in the Farmington church, he moved on in April 1842 to form Center Presbyterian Church in Farmington, Illinois. He held meetings of the Sangamon County Anti-Slavery Society at Center Presbyterian Church. On February 7, 1849, Galt organized another \\"new school\\" church, the Third Presbyterian Church in Springfield, Illinois. Galt was reportedly a Sangamon County \\"conductor\\" of the Underground Railroad. Galt was married to Sarah Happer. He died on September, 12th 1857 and is buried in Farmington Cemetery near the unincorporated community of Farmingdale, along with Sarah and other family members. Although the church changed names from Farmington to Farmingdale, the cemetery's name is still Farmington Cemetery and is on Farmington Cemetery Rd.

Major denominations are Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, Adventists, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of Christ in China, Methodist, Pentecostal and Salvation Army. With their emphasis on youth work, many congregations have a high proportion of young people. Two weekly newspapers are published, The Christian Weekly and The Christian Times. Two ecumenical bodies facilitate co- operative work among the Protestant churches in Hong Kong. The older one, dating from 1915, is the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. The second co-operative body is the Hong Kong Christian Council, formed in 1954. Major mainline denominations and ecumenical services constitute the membership core of the council, which is committed to building closer relationships among all churches in Hong Kong as well as with churches overseas, and to stimulating local Christians to play an active part in the development of Hong Kong society. The Chairman of the Council, the Rt Revd Thomas Soo, represents the Protestant community in the six religions' meetings. =Gallery= Image:CrownOfThornsChurch_03.jpgCrown of Thorns' Church Image:HK_SKH_HolyTrinityChurch.JPGHoly Trinity Cathedral, Kowloon City Image:Lutheran Theological Seminary Interior.jpg Chinese architecture in the Lutheran Theological Seminary Image:HK_TST_St_Andrew_s_Church_1.jpgSt. Andrew's Church (Kowloon) Image:Hongkongskhsjc.jpgSt. John's Cathedral, Hong Kong Orthodox Church Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul in Hong Kong In 1933, the head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, Bishop Victor (Svyatin) sent Priest Dmitry Uspensky, who served in Beijing, to Hong Kong, where many Eastern Orthodox emigrants from Russia moved since the Revolution in 1917. He organised a parish in Hong Kong and served there until his death in 1969. In 1945, the parish was visited by Russian Orthodox Bishop John (Maximovich) of Shanghai, and in 1968 by Russian Orthodox Bishop (Poyarkov) of Zaraisk. The parish was officially reestablished in 2008.Russian Orthodoxy in Hong Kong In November 1996, Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia () was set up by the decision of the Holy Great Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.Official statement of the Church of Constantinople concerning the establishment of the new \\"diocese\\" in Asia Mormonism (LDS Church) Hong Kong China Temple The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 23,000 practitioners in Hong Kong divided into 36 congregations, doubling the number of members from 10 years earlier.LDS Newsroom The LDS Church first sent missionaries to Hong Kong in 1853 but did not establish a headquarters until 1949. In 1996 the Church completed the Hong Kong China Temple in Kowloon. In 2005, the Church dedicated the Church Administration Building Hong Kong on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai. The geographical administrative area for the China Hong Kong Mission includes all of China. There are missionaries in Macau but , there are no LDS Missionaries preaching within mainland China, although there are some service Missionaries. Welfare and social services In 1955, the Catholic Diocesan started to provide different kind of social welfare to Hong Kong. For example, hospitals and clinics, creches, homes for the aged and blind girls. Starting from 1960s, the Catholics tried to provide services in more areas such as orphanages, noodle units, bakeries, milk conversion units, women rehabilitation institutes and vocational & trade training courses. In the 1970s, the Catholic Diocesan started to focus on specific areas and terminated some of the factory units. In 2018, the Catholics were still providing services in medical aspect, nurseries & child care centers, elderly & youth services and Caritas social family services center.Hong Kong Catholic Diocesan Archives, Catholic Statistics in Hong Kong In the Catholic community, Caritas is the official social welfare arm of the Church in Hong Kong. These services are open to all people. Indeed, 95 per cent of those who have benefited from the wide range of services provided by the diocese are not Catholics. \\"The Catholic French Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres\\" was one of the first orphanage and elderly home was established in 1848. In protestant communities, Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui has been responsive to social needs, by providing a wide array of social services, aiming at achieving a fair, just and loving society. At present, many social service organisations and social service models in Hong Kong were those initiated and promoted by the Church. Services provided by the Church are multi-faceted, including services for family and child-care, children and youth, the elderly, rehabilitation service, community development service and other supportive services. There are more than 230 units providing social service run by Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui at present. =Education= Prior to 1841, the territory known today as Hong Kong had been an extension of Imperial China for many centuries. The changes would come with the arrival of the British colonialisation in 1841. At first Hong Kong's education came from Protestant and Catholic missionaries who provided social services. Italian missionaries began to provide boy-only education to British and Chinese youth in 1843.Bray, Mark. Koo, Ramsey. [2005] (2005) Education and Society in Hong Kong and Macao: Comparative Perspectives on Continuity and Change. Hong Kong: Springer Press. In 1953, there were 81 Catholic school and served 28,610 students. The school's number starting to increase till 1979. In 1979, there were 318 Catholic school and served over 280,000 students. After the booming period, the number of the school slightly decreased to 270 while the student number kept increased to over 300,000. The peak shows in 1995, there were 327 Catholic school and served about 290,000 students. The number of the Catholic school decreased to 248 in 2018 and served over 140,000 students.Hong Kong Catholic Diocesan Archives, Catholic Statistics in Hong Kong Post-secondary institutions The first school to open western medical practice to the Far East was the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese in 1887; it was formed under Frederick Lugard, the Governor of Hong Kong and established by London Missionary Society, A Christian-based missionary, at the time. The nucleus of the school would later create the foundation for the new and renamed Hong Kong University in 1910.The University of Hong Kong. [2003] (2003). Growing with Hong Kong: The University and its Graduates, the first 90 years. There were three post-secondary institutions (The Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University and Lingnan University) ran by the Protestant community in Hong Kong. In addition, they operate 16 theological seminaries and Bible institutes, 16 Christian publishing houses and 57 Christian bookshops. Caritas Francis Hsu College is a self-financing degree-granting institution, which was established by Caritas Hong Kong. Kindergarten, primary and secondary schools In education, there are 320 Catholic schools and kindergartens which have about 286,000 pupils. There is the Catholic Board of Education to assist in this area. The Protestant churches run 144 secondary schools, 192 primary schools, 273 kindergartens and 116 nurseries in which 33 secondary schools and more than 50 primary schools are established by the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui. It is notable that many schools run by the Church has been getting outstanding results in Public Examinations, such as Diocesan Boys' School, Diocesan Girls' School and St. Paul's Co-educational College. =Medical services= The Protestant community in Hong Kong runs seven hospitals. The hospitalsHospital Authority:Hospitals & Institutions includes Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (co-managed with Hospital Authority), Hong Kong Baptist Hospital (private hospital), United Christian Hospital (co- managed with Hospital Authority), Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (co- managed with Hospital Authority), Evangel Hospital (private hospital), Haven of Hope Hospital (co-managed with Hospital Authority). Some of these hospitals have served Hong Kong for a long period of time. Tsan Yuk Hospital was set up by London Missionary Society in 1922 and become a government hospital in 1934.Tsan Yuk HospitalHong Kong Adventist HospitalHong Kong Adventist Hospital and Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital are other Christian-based hospitals. Six hospitals are managed by the Catholic community in Hong Kong. Three hospitals in Hong Kong are managed by Caritas-Hong Kong, a Catholic-based charity organisation: Caritas Medical Centre, Canossa Hospital and Precious Blood Hospital.Caritas-Hong Kong:Medical Service Divisions St Paul's Hospital and St Teresa's Hospital are managed by the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres Order, another Catholic based organisation. Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital is founded in 1961 by the Maryknoll Sisters. ;the Establishment of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital Before the establishment of the hospital, there were three government clinics but no hospitals in the Eastern District, a district with population of 440,000 in 1980s. The injuries of the Eastern District shared 40% of the death of the Hong Kong Island's injuries who was reaching the hospitals by ambulance, according to a report by a Christian- based charity organisation. In August 1982, several churches in the District formed an organisation to force the then Colonial Government to establish a hospital, leading to the establishment of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. The organisation also urged the Government to improve the medical service provided in the District.A Carnival of Gods: Studies of Religions in Hong Kong.(2002).

Conflict with the government =Preservation of heritage buildings= ;Hoh Fuk Tong Centre In early 2000s, Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China (the owner of Ho Fuk Tong Centre) submitted an application of a redevelopment scheme for the centre, proposing a demolition of all the historical buildings on the site, to the Buildings Department. The two adjoining schools, namely, But San School and Hoh Fuk Tong College, were also proposed to be demolished in the redevelopment scheme.Press Release:AMO obtains support to preserve historical buildings in Hoh Fok Tong Centre To protect the historic building from demolition, Morrison House was declared as proposed Monument on 11 April 2003;Press Release: Morrison Building in Hoh Fuk Tong Centre Declared Proposed Monument it was later declared as monument on 26 March 2004.The Morrison Building in Hoh Fuk Tong Centre ;Kom Tong Hall In 1960, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased the building. The Church used the Hall for worship services and other local Church activities as well as for administration of its Asia-area humanitarian, building and other programs. As a result of Church growth, locally and throughout Asia over the last four decades, the Church's headquarters were moved out of Kom Tong Hall and into a much larger new 14-story building in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. The Church no longer had need for the building and was looking to sell the property. It soon became apparent that a vacant lot would yield a far higher amount than if the property were sold intact, and the Church considered demolishing the building. In October 2002, the Church actually submitted an application for a demolition permit to the Building Authority. However, after hearing concerns raised by friends in the community, and a series of negotiations with the Hong Kong Government, Church officials reached a consensus in selling the property intact and preserving the building. =School-based management reform= The Education (Amendment) Bill 2002, which was to introduce the school-based management (SBM) governance framework to all aided schools in the city,LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL BRIEF: Education Ordinance(Chapter 279)- EDUCATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2002 was introduced in November 2002 and passed in July 2004.Bills Committee on Education (Amendment) Bill 2002 The Hong Kong Catholic Diocese, as one of the major schools sponsoring bodies, worried that the Diocese may not run schools according to its vision and mission as representatives of parents, teachers and principals are allowed to sit in the School Management Committee (SMC), causing the politicised atmosphere in SMC.Bishop Zen: 2003/10/5 – Can we still run schools according to the vision and mission of Catholic education? Bishop Zen published his articles to express his opinions on the Bill.Bishop Zen's stand on the issue of School-based Management He had previously said that \\"we will reconsider our commitment to education\\" if the Bill had been passed, leading to the worries of the parents and teachers; later he clarified that it didn't mean that the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese would stop running the Catholic school after the Bill had been passed.Bishop Zen: 2004/4/25 Bishop Zen further clarifies diocese's stand on proposed education bill and convenes forums for discussion 2014 Hong Kong protests Many of the participants and leaders of the 2014 Hong Kong protests (i.e. Umbrella movement) are Christians, despite many of the government officials and members of the Pro- Beijing camp which opposed the movement. Joshua Wong, the founder of Scholarism, is an Evangelical Christian who has cited his faith as a motivation for his leadership. Two of the three leaders of Occupy Central, another group supporting the protests, are also Christians. One of their motivations is distrust of the treatment of Christians by the Chinese government. They view democracy as a defence against government control. Different denominations, however, are split in their support or opposition to the protests. The Methodist Church of Hong Kong has been openly supportive of the protesters (while did not take any official stances). The Anglican Church in Hong Kong, on the other hand, has encouraged members to stay out of the protests and church leaders opposed the movement. The protesters themselves made a makeshift Christian chapel in the Mong Kok occupation region. The chapel was destroyed when police cleared the area. Protesters rebuilt it the next day.Shai Oster, \\"How Smashed Jesus Shrine Reveals Christian Undercurrent to Hong Kong Protests\\" Bloomberg, 28 October 2014 Matthew Bell \\"Christian take a prominent role in Hong Kong Protests\\", PRI's The World, 6 October 2014Ned Levin, \\"Hong Kong Democracy Protests Carry a Christian Mission for Some\\", The Wall Street Journal, 3 October 2014 Frank Langfitt, \\"A Surprising Tie That Binds Hong Kong's Protest Leaders: Faith\\", NPR, 9 October 2014.Political cartoon by Kong Chi Lo showing Jesus and Guan Yu holding yellow umbrellas and walking among protesters, China Digital Times, 14 October 2014 Christianity among Hong Kong Universities students According to the Hong Kong University Grant Committee statistics, as of school year 2011/2012, about one quarter (24.6%) of university students were Christian (21.1% Protestant Christian and 3.5% are Catholic) .

","title":"Christianity in Hong Kong"},{"id":"14046764","text":"The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War is a book by Lynn H. Nicholas and a subsequent documentary film. The book explores the Nazi plunder of looted art treasures from occupied countries and the consequences. It covers a range of associated activities: Nazi appropriation and storage, patriotic concealment and smuggling during World War II, discoveries by the Allies, and the extraordinary tasks of preserving, tracking, and returning by the American Monuments officers and their colleagues. Nicholas was awarded the Légion d'Honneur by France.Nicholas awarded Légion d'Honneur Despite the regular accounts of impending destruction of art works, Nicholas also recounts a veneration for art on the part of people of all sides of the conflict, and what amounts to desperate and sometimes heroic activity. The villains, unsurprisingly, are often the Nazis, particularly Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring; however, the activities of Western art dealers are often questionable, as well. Contents The book is chronological, starting with scattered events in the decade before World War II. During this time, the Nazis used their influence and money to acquire artwork, while dealers and the public at large were anticipating war. Discussion of Nazi occupation starts in the third chapter. The middle of the book discusses Nazi plundering during the war, as well as Soviet efforts to safeguard their treasures. Midway through the book, the role of American and Allied organizations is introduced, including the frustratingly tentative planning and lack of resources they faced. The book follows the path of liberation as the Allies push back the Axis, while missing art is searched for and recovered art conserved. The book concludes with chapters about post war activities: resolving problems of ownership, coordinating the return of stolen art, and attempting to collect what was yet missing. Philosophically intriguing are issues of who ultimately owns works of art. Since this last phase of recovery and restitution is ongoing, this book has a bearing on current activities. Awards The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award for general non-fiction in 1994. Documentary It was adapted for a film of the same name released in 2006. It was made for 1.3 million USD, with half underwritten by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the remainder underwritten by the National Endowment for the Arts, several other foundations, and one private investor. Among the featured vignettes in the film is Jewish refugee Maria Altmann, who in 2006 restituted Gustav Klimt's masterpiece Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.http://www.rapeofeuropa.com/stolenRestitutions.asphttp://www.biography.com/news/woman- in-gold-maria-altmann-biography Altmann was portrayed by Helen Mirren in the 2015 film Woman in Gold.

Lederman and science writer Dick Teresi. The book provides a brief history of particle physics, starting with the Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Democritus, and continuing through Isaac Newton, Roger J. Boscovich, Michael Faraday, and Ernest Rutherford and quantum physics in the 20th century. Lederman explains in the book why he gave the Higgs boson the nickname \\"The Goddamn Particle\\": In 2013, subsequent to the discovery of the Higgs boson, Lederman co-authored, with theoretical physicist Christopher T. Hill, a sequel: Beyond the God Particle which delves into the future of particle physics in the post-Higgs boson era. The book is part of a trilogy, with companions, Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe and Quantum Physics for Poets (see bibliography below).  Historical context  Fermilab director and subsequent Nobel physics prize winner Leon M. Lederman was a very prominent early supporter – some sources say the architect or proposer – of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. Direct link to article. Lederman wrote his 1993 popular science book – which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project – in the context of the project's last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s. The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditure. The proximate causes of the closure were the rising US budget deficit, rising projected costs of the project, and the cessation of the Cold War which reduced the perceived political pressure within the United States to undertake and complete high-profile megaprojects of this kind.

It is also known as the two-piece sari or half sari. Young girls between puberty and marriage wear this dress. Girls younger than this may wear it on special occasions. It comprises a langa or paavadai, a skirt which is tied around the waist using string, and a voni, oni, or davani, which is a cloth usually in length. The voni is draped diagonally over a choli (a tight fitting blouse, the same as that worn with a sari). Usually, the garment is woven with cotton or silk. A variant of this is the gagra choli of North India (the difference between the two being the direction of draping the voni or dupatta). The modern day \\"lengha-style sari\\", worn by Indians across the subcontinent mainly for special occasions, is inspired by the langa voni. Dress The half sari facilitates the transition from the childhood paavadai (skirt) sattai (blouse) to the sari, the more complicated drape worn by adult women. Usually the langa (paavadai) and voni are brightly colored and contrasting to each other. At a glance, the half sari outfit can look similar to southern styles of sari because the drape travels in the same direction: tucked into the front of the skirt, then wrapped around the waist, and then draped over the opposite shoulder. However, the voni is shorter, and the wearer is not required to manually pleat the cloth, as is done when draping the sari. In addition, the voni is less restrictive, allowing the wearer to move her legs freely. Modern day The influence of western culture and the perception of the dress as inconvenient has led to the decline of the half sari as daily wear, in favor of the shalwar kameez or western clothes. However, the langa voni has inspired the modern day \\"lengha-style sari\\" and has seen a comeback. In recent years, however, the langa oni is gaining popularity among girls and young women as occasional wear due to attention in media and fashion. Once very simple, they can now be seen with extravagant embroidery, mirror or zari work, and bold colors like black and grey which were once considered inauspicious. There is also a greater diversity of fabrics being used in addition to the usual silk or cotton, including chiffon, georgette, crepe and nylon. Full saris are sometimes woven so that the fabric, when worn, changes color or pattern at the hip, in order to give the visual effect of a langa voni. Significance in coming of age ceremony In South India, coming of age ceremonies or rites of passage (; ; ) are celebrated when a girl reaches puberty. She wears a langa voni given by her maternal grandparents, which is worn during the first part of the ceremony and then she is given her first sari by her paternal grandparents, which she wears during the second half of the ceremony. This marks her transition into womanhood. The tradition of presenting a langa voni from the maternal grandparents in some communities begins with the girl's first naming ceremony (namakaran) and her first rice- feeding ceremony (annaprashana). She receives her last one at her coming of age ceremony. Images File:Group of Tamil girls.jpgThe girl on the left is wearing the langa voni. The other two are wearing saris.

The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.Erik Stokstad (2009) 'On the Origin of Ecological Structure', Science 2 Oct 2009 pp. 33-35. =Rule 2: Reduced niche overlap= Case tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less niche overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization. His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near Baja California and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to interspecific competition. Testing and alternative theories Testing the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species. The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions. This is the reason why Diamond's results sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties and is considered a turning point in community ecology . Daniel Simberloff led the arguments against these rules claiming that theory as the one developed by Diamond \\"has generated predictions that are either practically untestable, by virtue of unmeasurable parameters or unrealizable assumptions, or trivially true\\" . The controversy was developed in a number of scientific papers (see for instance and ) and contributed to the development of null and neutral models in community ecology, which are nowadays widely used to test the significance of ecological patterns.

Allen. Viktor Hamburger, 1900–2001. National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoirs, 2015, 39 pp. was a German-American professor and embryologist. His collaboration with neuroscientist Rita Levi-Montalcini resulted in the discovery of nerve growth factor. In 1951 he and Howard Hamilton in 1951 published a standardized stage series to describe chicken embryo development, now called the Hamburger- Hamilton stages. He was considered \\"one of the most influential neuroembryologists of the twentieth century\\". Early life Hamburger was born on in Landeshut, Silesia, Germany to Max Hamburger and Else Gradenwitz. After completing gymnasium in June 1918, Hamburger was inducted into the German army, but was released after the Armistice later that year. The army had discharged him in the city of Breslau, and he began his university studies there, moving to Heidelberg for the academic year of 1919–1920. However, in the spring of 1920 he was attracted to move to Freiburg, where he went on to complete his Ph.D. in the laboratory of embryologist Hans Spemann in 1925. Career Hamburger was doing post-doctoral research at the University of Chicago when the Nazis came to power in Germany, and was able to remain in the US through the assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation. Hamburger began to work at Washington University in St. Louis in 1935; he retired from his professor position in 1969 and continued researching until the 1980s. In 1947 Hamburger recognized and brought to the United States Nobel Prize-winning neurologist Rita Levi-Montalcini. Their subsequent collaboration resulted in the discovery of nerve growth factor. In 1951 Hamburger and Howard Hamilton in 1951 published the Hamburger-Hamilton stages. They believed developmental biologists should have a well-grounded reference system to identify the stages of embryo development. This would facilitate comparisons between experiments in different laboratories. The devised their stage series based on visible anatomical characteristics, chosen on the basis of clearly identifiable external features and that the successive stages should be spaced closely together as possible and include quantitative measurements, such a beak or toe length. In the 1960s, Hamburger did embryological work that established that chick movements in embryo were spontaneous patterns, a finding that contradicted contemporary assertions of behavioral psychologists. Hamburger later revisited nerve growth factor, demonstrating that it was required for the maintenance of neural cells.

It is installed under the skin, with the tube connected to a vein. External access is with a needle through the yellow membrane. Port-a- Cath with needle assembly inserted In medicine, a port is a small medical appliance that is installed beneath the skin. A catheter (plastic tube) connects the port to a vein. Under the skin, the port has a septum (a silicone membrane) through which drugs can be injected and blood samples can be drawn many times, usually with less discomfort for the patient than a more typical \\"needle stick\\". Ports are used mostly to treat hematology and oncology patients. Ports were previously adapted for use in hemodialysis patients, but were found to be associated with increased rate of infections and are no longer available in the US. The port is usually inserted in the upper chest (known as a \\"chest port\\"), just below the clavicle or collar bone, with the catheter inserted into the jugular vein. Terminology Chest X-ray showing an implanted port A port is more correctly known as a \\"totally implantable venous access device\\". Brand names include Eco Port, Clip-a-Port, SmartPort, Microport, Bardport, PowerPort, Passport, Port-a-Cath, Infuse-a-Port, Medi- Port, and Bioflo. Procedure The catheter runs from the portal and is surgically inserted into a vein (usually the jugular vein, subclavian vein, or superior vena cava). Ideally, the catheter terminates in the superior vena cava, just upstream of the right atrium. This position allows infused agents to be spread throughout the body quickly and efficiently. A port consists of a reservoir compartment (the portal) that has a silicone bubble for needle insertion (the septum), with an attached plastic tube (the catheter). The device is surgically inserted under the skin in the upper chest or in the arm and appears as a bump under the skin. It requires no special maintenance other than occasional flushing to keep clear. It is completely internal so swimming and bathing are not a problem. The catheter runs from the portal and is surgically inserted into a vein (usually the jugular vein or less optimally the subclavian vein). Ideally, the catheter terminates in the superior vena cava or the right atrium. This position allows infused agents to be spread throughout the body quickly and efficiently. The septum is made of a special self-sealing silicone; it can be punctured hundreds of times before it weakens significantly. To administer treatment or to withdraw blood, a health care professional will first locate the port and disinfect the area, then access the port by puncturing the overlying skin with a Huber point (non-coring) needle. Due to its design, there is a very low infection risk, as the breach of skin integrity is never larger than the caliber of the needle. This gives it an advantage over indwelling lines such as the Hickman line. Negative pressure is created to withdraw blood into the vacuumized needle, to check for blood return and see if the port is functioning normally. Next, the port is flushed with a saline solution. Then, treatment will begin. The implantation procedure itself is considered minor, and is typically performed with both local anaesthesia and moderate sedation. Patients often have post-procedure discomfort at the insertion site which is most often managed by administration of acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen. A port is most commonly inserted as an outpatient surgery procedure in a hospital or clinic by an interventional radiologist or surgeon, under moderate sedation. Implantation is increasingly performed by interventional radiologists due to advancements in techniques and their facile use of imaging technologies. When no longer needed, the port can be removed in the interventional radiology suite or an operating room. Uses Ports have many uses: * To deliver chemotherapy to cancer patients who must undergo treatment frequently. Chemotherapy is often toxic, and can damage skin and muscle tissue, and therefore should not be delivered through these tissues. Ports provide a solution, delivering drugs quickly and efficiently through the entire body via the circulatory system. * To deliver coagulation factors in patients with severe hemophilia. * To withdraw (and/or return) blood to the body in patients who require frequent blood tests, and in hemodialysis patients. * To deliver antibiotics to patients requiring them for a long time or frequently, such as those with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. * Delivering medications to patients with immune disorders. * For treating alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with replacement therapy * For delivering radiopaque contrast agents, which enhance contrast in CT imaging. * To fill or withdraw fluid from the Lap-Band or Realize gastric bands used in Bariatric surgeries. * To administer analgesics to patients with chronic pain, such as cancer patients and those with sickle-cell disease Insertion chest X-ray after insertion of a port, with a malpositioned tip in the azygos vein. CT scan confirming a tip in the azygos vein. Fluoroscopy is useful in guiding the insertion of ports. A follow-up chest radiograph can immediately detect complications associated with the procedure in the form of pneumothorax, hemothorax and malpositions of the catheter (see Risks below for further details). However, it is suggested that chest radiography is not mandatory as a routine method after fluoroscopy-guided port insertion that is mainly performed by venous cutdown. The side of the patients' chest the port is implanted in will usually be chosen to avoid damage to the port and the veins by the seat belt in case of accident when seated as the driver. Thus, there is a potential conflict by left- and right-hand traffic as the rule of the road. Ports can be put in the upper chest or arm. The exact positioning itself is variable as it can be inserted to avoid visibility when wearing low cut shirts, and to avoid excess contact due to a backpack or bra strap. The most common placement is on the upper right portion of the chest, with the catheter itself looping through the right jugular vein, and down towards the patient's heart.  Models  There are many different models of ports. The particular model selected is based on the patient's specific medical conditions. Portals: *can be made of plastic, stainless steel, or titanium *can be single chamber or dual chamber *vary in height, width and shape. Catheters: *can be made of biocompatible, medical-grade polyurethane or silicone *can vary in length and diameter For applications such as CT scan, high pressure infusion allowing ports are needed. =Manufacturers= The major manufacturers of ports are AngioDynamics, B. Braun Medical, Bard Access Systems, Cook Medical, MedComp, Navilyst Medical, Norfolk Medical Products, and Smiths Medical. Risks * Age: If the device is put into a child, the child's growth means that the catheter becomes relatively shorter and will move towards the head. It may become necessary to remove or replace it. * Arterial injury: The subclavian artery can be inadvertently punctured while attempting a subclavian vein access, leading to a subcutaneous hematoma and occasionally a pseudoaneurysm. An alternative site may need to be used for port placement. Puncture of the carotid artery is significantly more rare, since attempts to access the nearby jugular vein are increasingly done with ultrasound guidance. * Infection: An infection may develop in the line or around the port. This may require antibiotic treatment or removal of the device. * Mechanical failure is uncommon. Ports placed through the subclavian vein may suffer from \\"pinch-off syndrome\\" where the catheter fractures as it passes into the vein. Ports placed via the jugular vein do not suffer from this problem. The catheter fragment then travels through the venous system and typically lodges in the right heart or the lungs. Many patients are asymptomatic but the mechanical failure is discovered because of an inability to flush or withdraw fluids from the port. In those instances, an interventional radiologist can usually retrieve the fragment and place a new port. *Pneumothorax: Attempts to gain access to the subclavian vein or jugular vein can injure the lung, potentially causing a pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large enough, a chest tube might need to be placed. In experienced hands, the incidence of this complication is about 1% when accessing the subclavian vein. When accessing the jugular vein the pneumothorax rate is virtually nonexistent. * Thrombosis: formation of a blood clot in the catheter may block the device irrevocably. To prevent clotting the port is flushed with saline and heparin, usually by a nurse or other medical professional, or someone properly trained that is a family member or the patient, once every six weeks, or more often in conjunction with administering medication. * Vascular occlusion: formation of a blood clot between the catheter and the vascular wall leading to partial or complete occlusion of the vein. The occlusion is cleared by removal of the port if possible. If not, then heparin therapy may clear the occlusion. * Intravenous drug use: If an intravenous drug user is discharged to be treated with a port in place to be treated on an outpatient basis, they may be likely to use the port improperly to inject illicit drugs. This use poses a serious risk of injury or severe infection, including of the heart lining.  Use  To reduce damage or coring of the septum (cutting out small pieces of membrane with the needle, plugging it up), low or non coring needles are to be used. After each use, a heparin lock is made by injecting a small amount of heparinized saline (an anticoagulant) into the device, preventing development of clots within the port or catheter. In some catheter designs where there is a self-sealing valve at the far end, the system is locked with just saline. The port can be left accessed for as long as required. The port is covered in a dressing to protect the site from infection and to secure the needle in position. If a port is used infrequently, it may be necessary to access the port regularly, flush it with saline, and inject a new heparin lock to prevent clotting between uses.  Alternatives  Sometimes, the physical condition of the patient, especially the structure of his veins, does not allow for the insertion of a port. An alternative is the PICC line, despite drawbacks such as external entry point and limited lifespan of the device.  In popular culture  In the 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, a minor character, Peter Riviera, has a kind of medical port placed in his arm to facilitate his recreational drug use.

By this time, Soviet Air Force leaders were convinced that metal was a highly usable substance in the building of airplanes. Tupolev therefore guided AGOS- TsAGI in creating the first Soviet all-metal aircraft. The ANT-3 was Tupolev's first practical aircraft. Construction and Development On 1 August 1924, design work started for the ANT-3, by the following July the prototype was completed at the AGOS factory. The sesquiplane ANT-3 first flew on 6 August 1925, piloted by V. N. Fillipov, a TsAGI test-pilot. The VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily - military air forces) ordered several ANT-3s, designated R-3 (R - Razvedchik - reconnaissance), after successful flight tests led by Mikhail Gromov. However, production was limited by the shortage of raw materials, but those that were produced proved useful for propaganda purposes. Production The ANT-3 was produced between 1926 and 1928 at GAZ-5 (GAZ - Gosudarstvenny Aviatsionnyy Zavod – state aviation plant/factory) in Moscow and, from late 1928, at GAZ-22. 102 units were probably produced in total. Design The ANT-3 was a sesquiplane seating two in tandem cockpits, with the pilot in front and gunner behind. The structure was predominantly built from light alloys with corrugated kol'choogaluminly skin. Lower main-planes were attached to the lower fuselage, whilst the upper mainplane was supported on short cabane struts. Wire bracing and streamlined 'V' interplane struts provided structural integrity. The single-engined ANT-3 could be powered by a range of engines from ; the prototype used a Liberty, the second aircraft was powered by a Napier Lion; the first 79 production aircraft used the Lorraine-Dietrich 12E; 21 aircraft used the Mikulin M-5 and one used a BMW VI. Tupolev proposed an upgraded version, to be powered by a Mikulin engine, with a range of about . One was built with a Lorraine-Dietrich engine, delivered to Aeroflot's Yakutsk division, designated PS-3 and used as a mail-plane until about 1930. Operational history Tupolev R-3NL RR-SOV photo from L'Aérophile September,1926 The R-3, used by the military for reconnaissance, was also used for propaganda purposes with long-distance flights. In the summer of 1926 the prototype R-3NL, named Proletariy (En:proletarian) and registered RR-SOV, piloted by Mikhail Gromov, assisted by mechanic Yevgeny Radzevich, flew a round Europe flight: Moscow - Königsberg - Berlin - Paris - Rome - Vienna - Prague - Warsaw - Moscow; After flying for about , a coolant expansion tank suffered fatigue failures, spraying water around the cockpit. Gromov returned to Moscow and newspapers stated that he and Radzevich turned back due to poor weather. The incident caused Tupolev to recommend that the tank have a convex base, which was adopted. Gromov resumed his expedition landing at Königsberg, by which point the radiator was leaking. Gromov proceeded to Berlin where mechanics were unable to repair the radiator. Moving on, they flew on to Paris, where a mechanic found that some putty sealant had separated. To solve the problem, he took another aircraft's radiator, adapting it to fit in the ANT-3, after which Gromov and Radzevich flew off to Rome. Later Gromov and Radzevich flew north to Vienna, but the sun started to set and it was dark when they were just from Vienna. Gromov decided to risk landing in Vienna, where campfires were lit around the airport to illuminate the landing strip. The remainder of the flight was largely uneventful other than overflying Prague to continue to Warsaw. By their return to Moscow they had flown a distance of in 34 hours 15 minutes flying time at an average speed of , for a new national long-distance speed record. The second production ANT-3M-5, registered RR-INT and named Nash Otvet (En:Our Answer), was flown by S.A. Shestakov and D.F Fufayev from Moscow to Tokyo and return, via Sarapul, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Verkhneudinsk, Chita, Nerchinsk, Blagoveshchensk, Spassk, Nanyuan and Yokohama, taking 12 days, covering in 153 hours flying time.The aircraft was named in response to the British Foreign Secretary, Austen Chamberlain, (half-brother of the later British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain), who severed diplomatic ties with the USSR in 1927 The flight was titled \\"The Great Eastern Overflight\\" Variants ;ANT-3 : Prototype, powered by a Liberty L-8 engine. ;R-3 : Original production military reconnaissance aircraft powered by Mikulin M-5 engines; 21 built. ;R-3LD : 79 production aircraft fitted with Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb engines. ;R-3NL : Second prototype, powered by a Napier Lion engine; RR-SOV Proletariy (Proletarian). ;R-7 : Improved derivative of the R-3, powered by a BMW VI engine.

S. Singh Gujarat,Gujarat, Volume 1 – Rash Bihari Lal, Anthropological Survey of India Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Nepal. In Punjab it was traditionally worn with the kurti and salwar.Punjabi Sabhiachaar barey by Jit Singh Joshi Waris Shah Foundation It is a combination of the gagra or lehenga (long skirt) and the choli (blouse), however in contemporary and modern usage lehenga choli is the more popular and widely accepted term by fashion designers, trend setters, and boutiques in South Asia, since ghagra is synonymous with the half-slip worn as an undergarment below the sari. Terms and history Historically, the gagra choli evolved from the three-piece attire worn by women in ancient India. The attire consisted of the antriya lower garment, the uttariya veil worn over shoulder or head and stanapatta a chest-band, which finds mentioned in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist Pali literature during the 6th century B.C.Agam Kala Prakashan, 1991 \\"Costume, coiffure, and ornaments in the temple sculpture of northern Andhra\\", p.118 =Choli= Woman in traditional style of gagra choli worn in the Hindi belt. A choli (Hindi: चोली, ), (ravike in South India Telugu: రవికె, Kannada: ರವಿಕೆ) is a midriff-baring blouse commonly worn with the Indian sari costume (worn in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and other surrounding countries). It evolved from the ancient Stanapatta (also known as Kanchuki) and is cut to fit tightly to the body with its short sleeves and low neck. The choli is usually cropped, allowing exposure of the navel; the cropped design is particularly well-suited for wear in the hot summers of the Indian subcontinent. =Gagra= Illustration of different regional variations of ghagra choli worn by women in India Lehenga, gagra/ghagra (Hindi: घाघरा ghāghrā) also chaniyaFashions from India – Tom Tierney (known as pavadai in Tamil: பாவாடை) is a form of skirt which is long, embroidered and pleated. It is secured at the waist or hips and leaves the lower back and midriff bare.Social Science a Textbook in History for Class IX as per New Syllabus – FK Publications The ancient version of skirt or ghagri evolved from bhairnivasani, which in turn evolved from the antriya when stitching on one side became tabular and was worn gathered together at the waist, and held by a girdle. This was one of the earliest forms of a clumsily stitched skirt. It was worn using a nada or drawstring. The ghagri was a narrow skirt long—the same length as the original antriya—and can still be seen worn by Jain nuns in India. Until the early 20th century, women irrespective of class largely wore gagras which reached down to ankles, especially in the Hindi belt. This was largely due to jeweled toes indicating the marital status of women, as both married and unmarried women observed the ghoonghat veil. Gagras were made out of two to three layers of coarse khadi fabric which created large flared look and remained largely plain but were decorated with gota and badla embroidery on special occasions. Most commonly used dyes were indigo, lac and turmeric. This style can still be seen in rural areas of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar & Madhya Pradesh particularly during folk festivals. Woman in gagra and long front covering choli tied at the back =Dupatta= The dupatta (Hindi: दुपट्टा, Urdu: دوپٹا) or chunri (known as oṛna in Bengali: ওড়না) is a scarf that is like a shawl and is worn with the gagra and choli. It is also used as part of the women's shalwar kameez costume. It is an evolved form of the Uttariya. Until the early 21st century, the dupatta was the most decorative part of gagra choli, while the rest of the garment was plainer, especially the gagra was an everyday one. Dupatta is worn in many regional styles across India. The most common style since early medieval times was to pleat the dupatta on one end, so it can be anchored by tucking it into the front waist of the gagra. The loose end is then wrapped across the waist and/or draped diagonally across the upper body to fall over the shoulder, or up and over to cover the head. This is similar to the way a sari is generally worn. Women farming or doing manual work tuck both ends of the dupatta into their choli. The dupatta is traditionally seen as a symbol of modesty, as its main purpose is to serve as a veil. There is no single way of wearing it, so as time passed and fashion changed, the styling of the dupatta also evolved. Fabrics The lehengas are made of a number of fabrics such as silk, cotton, khadi, georgette, crape, net, satin, brocade and chiffon.Types of Indian Lehengas – nrigujarati.co.in Although designers have successfully used various fabrics for lehenga, silk is still the preferred fabric. Decorative stitching Apart from the fabric, decorative stitching patterns also play a role. Lehengas come with a wide variety of decoration and embroidery work like Gota, Phulkari, Shisha, Chikankari, Zari, Zardozi, Nakshi, Kundan, etc.The latest fashion trends in saree collection – newsbycompany.com For festivals like Navratri, the ethnic Shisha embroidery is popular with a bit of patchwork. For formal wear and weddings, the embroidery is heavier in pearls, silk, sequins and zari. Kutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread. The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes. This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch. Festive attire The lehenga choli is the favourite female apparel worn during festivals, weddings or special events in India. This is due to traditions as well as of the fact that it is available in a number of fabrics with many different decorative choices. Traditionally the sari and the lehenga choli are the most popular garments for the bride in India.Fashionable wedding attire – The Hindu This is a common bridal attire mostly in North India and is also the traditional wear of Garba festival in Gujarat.India – R.I.C. Publications Ritu Kala – significance in rite of passage In southern India, coming of age ceremony or rites of passage (langa voni Telugu: లంగా వోని, Pattu Pavadai Tamil: பட்டு பாவாடை, Langa Davani Kannada: ಲಂಗ ದ್ವನಿ) are celebrated when a girl reaches puberty. She wears langa voni during the first part of the ceremony and then she is given her first sari, which she wears during the second half of the ceremony. This marks her transition into womanhood. The tradition of presenting langa voni begins with the girl's first naming ceremony called Namakaran and her first rice feeding ceremony called Annaprashana. She receives her last one at her coming of age ceremony. Langa voni is traditional clothing for unmarried girls in southern India. Pahari painting depicting women in Luanchari. ca.1760 Luanchari Luanchari (Hindi: लुआंचणी) is a full-dress garment. The luanchari is made up of two parts. The upper part is called choli, and is made of the same fabric as of the lehanga, but it is not uncommon to find the two pieces of the garment in different colours. The choli is stitched to the lehanga, to make a one-piece luanchari. This is commonly worn by the women in Pahari miniatures, and is quite similar to lehanga. It may take over 21 yards of cloth to make a complete luanchari. It is a traditional garment worn by Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh.

Background and career O'Sullivan attended Marcellin College, Randwick, and graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons). =Public service and diplomatic career= After joining the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1971, O'Sullivan held diplomatic appointments in Rome, Washington, D.C. and Cairo. Between 1991 and 1994 he was the Australian representative to the UN disarmament office. From 1994 to 1996 he headed two divisions in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. After serving as Deputy Chief of Mission at the Australian Embassy in Washington, O'Sullivan was appointed as the Australian Ambassador to Germany in 1999. O'Sullivan was a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade between 2003 and 2004. He was appointed as Senior Advisor (International) to Prime Minister John Howard in January 2004, taking up his appointment to head the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in July 2005. Between 2004 and 2005 O'Sullivan was concurrently a Commissioner of the National Crime Commission. O'Sullivan's appointment as Director-General of Security was criticised by former Australian Secret Intelligence Service officer Warren Reed, who claimed that O'Sullivan failed to protect Reed's cover while serving as deputy to the Australian Ambassador in Cairo, leading to the abduction of Reed's operational assistant by Egyptian security agents and the closure of the ASIS station in Cairo. Within weeks of his appointment to lead ASIO, the series of Islamic suicide bombings of London occurred amid domestic calls for draconian counter-terrorism laws, followed some months later with the 2005 Bali bombings, leaving four Australian tourists dead. In 2006, O'Sullivan warned that terrorists could carry out attacks on hotels and restaurants in Australia. Following actions by two ASIO agents that a Supreme Court Justice stated was probably criminal and constituted kidnapping under the law, the court dismissed legal proceedings after assessing the ASIO interviews were inadmissible. O'Sullivan defended the actions by the ASIO agents, although he did admit that changes have been made to ASIO's procedures.

Notes tendered to the Cole Inquiry showed that O'Sullivan told AWB executives to \\"[k]eep your responses narrow [and] technical. Do not blame US, complain about process.\\" Prime Minister John Howard had previously ordered full co-operation with the UN inquiry. O'Sullivan was gagged from commenting further in public, while the Cole Inquiry was in progress. =Political advisor= On 1 November 2013, O'Sullivan commenced appointment as Chief of Staff to the Attorney- General, George Brandis .

His new offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, named Seawitch, is one of the biggest in the world, and will put his competitors out of business. To destroy it and therefore be able to inflate the price of oil at will, the competitors get together and send one man to deal with Lord Worth. The villain has a personal score to settle with Worth and kidnaps him and his daughters.

Life and Work He was born in Milan in 1605 probably in the parish of St. Giovanni in Laterano. He was a son and pupil of Gianandrea the Elder. In 1621 he was admitted to the Ambrosian Academy. His activity in the cathedral of Milan - the only one certified so far - was remembered in the Annals only starting from 1631, just after the death of Gianandrea. The execution of an Angel started by his father was entrusted to Biffi, for which he still received payments in 1638, but which would then be finished by Vismara. In 1632 he obtained the money for the effigy of the Eternal started by Gianandrea for the chapel of the Madonna of the Tree and sent by him. From that year until 1635 he worked around the relief of Ester and Assuero for a lunette of the facade, already designed and started by the father according to the design of Cerano. The angels are also recognized in the cathedral in the niches of the internal piers on the sides of the Main Cross. More interesting must have been the activity of Biffi as an engraver: the portrait of Francesco Gabrielli, signed and dated 1633, was cited with praise by Bartsch; we still know a print with four caricature heads, signed \\"Biffius\\" and by Le Blanc referring to it, and four plates he drew and engraved by Cesare Laurenti, with allegorical fights, published in the book Amore and Glory. Biffi died in 1675. In 1691 his sons Filippo and Giuseppe dedicated a funeral monument to him in the church of St. Antonio Abate.

Kevork Chavush was a legendary fedayee whose main goal was to ameliorate the plight of the Armenian peasantry in the face of harassment by marauding Turks and Kurds. To this end, he advocated armed resistance. Chavush's extraordinary daring and valor inspired his men as he led the resistance in the region of Daron-Sasun from 1904 until 1907, when he was killed in battle. Kevork Chavush was known to have good relations with some Kurdish leaders of the region. He would openly meet and dine with them and at the same time, try to persuade them to not obey orders by the Sultan, who had hired the Kurds as part of his Hamidieh guards. This was in vain as the Kurds ended up not joining the Armenian revolutionaries. Kevork Chavush, is called \\"the man with the dagger who was always ready to punish those who molested the defenseless people.\\" Early life Kevork Chavush was born to a family of hunters in Sasun, in the village of Mktink in the Bsanats region. He received his education in Mush's Arakelots monastery's school. He left school to join Arabo, a leading fedayee at the time. After Arabo was arrested, Chavush tracked down Arabo's traitor and assassinated him. From 1885 to 1888, he travelled to and found residence in Aleppo. He worked to raise enough money to buy a rifle. He returned to Taron in 1890 to join his friend Hampartsoum Boyadjian's group of Armenian fighters with the aim to defend Armenian-populated villages from Hamidian persecutions. Sasun Resistance and death Heghine, wife and widow of Kevork Chaush, 1910 In 1894, he participated in the Sasun Resistance against the Hamidian persecution of Armenians. During the battle, Chavush was captured and sentenced to jail for 15 years. He managed to escape from jail 2 years later and fled to the mountains of Sasun, where he joined the Dashnaktsutyun political party with friends and pursued revolutionary movement against Turkish officials. In 1896, he met Andranik Ozanyan and participated in various battles, most notable the Second Sasun Resistance in 1904. During his career as a freedom fighter, he was also placed under the command of Serob Aghpyur. During this time, Kevork Chavush's uncle ran into trouble with the guerrillas when he nabbed a woman from a different Armenian village. The case was brought upon Serob Aghbyur who subsequently turned to Chavush and said \\"Kevork, your uncle is the guilty one, you decide upon his fate\\" (). Chavush executed his kidnapping uncle but suffered from a severe depression afterwards and isolated himself in order to grieve the loss of his uncle. Kevork Chavush was critically wounded on 25 May 1907 during a large firefight at the Battle of Sulukh with the Ottoman army in Sulukh, Mush and which forced him to escape the fighting. Two days later his body was found in Kyosabin-Bashin on 27 May under a bridge. Kevork Chavush remained a leading Armenian guerrilla until his death.

In 1953, the 101 was recovered from damaged areas and reconstructed by the Army Transportation Corps, under the direction of Col. George Simpson. It was soon discovered that 101 was still property of the Korean Republic. Col. George Simpson, Harold T.I. Shannon, and Harold E.

After two breaches were blasted in the walls by British heavy artillery, the fortress was successfully stormed on the evening of 19 January 1812. After breaking into the city, British troops went on a rampage for several hours before order was restored. Wellington's army suffered casualties of about 1,700 men including two generals killed. Strategically, the fall of the fortress opened the northern gateway into French-dominated Spain from British-held Portugal. An earlier Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo occurred in 1810 when the French captured the city from Spanish forces. Preliminary operations A map of the siege As part of his strategy in Spain, Napoleon ordered Marshal Auguste Marmont to send 10,000 troops to help Marshal Louis Suchet's forces capture Valencia and 4,000 more to reinforce the central reserve. When Wellington received news that Marmont's Army of Portugal sent forces eastward, he moved in bad snowstorm conditions, on Ciudad Rodrigo and arrived in the area on 6 January, with Wellington surveying the approaches with the chief engineer Lt. Col. Fletcher CRE next morning. Ciudad Rodrigo was a second class fortress with a high main wall built of \\"bad masonry, without flanks, and with weak parapets and narrow ramparts.\\" The city being dominated by the high Grand Teson hill to the north, the French built a redoubt there. Barrié's 2,000-man garrison was far too weak to properly man the defences. The French garrison included single battalions of the 34th Light and 113th Line Infantry Regiments, a platoon of sappers and only 167 artillerists to man 153 cannons. The fortress was invested, and on the night of 8 January, the Light Division stormed and took the Grand Teson redoubt by surprise. and began digging trenches to, and positions for, the breaching batteries. Digging in the rocky soil at night caused a peculiar hazard. When a pickaxe struck a stone, the resulting spark drew accurate French fire. By 12 January the trenches to battery positions were complete and the batteries were being installed. Wellington received a message concerning Marshal Marmont's movements and decided the siege must be undertaken rapidly. The Santa Cruz Convent, to the right, was stormed on 13 January by the KGLBeamish p 31 and one company of the 60th. The defenders made a vigorous sortie at 11am on 14 January with 500 men, as the troops were being relieved, this sortie was repulsed, and that night an escalade was mounted against the San Francisco Convent, on the left, by men from the 40th Regiment of Foot which was successful, all French troops falling back inside the town walls. The batteries, which opened fire at 4pm on 14 January, included thirty-four 24-lb and four 18-lb siege cannon. Work began on the second parallel, to provide closer batteries and a safe covered route for assaulting troops. In five days, the guns fired over 9,500 rounds and opened two effective breaches, one, called the great breach in a wall and a smaller one in an exposed tower. Wellington ordered an assault for the night of 19 January. The storm Major-General Thomas Picton's 3rd Division was ordered to storm the greater breach on the northwest while Robert Craufurd's Light Division was sent against the lesser breach on the north. Diversionary attacks by Denis Pack's Portuguese brigade would probe the defences at the San Pelayo Gate on the east and across the Agueda River on the south. All told, Wellington planned to use 10,700 men in his assault. Launched at 7 pm, the assault met determined resistance in the great breach. The men assaulting the small breach had fewer problems and managed to get through the wall and behind the defenders of the great breach, making further resistance hopeless, the assault was completely successful. There had been two cannons embedded in the wall of the greater breach that caused most casualties in the storming. The 88th Connaught Rangers Regiment took one of the guns while the 45th Nottinghamshire Regiment took the other. Allied losses in the assault were 195 killed and 916 wounded, although amongst the dead were Major-Generals Henry MacKinnon and Robert Craufurd. The victory was somewhat marred when the British rank and file, who were upset by the 562 casualties suffered during the storming of the town, thoroughly sacked the city, despite the efforts of their officers and the fact the civilians were Spanish and therefore allies of the British. Strategic consequences The French garrison lost 529 killed and wounded, while the rest were captured. The French Army of Portugal lost its entire siege train among the 153 captured cannon. The rapid loss of Ciudad Rodrigo badly upset the calculations of Marmont who believed the town would hold for three weeks, which would give him enough time to concentrate a relief force at Salamanca. It fell in less than two weeks and Marmont, with his 32,000 troops, decided not to try to recapture it as he needed the troops to defend other towns and fortresses. Wellington received an earldom and a generous pension from the British. The Spanish made him Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo. The capture of Ciudad Rodrigo opened up the possibility of a northern invasion corridor from Portugal into Spain. It also allowed Wellington to proceed to Badajoz on the southern corridor, whose taking would be a much more bloody affair.

The cathedral was raised to the status of a Minor Basilica in 2006. History =Foundation= St. Anthony Cathedral Basilica's roots go back to 1853 when the Catholic Church sent priests on horseback to minister to the settlers around the port of Beaumont. In 1879, Bishop Jean-Marie Odin, C.M., first bishop of the Diocese of Galveston and Fr. Vital Quinon build St. Louis Church and established the first formal Catholic parish community in Beaumont. St. Anthony Cathedral Basilica is the direct successor to this small limited seating structure and parish community. In 1901, following the Lucas Oil Boom, Bishop Nicolaus Gallagher, third bishop of Galveston and Fr. William Lee built a new and larger church to take the place of the St. Louis parish church. Bishop Gallagher changed the name of St. Louis parish community to St. Anthony. The cornerstone of St. Anthony Church was blessed in 1903.\\"Beaumont:Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica\\", Texas Heritage Commission In 1907 Bishop Gallagher dedicated the new brick church. With the inception of the Diocese of Beaumont in 1966, St. Anthony Church was elevated to the rank of a Cathedral by Pope Paul VI and Bishop Vincent Harris was installed as the first Bishop of Beaumont.McLeod, Gerald E., \\"A beautiful basilica in Beaumont\\", The Austin Chronicle, December 19, 2014 =Development= The church building has undergone many changes through the leadership of several Bishops and pastors. The first major interior restoration took place under Bishop Christopher Byrne, of the Diocese of Galveston and Monsignor E. A. Kelly in 1937. Stained-glass windows were installed throughout the church and symbolic oil paintings were added behind the altar. In 1972 Bishop Warren Boudreaux, second Bishop of Beaumont, and Monsignor M. F. Enderle began the second major renovation of this sacred site in conformity with renewal of the Sacred Liturgy following the Second Vatican Council. A free-standing altar was introduced facing the people, an appropriate bishop's chair became a permanent fixture in the sanctuary, the art in the sanctuary and throughout the Cathedral was renewed, the pews were refinished, kneelers replaced, carpeting installed, and new acoustical and lighting systems added. Extensive landscaping to the grounds was introduced, the exterior was renewed, the copper dome restored and a 2,500-pipe Wicks organ installed. Bishop Bernard Ganter, third Bishop of Beaumont and Monsignor Bennie Patillo undertook the building of a new Cathedral center and Chapel- Office Complex that was dedicated in 1991. In 1998, Bishop Joseph A. Galante, fourth Bishop of Beaumont, and Monsignor Jeremiah J. McGrath began extensive repairs of the Cathedral. At the beginning of the third millennium, Bishop Curtis J. Guillory, S.V.D., fifth Bishop of Beaumont and Monsignor McGrath began a major liturgical renovation of the Cathedral. On October 17, 2004 Bishop Guillory re-dedicated and consecrated historic Saint Anthony Cathedral. =Minor Basilica= On July 11, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI recognized the historical significance of Saint Anthony Cathedral by proclaiming it a Minor Basilica. Following a year-long Diocesan Jubilee Year celebrating the centenary of Saint Anthony Cathedral, the Papal Decree, Papal Ombrellino (Basilica Umbrella) and Papal Tintinnabulum (Basilica Bell) were solemnly installed on October 21, 2007. Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica's Papal Ombrellino (Basilica Umbrella) was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI on May 23, 2007. This half-opened umbrella is constructed of red and gold Belgium silk damask. The heraldic shields of The Holy See, Pope Benedict XVI, Bishop Curtis J. Guillory, S.V.D., the Diocese of Beaumont and the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Anthony are embroidered on the Papal Ombrellino's flaps. Referred to by a wide variety of names, such as Ombrellino and basilica pavilion, umbrellas (fully opened) were once used during Papal Processions through the streets of Rome to protect the Pope from the weather. Today the Ombrellino is used as a symbol of a minor basilica's distinct bond to the Papacy. The Ombrellino stand half-opened in minor basilicas throughout the world as a way of symbolically anticipating the arrival of the Pope at a basilica, his \\"home away from home.\\" The Cathedral Basilica's Papal Tintinnabulum, (Basilica Bell) was also blessed by Pope Benedict XVI on June 28, 2006 and was blessed a second time by the Pontiff on May 23, 2007. This elaborate bell, cast in Padua, Italy, is housed within a beautiful hand-carved gold gilded wooden Italian stanchion (post) that is decorated with the Papal Keys and Tridendum (Papal Crown), common symbols of the Pope and his pastoral ministry. Also decorating this bell stanchion are three lilies that symbolize St. Anthony's purity, the Gospel Book and flame symbolizing the eloquent preaching of St. Anthony, and four wheat stalks symbolizing the charity of St. Anthony, who fed the poor. The papal bell was once used during Papal Processions in Rome and today is used as a symbol of a minor basilica's definite union with the Pope. The Basilica holds a relic of Pope John Paul II, a zucchetto worn and signed by pope.Crum, Brooke. \\"Beaumont basilica home to relic from future saint\\", Houston Chronicle, July 7, 2013 Historic recognition The historic legacy of the Cathedral Basilica was recognized by the City of Beaumont in 1975 as a heritage site and in 1980 the Texas Historical Commission named it a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark.

Biography He studied under Pietro Francesco Mazzuchelli. He excelled in fresco painting for the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio at Milan and in different churches at Como. The Duke of Savoy chose him to finish a grand hall at Rivoli, which had been left unfinished by the death of Mazzuchelli. Bianchi was afterwards made painter to the Court, and was knighted in 1631. Between 1598 and 1601 he painted for the Cistercian monastery of the abbey of SantaMaria dell'Acquafredda above Lenno. In the following years he worked in Prague, while in 1606 he painted the chapel of the Madonna of Carmine in thechurch of Saint Stephen in Viggiu. In 1617 he completed some stuccoes and frescoes in the Royal Palace of Turin. In 1618 he completed frescoes for the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta in Santa Maria Rezzonico, while the next year he worked as an engineer in Orselina. In 1623 he completed frescoes in the Castle of Rivoli and in the next years worked in the Castle of Valentino, in the church of Monte Capucchino, in the church of St Thomas the Apostle, in the Jesuit church of the Holy Martyrs, all in Turin. He also worked in the sanctuary of the Madonna of Ghirli at Campione. After 1640 he worked in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, in the Cistercian church of San Remigio, in the church of Sant'Agostino, in the church of the monastery of Santa Marta, in the church of San Gerolamo and in the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Milan.

Diplomatic relations were formally established on 25 June 1975, soon after Mozambique gained independence from Portugal.Diplomatic Ties Between China and African Countries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China In November 2006, Mozambique became the thirteenth African country to be added to China's official list of tourism destinations. Bilateral visits Hu Jintao, president of the People's Republic of China, made an official visit to Mozambique in February 2007, during which he and Armando Guebuza, the president of Mozambique, pledged further cooperation in the areas of economy, technology, agriculture, education and sports. Shanghai and Maputo share a sister city relationship. Movement of people From 1992 to 2003, 22 Mozambicans went to China as international students. Estimates for the number of Chinese nationals residing in Mozambique ranged from 1,500 to 12,000. Human rights In June 2020, Mozambique was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations. Trade and investment China's pattern of trade with Mozambique differs from that with their major trading partners on the African continent, such as Angola, Nigeria, and Sudan. China mainly imports agricultural and fisheries products from Mozambique, but few raw materials, while exporting manufactured goods and machinery. Between 2004 and 2006, bilateral trade tripled in value from US$70 million to US$210 million, making China one of Mozambique's three largest trading partners, behind South Africa and Portugal. China has also become a major buyer of Mozambican timber; despite local regulations forbidding the export of unprocessed logs, which aim to force foreign countries hoping to gain access to Mozambican resources to invest in setting up processing facilities in the country, many logs are exported illegally. Chinese businessmen are not typically involved in the actual practise of logging; instead, it is performed mainly by locals, who then bring the logs to buyers in port cities. China has also become an increasingly important player in Mozambique's construction industry; over one-third of Mozambique's new road construction is now carried out by Chinese contractors. Contractors from other countries, who have been losing out on business due to their higher costs, complain that the Chinese contractors make no effort to transfer skills or technology to locals, and do not make use of local or regional labour subcontractors, instead preferring to import and manage their own workers. However, Chinese-run construction sites are better-organised and have a lower rate of pilferage. In the first 10 months of 2012, the value of trade was US$1.1 billion, with Mozambique being the 23rd largest trading partner of China. Development aid In addition to trade, China has begun providing development aid to Mozambique as well. The Export-Import Bank of China have made soft loans to Mozambique for infrastructure construction, for example providing US$60 million in 2006, and have twice cancelled large proportions of the country's debt to China, forgiving US$22 million in 2001 and US$30 million in 2007. They have also built a number of government buildings and public facilities free of charge, such as the national parliament building and the national stadium. According to AidData, from 2000 to 2012, there are approximately 52 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Zimbabwe through various media reports.Austin Strange, Bradley C.

Bidding process In October 2005, 30 communities put in a bid to be the site of the proposed police college (Airdrie later withdrew its bid, leaving 29 communities in Alberta vying for the college). Ten communities were cut from the list in March 2005, leaving 19 communities. Four months later, in July, it was narrowed down to four communities; Camrose, Fort Macleod, Lac La Biche and Red Deer County, and a four-person selection committee was chosen by the Alberta Government. After visiting each community and considering each of their bids, the committee chose Fort Macleod as the site of the training centre, Gordon MacIvor as the lead in the application and bid. Training centre The centre was to be built on of land in the southeast corner of Fort Macleod. It was expected to include classrooms, a library, a cafeteria, accommodations, indoor and outdoor firing ranges, a driving course and recreational areas. The town was to take care of all utilities on the land, while the college itself was to be built by a public-private partnership (P3), with an expected opening in 2010. The college was expected to provide an economic boom in Fort Macleod. Cancellation In August 2012, the Alberta Solicitor General announced that the project had been cancelled by the provincial government. It was felt that the nine-figure cost was not justified, and that the centre would not substantially improve policing quality in the province. The decision was supported by the Chiefs of Police in Alberta's two largest cities, Calgary and Edmonton.

The third line, 'sicut arx in colle sita' ('like a citadel placed on a hill': this is the literal meaning, not the one that Marshall used in his English translation) refers both to the situation of the school building on the slopes of Calton Hill and to the school crest, which shows a turreted castle on a rock.

The Turkish defeat ensured continued Nicaean hegemony of the Aegean coast of Asia Minor. The Seljuk sultan, Kaykhusraw I, was killed on the field of battle. The battle took place near the modern town of Yamalak in Kuyucak district in Aydın Province. Background Following the capture of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade (1204) and the partition of the Byzantine Empire, Theodore Laskaris (r. 1205–1222), crowned emperor in 1208, built up a power base in the former Byzantine territory of western Anatolia. This new polity was to become known as the Empire of Nicaea.. Nicaea was one of the main Greek successor states that claimed the heritage of the Byzantine Empire, the other successor states were Epirus and later the Empire of Thessalonica in western Greece. Nicaea was threatened from the north by the new Latin Empire established by the Crusaders, and from the east by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. The peace with the Seljuks was disturbed through the arrival, in early 1211, of the former Byzantine Emperor Alexios III (r. 1195–1203), at the port of Attaleia. The subsequent events are described in some detail by a number of near-contemporary sources, chiefly the chroniclers Ibn al-Athir and Ibn Bibi on the Seljuk side and the histories of George Akropolites and Nikephoros Gregoras on the Byzantine side, as well as references in other chronicles and the orations in honour of Theodore Laskaris by Niketas Choniates.. Alexios had fled Constantinople on the approach of the Crusaders in 1203, but had not given up on his rights to the throne, and was determined to reclaim it. In 1203–1205, he had wandered across Greece, seeking the support of powerful local grandees, before being captured by Boniface of Montferrat and held captive until ransomed by his first cousin, Michael of Epirus, in 1210.. Although Theodore Laskaris was Alexios's son-in-law, having married his daughter Anna, Alexios resolved to seek the aid of the Seljuk sultan, Kaykhusraw I (r. 1192–1196 and 1205–1211), with whom he had close relations: Alexios had sheltered him in Constantinople during the latter's exile, and George Akropolites claims that the two fled from Constantinople together in 1203... The sultan welcomed Alexios warmly, and the deposed emperor, after reminding the sultan of the succour he had given him, promised him rich rewards if he would help restore him to his throne. Kaykhusraw, having found in supporting Alexios's cause a perfect pretext for attacking Nicaean territory, sent an emissary to Theodore at Nicaea, calling upon him to relinquish his domains to the legitimate emperor. Theodore refused to reply to the sultan's demands, and the sultan assembled his army and invaded Laskaris' domains... Battle Theodore I Laskaris (r. 1205–1222), 15th-century manuscript. Kaykhusraw's army, with Alexios III in tow, laid siege to Antioch on the Maeander, which he hoped to use as a base to subdue the rest of the Meander Valley. The size of the Seljuk force is unknown. The hagiographer George of Pelagonia in his hagiography estimates it at 60,000, clearly an impossible figure, and even Gregoras's 20,000 seems to be exaggerated. Nevertheless, it was clearly a considerably larger force than the army Theodore managed to scrape together: both Gregoras and Akropolites put it at 2,000 men (3,000 according to George of Pelagonia), of whom 800 were Latin and the rest Byzantine Greeks... Laskaris marched his army from Nicaea over the Mysian Olympus and reached Philadelphia in eleven days (indeed, the Seljuk chroniclers name Philadelphia rather than Antioch as the site of the battle..) There he learned that Antioch was about to fall, and led his army in a forced march towards the town, discarding all baggage except for a few days' rations.. According to Gregoras, Laskaris intended to catch the Turks off guard by his rapid approach, but Akropolites relates that the Nicaean ruler sent Kaykhusraw's ambassador, whom he had taken along, to inform his master of his arrival. The sultan at first appeared incredulous, but eventually abandoned the siege and drew up his forces for battle.. The Turks were constrained by the narrowness of the valley and could not deploy their full force, especially their cavalry. Hence, the sultan decided to await the Nicaean attack instead. As the Nicaean army drew close to the Turks, Laskaris's Latin mercenary cavalry launched an impetuous charge on the Turkish centre; their attack inflicted many casualties on the Turks, in particular the lightly armed archers and slingers, as the knights drove through their formation and then wheeled back and charged it again from the rear. Kaykhusraw, however, soon managed to restore discipline among his troops, shaken by the sudden Latin onslaught, and used his superior numbers to surround and annihilate the Latins. The Turks then turned on the rest of the Nicaean army, which, after suffering casualties, began to retreat and break up... As the sources narrate, at this moment of victory, the Seljuk sultan sought out Laskaris, who was hard pressed by the attacking Turkish troops. Kaykhusraw charged his enemy and gave him a heavy blow on the head with a mace, so that the Nicaean emperor, dizzied, fell from his horse. Kaykhusraw was already giving orders to his retinue to carry Laskaris away, when the latter regained his composure and brought Kaykhusraw down by hacking at his mount's rear legs. The sultan too fell on the ground and was beheaded. His head was impaled on a lance and hoisted aloft for his army to see, causing the Turks to panic and retreat. It is unclear who delivered the fatal blow to the sultan: Choniates and Gregoras attribute this deed to Laskaris himself, Ibn Bibi to an unknown Frankish mercenary; Akropolites says that neither the emperor nor his attendants saw who did this, while George of Pelagonia claims that Kaykhusraw and not Laskaris was unhorsed first, and that one of the emperor's attendants cut off his head. Though the Turks retreated, allegedly at speed, the Nicaean army was so depleted in numbers that it could not mount a pursuit..  Aftermath  In this way Laskaris snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, although his own army was well-nigh destroyed in the process. The battle ended the Seljuk threat: Kaykhusraw's son and successor, Kaykaus I, concluded a truce with Nicaea on 14 June 1211, and the border between the two states would remain virtually unchallenged until the 1260s.. The former emperor Alexios, Laskaris's father-in-law, was also captured during the battle. Laskaris treated him well but stripped him of his imperial insignia and consigned him to the monastery of Hyakinthos in Nicaea, where he ended his days. Following the battle, the Turks carried the body of their sultan back to Konya, where he was buried in the dynastic mausoleum.: \\"The importance to the Seljuks of burial in the tomb tower in Konya is well known, and is graphically illustrated by the care taken to reinter the body of Giyaseddin Keyhusrev in Konya after he was killed by the troops of Theodore Lascaris after the battle of Alaşehir.\\" Ibn Bibi relates that Theodore Laskaris gave 20,000 dirhams to be distributed at the sultan's funeral as alms.. The battle freed Nicaea from Seljuk pressure, but Laskaris's army had suffered heavy casualties. In particular, his very effective, though headstrong, Latin mercenary cavalry had been almost destroyed. As a result, Laskaris could not adequately defend his territory from an attack by the Latin Empire of Constantinople; defeated at the Battle of the Rhyndacus, he had to cede some territory bordering the Sea of Marmara. The Nicaeans were compensated for this territorial loss when, in 1212, the death of David Komnenos allowed their annexation of his lands in Paphlagonia. The victory at Antioch on the Meander gave Laskaris considerable prestige, and the capture of Alexios ended internal opposition to his rule. The battle was the last major encounter between the Seljuks and the Byzantines. Ultimately, the Seljuks had failed to take all of Asia Minor. However, even though the Nicaean Empire would strengthen (at the cost of the Latins) and the Seljuks would weaken, the Turks, under Ottoman leadership, would ultimately conquer Byzantine Asia Minor a little over 100 years later.

Also displayed are several salo (3-stringed fiddles) and a drum. The sueng (, Burmese: ၄ကြိုးထပ်ပို (ဆီုင်), , also spelled seung or süng) is a plucked fretted lute from the northern region of Thailand. The instrument is made from hardwood and its strings (numbering either four or six and arranged in courses of two) are most often made of steel wire. It has nine bamboo frets. The sueng is part of a northern Thai traditional ensemble called the salo-so (saw)-sueng ensemble, along with the salo (3-string spike fiddle) and pi so (free reed pipe). The sueng is similar to the grajabpi (กระจับปี่), an ancient Thai instrument that is used in the classical music of central Thailand. Lai Thai motifs on a Sueng body Construction Most suengs are made from a single piece of Jackfruit wood, carved into shape by the artisan. Once carved, a round sound board of the same wood is glued to the instrument. Trapezoid shaped sticks are cut form a bamboo stem and installed as frets. The tuning pegs are then installed: this pegs only have an aestethic function nowadays, as many modern suengs rely on guitar machine heads for tuning. Eventually the instrument is painted and sometimes decorated with Lai Thai motifs. The bridge can be made from either bone or hardwood. Other woods used for the construction of the sueng are Rosewood and Teak. Sound The frets on the sueng are spaced differently than western fretted instruments. In fact, with such arrangement of frets, the instrument plays in the 7-TET temperament, meaning that in one octave the instrument plays seven tones, as opposed to the twelve tones of western music.

United States, 348 U.S. 397 (1955), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a Jehovah's Witness was denied fair hearing because of failure to supply him with materials in his record. Background Petitioner Simmons registered in the Selective Service System in 1948 and was employed as a chauffeur at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. He was classified 1-A. Simmons married in 1949 and received a dependency deferment which lasted from 1951 through 1955, at which point he was again classified 1-A. During his deferment, Simmons became an ordained minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses and filed the special form for conscientious objectors, claiming exception from both combatant and non- combatant service. He appeared in person before his local board seeking exemption as a minister, but the board maintained his 1-A classification and, after an unsuccessful appeal, referred the case to the Department of Justice. Following an investigation by the FBI, Simmons appeared at another hearing. While no notice for the hearing existed, similar forms used at the time state that the hearing officer would advise the registrant \\"as to the general nature and character\\" of adverse evidence in the FBI report if that information was requested. Evidence for this request was never found from before the hearing, but the request was made at the hearing. The hearing officer recommended that Simmons remain classified 1-A because his religious activities coincided with pressure from the draft board. In appealing to an Appeal Board, the Department of Justice adopted the recommendation of the hearing officer because of the timing of Simmons' religious activities and alleged abuse toward his wife (evidence for which was presumably gathered by the FBI). The Appeal Board continued the 1-A classification, but Simmons refused to submit to induction and prosecution followed. Simmons claimed he had not been given a fair summary of the FBI report and secured a subpoena duces tecum requiring production of the report. The subpoena was quashed on motion of the government, Simmons was convicted, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed. Opinion Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court. Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act provides that the Department of Justice must hold a hearing \\"with respect to the character and good faith\\" of any claimed conscientious objections. In a prior case (United States v. Nugent, ), relying on the availability of a summary of reports, the Court held that the Department satisfies its duties \\"when it accords a fair opportunity to the registrant to speak his piece before an impartial hearing officer; when it permits him to produce all relevant evidence in his own behalf and at the same time supplies him with a fair resume of any adverse evidence in the investigator's report.\\" This is viewed as an essential element in the processing of conscientious objector claims, not a matter of grace within the Department's discretion. Dissents Though no formal dissent can be found, it is noted at the end of the opinion that Justice Reed would affirm the judgement of the Seventh Circuit on the grounds that no such summary was requested (by the petitioner) and, because of that, it was not necessary to furnish more to the registrant than was given by the hearing officer. Justice Minton also dissented, arguing that even if a fair resume from the FBI was denied, it was not done arbitrarily and that the judgement of the board in doing so was, though erroneous, certainly allowable.

A flanker, he won 38 full caps for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, between 1959 and 1968, scoring nine tries. During the 1960s he had a status in New Zealand rugby comparable to that of his teammate, Colin Meads. Biography Born in Auckland on 21 February 1938, Tremain was educated at Auckland Grammar School, where he played in the 1st XV rugby team in 1954 and 1955. After leaving school, he became an agricultural field cadet, which took him all over the country, including stints studying at Massey and Canterbury Agricultural Colleges. As a result, he played for five different provincial teams: , , , , and . It was with the latter team that he made the greatest contribution, appearing in 96 games between 1962 and 1970, and becoming team captain. Tremain made two appearances for the South Island and seven for the North Island in interisland matches, and was captain of the New Zealand Universities side that toured North America in 1961. He made his All Blacks debut in 1959, playing in three tests against the touring British and Irish Lions. After touring with the New Zealand team to Australia and South Africa in 1960, Tremain was generally regarded as an automatic selection for the team, and he gained a status alongside his contemporary, Colin Meads, as one of the greats of New Zealand rugby. He continued playing for New Zealand until 1968, captaining the side in three matches in his final year. He was controversially omitted from the team in 1969. In all, Tremain played 86 matches for the All Blacks—38 of them full internationals—and scored 108 points (36 tries), including nine Test tries. A prolific scorer, Tremain scored 136 tries in his 268 first-class appearances. After retiring as a player, Tremain served the game as an administrator. He was chairman of the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union between 1985 and 1990 and a member of the New Zealand Rugby Union council from 1990. Tremain died in Napier on 2 May 1992. His sons include Chris Tremain, who served as the Member of Parliament for Napier between 2005 and 2014, and Simon Tremain, who represented , and Hawke's Bay in rugby union. Legacy Tremain has been inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. The Kelvin Tremain Memorial Trophy, named in his memory, is awarded annually to New Zealand's outstanding rugby player of the year. In 1986, Tremain and Russell Pettigrew founded the New Zealand Rugby Foundation, which assists seriously injured rugby players.

By randomly expressing different ratios of red, green, and blue derivatives of green fluorescent protein in individual neurons, it is possible to flag each neuron with a distinctive color. This process has been a major contribution to the field of connectomics, traditionally known as hodology, which is the study of neural connections in the brain. The technique was originally developed in 2007 by a team led by Jeff W. Lichtman and Joshua R. Sanes, both at Harvard University. The original technique has recently been adapted for use with other model organisms including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans', and Arabidopsis thaliana. While earlier labeling techniques allowed for the mapping of only a few neurons, this new method allows more than 100 differently mapped neurons to be simultaneously and differentially illuminated in this manner. The resulting images can be quite striking and have won awards in science photography competitions.  History and development  A brainbow of mouse neurons from Smith, 2007 The Brainbow neuroimaging technique was initially developed by a team of researchers at Harvard University in 2007. At the time they were working at Washington University in St. Louis. This particular group of scientists was led by professors Jeff W. Lichtman and Joshua R. Sanes, both of whom specialize in molecular and cellular biology and are highly renowned for their work. The team constructed Brainbow using a two- step process: first, a specific genetic construct was generated that could be recombined in multiple arrangements to produce one of either three or four colors based on the particular fluorescent proteins (XFPs) being implemented. Next, multiple copies of the same transgenic construct were inserted into the genome of the target species, resulting in the random expression of different XFP ratios and subsequently causing different cells to exhibit a variety of colorful hues. Brainbow was originally created as an improvement over more traditional neuroimaging techniques, such as Golgi staining and dye injection, both of which presented severe limitations to researchers in their ability to visualize the intricate architecture of neural circuitry in the brain. While older techniques were only able to stain cells with a constricted range of colors, often utilizing bi- and tri-color transgenic mice to unveil limited information in regards to neuronal structures, Brainbow is much more flexible in that it has the capacity to fluorescently label individual neurons with up to approximately 100 different hues so that scientists can identify and even differentiate between dendritic and axonal processes. By revealing such detailed information about neuronal connectivity and patterns, sometimes even in vivo, scientists are often able to infer information regarding neuronal interactions and their subsequent impact upon behavior and function. Thus, Brainbow filled the void left by previous neuroimaging methods. With the recent advent of Brainbow in neuroscience, researchers are now able to construct specific maps of neural circuits and better investigate how these relate to various mental activities and their connected behaviors (i.e. Brainbow reveals information about the interconnections between neurons and their subsequent interactions that affect overall brain functionality). As a further extrapolation of this method, Brainbow can therefore also be used to study both neurological and psychological disorders by analyzing differences in neural maps. Methods Three copies of the genetic construct allow for the expression of multiple fluorophore color combinations. Lawson Kurtz et al. / Duke University The basic Brainbow1 genetic construct. Lawson Kurtz et al. / Duke University Brainbow techniques rely on the Cre-Lox recombination, in which the protein Cre recombinase drives inversion or excision of DNA between loxP sites. The original Brainbow method includes both Brainbow-1 and Brainbow-2, which utilize different forms of cre/lox recombination. Brainbow-3, a modified version of Brainbow-1, was developed in 2013. For all Brainbow subtypes, the expression of a given XFP is a stochastic, or random, event. Brainbow-1 uses DNA constructs with different fluorescent protein genes (XFPs) separated by mutant and canonical forms of loxP. This creates a set of mutually exclusive excision possibilities, since cre-mediated recombination occurs only between identical loxP sites. After recombination occurs, the fluorescent protein that is left directly after the promoter is uniquely expressed. Thus, a construct with four XFPs separated by three different loxP sites, three excision events, and the original construct can produce four different fluorescent proteins. Brainbow-2 uses Cre excision and inversion to allow multiple expression possibilities in a given construct. In one DNA segment with two oppositely oriented XFPs, Cre will induce a random inversion event that leaves one fluorescent protein in the proper orientation for expression. If two of these invertible sequences are aligned, three different inversion events are possible. When excision events are also considered, one of four fluorescent proteins will be expressed for a given combination of Cre excisions and inversions. Brainbow-3 retains the Brainbow-1 loxP format, but replaces the RFP, YFP, and CFP genes with mOrange2, EGFP, and mKate2. mO2, EGFP, and mK2 were chosen both because their fluorescent excitation and emission spectra overlap minimally, and because they share minimal sequence homology, allowing for the design of selective antibodies that can be used to detect them in immunohistochemical protocols. Brainbow-3 also addresses the issue of uneven filling of neurons with XFPs by using farnesylated derivatives of the XFPs, which are more evenly trafficked to neuronal membranes. Brainbow is implemented in vivo by crossing two transgenic organism strains: one that expresses the Cre protein and another that has been transfected with several versions of a loxP/XFP construct. Using multiple copies of the transgene allows the XFPs to combine in a way that can give one of approximately 100 different colors. Thus, each neuron is labeled with a different hue based on its given combinatorial and stochastic expression of fluorescent proteins. In order to elucidate differential XFP expression patterns into a visible form, brain slices are imaged with confocal microscopy. When exposed to a photon with its particular excitation wavelength, each fluorophore emits a signal that is collected into a red, green, or blue channel, and the resultant light combination is analyzed with data analysis software. Superimposition of differentially colored neurons allows visual disentanglement of complicated neural circuits. Brainbow has predominantly been tested in mice to date; however, the basic technique described above has also been modified for use in more recent studies since the advent of the original method introduced in 2007. = Mice = tractographical images of similar neurons (Chédotal and Richards, 2010) The mouse brain has 75,000,000 neurons and is more similar to a human brain than drosophila and other commonly used organisms to model this technique, such as C. elegans. Mice were the first organisms in which the Brainbow method of neuroimaging was successfully employed. Livet et al. (2007) developed two versions of Brainbow mice using Brainbow-1 and Brainbow-2, which are described above. In using these methods to create a complete map and track the axons of a mouse muscle, it is necessary to collect tens of thousands of images and compile them into stacks to create a complete schematic. It is then possible to trace each motor axon and its synaptic contacts to construct a complete connectome of the muscle. More examples of neurons examined using the Brainbow technique in transgenic mice are located in the motor nerve innervating ear muscles, axon tracts in the brainstem, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. = Drosophila = The complexity of the Drosophila brain, consisting of about 100,000 neurons, makes it an excellent candidate for implementing neurophysiology and neuroscience techniques like Brainbow. In fact, Stefanie Hampel et al. (2011) combined Brainbow in conjunction with genetic targeting tools to identify individual neurons within the Drosophila brain and various neuronal lineages. One of the genetic targeting tools was a GAL4/UAS binary expression system that controls the expression of UAS-Brainbow and targets the expression to small groups of neurons. Utilizing ‘Flip Out’ methods increased the cellular resolution of the reporter construct. The expression of fluorescent proteins, as with the original Brainbow, depended on Cre recombination corresponding with matched lox sites. Hampel et al. (2011) also developed their own variation of Brainbow (dBrainbow), based on antibody labeling of epitopes rather than endogenous fluorescence. Two copies of their construct yield six bright, separable colors. This, along with simplifications in color assignment, enabled them to observe the trajectories of each neuron over long distances. Specifically, they traced motor neurons from the antennal lobe to neuromuscular junctions, allowing them to identify the specific muscle targets of individual neurons. Ultimately, this technique provides the ability to efficaciously map the neuronal circuitry in Drosophila so that researchers are able to uncover more information about the brain structure of this invertebrate and how it relates to its ensuing behavior.  Limitations  As with any neuroimaging technique, Brainbow has a number of limitations that stem from the methods required to perform it. For example, the process of breeding at least two strains of transgenic animals from embryonic stem cells is both time consuming and complex. Even if two transgenic species are successfully created, not all of their offspring will show the recombination. Thus, this requires extensive planning prior to performing an experiment. In addition, due to the random nature in the expression of the fluorescent proteins, scientists are unable to precisely control the labeling of neural circuitry, which may result in the poor identification of specific neurons. The use of brainbow in mammalian populations is also hampered by the incredible diversity of neurons of the central nervous system. The sheer density of neurons coupled with the presence of long tracts of axons make viewing larger regions of the CNS with high resolution difficult. Brainbow is most useful when examining single cell resolution against the background of a complex multicellular environment. However, due to the resolution limits of optical microscopy, conclusive identification of synaptic connections between neurons is not easily accomplished. This issue is somewhat avoided by the use of synaptic markers to supplement the use of optical microscopy in viewing synaptic connections.

Elected at the age of 37, Bankole is the youngest Speaker in the history of the House and 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election candidate under the platform of Action Democratic Party. Early life, Education and Career A Yoruba of aristocratic background, he was a businessman before being elected to the House. A Muslim Egba, Bankole was born in Abeokuta in what is now Ogun State on 14 November 1969. His parents are Alani Bankole, a businessman, former National Vice-Chairman and acting Chairman of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and holder of the chieftaincy titles of the Oluwo of Iporo Ake and the Seriki Jagunmolu of Egbaland, and one of his wives, Atinuke Bankole, who was herself the Ekerin Iyalode of Egbaland. Newspaper Thisday identifies Bankole's education as such: Baptist Boys' High School, Abeokuta starting 1979; Albany College, London, England, starting 1985; University of Reading, Reading, England, starting 1989; short course at University of Oxford's Officer Training College, Oxford, England, in 1991; and Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, in 2005. Bankole obtained a Master of Public Administration degree from John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, USA in 2005. . In 2014, he became a Mason Fellow in Public Policy and Management at John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, USA. In 1991, Bankole passed D.A.B selection into Royal Military Academy Sandhurst while taking courses for military officers at Oxford University where he was in the Artillery Corps. Bankole is a polo player, and is a member of the Lagos Polo Club and the Guards Polo Club, Abuja with defence as his preferred position. He also enjoys football. Private Sector An economist, Bankole is Chairman, Aspire Integrated Consultants Nigeria (since 2012) and Vice President, Africa House London (since 2016). Previously, Bankole was a Director of Freight Agencies Nigeria Limited from 1995 until 1998, Executive Director of Operations of West African Aluminium Products Limited from 1998 until 2004, and Director of ASAP Limited from 2000 until 2003. Public Sector - House of Representatives of Nigeria In 2002, Bankole was elected to the House of Representatives on the People's Democratic Party (PDP) ticket to represent the Abeokuta South Federal Constituency of Ogun State. He was Deputy Chairman of the House Committee on Finance while Aminu Bello Masari was Speaker, (Farouk Lawan was Chairman of the committee) and was also previously Chairman of the House Committee on Land Transport. Other committees he has sat on are the panels on Defence, Internal Affairs and Banking, and Currency. Bankole was re-elected in April 2007. He considers his legislative interests to be those related to defence and finance. =Speaker of the House= In September 2007, a committee questioned Speaker Patricia Etteh about spending the sum of ₦628 million ($4.8m) on home renovation and automobiles. She denied wrongdoing, but many representatives were unhappy with her attempts to defend herself, blows were traded on the floor of the House, and Etteh had to be escorted from the chamber. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and many top PDP members continued to back her, but a large segment of the party, led by Lawan and including Bankole, called for her resignation. It was reported that Bankole, among multiple other contenders, hoped to succeed her as early as 5 October 2007. After Etteh's resignation from the post on 30 October (along with her deputy, who was also caught up in the scandal), Integrity Group (anti-Etteh) member Terngu Tsegba became interim speaker. Nomination On 1 November, he was elected to succeed Etteh. The election began at 10.30am. The House was short of the statutory 360 members because three (Moses Segun Oladimeji, Joe Anota and Aminu Shuaibu Safana) died. Two constituencies were yet to elect their representatives. 328 of the 355 members voted. Samson Osagie of Edo State nominated Bankole for the post of Speaker, and Lynda Ikpeazu of Anambra State seconded the proposal. His challenger was Osun State Representative George Jolaoye, whom he beat by 304 votes to 20 (and 4 abstentions). Etteh was among those who voted against Bankole. The new deputy speaker was Usman Bayero Nafada. Bankole was declared speaker at 1.30pm. In his acceptance speech, entitled \\"We Stand Upon The Threshold of History\\", Bankole said \\"I am taking over the mantle of leadership at a very difficult time. But these are hard times, we need to build confidence again and assure the populace that we are still their representatives. I want an independent house that Nigerians will be proud of, this is my first task.\\" Tenure One week after his election, political opponents claimed that Bankole had not completed his National Youth Service Corps (N.Y.S.C) service, which is mandatory for all Nigerian university graduates under thirty years of age when they graduate, and called for his resignation over the issue. Bankole provided his N.Y.S.C discharge certificate, ending the rumour. On 22 June 2010 Bankole suspended 11 members of parliament indefinitely for disorderliness and fighting in the house.The Guardian newspaper, Thursday, 24 June 2010, page 8 Return of Unspent Funds by Government Ministries During his tenure, the House of Representatives as a result of performance of its oversight function ensured that Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA's) returned unspent budgeted funds amounting to about 450 billion naira to the government treasury in 2007 while about 350 billion naira was again recovered in 2008. In total, the House of Representatives ensured the return of about 1 trillion naira unspent funds by MDA's as part of the annual budgetary process under Bankole's speakership. These were unprecedented in the history of oversight in Nigeria’s legislature. Up until then, MDA's did not return unspent funds. Also, the House of Representatives discovered that about 5 trillion Naira generated revenue were never remitted by MDA's for the past 5 years before investigation. Termination of Inflated Abuja Runway Contract Under Bankole, the 64 billion naira contract for the second runway for the Nnamdi Azikwe Airport in Abuja was investigated and found to be grossly inflated. The contract was thus terminated by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Bills Under him, the House of Representatives accepted 328 motions, approved 282 resolutions and passed 136 bills. These bills include the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act which ensured that all revenue-generating agencies of government present their budgets for scrutiny every year. The agencies, which include the CBN, NNPC and Customs spent trillions of naira yearly without appropriation by the National Assembly. =Trial= In 2011, Bankole was tried by Nigeria's anti-corruption agency and was cleared of all charges.

Oxford University Press blog. http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/prentice/ which is a movement in which people seek to eat locally grown foods, often defined as those available within a 100-mile radius. Food activism Prentice has become a prominent activist for local eating, although she takes a pragmatic rather than a doctrinaire view, seeing it as an educational exercise in \\"consciousness raising\\" rather than a necessary or sufficient solution to problems of modern food production and consumption. She co-founded the Three Stone Hearth project in Berkeley, California, which seeks to provide homecooked-style food to subscribers too busy to cook for themselves every day; it has spread to Illinois, New York state, and Minnesota and inspired similar projects in Canada. She is the author of Full Moon Feast: Food and the Hunger for Connection, which combines essays arguing for local eating with recipes for local seasonal recipes matching the 13 lunar months of the year. Biography She starred as Pepper McKenzie on the popular 1982 children's television show Powerhouse, which aired on PBS and was later rerun by Nickelodeon. Her interest in food began when she became a vegetarian at the age of 14, although she subsequently started eating meat again. She worked as director of education programs at the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture in San Francisco. In 1996, she completed the professional Chef’s Training at the Natural Gourmet Institute in New York City. Criticism John Mariani has claimed that the concept of a locavore diet is nothing new, being similar to the ideas of Stewart Brand, Frances Moore Lappé, and others. A study by Christopher Weber found that eating locally as proposed by Prentice made no difference to greenhouse gas emissions—although that may not be the chief aim of locavores. She has also been criticized by vegans for promoting meat eating.

Texas, 326 U.S. 517 (1946), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state statute making it an offense to distribute literature in a federal government-owned town was an improper restriction on freedom of the press and religion.. Background =History= Tucker was an ordained minister of the group known as Jehovah's Witnesses. In accordance with the practices of this group he called on people from door to door, presenting his religious views to those willing to listen, and distributes religious literature to those willing to receive it. In the course of his work, he went to the Hondo Navigation Village located on the Hondo Army Airfield in Medina County, Texas. The village was owned by the United States under a Congressional program which was designed to provide housing for persons engaged in National Defense activities. According to all indications the village was freely accessible and open to the public and had the characteristics of a typical American town. The Federal Public Housing Authority had placed the buildings in charge of a manager whose duty it was to rent the houses, collect the rents, and generally to supervise operations, subject to over-all control by the Authority. He ordered Tucker to discontinue all religious activities in the village. Tucker refused. Later the manager ordered Tucker to leave the village. Insisting that the manager had no right to suppress religious activities, appellant declined to leave, and his arrest followed. At the trial the manager testified that the controlling Federal agency had given him full authority to regulate the conduct of those living in the village, and that he did not allow preaching by ministers of any denomination without a permit issued by him in his discretion. He thought this broad authority was entrusted to him, at least in part, by a regulation, which the Authority's Washington office had allegedly promulgated. He testified that this regulation provided that no peddlers or hawkers could come into or remain in the village without getting permission from the manager. =Lower courts= Tucker was charged in the Justice Court of Medina County with violating Article 479, Chap. 3 of the Texas Penal Code which makes it an offense for any 'peddler or hawker of goods or merchandise' willfully to refuse to leave premises after having been notified to do so by the owner or possessor thereof. Tucker argued that he was not peddler or hawker of merchandise, but a minister of the gospel engaged in the distribution of religious literature to willing recipients. He contended that to construe the Texas statute as applicable to his activities would, to that extent, bring it into conflict with the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of press and religion. His contention was rejected and he was convicted. On appeal to the Medina County Court, his Constitutional argument was again overruled. =Direct appeal to U.S. Supreme Court= At the time, Texas law did not provide for a subsequent appeal to a higher state court. Under 28 U.S.C. 344(a) (now at ), the United States Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal when there is no higher state court authorized to review the case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case. Opinion of the Court Justice Hugo Black, author of majority opinion Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court. Black referred to Marsh v. Alabama, Marsh v. Alabama, which was decided during the same term. In that case, the court had held that a state trespassing statute could not be used to prevent the distribution of religious literature by requiring a permit in a company town. Black noted that the only difference here was that the Marsh case involved a privately owned town and the current case involved a town owned by the federal government. Black allowed that there might be a case where it might be proper for security reasons to prohibit outsiders from entering such a housing area, but that did not apply in this case. The case was reversed and remanded. =Concurrence= Justice Felix Frankfurter, author of concurring opinion Justice Felix Frankfurter issued a concurring opinion. Frankfurter noted that since the town was owned by the government rather than a private company, the government was held a higher requirement not to infringe on basic freedoms than a company. He also noted that this did not involve an act of Congress. =Dissent= Justice Harlan Stone, author of dissenting opinion Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone, Justice Stanley F. Reed and Justice Harold H. Burton construed this case as showing a conviction for refusing, at the request of its authorized agent, to leave premises which are owned by the United States and which have not been shown to be dedicated to general use by the public. They, therefore, would have upheld the conviction for the reasons given in the dissent in Marsh. Subsequent developments This case was one of a series of cases known as the Jehovah's Witnesses cases that clarified the Free Exercise Clause. Those cases were heard primarily from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s.McAninch, William Shepard (1987), \\"A Catalyst for the Evolution of Constitutional Law: Jehovah's Witnesses in the Supreme Court\\", University of Cincinnati Law Review, 55 U. Cin. L. Rev. 997 These cases also had a major role in enforcing the Bill of Rights against the states via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Like Tucker, most of these cases dealt with the distribution of religious literature and door-to-door preaching. Prior to these cases, the court had applied the clear and present danger test developed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to constitutional issues, but beginning with these cases, they begin to apply the strict scrutiny test.Flynn, Patrick J.

He is ignored by the Georgian historic tradition, but mentioned by the 4th- century historian of the Roman Empire, Ammianus Marcellinus. He was the first son of Rev II to Salome and brother of Trdat of Iberia. Saurmag seems to have succeeded on the death of his paternal grandfather, Mirian III, the first Christian king of Iberia, in 361 and pursued pro-Roman policy. In 363, he was ousted by the Sassanid king Shapur II who installed Aspacures II (Varaz-Bakur) in his place. Aspacures II was Saurmag's paternal uncle. The Sassanid intervention in the Caucasus eventually drew a Roman response and, later in 370, Roman Emperor Valens sent in the twelve legions—about 12,000 men—under Terentius who restored Saurmag in the western provinces of Iberia adjoining Armenia and Lazica, while Aspacures' successor Mihrdat III was permitted to retain control of the northeastern part of the kingdom. The deal was not recognized by Shapur, who regarded it as grounds for war, and resumed hostilities against Rome early in 371.Lenski, Noel Emmanuel (2002), Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p. 175. University of California Press, .

Background  Since 1969 New Hampshire had required that noncommercial vehicles bear license plates embossed with the state motto, \\"Live Free or Die\\".1 N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 263:1 (Supp. 1975) Another New Hampshire statute made it a misdemeanor \\"knowingly [to obscure] ... the figures or letters on any number plate\\".N. H. Rev. Stat.

H. 332, 295 A. 2d 454 (1972)  Facts of the case  George Maynard and his wife, followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, viewed the motto as repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and for this reason, they covered up the motto on the license plates of their jointly owned family automobiles. On November 27, 1974, Maynard was issued a citation for violating the state statutes regarding obscuring of the state motto.  Prior history  On December 6, 1974, Maynard appeared pro se in Lebanon District Court to answer the charge. After waiving his right to counsel, he entered a plea of not guilty and proceeded to explain his religious objections to the motto. religious training and belief, I believe my 'government – Jehovah's Kingdom – offers everlasting life. It would be contrary to that belief to give up my life for the state, even if it meant living in bondage. ... slogan is directly at odds with my deeply held religious convictions ... I also disagree with the motto on political grounds. I believe that life is more precious than freedom.\\" The state trial judge expressed sympathy for Maynard's situation, but considered himself bound by the authority of State v. Hoskin, 112 N.H. 332 (1972),State v. Hoskin, 112 N.H. 332 (1972), a decision by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire: http://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/1972/6354-0.html to hold Maynard guilty. The court imposed a $25 fine, but suspended it during \\"good behavior\\". On December 28, 1974, Maynard was again charged with violating 262:27-c. He appeared in court on January 31, 1975, and again chose to represent himself; he was found guilty, fined $50, and sentenced to six months in the Grafton County House of Corrections. The court suspended this jail sentence but ordered Maynard to also pay the $25 fine for the first offense. Maynard informed the court that, as a matter of conscience, he refused to pay the two fines. The court thereupon sentenced him to jail for a period of 15 days. He served the full sentence. Prior to trial on the second offense Maynard was charged with yet a third violation of 262:27-c on January 3, 1975. He appeared on this complaint on the same day as for the second offense, and was, again, found guilty. This conviction was \\"continued for sentence\\" so that Maynard received no punishment in addition to the 15 days. On March 4, 1975, the Maynards sued in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 262:27-c, 263:1, insofar as these required displaying the state motto on their vehicle license plates, and made it a criminal offense to obscure the motto. On March 11, 1975, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order against further arrests and prosecutions of the Maynards. Because the appellees sought an injunction against a state statute on grounds of its unconstitutionality, a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281. Following a hearing on the merits, the District Court entered an order enjoining the State \\"from arresting and prosecuting [the Maynards] at any time in the future for covering over that portion of their license plates that contains the motto 'Live Free or Die. The Governor of New Hampshire chose to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, and it accepted the case. Decision of the court In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally require citizens to display the state motto upon their vehicle license plates. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, found that the statute in question effectively required individuals to \\"use their private property as a 'mobile billboard' for the State's ideological message\\". The Court held that the State's interests in requiring the motto did not outweigh free speech principles under the First Amendment, including \\"the right of individuals to hold a point of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster ... an idea they find morally objectionable\\". The state's interest in motor vehicle identification could be achieved by \\"less drastic means\\", and its interest in fostering state pride was not viewpoint-neutral. =Dissents= Justice Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun joined. Rehnquist wrote that > For First Amendment principles to be implicated, the State must place the > citizen in the position of either apparently or actually \\"asserting as true\\" > the message.

History People milling around the entrance of the Brisbane Stadium, circa 1925 The Festival Hall was originally known as Brisbane Stadium, which was built in 1910. In addition to its primary use as a venue to watch boxing, the Brisbane Stadium was also a venue for live concerts. Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole and Johnnie Ray played there in the 1950s. In 1958, the venue was demolished and a new building constructed, by then leading Queensland Construction Company E.J.Taylor & Sons, as part of the Centenary of Queensland. It was opened on 27 April 1959 and renamed Festival Hall. With a capacity of 4,000 people, it was the largest indoor public venue, in the Brisbane inner city area and it remained the city's primary indoor venue for more than forty years. It was designed in a postwar modern style, similar to its namesake, the Royal Festival Hall in London. Sports Like similar venues in other Australian cities, Festival Hall originally had been built as a boxing stadium, but as the popularity of boxing and wrestling waned after the introduction of television, it began to be used more often for other forms of entertainment, including the imported American sports craze \\"Roller Derby\\", and as a venue for concerts and theatrical presentations. Boxing events for the 1982 Commonwealth Games were held at Festival Hall. Also, many professional boxing events were held at the Festival Hall, including a number headlined by Australian boxing legend Hector Thompson. Performances Brisbane Festival Hall hosted performances for virtually every major tour by visiting overseas artists. On 28 June 1964, The Beatles played the first of four concerts at the venue. Other well known performers who entertained at Festival Hall include The Bee Gees, Ray Charles, The Easybeats, The Kinks, The Seekers, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Eric Burdon & The Animals, The Yardbirds, The Who, The Small Faces, Led Zeppelin, Santana, Osibisa, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Slade, Fleetwood Mac, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, The Ramones, Bob Marley & the Wailers (18 April 1979), Gary Numan, The Police, INXS, Madness, The Cure, Public Image Limited, Hoodoo Gurus, Nirvana, Ravi Shankar , Fugazi, Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, Pantera, U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tool, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemonheads, Faith No More, You Am I, Powderfinger, Moby, Groove Armada, Stone Roses, Björk, Sex Pistols, The Prodigy, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Public Enemy, Regurgitator, Portishead, Massive Attack, Radiohead, Beck, The Chemical Brothers, Blondie. Some early performances were done by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and the Bolshoi Ballet. The Police were scheduled to perform during The Police Around the World Tour on 24 March 1980, but the show was cancelled. The final concert held there, Michael Franti and Spearhead, took place on 9 August 2003. Redevelopment Brisbane Festival Hall closed on 29 August 2003, and the building was subsequently sold and demolished to make way for an apartment development known as Festival Towers. The seats from the venue were sold off as souvenirs in lots of three. Legacy Devine Limited, developers of the Festival Towers apartment building, subsequently commissioned the Queensland Performing Arts Centre's Performing Arts Museum to design and install a \\"Walk of Fame\\" display commemorating the history of the site. Located within the entry lobby of Festival Towers, the display consists of a wall-mounted installation of backlit panels, incorporating original seatbacks from Festival Hall, with images of performers and other significant figures in the Festival Hall story. Other smaller panels feature photographs and history of the site.

According to Russian sources, Koval's infiltration of the Manhattan Project as a GRU (Soviet military intelligence) agent \\"drastically reduced the amount of time it took for Russia to develop nuclear weapons.\\"Agence France-Presse (November 3, 2007), \\"Russia: Award for a Soviet Spy\\", The New York Times p. A11William J. Broad (November 12, 2007), \\"A Spy's Path: Iowa to A-Bomb to Kremlin Honor\\", The New York Times p. A1Robert Meeropol (November 17, 2007), The Case of the Rosenbergs: Their Sons' View, The New York Times Koval was born to Russian Jewish immigrants in Sioux City, Iowa. As an adult, he traveled with his parents to the Soviet Union to settle in the Jewish Autonomous Region near the Chinese border. Koval was recruited by the Soviet GRU (military intelligence), trained, and assigned the code name DELMAR. He returned to the United States in 1940 and was drafted into the U.S. Army in early 1943. Koval worked at atomic research laboratories and, according to the Russian government, relayed back to the Soviet Union information about the production processes and volumes of the polonium, plutonium, and uranium used in American atomic weaponry, and descriptions of the weapon production sites. In 1948, Koval left on a European vacation but never returned to the United States. In 2007 Russian President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded Koval the Hero of the Russian Federation decoration for \\"his courage and heroism while carrying out special missions\\".  Early life  George Koval's father, Abram Koval, left his home town of Telekhany in Belarus to immigrate to the United States in 1910. Abram, a carpenter, settled in Sioux City, Iowa, which, at the turn of the 20th century, was home to a sizeable Jewish community of merchants and craftsmen. Many of these settlers moved from Russia, in which Jews had been ruthlessly persecuted under the czar's anti-Semitic policies and pogroms. Abram and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; and Gabriel, born 1919.Walsh, 42. George Koval attended Central High School, a red-brick Victorian building better known as \\"the Castle on the Hill\\". Neighbors recalled that Koval spoke openly of his Communist beliefs. While attending Central High he was a member of the Honor Society and the debate team. He graduated in 1929 at the age of 15. Meanwhile, his parents left Sioux City as the Great Depression deepened. Abram Koval became the secretary for ICOR, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in the Soviet Union. Founded by American Jewish Communists in 1924, the group helped to finance and publicize the development of the \\"Jewish Autonomous Region\\" – the Soviet answer to Jewish emigration to the British Mandate of Palestine then being undertaken by the Zionist movement.Srebrnik, 80–108. The Koval family emigrated in 1932, traveling with a United States family passport. They settled in Birobidzhan, near the border of Manchuria.Walsh, 43. The Koval family worked on a collective farm and were profiled by an American Communist daily newspaper in New York City. The journalist Paul Novick wrote to his readers that the family \\"had exchanged the uncertainty of life as small storekeepers ... for a worry-free existence for themselves and their children.\\" While Isaya became a champion tractor driver, George Koval improved his Russian language skills in the collective and began studies at the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology in 1934. At the university, he met and married fellow student Lyudmila Ivanova. Koval graduated with honors in five years and received Soviet citizenship.  Recruitment and espionage  Later, Koval was recruited by the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (Главное Разведывательное Управление), or GRU. By the time he received his degree he had left Moscow under orders as part of a subterfuge. He was drafted into the Soviet army in 1939 to explain his sudden disappearance from the city. Though his parents had relinquished their US family passport, Koval returned to the US in 1940, replacing a spy recalled during Stalin's purges. His code name was DELMAR.Soldatov Arriving in San Francisco, he traveled to New York City. According to Arnold Kramish, an American colleague he befriended and with whom he re-established contact in 2000, it was there that Koval assumed deputy command of the local GRU cell. This outpost operated under the cover of the Raven Electric Company, a supplier to firms such as General Electric. Koval told coworkers he was a native New Yorker and an only child. He ingratiated himself with everyone he met. While Koval originally worked under a pseudonym, gathering information on toxins for use in chemical weapons, his handlers decided to have him work under his real name. During the beginning of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt that he would not be able to do so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union. = Atomic secrets = Oak Ridge workers operating calutrons. Koval's job as a health officer meant he had his own car and access to many sensitive areas of the facility. The Specialized Training Program was dissolved in early 1944, as the progress of the war tipped in favor of the Allies; many of the CCNY classmates were transferred to the infantry, while Koval and a dozen others were selected for the Special Engineer Detachment. The Detachment was part of the covert project to design, engineer, and fabricate an atomic bomb—an American, Canadian and British initiative known as the Manhattan Project. Koval was assigned to Oak Ridge, Tennessee; at the time, Project scientists were researching enriched uranium and plutonium-based bombs, with the Oak Ridge laboratories central to the development of both.Walsh, 44. The Project suffered from a lack of human resources, and asked the Army for technically qualified men. Koval enjoyed free access to much of Oak Ridge;Broad, 2. he was made a \\"health physics officer\\", and monitored radiation levels across the facility. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation records, the job gave him top-secret security clearance. At the time, Project scientists discovered reactor-produced plutonium was too unstable for the intended bomb designs, and that polonium initiators (urchin) were needed for the necessary chain reactions to occur. Koval was charged by his handlers with watching Oak Ridge's polonium supply to transmit information about it through a Soviet contact named \\"Clyde\\". His information reached Moscow via coded dispatches, couriers, and the Soviet Embassy. Among the intelligence he sent was that Oak Ridge's polonium was being sent to another Project site at Los Alamos National Laboratory.Walsh, 45. Koval was transferred from Oak Ridge to a top-secret lab in Dayton, Ohio on June 27, 1945, where polonium initiators were fabricated. The world's first atomic bomb was detonated in New Mexico on July 16 of that year. Atomic bombs were dropped on Japan on August 6 and 9, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. The Soviet Union responded by increasing efforts to develop its own atomic bomb. While the American Central Intelligence Agency estimated the Soviets would not succeed until 1950–53, the first Soviet atomic bomb was detonated on August 29, 1949. The initiator for the plutonium bomb was, according to Russian military officials, \\"prepared to the 'recipe' provided by military intelligence agent Delmar [Koval]\\".  Later years  After World War II, Koval was discharged from the Army. He returned to New York and CCNY, where he received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering on February 1, 1948. Telling his friends he was thinking about taking a trip to Poland or Israel, Koval secured a passport for six months' travel to Europe. According to the Russian publication Rossiyskaya Gazeta, he might have left because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector. He left by sea in October 1948 and never returned to his birth country.Walsh, 46. In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him \\"a very suspicious character\\", he wrote to Kramish. Turned down for education and research positions, Koval turned to his old GRU contact, who secured him a job as a laboratory assistant at the Mendeleev Institute. Eventually, Koval managed to obtain a teaching job there; his students often laughed at his foreign pronunciations for technical terms.Walsh, 47. While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs were caught after the war, Koval apparently went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another possibility is that the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them with the impression that he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty yearsDoyle. as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.Broad, 1. In 1999, Koval was living on his small pension in Russia and had heard that U.S. war veterans like himself could apply for Social Security payments. He applied. In 2000, the Social Security Administration's Office of Central Operations, Baltimore, Maryland responded with a one-sentence letter: \\"We are writing to tell you that you do not qualify for retirement benefits.\\" Koval described his 57 years of post-spy life living in Russia as \\"uneventful\\". His family knew he had done work for the GRU, but the subject was never discussed. He did not receive any high awards upon his return, a fact that bothered him. Bigger awards went to \\"career men\\", he told Kramish. However, he ended his correspondence by saying that he was not protesting his treatment; \\"[I am thankful] that I did not find myself in a Gulag, as might well have happened\\". Koval died in his Moscow apartment on January 31, 2006, at the age of 92. Koval's activities as a spy began to emerge after the publication of a 2002 book, The GRU and the Atomic Bomb, which mentioned Koval by his code name and listed him as one of a handful of spies who evaded counterintelligence groups. On November 3, 2007, he received the posthumous title of Hero of the Russian Federation bestowed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. When Koval was honored, the Russian presidential proclamation stated, \\"Mr Koval, who operated under the pseudonym Delmar, provided information that helped speed up considerably the time it took for the Soviet Union to develop an atomic bomb of its own\\".Moscow Kremlin.

Agrahari, Agraharee or Agarhari is an Indian and Nepali Vaishya community, claimed to be descendants of legendary king Agrasena. Predominantly, they are found in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Terai region of Nepal. History In 1916, Robert Vane Russell, an ethnologist of the British Raj period wrote, Agrahari, a sub caste of Bania found chiefly Jubbulpore district and Raigarh State. Their name connected with the cities with Agra and Agroha. William Crooke states that Agrahari claim partly a Vaishya and partly a Brāhmanical descent, and wear the sacred thread. Like that of the Agarwāla Banias their name has been connected with the cities of Agra and Agroha. There is no doubt that they are closely connected with the Agarwālas. In Chhattisgarh, Central Provinces of British India, some of few Agrahari were Malgujars/Zamindars. The ruler of Raigarh awarded the title Shaw to Agraharis. The title still continues. Sikhism in Agrahari Most of the Agraharis follow Hinduism, although some are Sikhs. The majority of Agrahari Sikhs are found in the Eastern Indian state of Bihar Jharkhand and West Bengal. Author Himadri Banerjee wrote in his book \\"The Other Sikhs: A View from Eastern India\\", that Agraharis converted to Sikhism during Mughal period by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, 9th Guru of the Sikhs. Mughal rulers were enforcing Hindus to convert to Islam, but Agraharis refused to convert to Islam and they accepted Khalsa Panth, led by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji for protecting their life and religion. Other legend says that Agrahari Sikhs are a community of Ahom converts to Sikhism from the time of 9th Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji’s travel to Assam. They are also known as \\"Bihari Sikhs\\" having lived for centuries in Bihar. They are running several separate Gurudwara in Bihar and West Bengal. The majority of these Sikhs are found in Sasaram, Gaya and Kolkata of Bihar and West Bengal. In Jharkhand they are found in Dumari Kalan and Kedli Chatti. Agrahari Sikhs not only came Eastwards of India, they are also found in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. Agrahari Sikhs are of the non-Punjabi background and have nothing related to Punjab, Punjabi, and Punjabiyat. They belong to mainstream Sikhism as taught by the Sikh Gurus. Surname, Gotra & title Agrahari often use their community name as surname. However, many people using Gupta, Bania or Baniya, Patwari or Vanik or Banik, Shaw and Vaishya or Vaishy or Vaish or Baishya or Baish. They have a common gotra, the Kashyap.

Early years After graduation Katz studied law at The German University in Prague. During his studies, he wrote for a variety of newspapers and magazines. Upon graduation, he began work with the now defunct Vossische Zeitung newspaper in their Prague office. During this placement, he spent a year in East Asia working as a traveling reporter. Career in Journalism After the First World War, Katz moved to Leipzig and in 1924 he became director of the Leipzig Publishing Company, a position he held for two years. In the years between 1928 and 1930, he was a clerk for the Ullstein publishing house in Berlin. While working in this position, Katz founded the Green Post, a periodical which very quickly reached a circulation of over one million. The financial success allowed Katz to establish himself as an independent writer, giving him the freedom to travel the world while writing of his experiences. Travel and Publication During the period between 1925 and his death, Katz published nearly thirty-five volumes, mostly personally written journalistic travel books. In the late twenties, his five- book series Die Weite Weite Welt (The Wide, Wide World) emerged, including Ein Bummel um die Welt, Funkelnder Ferner Osten, Heitere Tage mit braunen Menschen, Schnapps Kokain und Lamas, Ernte (name translations below). His other areas of interests were animals - specifically dogs - and gardening. Some of his most refreshing works center around the personalities of dogs, and the methods one must employ to be a successful gardener. In 1933, Katz emigrated to Switzerland. In 1941, he moved to Brazil obtaining citizenship there. In 1956 he returned to Switzerland where he died in 1968 living above Locarno.

Energy in Chile is dominated by fossil fuels, with coal, oil and gas accounting for 73.4% of the total primary energy. Biofuels and waste account for another 20.5% of primary energy supply, with the rest sourced from hydro and other renewables. Electricity consumption was 68.90 TWh in 2014. Main sources of electricity in Chile are hydroelectricity, gas, oil and coal. Renewable energy in the forms of wind and solar energy are also coming into use, encouraged by collaboration since 2009 with the United States Department of Energy. The electricity industry is privatized with ENDESA as the largest company in the field.

Retrieved 15-05-2012 oil (13%), gas (30%) and coal (20%). Wind has a small but growing presence with 198 MW. Faced with natural gas shortages that have the potential to jeopardize electricity supply, Chile is currently building its first LNG terminal to secure a supply for its existing and upcoming gas-fired thermal plants. In addition, it has engaged in the construction of several new hydropower and coal-fired thermal plants. Chile’s successful electricity sector reform, which served as a model for other countries, was carried out in the first half of the 1980s. Vertical and horizontal unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution and large scale privatization led to soaring private investment. However, in recent years, there has been a substantial modification of the 1982 Electricity Act, to bring it line with developments of the last 20 years in the sector. This was the result of a pressing need to change. The main companies involved, in terms of installed capacity, are the following: * ENDESA (35%, 6085 MW) * AES Gener (18%, 3157 MW) * Colbún S.A.

The MMP3 gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes which localize to chromosome 11q22.3. MMP-3 has an estimated molecular weight of 54 kDa.  Function  Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins and during tissue remodeling in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development and reproduction, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis, and tumour metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The MMP-3 enzyme degrades collagen types II, III, IV, IX, and X, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. In addition, MMP-3 can also activate other MMPs such as MMP-1, MMP-7, and MMP-9, rendering MMP-3 crucial in connective tissue remodeling. The enzyme is also thought to be involved in wound repair, progression of atherosclerosis, and tumor initiation. In addition to classical roles for MMP3 in extracellular space, MMP3 can enter in cellular nuclei and control transcription.  Gene regulation  MMP3 itself can enter in nuclei of cells and regulate target gene such as CTGF/CCN2 gene. Expression of MMP3 is primarily regulated at the level of transcription, where the promoter of the gene responds to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products. A polymorphism in the promoter of the MMP3 gene was first reported in 1995. The polymorphism is caused by a variation in the number of adenosines located at position -1171 relative to the transcription start site, resulting in one allele having five adenosines (5A) and the other allele having six adenosines (6A). In vitro promoter functional analyses showed that the 5A allele had greater promoter activities as compared with the 6A allele. It has been shown in different studies that individuals carrying the 5A allele have increased susceptibility to diseases attributed to increased MMP expression, such as acute myocardial infarction and abdominal aortic aneurysm. On the other hand, the 6A allele has been found to be associated with diseases characterized by insufficient MMP-3 expression due to a lower promoter activity of the 6A allele, such as progressive coronary atherosclerosis. The -1171 5A/6A variant has also been associated with congenital anomalies such as cleft lip and palate, where individuals with cleft lip/palate presented significantly more 6A/6A genotypes than controls. Recently, the MMP3 gene was shown to be down-regulated in individuals with cleft lip and palate when compared to controls, reinforcing the nature of cleft lip/palate as a condition resulting from insufficient or defective embryonic tissue remodeling.  Structure  362x362px Most members of the MMP family are organized into three basic, distinctive, and well-conserved domains based on structural considerations: an amino-terminal propeptide; a catalytic domain; and a hemopexin-like domain at the carboxy-terminal. The propeptide consists of approximately 80–90 amino acids containing a cysteine residue, which interacts with the catalytic zinc atom via its side chain thiol group. A highly conserved sequence (. . .PRCGXPD. . .) is present in the propeptide. Removal of the propeptide by proteolysis results in zymogen activation, as all members of the MMP family are produced in a latent form. The catalytic domain contains two zinc ions and at least one calcium ion coordinated to various residues. One of the two zinc ions is present in the active site and is involved in the catalytic processes of the MMPs. The second zinc ion (also known as structural zinc) and the calcium ion are present in the catalytic domain approximately 12 Å away from the catalytic zinc. The catalytic zinc ion is essential for the proteolytic activity of MMPs; the three histidine residues that coordinate with the catalytic zinc are conserved among all the MMPs. Little is known about the roles of the second zinc ion and the calcium ion within the catalytic domain, but the MMPs are shown to possess high affinities for structural zinc and calcium ions. TIMP-1 (blue) in complex with MMP-3 (red). Note the Cys1 (green) TIMP-1 chelating to the catalytic zinc (purple). Calcium ions (yellow) are also shown. Based on the PyMOL rendering of PDB 1UEA. For simplicity, the other MMP-3 monomer complexed with its respective TIMP-1 is not shown. The catalytic domain of MMP-3 can be inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The n-terminal fragment of the TIMP binds in the active site cleft much like the peptide substrate would bind. The Cys1 residue of the TIMP chelates to the catalytic zinc and forms hydrogen bonds with one of the carboxylate oxygens of the catalytic glutamate residue (Glu202, see mechanism below). These interactions force the zinc-bound water molecule that is essential to the enzyme's function to leave the enzyme. The loss of the water molecule and the blocking of the active site by TIMP disable the enzyme. The hemopexin-like domain of MMPs is highly conserved and shows sequence similarity to the plasma protein, hemopexin. The hemopexin-like domain has been shown to play a functional role in substrate binding and/or in interactions with the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of specific MMP protein inhibitors.  Mechanism  The mechanism for MMP-3 is a variation on a larger theme seen in all matrix metalloproteinases. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated to a glutamate residue (Glu202) and one of the zinc ions present in the catalytic domain. First, the coordinated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide substrate's scissile carbon while the glutamate simultaneously abstracts a proton from the water molecule. The abstracted proton is then removed from the glutamate by the nitrogen of the scissile amide. This forms a tetrahedral gem- diolate intermediate that is coordinated to the zinc atom. In order for the amide product to be released from the active site, the scissile amide must abstract a second proton from the coordinated water molecule. Alternatively, it has been shown for thermolysin (another metalloproteinase) that the amide product can be released in its neutral (R-NH2) form. The carboxylate product is released after a water molecule attacks the zinc ion and displaces the carboxylate product. The release of the carboxylate product is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction. In addition to the water molecule directly involved in the mechanism, a second water molecule is suggested to be a part of the MMP-3 active site. This auxiliary water molecule is thought to stabilize the gem-diolate intermediate as well as the transition states by lowering the activation energy for their formation. This is demonstrated in the mechanism and reaction coordinate diagram below. The catalytic mechanism for MMP-3 with an auxiliary water molecule. Charges shown are formal charges.  Disease relevance  MMP-3 has been implicated in exacerbating the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) through its disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Different studies have shown that after the brain undergoes trauma and inflammation has begun, MMP production in the brain is increased. In a study conducted using MMP-3 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BBB permeability after traumatic injury. The WT mice were shown to have lower claudin-5 and occludin levels than the KO mice after TBI. Claudin and occludin are proteins that are essential for the formation of the tight junctions between the cells of the blood-brain barrier. Tissue from uninjured WT and KO mice brains was also treated with active MMP-3. Both the WT and KO tissues showed a drop in claudin-5, occludin, and laminin-α1 (a basal lamina protein), suggesting that MMP-3 directly destroys tight junction and basal lamina proteins. MMP-3 also does damage to the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), the functional equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, after spinal cord injury (SCI). In a similar study conducted using MMP-3 WT and KO mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BSCB permeability, with the WT mice showing greater BSCB permeability than the KO mice after spinal cord injury. The same study also found decreased BSCB permeability when spinal cord tissues were treated with a MMP-3 inhibitor. These results suggest that the presence of MMP-3 serves to increase BSCB permeability after SCI. The study showed that MMP-3 accomplishes this damage by degrading claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 (another tight junction protein), similar to how MMP-3 damages the BBB. The increase in blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier permeability allows for more neutrophils to infiltrate the brain and spinal cord at the site of inflammation. Neutrophils carry MMP-9., which has also been shown to degrade occludin. This leads to further disruption of the BBB and BSCB  References   Further reading   *  External links  * The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: M10.005 * Category:Matrix metalloproteinases Category:EC 3.4.24 ","title":"MMP3"},{"id":"14049137","text":"Flag Day is a day to fly a flag of a certain area or a day set aside to honor an event specifically involving a national flag.

Golfers compete in teams of two, using only one ball per team, and taking alternate shots until the hole is completed. Team members take turns in teeing off on each hole, i.e. one player will take the tee shot on odd-numbered holes, and the other on even-numbered holes. Foursomes is most commonly played as match play, with each hole being won by the team that completes it in the fewest shots. This form of golf is often played in team golf competitions such as the Ryder Cup, Solheim Cup, Seve Trophy, and the Presidents Cup. Foursomes can also be played in stroke play competitions, with the winners being the team who have taken the fewest strokes to complete a set number of holes. Since 2000 this format has been used with alternating rounds of four-ball by the World Cup of Golf, and since 2017, again combined with four-ball rounds, by the Zurich Classic on the PGA Tour. Variations Greensomes, also known as \\"Scotch foursomes\\", follows the same format as foursomes except that both players tee off on every hole. The better ball is chosen and alternate strokes are then played to complete the hole. This format is used at the Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf, where two rounds are played on a par three course; in each round, nine holes are played as greensomes and nine as better ball. Bloodsomes, or gruesomes, follows the same format as greensomes except the opposition pairing choose which ball is played.

The Duke's Company was a theatre company chartered by King Charles II at the start of the Restoration era, 1660. Sir William Davenant was manager of the company under Prince James, Duke of York's patronage. During this period, theatres began to flourish again after being closed due to restrictions throughout the English Civil War and Interregnum. The Duke's Company existed from 1660 until 1682 when it merged with the King's Company to form the United Company. History The Duke's Company was one of the two theatre companies (the other being the King's Company) that were chartered by King Charles II at the start of the English Restoration era, when the London theatres re-opened after their eighteen-year closure (1642-60) during the English Civil War and the Interregnum. The Duke's Company had the patronage of the King's younger brother Prince James, Duke of York and of Albany (later King James II & VII). It was managed by Sir William Davenant. The company started at the old Salisbury Court Theatre, and occasionally used the Cockpit in Drury Lane. After a year, the actors moved to a new theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, a building on Portugal Street that had previously been Lisle's Tennis Court (it opened on 18 June 1661). There they were joined by Thomas Betterton, who quickly became their star. In December 1660, the King granted the Duke's Company the exclusive rights to ten of Shakespeare's plays: Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, Measure for Measure, Henry VIII, and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. In 1661, their first year at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the company revived Hamlet, in a production that employed the innovation of stage scenery. Samuel Pepys saw their production on 24 August; he described it as \\"done with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton did the Prince's part beyond imagination\\". Davenant tried to make the most of the limited Shakespearean materials available to him. In 1662 he staged The Law Against Lovers, a heavily adapted version of Measure for Measure that blended in characters from Much Ado About Nothing. It was the earliest of the many Shakespearean adaptations produced during the Restoration era and the eighteenth century. The company also acted some of the plays in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. Yet the rival King's Company under Thomas Killigrew controlled more of the \\"Old Stock Plays\\", the traditional repertory of English Renaissance drama (Davenant even had to petition for the right to perform his own pre-1642 plays). The Duke's Company was driven to seek out new work by a new generation of writers, and to experiment with new forms and styles. The company performed the plays of Davenant, John Dryden, Thomas Otway, George Etheredge, Thomas Shadwell and others; it produced Aphra Behn's plays from 1670 to 1682. The company also acted many translations and adaptations of French and other foreign plays; their 1662 production of Sir Samuel Tuke's The Adventures of Five Hours, a version of Calderón's comedy Los Empeños de Seis Horas, ran for thirteen straight performances and was the first great hit of Restoration drama. Like the King's Company, the Duke's pioneered the use of the first English actresses in the early 1660s. Their standout performer was Mary Saunderson, later Mrs. Betterton, who acted many of the lead female roles in Shakespeare's plays. Anne Gibbs (later married to Thomas Shadwell), Hester Davenport and Mary Lee also had noteworthy careers. Samuel Pepys saw many of their productions, and recorded them in his Diary. King Charles witnessed many of their productions too; in a break with past practice, the King sometimes came to the theatre to see the plays, which in previous reigns had never happened. (Instead, the acting companies had always gone to Court to perform.) In its busiest seasons, the company staged fifty different plays in a year, ten of them new works. After Davenant's death in April 1668, Betterton took command of the company, in collaboration with Davenant's widow Lady Mary Davenant. Their management team expanded its strategies to ensure success: the company engaged in three consecutive (and profitable) summer seasons in Oxford starting in 1669. On 9 November 1671 the company moved into a new theatre in Dorset Garden, sometimes called the Queen's Theatre, \\"the most elegant of all the Restoration playhouses...\\". The Duke's Company exploited the scenic capacities of the Dorset Garden Theatre to produce many of the Restoration spectaculars and the early operas and semi-operas that characterized the Restoration era. The most successful of the company's semi-operas was the Dryden/ Davenant adaptation of The Tempest, which premiered on 7 November 1667. From 1675 on, Elizabeth Barry acted with the Duke's Company and became recognized as one of the stars of the era. Both the Duke's and King's Companies suffered poor attendance during the turmoil of the Popish Plot period, 1678-81\\\\. When the King's Company fell into difficulties due to mismanagement, the Duke's Company joined with them to form the United Company in 1682, under the Duke's Company's management. The United Company began performances in November of that year. The King's Company theatre, the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, was used mainly for plays, while the Duke's Dorset Garden theatre was devoted to operas and spectaculars. John Downes was the prompter of the Duke's Company from 1662 to 1706. In 1708 he published his Roscius Anglicanus, the \\"main source of information about the Restoration theatre\\" for later generations. Company structure =Management= Sir William Davenant Sir William Davenant was the first manager for the Duke's Company. Moreover, he was the patent holder and fundamentally the creator of the theatre group. After Killigrew had been granted his patent for the King's Company, Davenant drafted a document to give him and Killigrew duel monopoly over the theatre companies. Davenant could do this because he was rewarded with a warrant from Charles I during 1639 to build his own theatre, which whilst defunct still added gravitas to his claims. Furthermore, his masque work with Charles I, also being the writer for the two operas performed during the Puritan regime certainly cemented him as an accomplished and reliable manager to the second company. Thus the Duke's company was created. Davenant, with a background in masque, grew to believe that spectacle was the way forward for British theatre. Mary Edmond comments that he \\"realised very early on that play goers would soon be demanding scenic theatres\\". Thus he went forward with creating theatre spaces that used changeable scenes, as well as always updating these scenes to make performances feel fresh and new for the audiences. During his time as manager he set the standard for the Duke's company. After being lumbered with only 23 plays in comparison to the King's 108, Davenant turned his company in the direction of new writing and adaptations of pre-restoration work that he did have. He worked with writers such as George Etheredge, John Dryden and Roger Boyle. Not only did he attempt to keep the work performed for the Duke's men modern, he also had plans to keep the theatres as functional and of the highest quality. This new and exciting theatre manifested as Dorset Garden. Whilst this was not created until after his death, he managed to fund the project. He did this by selling 7 7/10ths of his shares to people at a price range of £600 - £800. Then sharers then managed to raise the rest of the substantial sum of £9000 which it is roughly considered to have cost. Henry Harris and Thomas Betterton The theatre house was built under the next set of managers for the Duke's company. This was the collaboration of Thomas Betterton and Henry Harris under the watch of Davenant's wife. Both Betterton and Harris were star players of Davenant. They continued the legacy of the Duke's company well. The theatre house that was erected during their time as managers was state of the art, boasting machinery, something that was no doubt inspired by European theatres. Furthermore, they continued to boast new writers including Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway and once again John Dryden. Unlike Davenant, neither wrote their own work. However, unlike the King's Company, the second managers wanted to make the transition as smooth as possible. Their decisions had \\"been reviewed by the board of sharing actors as well as by representatives of the Davenant family\\". Thus we see that despite having recognizable influence within the company, the duo didn't want to alienate or anyone involved in the company. =Ownership= As for who owned the company, it doesn't appear that there was one owner. Instead the companies were owned by shareholders who all had some say in the running of the company, and who helped with raising funds. Indeed, the main shareholder and patent holder should be considered the principal owner, which would therefore mean William Davenant would be the owner for the period of 1660–1668. Thereafter Lady Davenant would be considered the owner, with Betterton and Harris as the managers. William Van Lennep supports this assumption writing \\"The formal structure, then, of this type of arrangement consisted of a proprietor (the largest shareholder), who was the master of the company in both theatrical and financial affairs; a small number of sharing actors, who received a proportion of the profits after the gross receipts had provided for the major expenses; and a large number of actors on salary.\\" =Joining the company= People joined the company by buying shares within the company, as \\"the companies were a business, and shares in them were sold to raise money needed to furnish theatres, hire personnel, and produce plays\\". Therefore, it is assumed that only those of a certain class could join the company. =Least influential member= In 1660, for the first time women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage. However, the significance of this at the time was evidently not as apparent. One can assume this because the records of this precise actress that performed is yet to be found; therefore suggesting that it was not recorded, undermining the influence of women performing in the theatre. An example of one of the women that was first to perform was Mrs. Eastland. Although her name appears on the prompter of Killigrew's original actresses, \\"her name appears on no dramatis personae until 1669 and she only ever played minor parts\\". In addition, she only appears on the cast list in 1669; nine years after the start of the company. In spite of the allowance of women in the theatre, it is evident that the patriarchal nature of the theatre was still very apparent. For men, the acting profession was a respected and successful career, however, \\"no woman with serious pretentions to respectability would countenance a stage career\\". But due to the nature and demands of being an actress; learning lines quickly, and needing to have a civilised etiquette meant that the company had to find women of a middle ground; this suggests the class differences, and the overall significance of men compared to women within the company. Plays The new theatre the Duke's Playhouse opened on 28 June 1661 in Dorset Gardens, with the spectacular The Siege of Rhodes. The new theatre encompassed new possibilities for the company to create rich and dramatic theatre. \\"A small stage and proscenium arch; the scenery consisted of wings fronting pairs of large painted flats which could be moved along grooves set in the floor and flies of the stage\\". This was the first public playhouse in England to use such innovation and so impacted the choice of play. The plays became spectacles; the Siege of Rhodes being a \\"magnificent production\\". Other productions such as Hamlet (1661), Love and Honour (1661) and The Tempest (1667) characterise the Company's restoration spectaculars and operas. Downes remarked that the adaptation of Love and Honour, originally from 1643, in 1661 was \\"Richly Cloth'd\\" with Betterton robed in fine garments and the set extraordinary. =Shakespeare= The Duke's Company were granted exclusive rights to ten Shakespearean plays; Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, Measure for Measure, Henry VII and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. This, combined with the talented actors, such as Betterton, allowed the company to create adaptations of the Shakespeare's within the playhouse. =Davenant= William Davenant, as a manager and on good terms with the King, was able to use his patency and Betterton's talents to produce performances of his own plays. Killigrew and Davenant planned to put on tragedies, comedies, plays, operas, and all other similar entertainments, setting reasonable admission charges to meet \\"the great expences of scenes, musick and new decorations as have not bin formerly used\\". =Censorship= The King's theatre monopoly was controlled by the legislative power the Lord Chamberlain. Chamberlain had the power to censor dramatic and printed work, having patents submit work 14 days before the performance. The Duke's Company found themselves subject to Chamberlain's legislation, due to the comic performer and renowned improvisor, Edward Angel. During the run of Dryden and Davenant's The Tempest, 1667-8, Lord Chamberlain issued a warrant for the arrest of the comedian Edward Angel a member of the Dukes Company. Although the reasons behind the order remain unclear, one possible explanation is that Angel had caused offence with his talent for improvisation and unscripted political satire. The licensing act even controlled the schedule and permitted attendees. For example, on 6 February 1720 he ordered Gay's new pastoral tragedy Dione be acted \\"immediately after Hughes\\"'s The Siege of Damascus. Actors =Thomas Betterton= Thomas Patrick Betterton (ca. 1635 – 28 April 1710), English actor in Dukes Theatre Company, son of an undercook for Charles I, born in London. Early life and apprenticeship As a young boy, Betterton's education is unclear, however he is described to have had a \\"great propensity\\" for reading, which may explain why he was bound to Sir William Davenant's publisher, John Holden, in an apprenticeship. He may have performed in Davenant's early-unlicensed plays, however unable to sustain acting as a full career due to the plays infrequency due to the uncertain status of theatre during the Interregnum (1649 - 1660). Documents link Betterton's name to working with John Rhodes, a bookseller, during this time. John Downes, a theatre prompter for Davenant's acting troupe, first documents Betterton's participation in theatre in 1659, Drury Lane. Downes accredited Betterton's talents saying; \\"His voice being audible strong, full and Articulate, as in the Prime of his Acting\\". Acting career On 6 October 1660, Betterton was a part of the Kings Company led by Thomas Killigrew. However, by 5 November, he had moved to a formal sharing agreement with Davenant to constitute the Dukes Company, as he may have felt his talent was overshadowed in the Kings Company. Betterton, in the Dukes Company became one of the most famous actors of the Restoration period. He was Samuel and Elizabeth Pepys's favourite actor; \\"He is called by us both, the best actor in the world.\\" The Dukes theatre, with the help of Betterton's acting, were recognized for passing on a \\"traditional\\" and \\"correct\\" way to perform older plays, such as Shakespeare. The actors in the company owned some of the repeat roles as long as they remained in the company, which meant the actors could create and sustain their interpretations of the characters. Betterton is noted today as being \\"the first classical actor\\". Charles Gildon quotes Betterton as saying the company were \\"obliged to make [their] Study [their] business\\", and even learning the parts before rehearsals to \\"enter thoroughly into the Nature of the Part\\". We can see here an early Stanislavskian approach to acting, where Betterton even \\"kept his mind in the same temperament as his character required\\". Betterton undertook the responsibility of many lead roles in both Shakespeare, such as Hamlet, and in newer plays, such as Solyman the Magnificent. He is described as versatile actor, being able to play both villainous and comedic roles, however he did not play farce. In Milhous's \\"Census\\" there are 180 documented appearances of Betterton in the Dukes company however the real figure is most likely higher as 128 plays are left undocumented. Betterton's most successful role in the Dukes Company was Hamlet, which he first played in the aftermath of Charles II's coronation in 1661. John Downes writes that Davenant had seen Joseph Taylor act the part before the interregnum and then taught Betterton \\"in every particle of it\\". The Dukes Companies reparatory system was commercially influenced to catch and shape the social mood of the time. As the Dukes Company had royal monopoly, he created a king in Hamlet to reflect the positive influence of the return of the monarchy; his Hamlet was valiant. On 7 April 1668 Sir Davenant died, and Betterton and Augustus Harris, being elected by all parties involved in the theatre, took over as administrators until 1677 whilst the heir to the company, Charles Davenant was too inexperienced. They successfully took control and led the construction of the Dorset Garden Theatre in 1671. Betterton throughout his career travelled to France regularly to learn about the Spectaculars and foreign Operas in order to increase the Dukes repertoire. However, Bettertons role in the spectaculars remained as chief consultant as he could neither sing nor dance, but he continued performing in traditional plays. Betterton as a writer is never recorded to have created any original texts, however he took a key role in production adaptation and revamping old texts, which meant combining plot lines. He worked very closely with contemporary playwrights of the time such as Aphra Behn and John Dryden, and very much encouraged the development of their new works. Private life Much of Betterton's private life and character remains a mystery, as he did not leave behind any personal journals or records. His shadowy reputation is encouraged by Pepys description of him as \\"a very sober, serious man, and studious and humble\\". Betterton married Mary Saunderson, an actress in the Dukes theatre, on 24 December 1662. Together, they accumulated shares within the Dukes Theatre Company by re-investing their money in part-shares. They never had children of their own, however had two adopted daughters who were both trained for the theatre. There is suggestion that Betterton may have fallen ill from 16 October 1667 to 6 July 1668, as Pepys notes in his diary; \\"Betterton, ill of fever- did not return for several months\\".

He held ministerial office in the governments of Stanley Bruce and Joseph Lyons, representing the Division of Gippsland in Victoria from 1922 to 1943. He played a leading role in the creation of the Victorian Country Party as the political arm of the Victorian Farmers' Union. Early life Paterson was born in Aston, near Birmingham, England and educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and Ayr Grammar School. He became a shoe salesman in 1897 and later a branch manager, but resigned in 1908 to study farming. In November 1908, he married Elsie Jane Tyrrell and next day set out to Australia with his wife, mother, brother and cousin, where he joined two other brothers on a dairy farm at Springfield, near Romsey, Victoria. Political career Paterson joined the Victorian Farmers' Union in 1916, became its president in March 1922 and in November 1922 chaired a conference that led to the creation of the Victorian Country Party. He stood unsuccessfully for the Senate in the 1919 elections and for the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1920 but in 1922 elections he won the federal seat of Gippsland, defeating the Nationalist George Wise. His victory was one of several Country Party gains that forced the Nationalists to go into Coalition with the Country Party in order to stay in office. In parliament, he campaigned for a subsidy for dairy exports to be paid for by a tax on Australian consumers and known by opponents as \\"Paterson's Curse\\" (referring to the Australian name for Echium plantagineum). £20 million were paid under this scheme between 1926 and 1933. Paterson was Minister for Markets and Migration from June 1926 to January 1928, Minister for Markets from January to December 1928 and Minister for Markets and Transport from December 1928 to October 1929. He was deputy leader of the parliamentary Country Party from 1929 to 1937, under Earle Page, and was acting leader for several months in 1933 following the death of Page's son. He was appointed Minister for the Interior in the Lyons coalition government in November 1934. Also in November 1934 he made an exclusion order against Czech writer Egon Kisch which was later overturned by the High Court. He resigned as minister and deputy party leader after the 1937 elections, as a result of the 1936 controversy over the exclusion from Australia of Mabel Freer, a white British woman born in India, who, under the terms of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, had failed a dictation test in Italian. During his time as Minister for the Interior, Paterson was praised by William Cooper of the Australian Aborigines' League for his goodwill and support of the League's requests for greater government assistance to Aboriginal people.Attwood & Markus, pp. 95–96. Paterson remained prominent in Country Party affairs and helped form a breakaway party from the Victorian Country Party that was loyal to the federal parliamentary Country Party in March 1938. He helped reconcile the federal and Victorian parties in 1943, but did not stand for re-election in 1943 elections. He died of coronary vascular disease at his Melbourne home, survived by his wife and elder son.

Souter, Kt., C.S.I., C.I.E. (1831-1888) was the first Police Commissioner of Bombay, serving from 1864 to 1888.  Parentage  His father was reportedly a captain in the 44th Regiment who became a prisoner in Afghanistan in 1842.  Rise to prominence  The office of Commissioner of Police came into being after a certain Colonel Bruce, Inspector-General of Police with the Government of India, was sent to Bombay (old name of Mumbai) in 1864 to investigate local conditions and to make recommendations regarding the local police force. Before Frank Souter was appointed Police Commissioner in 1864, he saw action as a volunteer fighter in 1850 against the rebels in the Nizam's dominions. In 1854 he was appointed Superintendent of Police in Dharwar. Subsequently, he was credited for the capture of the Nargund rebel chief during the Mutiny of 1857 and was awarded a sword of honour for this achievement. In 1859 he put to death a notorious outlaw named Bhagoji Naik and captured the latter's followers, thus ending the activities of the Bhil brigands in northern Deccan; this and other acts of courage earned for Mr. Souter a recommendation for the Victoria Cross. Two more accolades came to Mr. Souter in the next few years. In 1868 he was presented the C.S.I. award, and in 1875 he was knighted by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales.  Incumbency as Police Commissioner  The traditional systems of Magistrates of Police and the Court of Petty Sessions were fully in force during the first thirteen years of Mr. Souter's term of office; however, these were later replaced by the Presidency Magistrates. In the beginning, annual reports on police matters were prepared by the Senior Magistrate, and later by the Chief Presidency Magistrate. However, the Bombay Government abolished these magisterial reports in 1883 because they contained mainly sad statistics. As a result, Police Commissioner Frank Souter had the opportunity to submit the first annual report on the police in the town and island of Bombay one year after the abolition mentioned earlier. During the latter years of his incumbency, Mr. Souter found his police force seriously undermanned and underpaid. At one point he decried the police-to-population ratio of 1 to 506 as well as the meager pay of Rs 10 per month received by the lowest ranked constable. He also expressed disapproval of the inability of most of his men to read and write. Although the Bombay Government was sympathetic with Mr. Souter's concerns, all it could do was to increase the size of the police force by about 100 men, which was still seriously inadequate. One of the notable challenges encountered by the Police Commissioner was recorded in 1884, when Mr. Souter and his men had to deal with the traffic of about 8,000 pilgrims passing through Bombay for the annual Haj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, in addition to their regular work. Two years earlier, the annual pilgrim count justified the creation of a passport system and the appointment of a Protector of Pilgims. It also pushed the Indian legislature to consider writing a Pilgrims Brokers' Act. The Police Commissioner had his share of sensational crimes to be dealt with, the earliest of which was the robbery-motivated murder of four Marwardis by three Italians and one Austrian that happened in 1866; the police caught the murderers. After that, there were many other crimes involving human life and property - and some of the offenders were Europeans - but the records suggest that Mr. Souter and his men proved equal to the task of preventing and detecting crime.  Retirement and demise  On 30 April 1888 Sir Frank Souter relinquished his position as Police Commissioner. Three months later, he died in his place of retirement, the Nilgiris in the Madras Presidency.

It was originally serialized in Nakayoshi, and was published by Kodansha in 2004. The first volume of the series was released in America by Tokyopop in September 2007. Plot For 5 years, Otome and Minami have been step siblings. Their grandmother is staying with them, taking up Otome's room while she recovers from surgery. This results are to Otome having to bunk in her brother's room. They have divided the room with a sheet hanging from the ceiling between the bed where Otome sleeps and a futon on the floor where Minami is sleeping. This often results in Otome either falling half-dressed out of her bed and onto Minami or Minami knocking down the sheet while Otome isn't there and rifling through her things. Shortly afterwards, a boy named Amane kisses Otome and they begin to date. This sparks emotions in Minami, forcing him to realize that he may feel for Otome more than brotherly love. As Minami begins to express this inner struggle through teasing, harsh words, and awkward romantic gestures, Otome comes to feel the same things. Characters =Main Characters= ; : The cheerful, cute, clumsy older step-sister of Minami. Otome is at first oblivious to Minami's growing feelings for her. She has a crush on Amane (Minami's friend), but also finds that she's heartbroken at the thought of Minami transferring to another high school next year. Throughout the story, she was \\"given up\\" by Amane because he realizes that she loves Minami more than she loves him. At the end of the series, Otome and Minami get together. ; : Otome's step-brother who was three days younger than her. Minami is popular with girls and flirts confidently with almost every one of them in school. He even turns his interest in baking into a strategy to charm the opposite sex.

She is seen as energetic and is one of Minami's fangirls. But in the end, she ends up with Hokuto. ; :Kasumi is one year younger than Minami and is also a member of the cooking club. When Minami first began flirting with Kasumi, she was mildly offended and embarrassed, reacting defensively. Eventually she allows herself to get closer to him. Though it seems like she and Minami have begun a legitimate relationship, she easily spots his affection for Otome and is frustrated by it. She is very interested in Minami and tries to get him to return her feelings and give her more attention. Later on, she finally gives up and realizes that it's impossible for Minami to return her feelings because he's in love with Otome. ;Granny :She acts as a loving grandmother to both of the siblings, and was the person who got them to get along when they first became a family by having them both over at her house during summer break. Granny is a busybody, gossiping and spying on Minami when he is alone in his room with Kasumi. She made matching yukata for Minami and Otome.

At first he is very rude to Otome and Minami, but immediately fell for Otome when he sees her in a wedding dress for a cosplay competition. As a proof that Hokuto threatens to steal Otome, he kisses her in front of Minami. Later in the end, he ends up with Aiko instead after she gives him a candy to cure his sore throat. Media Originally published by Kodansha and serialized by Nakayoshi in Japan, Cherry Juice was first released in America by Tokyopop in 2007.

The fourth volume's release date is not known as of now. In Germany, it was first released in July 2006 and the final volume released in February 2007. The manga was never released in an animated format. Reception \\"Artist Haruka Fukushima has drawn some pretty wacked-out romance in the past (see Kedamono Damono for ample evidence of that), but Cherry Juice plays it a great deal straighter, saving most of the comedy for the cute little side comments that dot each page.\\" — Kevin Gifford, Newtype USA. \\"This manga is a romantic dramedy like few, if any, others. The latest in this romance series sees relationships turned inside out and a taboo line perhaps being crossed.\\" — Holly Ellingwood, activeAnime. \\"Definitely a tweens and young teens title, older readers or those more widely read could appreciate some of the perceptive observation, but might be unimpressed with the rest.\\" — Patricia Beard, Mania.

Klaver was born in Hattem, Gelderland, the son of Hendricus Jacobus Klaver, a carpenter and grocer, and Evelina Lubberta Barendsen. His talent as artist was apparent from an early age. He worked as an apprentice carpenter for some years and received painting tuition from another Hattem resident, the landscape painter Jan Voerman Snr. In 1892 he arrived in Amsterdam to study painting. Here he met fellow student Gerarda Jacoba Doyer, born in Deventer on 4 May 1864, to a family of French Hugenot descent. They were married in 1898 and settled in Oldebroek, where Luite started a nursery growing flowers and vegetables. He happened to be the first horticulturist to cultivate Gerberas. His artistic talent and scientific accuracy in depicting plants is evident in the numerous lithographs that appeared in six books, published by Sederius and S.L. van Looy. Between 1895 and 1898 Klaver studied at the Rijksnormaalschool in Amsterdam, which trained high school teachers. He also photographed art works for van Meurs and Co, augmenting his income. Luite and Gerarda had three children born in Oldebroek – Clare Helena (1899), Eveline Hendrika (1902) and Dirk Anton (1911). Gerarda died in 1915 of tuberculosis. Luite and the 3 children finally settled in Hattem on the estate of Molecaten. In 1918 Luite married Gerarda's niece, Egberta Hendrika Barendsen (born in Kampen on 19 October 1875 and died in 1945). They later moved to Soestduinen, where he was part of the management of a factory producing photographic materials. Luite became interested in colour photography and patented various cameras using dichroic filters and glass plates coated with colour-sensitive emulsions. A gallery of his photographs is at the Prentenkabinet Museum in Leiden. Most of his paintings belong to his descendants, while some are with the Voerman museum in Hattem. He died, aged 90, in Utrecht, and was buried in Driebergen.

These teams were constructed from the new Elite Group and Plate Group divisions which had been introduced into the Ranji Trophy that season. However, this format lasted for only one season as it was felt that the new teams lacked a sense of identity. From the 2003–04 season, the five original zonal teams competed along with a sixth guest team which was a touring foreign team. The first guest team was England A in 2003–04. The Indian Premier League has become very popular in India since its inaugural in 2008. Mumbai (formerly Bombay) has continued its dominance of the domestic scene into the 21st century by winning the Ranji Trophy five times in the first decade. Noted Indian cricketers in the 21st century include Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, VVS Laxman, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli. India won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. India was the first Sub- continental team to win a Test match at the WACA in January 2008 against Australia. Indian cricket team under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and brilliant performances from Gautam Gambhir & Yuvraj Singh also went on to win the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 and became the first team in history to win the Cup at home.

He was an expert in Australian constitutional law. In 1963, he became the Foundation Dean of Monash University Law School, which is now called the David Derham School of Law in his honour. Early life and education Derham was born in Australia in 1920, the son of Alfred Plumley Derham , an Australian soldier and doctor, and Frances Derham MBE, an Australian lecturer in art and artist, and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne.Derham, Francis Plumley (1885 - 1957) and Alfred Plumley (1891-1962) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online David Derham served for four years in the Australian Imperial Force in World War II, before going on to complete a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Melbourne in 1947. He graduated first in his year level, winning the Supreme Court Prize. Career He practised briefly as a barrister, before being appointed Independent Lecturer in Constitutional Law at Melbourne University. In 1951, he was made Professor of Jurisprudence. He served in this position for twelve years, and in 1963 he was approached to become Foundation Dean of the forthcoming new law school, Monash. On 14 October 1963, Monash University's Council was informed that Derham had accepted the position. Derham's appointment at Monash was crucial for the law school. Because Derham was so highly regarded in the legal profession, Monash ensured that its new faculty would immediately gain a good reputation and have the confidence of the community.Peter Balmford, \\"Foundation of the Monash Law School\\", Monash University Law Review, vol. 15, 1989, p. 161 The University's Vice-Chancellor, Louis Matheson, had been eager to find a Dean with extensive experience and respect in legal and academic circles. Derham satisfied these criteria in abundance. Although Derham was required to continue teaching at Melbourne University until 1964, he immediately set to work on establishing an original curriculum for Monash. His links with the legal profession meant that a wide range of barristers, solicitors and judges assisted him through committees investigating various elements of the establishment of a new law school. The final program he established at Monash was radically different from the course he had previously overseen at Melbourne. The Monash Bachelor of Laws emphasised the need for law graduates to learn transferable legal skills, rather than merely learning the law itself. He also introduced small- group teaching. On 1 March 1968, Derham was appointed Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, a position he held until 1982.University Secretary's Department : University Calendar - Former Office-bearers: The University of Melbourne In addition to his work as a university administrator, Derham was well known for his wide-ranging legal publications. He also advised the Australian Government on a range of issues concerning the legal system, most notably the administration of justice in Papua New Guinea (which was an Australian Territory until the 1970s). Awards Derham received a number of awards recognising his outstanding contribution to legal education. In addition to his knighthood, he was awarded honorary doctorates in law from both Monash and Melbourne universities. Personal life According to those who knew him, Derham was a warm, energetic and charming friend. Derham died in Melbourne in 1985, leaving behind his wife and children.

Robertson Sir George Scott Robertson, (22 October 1852 – 1 January 1916) was a British soldier, author, and administrator who was best known for his arduous journey to the remote and rugged region of Kafiristan in what is now northeastern Afghanistan and for his overall command of British Empire forces during the Siege of Chitral. He chronicled his Kafiristan experience in the book The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush. Some have suggested that Robertson's year- long expedition and subsequent book (originally published in 1896) provided background and inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's short story \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\". However, Kipling's work was originally published in 1888, predating Robertson's travels to the region. Travels to Kafiristan Robertson was born in London and received his education at the Westminster Hospital Medical School (now Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London). In 1878 he entered the Indian Medical Service and served throughout the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878–80. In 1888, he was attached to the Indian Foreign Office and assigned as agency surgeon in Gilgit, in northern India, now Pakistan. According to his book it was around this time, during the war and while in Gilgit, that Robertson became interested in the land and way of life of the Kafir people. He asked the Government of India for permission to journey to Kafiristan, and by October 1889 was on his way, departing from Chitral in what is now northwest Pakistan in the company of several Kafir headmen of the Kam tribe. His journey lasted just over a year, ending in 1891, and providing Robertson with first-hand experience of what to him were the strange customs and colorful people of Kafiristan. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1892. Siege of Chitral In 1893, after his travels in Kafiristan, Surgeon Major Robertson was reassigned to the then- independent State of Chitral, this time as a political agent. In 1895 he brought a force of around 400 soldiers, under the direct command of Captain Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend, from Gilgit to oversee the transfer of power in Chitral following the death of its ruler, Aman ul-Mulk. After his arrival, Robertson engaged in a series of complex political and military maneuvers, during which hostility from local tribesmen led to his forces to move into Chitral Fort for protection. The six-week siege that followed included an unsuccessful sortie on 3 March 1895, when the British led forces took heavy losses. The siege was raised on 19 April when a relief force, under Colonel Kelly, arrived and dispersed the armed tribesmen. For his service during the famous siege Robertson was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India and appointed British agent in Gilgit. It was he who took the important decision of installing and recognising Shuja ul-Mulk as the provisional Mehtar of Chitral, subject to approval of the Government. He later wrote a book by the title Chitral; the Story of a Minor Siege recounting the intense and dramatic events in Chitral. Later years Robertson continued in the Indian Service until his retirement in 1899. He then returned to Great Britain where he made an unsuccessful bid for political office as a Liberal party candidate in Stirlingshire at the 1900 general election, but later was elected in Central Bradford in 1906.Craig, op. cit., page 79 He held his seat in the House of Commons until his death on New Year's Day, 1916. The Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush In 1896, Lawrence & Bullen Ltd published The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush written by Sir George Scott Robertson. The book provided a detailed account of Sir George Robertson's tour throughout Kafiristan. Although its descriptions of the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush are written in an outdated and colonial (and, from the perspective of modern sensibilities, discriminatory) style, the work contains some of the only accounts of the region from that time period. The book is accompanied by illustrations by Arthur David McCormick and was dedicated by the author to his wife. References Sources *Robertson, George Scott (1896) The Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush.

Huggins (1921 - July 14, 2000) was president of the St Kilda Football Club in the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League) from 1959 to 1979 and remains the club's longest serving president. St Kilda presidency Huggins was a Melbourne businessman and company director and assumed the presidency at St Kilda in 1959 after serving on the committee from 1954. Huggins was also vice-president of the club in 1980 and 1981. During his time as president, Huggins oversaw the appointment of Allan Jeans as coach of the Saints. Jeans successfully guided St Kilda to the 1965, 1966 and 1971 grand finals, winning the premiership in 1966. Along with highly regarded club secretary Ian Drake, Huggins engineered the move of the club to Moorabbin in 1965 and this netted immediate financial benefit for the Saints as well as coinciding with one of the most successful on-field periods in the club's history. In 1976, Huggins, then VFL vice-president, was a considered a strong chance to assume the position of President of the League. He withdrew from the contest to remain with St Kilda and Allen Aylett became VFL president at the beginning of 1977. Huggins stepped down from the St Kilda presidency in 1979, but continued on the board until 1981 at which time he retired after a quarter of a century involved in football at the highest level. The remaining grandstand containing the social club facilities at Moorabbin Oval is named the G. G. Huggins Stand in honour of Huggins.

The first part of the railway opened in 1887 and closed in 1934. A major reason for building the railway was to exploit tourist traffic to Blarney Castle. Initial route The railway operated from its own station. the Cork Western Road railway station, in Cork city. The initial lines westwards from Cork to Blarney and Coachford opened in 1887 and 1888 respectively. The railway was built close to the south bank of the River Lee as far as a station at Coachford Junction, 6½ miles west of Cork. From Coachford Junction the branch to the Blarney line terminus station was 2 miles, and the line to the terminus station at Coachford was 9 miles. Throughout the railway's existence, the line was equipped with nine steam locomotives. The Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company was later to share railways' line out of Cork city. Donoughmore extension An 8½ mile long extension was built north-westerly from St Annes (on the Blarney branch) to Donoughmore. The line was opened in 1893. It was legally a separate company (the Donoughmore Extension Light Railway Company, incorporated in 1889) but worked as a part of the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway. Final years The line was comparatively unaffected by World War I, but experienced serious damage during the Irish Civil War of 1922–23. The destruction of a bridge over the River Lee seriously undermined the railway's viability; the railway was repaired and incorporated into the Great Southern Railways in 1925. Road competition started to seriously affect the railway in the 1920s. The railway closed on 29 December 1934. Rolling stock =Locomotives= CMLR No. 8 Peake The original three locomotives nos. 1–3 City of Cork, Coachford and St. Annes were originally supplied in a configuration in 1887 by Falcon Engine & Car Works and were converted to later. No. 4, the first to be call Blarney, was a small from Kitson and Company which was scrapped in 1911. Traffic needs dictated the ordering of two further locomotives, Nos. 5 and 6, 'Donoughmore and The Muskerry, types from a Thomas Green & Company of Leeds & London. On closure of the CMLR these passed to the Schull and Skibbereen Railway and Tralee and Dingle Light Railway respectively. Two more engines, Nos. 7 and 8, Peake and Dripsey were from Brush Electrical Engineering Company, Falcon's successor were ordered in the later 1890s and 1905 respectively and were broadly similar to earlier ones from the same manufacturer. The CMLR's final locomotive, No. 9, also named Blarney, a Hunslet Engine Company , was ordered in 1911 but only delivered in 1919 due to the war, and then scrapped in 1927. =Carriages and wagons= The CMLR main fleet consisted of just over twenty bogie passengers vehicles of length seating of the order of 36 to 40 persons in a mixture of first and third classes.

The violence that took place in Nellie by natives - mostly rural peasants was seen as a fallout of the decision to hold the controversial state elections in 1983 in the midst of the Assam Agitation, after Indira Gandhi's decision to give 4 million immigrants from Bangladesh the right to vote. It has been described as one of the worst pogroms since World War II. A documentary, What the Fields Remember, has been produced by Public Service Broadcasting Trust.http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/baradwaj-rangan-on-what-the- fields-remember/article7641365.ece?homepage=true Context In 1978, Lok Sabha member Hiralal Patwari died, necessitating a by-election in the Mangaldoi Lok Sabha Constituency. During the process of the election it was noticed that the electorate had grown phenomenally. Investigation revealed that there had been mass inclusion of alleged illegal migrants. \\"A close scrutiny of the electoral rolls indicated that there had been mass inclusion of names of illegal immigrants, prompting AASU to demand that the by-election be called off...\\": \\"Significantly the Election Commission reviewed the list and found 68.28 percent of the allegations to be true. After Election Commission‟s assessment it came to light that 45 thousand illegal foreigners are listed in the voter‟s list.\\" The All Assam Students Union (AASU) demanded that the elections be postponed until the names of \\"foreign nationals\\" were deleted from the electoral rolls. The AASU subsequently launched an agitation to compel the government to identify and expel allegedly illegal immigrants. The ethnic clash that took place in Nellie was seen as a fallout of the decision to hold the controversial Assembly elections in 1983 (boycotted by the AASU) despite stiff opposition from several elements in the state. Police officials had suggested to hold the polls in phases in order to avoid violence. According to then Assam Inspector General of Police, KPS Gill, there were 63 constituencies, where elections could have been held without any trouble. Among the rest, the Assam police had declared there were 23 constituencies where it was \\"impossible to hold any election.\\" Nellie was cited as one of the \\"troubled\\" spots before the elections. 400 companies of Central paramilitary force and 11 brigades of the Indian Army were deployed to guard Assam while the polls were scheduled to take place in phases. Result Press clips from 1983 The official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist). The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by Hiteswar Saikia) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit. Assam United Democratic Front and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident. Police filed 688 criminal cases, of which 378 cases were closed due to \\"lack of evidence\\" and 310 cases were slated to be charged. However, all these cases were dropped by the Government of India as a part of the 1985 Assam Accord; and, as a result, not a single person received punishment. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed the Assam Accord with the leaders of the AASU to formally end the Assam Agitation in 1985.

Early life Born as Franz Oscar Natzke (as he was sometimes credited earlier in his career) at Wharepuhunga, North Island, New Zealand, he was the son of August Natzke (a native of Brixen, a German-speaking part of Italy), who had emigrated to New Zealand and settled in Otorohanga, and Emma Carter Natzke, of Christchurch, New Zealand, who was a singer. As a boy, the young Natzke worked on his father's farm; he was encouraged and trained as a singer by his mother. The family was displaced by the recession of the 1920s to Waiheke Island, where Oscar sang as a boy soprano in concerts. At the age of 15 he was apprenticed to a blacksmith at Freemans Bay, Auckland, where he worked for 3½ years; he later worked for a phosphate company. Career When his voice broke, he became a basso profondo and soon became well-known. He was aided early in his career by Homer Samuels, husband of Amelita Galli-Curci; John Brownlee, the Australian baritone; and Anderson Tyrer, conductor of the New Zealand National Orchestra. Around this time he changed his name to Oscar Natzka. In 1935 he went to London, England to study under Albert Garcia, grandson of Manuel Garcia Jr. and former pupil of his great-aunt Pauline Viardot. In 1938, after being discovered by opera director Vladimir Rosing, he made his debut with The Royal Opera, Covent Garden, and went on to enjoy a career on the operatic circuit. He appeared in the musical revue Meet the Navy during the 1940s and its 1946 film adaptation. Personal life He married Winifred Jean Clements, from Auckland, in 1941. Natzka died on 4 November 1951 in New York City, aged 39 after collapsing on stage on 23 October 1951 during a performance of Die Meistersinger at the New York City Opera. His widow, Winifred, later married the Oscar-winning American actor, Charles Coburn.

Color Video Starts Nov. 20; Adapters Needed by Present Sets\\", The New York Times, October 12, 1950, p. 1. History The use of sequential color systems for moving images predates the invention of fully electronic television. Described at the time as \\"additive\\" rather than sequential color systems, two-color Kinemacolor, in commercial use since 1906, and its predecessor three-color format, invented by Edward Raymond Turner and patented in 1899, were both sequential natural color systems for use with motion picture film. They utilized black-and-white film and rotating color filter wheels to record the amount of each color in the scene on alternating frames of the film, so that when the frames were projected by light of similar colors at a sufficiently rapid rate, those colors blended together in the color center of the viewer's occipital lobe, producing a wider range of hues. Due to litigation by William Friese-Greene, Kinemacolor ended up in the public domain in 1915, after which several derivative sequential color processes (such as Friese-Greene's Biocolour and the original Prisma Color) were developed. Some were brought to the point of being publicly shown, but during the 1920s they could not compete with rival bipack and other subtractive color processes, which were free of color flicker and did not require special projection equipment—the final multicolored images were right there on the film as transparent coloring matter. Operation Patent diagrams of CBS field- sequential color system: Fig. 1 the transmission system, Fig. 2 the receiving system, Fig. 3 the color filter disk. The CBS field-sequential system was an example of a mechanical television system because it relied in part on a disc of color filters rotating at 1440 rpm inside the camera and the receiver, capturing and displaying red, green, and blue television images in sequence. The field rate was increased from 60 to 144 fields per second to overcome the flicker from the separate color images, resulting in 24 complete color frames per second (each of the three colors was scanned twice, double interlacing being standard for all electronic television: 2 scans × 3 colors × 24 frames per second = 144 fields per second), instead of the standard 30 frames/60 fields per second of monochrome. If the 144-field color signal were transmitted with the same detail as a 60-field monochrome signal, 2.4 times the bandwidth would be required. Therefore, to keep the signal within the standard 6-MHz bandwidth of a channel, the image's vertical resolution was reduced from 525 lines to 405. The vertical resolution was 77% of monochrome, and the horizontal resolution was 54% of monochrome.William F. Schreiber, \\"Introduction to 'Color Television—Part I'\\", Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 87, no. 1, January 1999, p. 175. Because of these variances in resolution and frame rate from the NTSC standards for television broadcasting, field- sequential color broadcasts could not be seen on existing black and white receivers without an adapter (to see them in monochrome), or adapter-converter (to see them in color).CBS Field Sequential System: Advertisements, Early Television Foundation. Commercial failure CBS purchased its own television manufacturer in April 1951 when no other company would produce color sets using the system.\\"Hytron's Deal With CBS Seen TV Color Aid\\", The Washington Post, April 12, 1951, p. 15. In June 1951, Philco offered 11 television models that could show CBS color broadcasts in black and white. \\"Philco Offers 11 TV Sets To Receive CBS Color TV in Black and White\\", Wall Street Journal, June 4, 1951, p. 9. Production of CBS-Columbia color receivers began in September;\\"CBS Subsidiary Starts Mass Production of Color Television Sets\\", Wall Street Journal, September 13, 1951, p. 18. they were first offered for retail sale in October. Field-sequential color broadcasts were suspended by CBS on October 21, 1951, ostensibly by request of the National Production Authority, which in November 1951 prohibited the manufacture of color sets for the general public during the Korean War.\\"Color TV Shelved As a Defense Step,\\" New York Times, October 20, 1951, p. 1. \\"Action of Defense Mobilizer in Postponing Color TV Poses Many Question for the Industry,\\" New York Times, October 22, 1951, p. 23.

Only 200 color sets had been manufactured for commercial sale, and only 100 of those had shipped, when CBS suspended its color broadcasts.Ed Reitan, CBS Field Sequential Color System, 1997. CBS announced in March 1953 that it had abandoned any further plans for its color system.\\"CBS Says Confusion Now Bars Color TV,\\" Washington Post, March 26, 1953, p. 39. RCA was the leading company in the television field, with a larger technical staff, more development funds, and more political success in getting the NTSC compatible color television system. RCA developed the hardware for NTSC which superseded the field-sequential system as the U.S. standard in December 1953. Predecessor inventions According to television historian Albert Abramson, A. A. Polumordvinov invented the first field-sequential color system. Polumordvinov applied for his Russian patent 10738 in 1899. This system scanned images with two rotating cylinders.Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941 (Jefferson, North Carolina: 1987), pp. 22, 277. A later German patent by A. Frankenstein and Werner von Jaworski described another field-sequential system. Like the CBS System, this patent included a color wheel. Frankenstein and Jaworski applied for their patent 172376 in 1904.Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941 (Jefferson, North Carolina: 1987), pp. 24, 277. This patent probably inspired John Logie Baird to use a similar color wheel in his system. John Logie Baird demonstrated a version of field-sequential color television on July 3, 1928, using a mechanical television system before his use of cathode ray tubes, and producing a vertical color image about 4 inches (10 cm) high. It was described in the journal Nature: :The process consisted of first exploring the object, the image of which is to be transmitted, with a spot of red light, next with a spot of green light, and finally with a spot of blue light. At the receiving station a similar process is employed, red, blue and green images being presented in rapid success to the eye. The apparatus used at the transmitter consists of a disc perforated with three successive spiral curves of holes. The holes in the first spiral are covered with red filters, in the second with green filters and in the third with blue. Light is projected through these holes and an image of the moving holes is projected onto the object. The disc revolves at 10 revolutions per second and so thirty complete images are transmitted every second — ten blue, ten red, and ten green. :At the receiving station a similar disc revolves synchronously with the transmitting disc, and behind this disc, in line with the eye of the observer, are two glow discharge lamps. One of these lamps is a neon tube and the other a tube containing mercury vapour and helium. By means of a commutator the mercury vapour and helium tube is placed in circuit for two-thirds of a revolution and the neon tube for the remaining third. The red light from the neon is accentuated by placing red filters over the view holes for the red image. Similarly, the view holes corresponding to the green and blue images are covered by suitable filters. The blue and green lights both come from the mercury helium tube, which emits rays rich in both colours.Dr. Alexander Russell, Nature, August 18, 1928. Baird demonstrated a modified two-color version in February 1938, using a red and blue-green filter arrangement in the transmitter; on July 27, 1939 he further demonstrated that color scanning system in combination with a cathode ray tube with filter wheel as the receiver.\\"Colour Television: Baird Experimental System Described\\", Wireless World, August 17, 1939. Later use For the first nine months of NTSC color in 1953–1954, CBS continued to use its field-sequential color television cameras, with the field rate and signal adapted for NTSC standards, until RCA delivered its first production model of an NTSC color camera in time for the 1954–55 season. The Soviet Union was the only other country to experiment with a field-sequential color system. It manufactured a small number of color receivers in 1954 that used a mechanical color disc.1954 Russian Raduga (Rainbow) Field Sequential Color Set, Early Television Foundation. The field-sequential system was used in specialized applications long after it had been replaced for broadcast television. A notable user of the technology was NASA. Field-sequential color cameras were used on the Apollo lunar landing cameras which transmitted color television images from the Moon during missions from 1969 to 1972. Another system was used for the Voyager program in 1979, to take pictures and video of Jupiter. Early Space Shuttle flights (from 1981 to 1995) used cameras with interchangeable lenses. For color transmissions, a field-sequential color system was built into the lens assembly. For the NASA transmissions, the video from space was field sequential, converted by a duty cycle extension technique to component RGB color video on the ground, and thereafter converted to NTSC and other world standards like PAL and SECAM. Modern day Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors commonly use color wheels to generate color images, typically running at a multiple of the video frame rate. Modern day LCD displays implement FSC by using several colors of LED backlight, by cycling the backlights, and gain several advantages such as brighter colors, darker blacks, and lower cost. These displays are used in LCD Camera viewfinders and other industrial applications.

This idea was first introduced by Alice Silverberg and Karl Rubin in 2003; Silverberg named CEILIDH after her cat. The main advantage of the system is the reduced size of the keys for the same security over basic schemes. Algorithms =Parameters= * Let q be a prime power. * An integer n is chosen such that : ** The torus T_n has an explicit rational parametrization. ** \\\\Phi_n(q) is divisible by a big prime l where \\\\Phi_n is the n^{th} Cyclotomic polynomial. * Let m=\\\\phi(n) where \\\\phi is the Euler function. * Let \\\\rho : T_n(\\\\mathbb{F}_q) \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb{F}_q}^m a birational map and its inverse \\\\psi. * Choose \\\\alpha \\\\in T_n of order l and let g=\\\\rho(\\\\alpha)). =Key agreement scheme= This Scheme is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. * Alice chooses a random number a\\\\ \\\\pmod{\\\\Phi_n(q)}. * She computes P_A= \\\\rho(\\\\psi(g)^a) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m and sends it to Bob. * Bob chooses a random number b\\\\ \\\\pmod{\\\\Phi_n(q)}. * He computes P_B= \\\\rho(\\\\psi(g)^b) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m and sends it to Alice. * Alice computes \\\\rho(\\\\psi(P_B))^a) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m * Bob computes \\\\rho(\\\\psi(P_A))^b) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\rho is the identity, thus we have : \\\\rho(\\\\psi(P_B))^a) = \\\\rho(\\\\psi(P_A))^b) = \\\\rho(\\\\psi(g)^{ab}) which is the shared secret of Alice and Bob. =Encryption scheme= This scheme is based on the ElGamal encryption. * Key Generation ** Alice chooses a random number a\\\\ \\\\pmod{ \\\\Phi_n(q)} as her private key. ** The resulting public key is P_A= \\\\rho(\\\\psi(g)^a) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m. * Encryption ** The message M is an element of \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m. ** Bob chooses a random integer k in the range 1\\\\leq k \\\\leq l-1. ** Bob computes \\\\gamma = \\\\rho(\\\\psi(g)^k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m and \\\\delta = \\\\rho(\\\\psi(M)\\\\psi(P_A)^k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^m. ** Bob sends the ciphertext (\\\\gamma,\\\\delta) to Alice. * Decryption ** Alice computes M = \\\\rho(\\\\psi(\\\\delta)\\\\psi(\\\\gamma)^{-a}). Security The CEILIDH scheme is based on the ElGamal scheme and thus has similar security properties. If the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption holds the underlying cyclic group G, then the encryption function is one-way. If the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (DDH) holds in G, then CEILIDH achieves semantic security. Semantic security is not implied by the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption alone. See decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption for a discussion of groups where the assumption is believed to hold. CEILIDH encryption is unconditionally malleable, and therefore is not secure under chosen ciphertext attack. For example, given an encryption (c_1, c_2) of some (possibly unknown) message m, one can easily construct a valid encryption (c_1, 2 c_2) of the message 2m.

Elgar left 130 pages of sketches, which the British composer Anthony Payne worked on for many years, producing a complete symphony in 1997, officially known as \\"Edward Elgar: the sketches for Symphony No 3 elaborated by Anthony Payne\\" or in brief \\"Elgar/Payne Symphony No 3\\". The first public performance was at the Royal Festival Hall on 15 February 1998, by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andrew Davis.notes to Naxos recording 8.554719 History After the death of his wife Caroline Alice Elgar in 1920, Elgar retreated into semi-retirement, producing no large-scale works. His friend and champion George Bernard Shaw held that the BBC should commission a new Elgar symphony, and with the aid of the British conductor and composer Landon Ronald he persuaded the BBC to do so. Elgar worked on the new piece during the last year of his life, jotting down short snatches of bars, as well as composing pages in full score.notes to NMC recording D053 Realising that he would not complete the score, the dying Elgar did not destroy the sketches, and made contradictory remarks about the unfinished work. He told his friend, the violinist William Henry Reed, \\"Don’t let anyone tinker with it\\", but to his doctor he said, \\"If I can’t complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it – or write a better one\\". Elgar and Reed had often played through various sketches for the symphony on violin and piano, and Reed knew more than anyone about Elgar's intentions. Reed reproduced more than forty pages of the most important sketches in his book Elgar as I Knew Him, probably to illustrate what he believed to be the impossibility of weaving them into a coherent whole.notes to NMC recording D053 Their publication in 1936 meant that seventy years later they went into the public domain, and the Elgar family were powerless to prevent anyone from developing the sketches. In 1974, a BBC Radio 3 producer, Dr Roger Fiske, devised a programme about the Symphony, and orchestrated some of the sketches, completing Elgar's unfinished score and composing some other passages. Elgar's daughter Carice gave her approval and Sir Adrian Boult agreed to conduct the music. The score was sent for copying to Maurice Johnstone, a former BBC head of music. Johnstone felt strongly that the broadcast would amount to \\"tinkering\\" with the score and he successfully persuaded Boult to withdraw from the project on ethical grounds and the programme was subsequently dropped. A similar proposed feature for BBC television in 1979 also failed to materialise.Kennedy, p. 265March et al., p.481 The British composer Anthony Payne had become interested in the sketches in 1972, and in 1993 the BBC invited him to work on them for a workshop performance. In the event the performance did not take place, because of objections from the Elgar family. Payne nevertheless continued to work on the sketches, completing the Scherzo, the Adagio and the first movement of the work. The Elgar family decided to commission Payne to make an authorised version. Payne later wrote, \\"It was during this process that I became more consciously aware of the overall sweep of the symphony. It was different in its sheer breadth of emotion from any of his other symphonic works: there was the raw vigour and magic lyricism of the opening movement, the use of a lighter manner in the second which went far beyond his established symphonic practice, and the searing intensity of the Adagio, tragic in its import, while the finale revealed a world of chivalric action and drama.\\" His greatest difficulty was in completing the finale, as Elgar had left few clues about its structure and none about how it would end. Payne wrote both the entire development section and the coda. He decided to end the work quietly, following the model of 'The Wagon Passes' in Elgar’s Nursery Suite. According to Payne, \\"The finale's main subject actually suggests this kind of treatment, and it would lead the music away into some new visionary world, spanning the years between the composer's death and my attempted realisation of his sketches. I trusted my intuition and went ahead and wrote\\". The symphony was first heard in public during 1998 and 1999, when it was performed in Glasgow (24 September), Birmingham (25 September), Bristol (10 October/27 January), Liverpool (24 October), Manchester (17 December) and Cambridge (29 January). International performances were programmed as far afield as Brussels, Ljubljana, St Petersburg, Hong Kong and Winnipeg. The United States première took place on 20 November 1998 with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Andrew Davis, followed by performances by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with Davis and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington with Leonard Slatkin. Boosey & Hawkes website The symphony was described by the philosopher Roger Scruton as \\"a brilliant and heartfelt recuperation of musical ideas and one that has helped to revitalise our musical culture\\".Scruton, p. 95 Structure A performance of the symphony takes about 55 minutes. * Allegro molto maestoso :The symphony opens in a sweeping sequence of parallel open fifths and octaves (the first seventeen bars of which Elgar left in full score) building to a march rhythm. By contrast the second subject is \\"sublimely wistful\\".The Gramophone, March 1998 There is an exposition repeat indicated by Elgar, and a calm new theme for strings introduces the development section, which later has a lively theme for the horns. A march section in B flat minor follows. After the recapitulation, the coda brings together the main themes and the movement ends with a majestic C major conclusion based on the opening theme. The movement, taking about sixteen minutes in performance, though on a large scale, is shorter than the equivalent movements of Elgar's first and second symphonies.The Gramophone, March 1998notes to LSO Live recording LSO00072 * Scherzo: allegretto :The scherzo is in great contrast to those of the first two symphonies, both of which are fast and forceful. It is, however, the movement of which the sketches provided the clearest indications of Elgar's intentions, and the gentle wistfulness is in a recognisable Wand of Youth style. A light dance- tune with a prominent part for the tambourine recurs like a rondo. There are two contrasting episodes, the second of which features an A major theme in pastoral vein.The Gramophone, March 1998 * Adagio solenne :Elgar wrote that the opening bars of the slow movement would \\"open some vast bronze doors into something strangely unfamiliar\\". The first main theme is elegiac, the D major second subject offering gentler contrast. The recapitulation emphasises the brooding first theme, and the movement ends with a single solo viola note, marked fine; \\"this is the end\\", Elgar said of this phrase.The Gramophone, March 1998 * Allegro :The opening of the finale returns to the heroic tone of the start of the symphony with a rousing fanfare (scored by Elgar). It is the movement of which the least original Elgar material exists, and Payne was obliged to contribute a quantity of original music. The martial opening theme has a subsidiary theme in Elgar's nobilmente vein. The climax of the movement is a large-scale crescendo-decrescendo modelled by Payne on \\"The Wagon Passes\\" in the Nursery Suite. The hushed ending dies away in a long pianissimo note from the tam tam.

Biography He was born in Florence on the 21st of July 1644; at twelve he entered the workshop of the Florentine painter Jacopo Vignali, where he remained for about eight years: from this period of his formation are some lunettes frescoed in the first cloister of Santa Maria del Carmine, two of which (Elijah Fed by an Angel and Elijah Builds a Temple on the Site of the Sacrifice of Abraham) are signed and dated 166 ... (1660?); four others of the same cloister (Elijah Raises the Child of Sidon's Widow, Elijah Covers Elisha with his Cloak, Elijah Heals the Water of a Spring, the Children Saved by the Bears) were ascribed to him by Richa. Bettini\`s signed and dated 1661 Guardian Angel was found in the church of Saints Simone and Giuda in Corniola (Empoli). In this latter canvas, so clearly youthful in the uncertainties and imbalances of the composition, one easily recognizes the teachings of Vignali, and echoes of the Florentine culture of the time. Bettini, soon after his marriage at the age of twenty, left for Rome, where he apprenticed with Mario Nuzzi (Mario dei Fiori) for a few years; then, he moved to northern Italy to study and he worked for the duke of Parma. Biographers of the early eighteenth century, such as (Baldinucci and Sagrestani) list him as working for the duke of Parma, the duke of Modena (from 1670 onwards for eighteen years), the marquis Muzio Spada of Faenza from 1685 to 1701, and finally Bolognese lords. In 1703 the painter moved from Modena to Bologna, where he died on the 4th of November 1705. Other details of his biography and work are sparse; in part, because still life was considered minor painting, sold mostly to private households. Many inventories list such works merely as a \\"still-life, leaving the precise subject undefined, and thus hindering a precise delineation of a reliable catalogue of Bettini works.

The average body length is 130 mm and the weight is about 27 grams. The African yellow house bat's face looks similar to that of a dog. The wings can be shades of either olive, grey or red. The back is covered with soft, short fur with a hint of brown, and the abdomen is covered with bright yellow fur. The color of the interfemoral membrane is brown and transparent. The lesser Asiatic yellow house bat (S. kuhlii) is smaller and leaner than the African yellow house bat. The total body length is about 120 mm and the average body weight is around 16 grams. The forearm length can extend up to 52 mm. A unique physical characteristic of the lesser yellow house bat is the tail, which is long and covered with the interfemoral membrane between the hind legs. The lesser Asiatic yellow house bat has pointy ears and a dog-like face with a dull muzzle. The lesser Asiatic yellow house bat has soft dense yellowish-brown fur on the back. The abdomen fur is composed of either a white or off-white color. The greater Asiatic yellow house bat (Scotophilus heathii) is yellow-brown in color with a small hint of green on the back. The average forearm length is about 58 mm. The face of the greater Asiatic yellow house bat, like the other two, also resembles a dog's face. The belly is covered with bright yellow fur.  Behavior and ecology  Although an individual may roost singly, yellow house bats are grouping mammals. The amount of grouping yellow house bats varies depending on the capacity of a living place. A large cave can generate colonies of less than a hundred; otherwise, groups of 12 to 30 bats max is the common grouping amount in artificial habitats. Some yellow house bats may have more than just one roosting site around the foraging areas. This behavior serves as a mechanism of avoiding predation, interpreted by biologists. Yellow house bats are quite common in suburban areas. They live in nooks and crannies of houses, and are very quiet. Thus, it is difficult for humans to detect their movements nearby because they tend to fly very low at a steady speed, and they only go out for food when the sun sets. Once they go out for food, they continue to feast for approximately 2 hours to reach their full satiety, then rest during daytime. = Reproduction = Like most other species of bats, yellow house bats give birth annually. A birth will often consist of two twin bats. The newborn bats are capable of flight at a very early age, allowing them to defend themselves and participate in the feeding frenzy. Yellow house bats have a unique method of ensuring its pups' survival. When these bats breed, the female will postpone fertilization if necessary in order to time the birth so that the pups are born when prey is at its peak in numbers. Yellow house bats are polygynous; they have multiple sexual partners during their mating season. The males of this species are competitive for female attention. They will defend the female if other males come into its territory.Crichton, Elizabeth G; Krutzsh, Philip H. Reproductive biology of bats. Academic Press, 2000 The range of a male's territory depends on the resources that are readily available at the time. The more abundant the food and shelter for the male, the smaller the territory it needs to defend. The female moves from roost-to-roost, usually in different male territories. Yellow house bats feed for about two hours a day. = Diet = Yellow house bats are fond of small insects. Depending on the habitats at the different regions, yellow house bats have different food preys. They prefer to feed on airborne insects, hymenopterans and dipterans, which can be found under the canopies of tall trees and riparian forests at nights. Small insects such as wasps, bees, moths, and beetles are all fearful of yellow house bats. Larger soft-bodied insects can also become yellow house bats' food. = Predators = Although secondary consumers such as owls, hawks, raccoons, snakes and gymnogene consume yellow house bats, these animals do not target bats as a primary food source due to the bats' nocturnal activity, while other predators tend to be diurnal.  Habitat and distribution  Scotophilus kuhlii from the Philippines. They are commonly found in man-made structures. Yellow house bats live in various habitats, ranging from woodland savannas, forests to mountains. However, they can also co-exist with humans in rural and urban areas. In the natural environments, they roost in dark caves, the dried leaves of palm trees, hollow tree trunks and so forth. In the vicinity of people, they live in crevices, cracks and holes in building walls, on the roofs of old houses and between overlapping corrugated iron sheets. Yellow house bats derive their name from their ease of adaptation to human presence. Whether they reside in natural surroundings or man-made constructions, they tuck themselves into narrow dark clefts. Some yellow house bats have a high tolerance for harsh weather; it is reported that African Yellow House Bats can live in both dry and moist Saharan habitats. The Sulawesi Yellow House Bat (Scotophilus celebensis) received its name from its location in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The population is currently unknown, as is the population trend. They tend to live in rather small colonies. The Sody's Yellow House Bat (Scotophilus collinus) can be found in western Java, Bali, Lombok, Flores, Timor, Semau and Rote islands in Indonesia, and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. They have also been found on Lembata and the Aru Islands, possibly also on two islands in Indonesia. Like the Sulawesi Yellow House Bat, very little to nothing about its population is known. The African Yellow (House) Bat (Scotophilus dinganii) has a range in sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal and the Gambia in the west to Ethiopia in the east, south to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. There is no recording of this bat's population either. The Greater Asiatic Yellow House Bat (Scotophilus heathii), also known as the Common Yellow House Bat, is located in South and Southeast Asia, ranging throughout China, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The bat has been documented from sea level to . The population is high and stable. The Lesser Asiatic Yellow House Bat (Scotophilu kuhlii) has a range similar to that of the Greater Asiatic Yellow House Bat's location, with the exception of some countries. The population trend is also the same as the Greater Asiatic Yellow House Bat. References Further reading * JACOBS, D. S.; EICK, G.N.; SCHOEMAN, M.C.; MATTHEE, C.A. 2006.

Biography Wheeler was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to William Archibald Wheeler and Harriet Marie Alden Wheeler (a descendant of John and Priscilla Alden), graduated in 1925 from George Washington University with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and was awarded the Ruggles Prize for excellence in Mathematics. Subsequently he studied physics at Johns Hopkins University until 1928. During his education he worked part-time at the National Bureau of Standards' Radio Laboratory, then from 1922 onwards with Prof. Louis Alan Hazeltine at Stevens Institute of Technology after discovering that they had independently invented the Neutrodyne receiver. (It entered large-scale production in 1923, and was the dominant receiver for most of the 1920s.) In 1924 he became Hazeltine Corporation's first employee, and in 1925 created the first radio receiver with a diode automatic volume control that maintained a constant sound level while tuning to broadcasts of differing strengths. AM radio receivers incorporating this circuit came into use about 1930, and it has been included in every set since. He led the Hazeltine laboratory 1930-1939, and during this time received patents for 126 inventions on a wide range of work including circuits, test equipment, acoustics, antennas, transmission lines, methods of calculation for inductance of coils (included in all relevant textbooks since the mid-1930s), skin effect, coupled circuit theory, television scanning theory, and analysis and design of wide- band TV amplifiers. In World War II Wheeler led work on Identification friend or foe (IFF) antennas for aircraft, surface vessels, submarines, and ground stations. By war's end, these \\"lifesaver antennas\\" had been placed on all Allied ships. In 1946 he founded Wheeler Laboratories, Inc., to develop microwave circuits and antennas for missile systems tracking and guidance radar. In 1959, when it became a Hazeltine subsidiary, he was named a Hazeltine director and vice-president. All told, Wheeler held 180 United States patents and received over fifty awards. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the Institute of Radio Engineers (1927) and of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1946), and awarded the IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award in 1940 \\"for his contribution to the analysis of wide-band high-frequency circuits particularly suitable for television\\", and the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1964 \\"for his analyses of the fundamental limitations on the resolution in television systems and on wideband amplifiers, and for his basic contributions to the theory and development of antennas, microwave elements, circuits, and receivers.\\" He was also a member of Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, and the Defense Science Board.

It is perhaps the second most popular section of whitewater for kayakers and canoeists in England, particularly for experienced paddlers. This section is followed on by the Dart Loop.  Overview  The section's length is approximately 4.3 miles (6.9 kilometres) in length. This section is loosely Graded at 4, but varies tremendously on rain and ground water levels. The Dart has been known to rise in minutes, changing drastically from a quiet trickle to a raging torrent.  Whitewater information  = Water levels = There is a gauge on the section below which gives an accurate level, however this requires you to run that section in order to see it. It is much easier to see the level at Newbridge before driving to the get in. This gauge is known as the slab,on the river left at the \\"putin\\" for the \\"loop\\" section. * Low: from the lowest point of the slab; if the water is not up to the top edge, the water level conditions are low. Starts as a technical Grade 3, and works up to a low Grade 4. * Medium: on or close to the edge is deemed medium water. Mainly Grade 4. * High: when the slab is covered high water conditions apply. Grade 4+, with the last few kilometres pushing up to Grade 5. * Spate: on the steps leading down to the water's edge is spate conditions. Later sections are a serious Grade 5+ undertaking. = Access point = The river East Dart runs through the car park, and access to the river can be made from here. The best \\"put in\\" is to walk out of the car park, over the road, and then down to the river's edge just downstream of the road bridge, just upstream from Dartmeet. = Notable rapids = The Upper Dart section has an easier run in and run out of the main section of rapids in the middle of the run. Within this middle section there are a number of features on the Upper Dart, only notable rapids are mentioned here. These are referred to in English White Water by the British Canoe Union.  Boulder Garden  The first significant steep rapid made up of numerous boulders. The entry is straight forward, and the twisting path makes for the first Class IV whitewater, where a long pool Eagle Flats awaits below.  Lucky Tor  An island divides the flow, with a long boulder garden down the left, and easy rapids to a steeper exit on the right. Towards the end of the island, the two channels join to make a steep exit into a bedrock feature.  Board Ledge  After a long straight, the river bends river and drops over 3 wide bedrock ledges, that at low and medium flows is straight forward, and the water level increases, more significant stoppers form on each of the ledges.  Mad Mile  A series of river wide ledges and slides, with a large pool, Mel Pool, halfway down. Much easier in low water, but at high levels many stoppers are powerful and hold swimmers. Sneak routes exist, and should be used. A series of ledges from Broadledge, finish in a diagonal ramp at Mel Pool, where in high water makes for a huge cushion wave and the centre of difficulties when in flood. Mel Pool Steps, has a number of routes, with the a series of small slides that leads to easier water. This section also belies its name – it's closer to half a mile.  Euthanasia Falls  A diagonal drop with cushion wave, chunky stopper, large rocks with the water funnelled between them. A chicken chute exists at certain levels.  Sharrah's Pool or Pandora's Box or Surprise Surprise  Complex rocky set of drops, complete with siphons. River left section has a slot, middle section has rocks with a high possibility of pinning. More dangerous at lower water levels, at high levels it can wash out. = Egress point = Newbridge is the official BCU egress point.

Say! JUMP. He is under the management of Johnny & Associates.  Early life  Chinen was born the son of Takashi Chinen, a former Japanese gymnast who won a bronze medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He is named after Yuri Osawa, an announcer, whose name his mother liked, but is written with different characters; the yu is a character often used in girl's names (侑 Yū) and the ri is taken from Li (李), a surname his mother thought common among Chinese gold medalist gymnasts.From an interview piece in Sports Hochi sold December 5, 2005.  Career  On June 2, 2003, Chinen entered Johnny & Associates as a trainee. Daiki Arioka, who would later also debut as a member of Hey! Say! JUMP, was also there during that time. On April 3, 2007, he began activities with the temporary group, Hey! Say! 7 starting with a public performance at a KAT-TUN concert. On September 21, 2007, he made his debut as a member of Hey! Say! JUMP. He was in a 2008 drama, One-Pound Gospel, as \\"Yoshihiko\\" in Episode 3, with Hey! Say! JUMP member Ryosuke Yamada and their senpai, Kazuya Kamenashi (KAT-TUN). In the same year, he played in the drama Sensei wa erai! as Umeno Wataru, along with other Hey! Say! JUMP members: Daiki Arioka, Ryosuke Yamada and Yuto Nakajima. In October 2008, he was in the drama called Scrap Teacher: Kyoshi Saisei as Yoshida Eitaro, along with the same Hey! Say! JUMP members that played with him in Sensei wa erai!. As a supporter of the Japanese volleyball team for the FIVB World Grand Prix 2009, he performed in June 2009 with Ryosuke Yamada and Nakayama Yuma w/ B.I.Shadow, which is composed of Kento Nakajima, Kikuchi Fuma, Hokuto Matsumura and Yugo Kochi as members of the temporary group NYC Boys. The \\"C\\" of NYC boys comes from the initials of his family name \\"Chinen\\". On March 2, 2010, a press release made by Johnny and Associates revealed that Chinen and Yamada would become members of a second Johnny's unit, NYC. They worked as a member of both Hey! Say! JUMP and NYC, which is a rarity in their talent agency. Ryo Nishikido (and formerly Uchi Hiroki) is the only such case of a Johnny's talent officially debuting in two groups (Kanjani8 and NEWS), and as NYC became an officially debuted Johnny's unit, Yamada and Chinen joined them in this unusual situation. In September 2011, he played the voice of Brainy in the Japanese-dubbed version of the film The Smurfs. Hey! Say! JUMP's ninth single, \\"Magic Power\\", was used as the theme song for the film. In January 2012, Chinen co-starred with his senpai Tomohisa Yamashita in a drama called Saiko no Jinsei no Owarikata: Ending Planner, in which he played Yamashita's younger brother. Chinen's character in the drama was a university student who was so focused on helping out a friend to the point of stealing money from his family's business. Atsuko Maeda and Nana Eikura joined the cast. In June 2012, It was announced that Chinen would have his first lead- role drama series based on the manga Sprout, by Atsuko Nanba, on July 7 on NTV.
