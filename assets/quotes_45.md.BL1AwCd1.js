The survey is using a very efficient near-infrared FOURSTAR instrument on the Magellan Telescopes, surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS.http://zfourge.tamu.edu/ Scientific aims ZFOURGE aims to create a benchmark of properties at z > 1 by deriving 1-2% accurate redshifts of ∼60,000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3\\\\. While majority of L∗ galaxies are too faint for spectroscopy, which resulted in inaccurate broadband photometric redshifts in the previous times. To mend that FourStar is equipped with innovative \\"medium-bandwidth\\" filters from 1 − 1.8μm, which enable redshifts to z = 3.5. This allows ZFOURGE to observe galaxy samples from the low mass at z > 1, to measure the value of mass and environment in transformation of galaxies, measure galaxy scaling relations. It will also explore the shape of the stellar mass function to z = 3, and find luminous galaxies at z = 6-9, and identify high-redshift 1.5 < z < 2.5 (proto)clusters.http://zfourge.tamu.edu/science/ Instruments The Fourstar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) is conducted using the FourStar imager (Persson et al. 2013) on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. It is using medium-band filters in the near-IR (van Dokkum et al. 2009) which allows for samplings at wavelengths that bracket the Balmer break of galaxies leading to more well-constrained photometric redshifts at 1 < z < 4 than with broadband filters alone. This dataset provides a comprehensive sampling of the 0.3 – 8 micron spectral energy distribution of galaxies. ZFOURGE is composed of three 11′ x 11′ pointings with coverage in the CDFS (Giacconi et al. 2002), COSMOS (Capak et al. 2007) and UDS (Lawrence et al. 2007). The 5sigma depth in a circular aperture of D=0.6\\" in the Ks band is 26.2-26.5 in the CDFS, COSMOS and UDS fields respectively at a typical seeing of ~0.4″.

He has been a Department Manager at National Institute of Technology (Norway) Teknologisk Institutt 1990-2000, and CEO of Groceries' Environmental Forum or DMF (DAGLIGVAREHANDELENS MILJØFORUM in Norwegian) 2001–2007 Advocating for environment Through his career and especially in deposit-return system for bottles, he became a known figure for advocating for environment in Norway, lecturing at academic gatherings and national TV programs to promote the idea of where he has promoted sustainable production with low impact on environment and recycling of one-way containers and avoid wasting food. In 2006 he won the Optimization Award of the year in Norway.

Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway. *Recycling cans in Norway Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014. The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.

Location Conservation units in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial. 15\\\\. Rio Amapá Sustainable Development Reserve The Rio Amapá Sustainable Development Reserve is in the municipality of Manicoré, Amazonas. It has an area of . The BR-319 highway runs along the northwest border, and the AM-464 highway runs along the northeast border. To the northeast the reserve adjoins the Matupiri State Park on the other side of AM-464. The Madeira River flows some distance from the southeast border of the reserve. To the southwest it adjoins the Lago do Capanã Grande Extractive Reserve. The Nascentes do Lago Jari National Park and the Igapó-Açu Sustainable Development Reserve are on the opposite side of the BR-319 highway. Environment The reserve is in the region between the Madeira and Purus rivers in an area drained by the Amapá and Jutaí rivers. The two rivers flow through the reserve from southwest to northeast. The Matupiri River forms in the reserve where the Jutaí and Novo rivers converge. The reserve is subject to seasonal floods. Vegetation includes terra firma forest with many Brazil nut trees, igapó, campina and campinarana. It is part of a complex of isolated savanna areas with high levels of endemic species, as well as species typical of the cerrado and the Amazona campina. There is high biodiversity. Some species such as Roosmalen's dwarf porcupine, (Sphiggurus roosmalenorum) are unique to the region. The rare Allobates caeruleodactylus frog is found in the reserve. Over 200 birds species have been recorded including four new species of the genera Leucopternis, Herpsilochmus, Hemitriccus and Cyanocorax. Traces of mammals such as the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), jaguar (Panthera onca) and cougar (Puma concolor) have been found, indicating that the environment is healthy. Large numbers of giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) are present in the Amapá River. Economy  There are no permanent residents in the reserve, but some families occupy the area seasonally to harvest Brazil nuts. There is high potential for scientific, ecological, educational and bird watching tourism. As of 2010 the reserve was used by 305 families with about 1,328 people in 19 communities. They are represented by the Central das Associações Agroestrativistas de Democracia (CAAD), which covers communities around the Madeira River and the AM-464 highway. By 2010 the Bolsa Floresta program was providing support to families using the reserve in exchange for commitment to conservation. As of 2016 the reserve was receiving support from the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. There has been some conflict with indigenous people of the Terra Preta community, who claim part of the reserve should be recognized as indigenous territory and at times have barred entry of others into the reserve. History The Rio Amapá Sustainable Development Reserve was created by Amazonas decree 25.041 of 1 June 2005 with the objectives of preserving nature and ensuring the means and conditions for assuring and improving the quality of life of the traditional extractive population. At time of creation most of the land in the reserve was state property or untitled land, although there were four private properties that extended into about of the reserve. On 19 October 2005 the Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (INCRA – National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as meeting the need of 300 families of small rural producers, who would qualify for PRONAF support. The deliberative council was created on 4 September 2007, and the management plan approved on 27 September 2010. The state-level conservation units in the BR-319 corridor are the Piagaçu-Purus, Rio Amapá, Rio Madeira, Igapó-Açu and Matupiri sustainable development reserves, Canutama Extractive Reserve, Canutama State Forest, Tapauá State Forest and Matupiri State Park. In December 2012 the Amazonas state government allocated more than R$6 million to these nine units, covering and 143 communities, to be coordinated by the State Center for Conservation Units (CEUC). The funding was for development of management plans, creation of management councils, environmental monitoring, land survey, and production and marketing.

She was a co-founder of Freedom House, an emergency ambulance service that assisted underserved populations in Pittsburgh in the 1960s and 1970s. She was also the first medical director of Magen David Adom, Israel's Red Cross Society, and was later called by colleagues, \\"Israel's Mother Teresa\\".  Early life  Nancy Lee Caroline was born on June 27, 1944 in Newton, Massachusetts to Leo and Zelda Caroline. From a young age, Nancy had a strong social conscience and a strong sense of her identity as a Jew. She began her medical career while still a teenager, working as a photographer and lab worker at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1966 she received a B.A. in linguistics from Radcliffe College and her M.D. from Case Western Reserve University in 1971. She stayed in Cleveland to complete her residencies, and then began a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh in 1973.  Freedom House project  Her mentor in the fellowship was Peter Safar known for his work in emergency medicine and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In 1974, the university received grant funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation to create a \\"curriculum for nation wide emergency medical services\\". Safar oversaw this project, but recruited Caroline as the medical director for Freedom House in 1974, one of the first EMS medical directors in the United States. The service had encountered police oppression and opposition as well as financial and administrative issues. By the time Caroline first became involved, the service was on the brink of collapse. However, she staged a successful comeback during her time as medical director. This service was the first to train and use EMT paramedics in America as well as EKG in the ambulances. Despite this, funding was cut in 1975 when the city launched its own ambulance service and Freedom House quickly folded. In 1976, she took over as deputy director for the emergency department of Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh. Nancy Caroline in front of Freedom House ambulance ca. 1975 Nancy Caroline with a motorcycle The Freedom House project, not to be confused with the organization created by Eleanor Roosevelt, was created to train ambulance attendants and teach paramedics in the Hill District. In segregated Pittsburgh, ambulance service was privatized and rarely answered calls in black neighborhoods. Police were the only emergency responders in most of these neighborhoods. The service was very successful and became the national model for cities' ambulances. Caroline wrote Emergency Care in the Streets, a textbook which was the first of its kind for paramedic training.  Israel and Magen David Adom  From the time she was very young, her identity as a Jew was very important to Nancy Caroline and shaped many of her actions and choices throughout her life. In 1977, she immigrated to Israel, becoming the first medical director of Magen David Adom, Israel's Red Cross Society. She created a program focused on emergency medical responses to terrorist attacks where the providers could respond within minutes. She also translated her EMS textbook into Hebrew.  East Africa  Nancy Caroline relocated to Kenya in 1982 to become Senior Medical Officer of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) in Nairobi. While working in the region, she managed the Flying Doctors emergency medical service which covers Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and southern Sudan. She conducted medical classes for health workers throughout the region and wrote a weekly health column for the Kenyan newspaper The Standard entitled \\"Ask Dr. AMREF\\". During her five-year stay in East Africa, she wrote a handbook on basic life support while consulting for the League of Red Cross societies and running seminars on first aid. She worked extensively with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church to provide better health care and nutrition in over 600 orphanages. She set up a non-profit organization, Agro-Africa Limited, the purpose of which is to set up small scale agricultural projects to ameliorate Kenya's massive droughts and help its victims. Finally, she was the director of medical programs for the American Joint Distribution Committee in Addis Ababa. In 1987, she returned to Israel and continued to work for AMREF, writing correspondence courses for rural health workers in Africa and developing training materials in emergency medicine.  Final years  Caroline was working until her death in 2002. She remained an adjunct visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh's medical school and, on a volunteer basis, as a physician and medical adviser of Magen David Adom, the Oncology Department of the Sheba Medical Center, and the Tel Hashomer Hospice. For the last fifteen years of her life, she dedicated her work to cancer treatment and hospice care in Israel. In 1995, concerned about the limited options she saw in hospice care in Israel, she founded the Hospice of Upper Galilee (HUG). In 2002, she married geneticist and molecular biologist Lazarus Astrachan, whom she had first met in medical school. They were only married a few months before she died. She was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and was cared for at the Hospice center she founded. She died December 12, 2002 at home in Metulla, Israel and was buried in her native Boston. Her husband died a few months later.

Since September 2011 it has been owned by the French group CAFOM distribution. History On 11 May 1964, Sir Terence Conran, a young furniture designer and restaurateur, opened the first Habitat store Fulham Road, London. It aimed to modernise the British furniture industry offering contemporary design at affordable prices. The brand then grew rapidly by anticipating the tastes of the public. In 1973, the company opened its first French store in Paris, in the Montparnasse district. For the next two decades, Habitat continued its expansion in Europe, opening stores in France, Spain and Germany. In the 1980s, Sir Terence Conran merged Habitat into the Storehouse plc group, which included British Home Stores, Richard Shops, Mothercare, Heal's and a 50% share of SavaCentre. In 1992, Habitat joined the Ikano group. Founded by the Swedish businessman Ingvar Kamprad, founder and owner of IKEA, Ikano consisted of independent companies operating in different sectors. During this period, the Kamprad family recruited new talents, such as Vittorio Radice, and consolidated the Habitat brand on the furniture and interior markets. In 1998, Tom Dixon was also asappointed director of design. In September 2011, Habitat joined the CAFOM group (except the United Kingdom subsidiary). Founded by Hervé Giaoui in 1985, CAFOM is an independent French retail group specialising in home improvements. The group was already present on the French market through its online retail site Vente- unique.com and with a dozen stores overseas as well. In 2011, French designer Pierre Favresse was appointed artistic director of the brand Habitat. In 2014, Habitat celebrates 50 years of existence, and uses big names to celebrate the event: Sir Terence Conran and Thierry Marx.

E. van Vogt, originally published in Astounding in January 1943. The story involves time travel and is told in a non-linear fashion with multiple plot twists. Plot summary Drake, a travelling salesmen for the Quik-Rite pen company, awakes in the hospital with no memories of the last two weeks. His boss tells him that he disappeared in the middle of his last business trip. In an attempt to piece together what happened, he sets out to recreate the journey. While waiting for a train, another traveller, Kellie, remembers him. Drake explains his predicament, and Kellie recounts their last encounter. The two met on a train two weeks ago. When Drake explained he sold pens, Kellie produced a fountain pen he purchased from a girl who boarded their train on an earlier trip. It condensed ink from the atmosphere, so it never ran out, could be adjusted to print in any color, and cost only $1. When an older man next to them asks to examine it, it broke, and the man gave Kellie a dollar for its replacement. Soon after, the girl, Selanie, boarded the train. This time she was selling a folding travel cup that filled itself with a selection of refreshing drinks when opened up. As she made her way through the cabin to sell them to eager customers, Drake showed her the broken pen and asked if he could buy a new one. Startled, she asked how it broke. When Drake pointed to the man, she turned to look at him and then ran from the train. Drake followed her off the train. That was the last Kellie saw of Drake. Drake returns to the station where he exited the train two weeks earlier, and learns from some locals that he disappeared after following Selanie to a motorhome. The following day, an old man appeared in town, and stole all of the gear Selanie had sold, leaving behind a dollar bill for each one. Drake visits the location of the motorhome, but it is no longer there. Learning little else, he travels to the nearest town and books into a hotel. While sitting in the lounge he overhears someone breaking an object and offering to pay a dollar for it. He turns to confront the man. Drake awakes in an apartment filled with advanced technology. He spends a day exploring what appears to be an enormous empty city before returning to the apartment at night to sleep. He awakes next to an unknown woman, who reveals herself to be a somewhat older version of the girl from the train, now apparently his wife. Utterly confused, Drake is taken to meet someone in authority, who explains the situation. Drake is a member of the Possessors, a time-travel police force. Selanie's father is a time traveller who hoped to upset the formation of the Possessors by selling advanced technology in the 1940s when the Possessors were first forming. Drake had been sent to sabotage his plans, disguised as someone interested in stealing their pen's technology. Had he been successful, the three of them would be left trapped in the past for a time, where he and Selanie would fall in love. But something went wrong, and he was dumped two weeks in the future. The story ends with Drake preparing to leave on the mission once again, this time prepared to properly surprise Selanie's father. Selanie's farewell demonstrates that this attempt must have been successful. Versions The Search was included in 1952's Destination: Universe!, the first of a number of Van Vogt short story collections, and again in Transfinite, the 2003 collection. The Search also forms part of one of Van Vogt's fix-up novels, Quest for the Future (1970). The story remains similar to the original, but the names are changed to follow the overarching story of the fix-up. The results are not considered to be a success, and the low quality of these fix- ups has been suggested as one of the reasons for van Vogt's decline in popularity.

It contains the headquarters of the Ogbadibo Local Government Area. Otuba means to gather together. The name Otukpa is a symbol of Unity, Defence and friendship.  Background  Three men; Oono, Oodo Ogodo and Ameh Ochagbaha coming from diverse directions insearch of fortunes converged at a spot popularly known today as Oto. The men entered into a pact to stay together and forge their fortunes forward collectively. They decided on a suitable name for the area known today as OTUKPA. The original name ‘Otuba’ which means “to gather or together” points to significant elements of unity among them. The name Otukpa is a symbol of Unity, Defence and friendship. Otu-le-kpa, ugboga bo glan (Prof. Abimaje Akpa) Anthony Inedu Ijika Akoto in his book titled ‘ The Making of Otukpa Land’ has the following to say about the name OTUKPA; ‘ While writing on the etymology of the name “Otukpa” the works of Captain G.D.C. Money plays a pivotal edifying role. According to Money, Otukpa was formed from two Idoma words: ‘Oto’ a name of a village in the then settlement and ‘Ukpa” a sacred plant believed to contain medicinal properties and healing powers. It was in the mist of the plants ‘Ukpa’ in a village called ‘Oto’ that the elders of the three clans Ai-Oono, Ai-Oodo and Ai-Ochagbaha had a convent and pact of love, friendship and defence. Oto and Ukpa became so symbolic among the people, hence the name ”Oto Ukpa” was combined to form OTUKPA’ ≤←←§±≤≠≈  Early Settlement  The Ai-Oono, Ai-Oodo, Ai-Ochagbaha clans who occupy the area known today as Otukpa have had and practiced communal life system since their arrival to the present Otukpa. The clans occupy a portion of the present otukpa. The clans occupy a portion of the waterless ridge of hills which form the south –western portion of the Idoma division. The language of the people is Idoma. The whole area hitherto full of forest has gradually deforestated so as to give way to agriculture to support the increasing population. The only forest reserves in the vicinity of the villages are retained for purpose of defence, game and worship of deities.

It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof and stone foundation. A period 1-1/2 story brick ell extends to the rear (south), to which a modern wood-frame ell has been attached. The main facade, facing Quechee Main Street, is five bays wide, with sash windows set in rectangular openings. The openings on the ground floor are topped by blind arches. The main entrance is set in a wider arched opening, with flanking sidelight windows exhibiting tracery, and a multilight arched transom window above. The interior retains original Federal period woodwork, including paneling, chair rails, and a partially hung circular staircase in the main hall. with The house was probably built not long after Jedediah Strong purchased the land in 1815.

Biography  Mathieu Pacaud is the son of Danièle Pacaud and the starred chef Bernard Pacaud. He grew up in the middle of the most renowned places of high gastronomy, influenced by his father, head chef of the gastronomic restaurant L’Ambroisie, in Paris. The Corsican roots of his mother will have a significant influence on his cooking. When he was 15 years old, Mathieu Pacaud started his career at the renowned two Michelin-starred restaurant Le Jamin, located in the 16th district of Paris. He stayed for two years under the direction of the famous French chef Benoît Guichard, before joining the luxurious Plaza Athénée, as a chef de partie. At 20, he decided to leave his home country for Beirut, Lebanon, where he ran one, and eventually five French restaurants. When he went back to France in 2003, he began working with his father, the chef Bernard Pacaud, who holds three Michelin stars since 1988 at l'Ambroisie. In only six years, Mathieu Pacaud worked his way up the ladder until he reached the position of Chef, alongside his father, heading L'Ambroisie. They now run the restaurant and co-create the menu. He then created MBP Conseil, his consulting company. He first opened Hexagone in January 2015, a fusion of a cocktail bar and a contemporary restaurant. A few months later, he created Histoires, a restaurant at Hexagone. Only a year after the restaurants’ opening, the Michelin guide attributed one star to Hexagone and two stars to Histoires, a historic performance in the story of the Michelin.

In 1885, it became the Grocers' and Vintners' Association of Dublin, and it later became the \\"Irish National Union of Vintners', Grocers' and Allied Trades Assistants\\". The union merged into the British National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, but many of its former members wished to retain an independent Irish organisation, and split away in 1917, reforming under the old name.Arthur Marsh and John B.

The union joined the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1919, but left again in 1923. In 1945, it affiliated to the Congress of Irish Unions, and then transferred to its successor, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Over time, the union became strongly associated with bar staff. Although the majority of its members were based in Ireland, it also had branches in London, which attracted membership from workers at Irish pubs in the city.

Under its aegis, the first medical college for women, the Ladies' Medical College was founded in 1864, albeit with limited aims and a short life-span. Formation The society was established at a time when women were effectively barred from becoming doctors in the UK by the Medical Act 1858, which required physicians to pass examinations offered by any of 19 examination boards, none of which permitted the admission of women. The practice of midwifery was unregulated, and was undertaken either by self- trained working class women, or by male physicians. The male medical establishment, as a rule, opposed encroachment on what it considered to be its territory by women. The Society was established by James Edmunds, a physician at the British Lying-In Hospital in Holburn, and the social reformer Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury acted as its first president. Patrons included the rising Frederick Temple Blackwood, Henry Edward Manning, George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, and Catherine Gladstone, wife of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Professionals who lent support included physicians serving at a number of London hospitals, and William Buchanan, a former master of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Concerns providing the impetus for the foundation of the society included a desire to raise the status of midwifery such that it could be considered a profession for educated women; to respect the feelings of female patients who preferred to be tended by female practitioners; and to save lives, both by the effect of better training and practice, but also by reducing infections introduced by male physicians who in their wider work came into contact with disease, surgery and post-mortems. Ladies' Medical College In 1864, the society founded the Ladies' Medical College, initially offering a course in obstetrics and supporting and related subject matter, with a somewhat broader curriculum by 1870. From 1867 students gained clinical experience at the British Lying-In Hospital. 14 students entered in the first year of operation, 69 by 1867 and 84 in 1870. The medical profession, in general, reacted very poorly to the College, espousing various grounds in the British Medical Journal: that the midwifery role should remain subordinate to the (male) physician; that despite its name, the college provided an insufficient education; or that the colleges aims were too high. Feminist journals such as the Alexandra Magazine and Englishwoman’s Journal were more supportive. That the College's ambitions were limited appears to have limited its life-span. Aspiring female physicians were concerned with access to the acquisition of credentials enabling them to be listed on the Medical Register, and these the College did not offer. In 1872, the Society unsuccessfully sought funds to extend the curriculum offered at the College, at the same time renaming it The Obstetrical College for Women' and in 1873 the College closed. Position on medical degrees for women The society appears to have been divided within itself on the question of the admission of women to medical degrees. On the face of it, full admission of women was a stated goal of the society as late as its 6th annual meeting. Equally, James Edmunds spoke against the proposition three years earlier, and the society's main instrument, the College, was deliberately limited in its scope. The Society pursued a half-way house, lobbying parliament for the extension of the Medical Register to cover \\"Licentiates in Midwifery\\", and to this end issued its own certificates in midwifery training. Closure The Society closed in 1869, partly from lack of funds, and partly because it had lost the support of women wishing for a full and complete training curriculum. A year after the closure of the Society's College, the London School of Medicine for Women - unconnected with the Society and arising out of the experience and reaction to the Edinburgh Seven - opened in 1874 to provide full medical training, and the UK Medical Act of 1876 enabled the medical authorities to license all qualified applicants irrespective of gender.

The cliff rises to at its summit, the highest point on the Monmouthshire bank of the Wye. The area is traversed by the Wye Valley Walk, and is also a popular venue for rock climbing. Access is provided by the A466 road which passes along the valley immediately below the cliff face. The site has been appreciated by visitors since the time of the Wye Tour in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It contains several viewing points constructed so that visitors can gain a full appreciation of the area's Picturesque landscape, including the Eagle's Nest viewpoint which was built in 1828 for its landowner the Duke of Beaufort as an extension to the walking path network already developed around the nearby Piercefield estate. It has been described as \\"one of the most impressive viewpoints in the British Isles\\".C. J. O. Evans, Monmouthshire: Its History and Topography, 1953, pp. 524–525 Name According to Joseph Bradney, the location was mentioned by Nennius as Huit gwynt, from the Welsh words Chwyth gwynt meaning \\"the blowing of the wind\\", and this gives the origin of the feature's modern name rather than it being derived from the words \\"Wye\\" and \\"cliff\\".Joseph Bradney, A History of Monmouthshire: Vol.IV, The Hundred of Caldicot, 1929 (reprinted 1994), p.46, Wyndcliff gives its name to Wyndcliffe Court, a country house about to the west of the Eagle's Nest. Geology and ecology Ancient woodland on the Wyndcliff Like nearby Black Cliff, the crag is formed from strata of the Black Rock Limestone Subgroup (traditionally referred to as the 'Lower Dolomite'). It sits atop the less competent strata of the Avon Group (traditionally the 'Lower Limestone Shale') which have collapsed under the loading. The broad landslipped mass extends to the riverbank.

From 1824, the building of a new turnpike road between St Arvans and Redbrook allowed greater ease of access to the Wyndcliff area through which the road passed. It became the focus of carriage trips by tourists wishing to see the views, and numbers grew in particular with the establishment of steam packet services between Bristol and Chepstow which allowed day trips to be made.Wye Valley AONB Partnership, Overlooking the Wye: a Guide to the Heritage of the Wye Valley, 2013, p.65, The Duke of Beaufort, who owned the land, was responsible through his steward Osmond Wyatt for installing a path known as the 365 Steps (though the modern number of steps is closer to 300) from the road to the top of the cliff. There, Wyatt constructed a split-level viewing platform called the Eagle's Nest, in 1828. A small building, Moss Cottage, where refreshments and informal entertainment were provided, was also built beside the path, with a table made from a slab of walnut tree from inside Chepstow Castle.Ivor Waters, About Chepstow, 1952, p.74 The cottage later fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1950s. In 1834, there was a proposal to build an observatory on the site, but it was never constructed. The view from the Eagle's Nest includes the farmland on the opposite bank of the Wye at Lancaut; the cliff face at Wintour's Leap; Chepstow Castle and the adjoining town; the mouth of the Wye at Beachley; the Severn estuary, Severn Bridge and Second Severn Crossing; and the Cotswold Hills beyond. Prince Puckler-Muskau, who visited the Eagle's Nest in 1828, said: \\"The grouping of this landscape is perfect ... I know of no picture more beautiful.\\"Julian Mitchell, The Wye Tour and its Artists, 2010, p.75, Samuel Taylor Coleridge described the view as \\"the whole world imaged in its vast circumference\\". \\"The Picturesque Wye Tour: Eagle's Nest\\", Wye Valley AONB Partnership.

On September 13, 2016, one of those injured, a pregnant woman, died, bringing the death toll up to 15. Militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf reportedly claimed responsibility for the bombing but later denied responsibility, claiming that their allies, the Daulat Ul-Islamiya, were responsible for the incident as a show of sympathy to the group. Disgruntled vendors are also being considered as possible perpetrators. On October 2, 2016, three of the ten suspects were arrested. The arrested are linked to the Maute Group which has ties with the Abu Sayyaf. Background On August 28, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to destroy Abu Sayyaf, after the bandit group beheaded an 18-year-old boy on 22 August 2016, when the victim's family failed to pay ransom. On July 7, 2016, Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte announced that Davao City is facing threats from terror group ISIS, prompting authorities to increase security in the area. He however got criticized for such announcement. After the night market bombing, Duterte admitted he received a bomb threat two days before the incident stating that an attack will occur either in General Santos or Davao City. Duterte opted not to release the info to the public, citing that the bomb threat also told him not to publicize the threat. Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio had previously ordered the popular night market to be closed due to \\"a number of violations and complaints\\". It however reopened on 13 August following meetings with the vendors and provided that all vendors follow stricter rules set by the city government. Attacks The bombing took place around 22:17 PST at a night market along Roxas Avenue in the city's central business district, some 100 meters from the main campus of the Ateneo de Davao University. Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte issued a statement shortly after the attacks to confirm the report on the number of casualties. He also said it was too early to tell who may be behind the explosion and assured the public that the authorities are on top of the incident. At the Command Conference of the Police Region Office 11 in Davao the night following the incident, Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa confirmed that the Davao blast was a terror attack and that an improvised explosive device was used. Suspected perpetrators The Islamist militant group Abu Sayyaf, through its spokesman, reportedly claimed responsibility for the alleged bombing as it called on the mujahideen in the country to unite against the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The group later denied the reports by saying that it was their allies, the Daulat Ul-Islamiya responsible for the explosion saying that the Daulat's actions was to sympathize with the Abu Sayyaf. Its spokesman said that the attacks will not stop unless Duterte were to adopt the hadith as law of the country and he himself seek conversion to Islam. Before the attack, the terrorist group reportedly vowed retaliation against the Philippine government for launching a major offensive against it recently in Sulu. The City Government of Davao has offered 3 million pesos bounty for the eventual arrest of the perpetrators. Two million pesos will be given for those who can give information on the whereabouts of the bombing suspects, while another 1 million pesos will be given for those who can arrest and bring the suspects to the authorities. =Individuals= The Philippine National Police's investigation remarked the similarities of the IED used in the bombing to the one used by Abdul Manap Mentang at the 2005 Valentine's Day bombings which was also detonated at the night market. Like in the 2005 bombings, the 2016 bombings used an IED is a mortar shell and fitted with a remote detonator. This finding caused the police to suspect that Mentang, who was at large at the time of the explosion, may be directly involved in the 2016 bombings. As of 5 September, the PNP had three \\"persons of interest\\" in connection with the bombings based from testimonies from witnesses. One of these three persons is a medium-built male in his 40s who was seen leaving a bag under a massage table. The two other persons of interest are female. On October 4, 2016, three men who are linked to the Maute Group were arrested through the joint efforts of the police and armed forces and were presented to the media on October 7. The men were TJ Tagadaya Macabalang, Wendel Apostol Facturan, and Musali Mustapha. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that the Maute Group has already established links with the Abu Sayaff and that there are \\"indications\\" that the group is aligning themselves with ISIS. There are seven other suspects which were yet to be arrested. Reactions =Domestic= ;Government The Philippine National Police has placed all of its units nationwide under full alert following the attack while the Davao City Police Office has also set up a hotline specifically for use of the victims' relatives. President Rodrigo Duterte declared a \\"state of emergency on account of lawless violence\\" in the Philippines as the whole city of Davao was placed on lockdown. Under the declaration, the Armed Forces of the Philippines are given the authority to conduct law enforcement operations normally done by the Philippine National Police, but unlike martial law, the writ of habeas corpus is not suspended. While no nationwide curfew has been imposed, residents were advised to stay indoors as police and soldiers set up checkpoints and search vehicles and houses. Duterte also postponed a scheduled state visit to Brunei that would have taken place from 4 to 5 September. ;Non- state parties On 4 September 2016, the Communist Party of the Philippines has accused the United States of instigating the bomb attack.

He was a founder of the New York Psychiatrical Society. He was a Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell Medical College in New York. He was the grandson of Louis McLane and Alexander Hamilton, and in 1910 he wrote The Intimate Life of Alexander Hamilton, a biography of his paternal grandfather. Early life and family Louis, 1851 Hamilton was born in Brooklyn in New York on October 6, 1848, the son of Philip Hamilton (1802–1884) and his wife, Rebecca McLane (1813–1893). His paternal grandfather was an American founding father, Alexander Hamilton. His maternal grandfather, Louis McLane (1786–1857), was a member of the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, the 10th Secretary of the Treasury, the 12th Secretary of State, and a two time U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom. His mother's younger brother was Robert Milligan McLane (1815–1898), a Governor of Maryland and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, France, and China. As a boy and later on, Hamilton ate Christmas dinners at the old-fashioned English home of David Colden (1733–1784), a son of Lt. Gov. Cadwallader Colden. He also ate Thanksgiving dinner every year with Charlotte Augusta Gibbes Astor (1825–1887), the wife of John Jacob Astor III and mother of Willie Astor (1848–1919), a friend of his who later moved abroad due to constant ridicule in the press and became an English peer. As a young teenager during the American Civil War, Hamilton took part from 1861 until 1863 in \\"repeated drillings, and marchings in the Rochester Home Guards, a sort of Boy Scout organisation.\\" Hamilton's older brother, Captain Louis McLane Hamilton, enlisted as a volunteer in the 22nd New York Militia in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Gettysburg as part of the 3rd U.S. Infantry. After the war, he served in the 7th U.S. Cavalry under General George Armstrong Custer. Louis was killed while leading his command during Custer's 1868 attack on Black Kettle's Cheyenne encampment in the Battle of Washita River. Career =Early medical practice= Hamilton received his medical education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, graduating in 1870. The subject of his thesis was galvanopuncture, the application of electrical current to needles inserted in the body. He was the recipient of the highest faculty prize and the Harsen Prize medal upon his graduation. Specializing in \\"nervous diseases,\\" Hamilton was one of the first medical practitioners in America to use electricity for cauterization; his text on Clinical Electro-Therapeutics was published in 1873. Hamilton also invented an improved dynamometer, which he described in an April 1874 article in the Psychological Journal and Medico-Legal Journal. During the 1870s, Hamilton wrote numerous articles for medical journals on subjects including epilepsy and tremors, and was editor of the American Psychological Journal. He lectured on nervous diseases at the Long Island College Hospital. He was physician in charge of the New York State Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System, and served as a visiting surgeon to an epileptic and paralytic hospital on Blackwell's Island. In 1879, he won the highest prize given by the American Medical Association. During his early years of practice, he was the doctor to much of the old New York society that lived about Washington Square, lower Fifth Avenue and St. John's Park. In his autobiography, Hamilton wrote that \\"New York society of the best kind was exclusive and conservative, and something besides money was then required to get a foothold in its midst.\\" In the early 1870s, he associated socially with the De Peyster, Livingston, Van Rensselaer, Schuyler, De Rham, Wilkes, Delano, Forbes, Schermerhorn, Wetmore, Minturn, Grinnell, Winthrop, King, Duer, Swarthout, Duncan families, which like the Hamilton family were prominent in New York society. After the Civil War, however, Hamilton was witness to their gradual decline and thinning out, as they were overtaken in the forefront of society by so-called \\"new money\\" people who had earned their wealth, for example, in the Comstock Lode. In the 1870s, Hamilton served as a member of the Coroner's jury in New York; in an 1874 inquest, he agreed with William A. Hammond that hydrophobia was a disease of the nerve centers and not a blood poison. In 1874, he presented a paper titled Suicide in Large Cities, with Reference to Certain Sanitary Conditions which tend to Prevent its Moral and Physical Causes at the Health Congress of the American Public Health Association in Philadelphia. In this paper, he argued that suicides were more strongly felt in metropolitan areas due to the use of intoxicating drinks or narcotics, nervous disease, seduction, immoral habits, and disappointment. =Public medical work= Allan McLane Hamilton, By the 1880s, Hamilton had become well known as an \\"alienist,\\" a term that was then used to describe a psychiatrist or psychologist. He was an early expert in what is now known as forensic psychology, including evaluating defendants to determine their competency to stand trial. From 1900 to 1903, Hamilton was a professor of mental diseases at Cornell University Medical College. Hamilton was called as an expert witness in several of the most prominent cases of his time, including the murder trials of the assassins of presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley: * In 1881–1882, during the trial of Charles J. Guiteau for the assassination of President Garfield, Hamilton gave evidence on the subject of Guiteau's sanity. Hamilton always maintained that Guiteau was perfectly sane and a \\"shrewd scamp.\\" * In 1892, Hamilton provided evidence during the much publicized murder trial of Carlyle W. Harris, who had killed his wife, Mary Helen Potts. * In 1901, Hamilton gave evidence during the trial of Leon Czolgosz, for the assassination of President William McKinley, who had been shot and killed during the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Hamilton was sent for by Ansley Wilcox, a distinguished Buffalo lawyer at whose home the President died. Contrary to Guiteau's case, Hamilton felt that Czolgosz did not receive an adequate defense and that indeed he was \\"a defective who had long been drifting to paranoia,\\" and was likely influenced by the yellow journalism of the time, which had been vociferously attacking McKinley in the press. * In 1906, he testified at the murder trial of Harry K. Thaw, who had murdered New York architect Stanford White, a friend of Hamilton's, in 1906. * In 1907 Hamilton was asked by George Washington Glover II to evaluate his mother, Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs as part of a lawsuit called the \\"Next friends suit\\".Bates and Dittemore 1932, 411, 413, 417. Hamilton met personally with Eddy to evaluate her and remained in occasional correspondence during the suit. Hamilton told The New York Times that the attacks on Eddy were the result of \\"a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself,\\" and that \\"there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity.\\"The New York Times 1907. Dr. Edward French, who was with Hamilton, agreed with his assessment, finding \\"not the least evidence of mental weakness or incompetency.\\" =Honors= In the late 1890s, Hamilton appears to have visited Scotland, where in 1899 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir James Crichton-Browne, Sir Thomas Grainger Stewart, Sir John Batty Tuke and Sir James Dewar. In 1912, he received an honorary LLD degree from Hamilton College on the centennial celebration of the college which was named after his grandfather. Personal life =Biography of Alexander Hamilton= In 1910, Hamilton wrote a biography of his paternal grandfather, Alexander Hamilton, titled The Intimate Life of Alexander Hamilton, which was published by Scribner & Sons. In 1911, he published an op-ed article in The New York Times protesting Gertrude Atherton's characterization of his grandfather in her novel, The Conqueror, as someone \\"whose life was dotted with questionable affairs and escapades with women.\\" =Marriages and family life= Hamilton was married twice, first on May 25, 1874, to Florence Rutgers Craig (1854–1925), the daughter of William Pickney Craig and Hannah Sitgreaves (née Reeves) Craig (1815–1889), in Baltimore, Maryland. The Villa Castello, Capri, painted by Charles Caryl Coleman, 1895 In 1894, Hamilton visited the Island of Capri off the coast of Italy, and Villa Narcissus, the Capri home of his friend Charles Caryl Coleman, an artist. Coleman located a home for Hamilton on Capri, near his own, and Hamilton moved into the 800-year-old home and garden known as Villa Castello. While in Capri, Hamilton befriended Dr. Axel Munthe of Castello Barbarossa, Dr. Emil von Behring, and Dr. Ignazio Cerio. He became close there with Lord John Norton, with writers Norman Douglas, Marion Crawford, and Maxim Gorky, and with the painter George Bernard Butler (who had served with Hamilton's brother in the Civil War). After a formal separation from his wife Florence, Hamilton was living and working in London when he met May Copeland Tomlinson (1870–1924), whom he had seen as a patient. Tomlinson was a wealthy Englishwoman, born in London, who also had a summer home on Capri. On March 27, 1902, shortly after obtaining an official divorce in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, he married for the second time. May Copeland Tomlinson was an author of articles on George Eliot and a translator of Honoré de Balzac. She had also obtained a divorce in Sioux Falls from her former husband, Frederick Tomlinson, an architect. She had one daughter, Madeline Tomlinson, who was living in New York in 1910. Hamilton's only child, Louis McLane Hamilton (1876–1911), named after Hamilton's late brother, was born to his first wife Florence. Louis was a lieutenant in the United States Army, and served in the Spanish–American War. He was twice court-martialed, once for using offensive language in front of another officer's wife, and the second time for being absent without leave and making a false report to his superior officer. In both cases, President Theodore Roosevelt intervened to commute the sentence, preventing Louis's dismissal from the Army. Louis died in Paris on August 29, 1911, after a long illness. =Death= Allan McLane Hamilton died on November 23, 1919, at his summer residence, Fair Meadows, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, aged 71. He is buried in Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery outside New York.

Communities are mobilised around their needs and organised to stimulate more effective demand for services.  Philosophy and approach  The centre piece of the RSP approach is social mobilisation of the poor in order to enable them to participate directly in decisions that affect their lives and prospects. Communities are mobilised and asked to indicate their priorities through a process of dialogue, catalysed by the programmes. They are then encouraged to assume responsibility for implementing and maintaining the projects, reflecting their own priorities, with technical and financial support being extended by the programmes. The model upholds civil society as central to addressing the economic, socio- political and cultural causes of poverty. It also subverts the conventional model of social development, which assumed that either central government or outside agencies would lift people out of poverty.  Role of RSPN  The RSPN is a strategic platform for the RSP's. It provides capacity building support to them and assists them in policy advocacy and donor linkages.

The proposal included construction of a second lodge near the base of the glacial moraine known as \\"The Bowl,\\" a new chairlift in the Middle Branch watershed serving of new intermediate and advanced terrain, and 200 additional parking spaces. Local conservation groups objected to the expansion plan, citing concerns about the effects of soil erosion on streams and wetlands in Ashland's Municipal Watershed, as well as concerns for the Old-growth forest, Inventoried roadless area and sensitive wildlife such as the Pacific fisher (animal) that exist in the proposed expansion area. In February 2000, the United States Forest Service issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) considering the MAA expansion proposal. The draft EIS drew over 6,000 public comments, about half of which supported the MAA plan and half opposed. In June 2001, Jack Williams, supervisor of the Rogue River- Siskiyou National Forest, announced preparation of a second draft EIS to address substantive public comment regarding alternatives to the MAA proposal. In July 2003, the Forest Service issued its second draft EIS on expansion, this one with a broader range of alternatives. The first option was no action. The second option was the MAA's expansion proposal. The third option would develop half of the MAA proposal on the east side of the Middle Branch watershed, and avoid development on the west side of that creek, thereby reducing impacts to the McDonald Peak Inventoried roadless area. The fourth option would develop new ski facilities east of the existing ski area on \\"The Knoll,\\" instead of in the Middle Branch watershed. The fifth option was a community proposal to develop the ski area largely within its existing footprint. The sixth option slightly modified the MAA proposal with different ski run placement and a wetland crossing design introduced by the Forest Service. The second draft EIS drew a similar level of public comment as the first one, with about 50 percent favouring the MAA plan and half opposed or supportive of other alternatives. In September 2004, forest supervisor Scott Conroy issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and a Record of Decision (ROD) that approved a blend of alternatives 2 and 6 incorporating most elements of the original MAA expansion proposal. The Forest Service received 28 notices of appeal and denied all of them. In January 2005, three organizations—Oregon Natural Resources Council, Headwaters and Sierra Club—and an individual, Eric Navickas, filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Oregon alleging that the ROD approving the expansion violated the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In February 2007, District Judge Owen M. Panner granted summary judgment to the Forest Service stating, \\"You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.\\" ONRC, Headwaters and Sierra Club, but not Navickas, appealed Panner's judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A motions panel of the appellate court issued a preliminary injunction that prevented implementation of the expansion while the conservation groups' appeal was under review. The motions panel cited a likelihood of irreparable harm to the City of Ashland's water quality, and to sensitive Pacific fisher (animal), a rare forest carnivore known to exist in the expansion area. In September 2007, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals ruled in an opinion written by Circuit Judge Milan Smith that the Forest Service violated federal law in four ways when it approved the ski area expansion. Specifically, the 2004 ROD approving expansion: # Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA by failing to designate and manage geologically unstable landslide terrain as Riparian Reserve. # Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA by failing to recognise and observe mandatory soil disturbance limits on Restricted Watershed lands. # Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA with an arbitrary and capricious biological evaluation of effects to Pacific fisher. # Violated the NEPA by failing to disclose significant cumulative effects to the Siskiyou Crest biological corridor used by Pacific fisher. The appellate opinion specifically noted that the Aquatic Conservation Strategy of the Northwest Forest Plan \\"prohibits the Forest Service from 'using mitigation or planned restoration as a substitute for preventing habitat degradation' within Riparian Reserves, and explains that 'priority must be given to protecting existing high-quality habitat' rather than compensating for management actions that degrade existing habitat through mitigation and restoration.\\" It remanded the case to the District Court with instruction to enjoin the ski area expansion \\"until the Forest Service has corrected the NFMA and NEPA violations we find in this opinion.\\" In October 2007, Linda Duffy, ranger of the Siskiyou Mountains Ranger District, announced the Forest Service would produce a supplemental EIS to remedy legal violations identified by the Court of Appeals. In May 2011, the Forest Service issued a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) for the Mt. Ashland Ski Area Expansion. The FSEIS identified approximately 67 acres of Riparian Reserve on geologically unstable lands including multiple locations where the expansion would directly impact hazardous landslide terrain. It further disclosed that expansion would render approximately 500 acres of forest habitat unusable to Pacific fisher. Concurrent with the 2011 FSEIS, forest supervisor Conroy issued a Supplemental Record of Decision affirming the 2004 ROD without modification. Subsequently, Judge Panner lifted the court's injunction. In 2013, the Mt. Ashland Ski Area successfully implemented several projects identified in its expansion plans,http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest- news/index.ssf/2013/03/mount_ashland_ski-area_expansi.html including a 20% increase to its parking lot capacity, widening the Sonnet beginner ski run and several other ski runs. In October 2016, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals granted summary judgment to the Forest Service in a separate complaint filed by Oregon Wild, Sierra Club and Center for Biological Diversity, holding the federal agency was not required to produce another impact statement on the expansion project.  Current Ski Area Expansion Planning  As of September 2020, the Mt. Ashland Association has made no public announcements of plans to develop additional ski trails in the East Fork of Ashland Creek.

She was one of two nursing supervisors from Canada who served in South Africa and was decorated for her service by the Duke of York, later King George V, in 1901. Early life Deborah Jane Hurcomb was born in 1867 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to Catharine (née Montgomery) and Philip William Hurcomb. Hurcomb's mother was Canadian and her father was a British military officer. A few weeks after her birth, her parents moved to Alverstoke, Hampshire, England. She grew up and was educated there, before the family returned to Canada. Hurcomb completed her nursing training at the Montreal General Hospital. Career Hurcomb began working as a private nurse in Montreal and around 1899 moved to Ottawa to become the superintendent of the Perley Home for Incurables. In 1900, she volunteered to serve as a nurse during the Second Boer War and became a superintendent of the second Canadian nursing contingent. The nurses were given a rank equivalent to that of a lieutenant and were treated as officers. In February 1900, Hurcomb sailed aboard the S. S. Laurentian with nurses Margaret L. Horne, Margaret Clotilde MacDonald and Marcella P. Richardson to join the first contingent of nurses at the Number 3 Hospital at Rondebosch. After two weeks in Rondebosch, the group left for Kimberley, where they served in a makeshift hospital of one hundred beds located in the Masonic Temple. An outbreak of dysentery and enteric caused them to relocate to Bloemfontein six weeks later to help with the epidemic. Each of the nurses, except MacDonald, contracted the disease, but continued their work to provide services for the sick and wounded. In July, 1900, Hurcomb led her group of nurses to Pretoria, where they served at the Irish Hospital, until their return aboard the Roslyn Castle from Cape Town to Halifax, Nova Scotia in December 1900. In 1901, Hurcomb, along with two other nurses, Georgina Pope and Sarah Forbes, received medals for their war service from the Duke of York, later King George V, during his tour to the Outposts of the British Empire. She returned to South Africa in early 1902 with Forbes, MacDonald and Pope. The veterans were accompanied by four other nurses, Florence Cameron, Eleanor Fortescue, Amy W. Scott, and Margaret Smith. They did not serve as members of the Canadian Army Nursing Service, but rather as members of the British Army's temporary units. They accompanied the 2nd Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles (2 CMR) to Harrismith, where they were to be attached to the Canadian 10th Field Hospital. As that hospital had moved on to Newcastle, the nurses instead joined the 19th Stationary Hospital located between the Drakensberg hills and a small mountain called Platberg. Hurcomb and the other nurses were responsible for around 600 patients who had enteric fever. She had not fully recovered from her previous bout with the disease and succumbed to it again, having to be evacuated back to Canada in May. After her recovery, Hurcomb worked as a private nurse in Ottawa. Hurcomb died while on a visit to her father at his home in Buffalo, New York on 28 February 1907 and was buried in Ottawa.

Both major political parties – the Jamaica Labour Party and the People's National Party – subscribe to the position, and the current Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness, has announced that transitioning to a republic will be a priority of his government. Background In the lead-up to Jamaican independence in 1962, the Parliament of Jamaica established a cross-party joint select committee to prepare a new constitution. The committee received several submissions calling for Jamaica to become a republic, which it \\"heard politely, but rejected unceremoniously\\". The People's Freedom Movement, an extra-parliamentary opposition party, suggested that the constitution include a provision for a referendum on a republic at a later date, but this was not carried out.Derek O'Brien, \\"Jamaica’s drift towards republicanism: Possible consequences for the Caribbean\\", ConstitutionNet, 26 May 2016. Retrieved 3 September 2016. Both major party leaders in Jamaica in the lead-up to independence (the JLP's Alexander Bustamante and the PNP's Norman Manley) were opposed to Jamaica becoming a republic. Law professor Stephen Vasciannie has suggested that the decision to retain the monarchy at independence was due to several factors, including a desire for continuity and stability, a desire to demonstrate the maturity required for independence, the popularity of the Royal Family amongst Jamaicans, and tendencies towards Anglophilia among the political elites.Stephen Vasciannie, \\"Reflections on the Republic of Jamaica\\", The Jamaica Observer, 29 November 2015. Retrieved 3 September 2016. History The first Jamaican prime minister to make steps towards a republic was Michael Manley, whose People's National Party (PNP) came to power at the 1972 general election. His government established a commission into constitutional reform in 1975, and in July 1977, following a march to commemorate the Morant Bay rebellion, Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. However, his government was defeated at the 1980 general election by the more conservative Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), led by Edward Seaga. Seaga was also a republican, having expressed a preference for a \\"ceremonial presidency\\" in 1977. Despite this, no concrete moves towards a republic occurred during his premiership.Michael Burke, \\"Queen, emperor and republican status\\", The Jamaica Observer, 21 April 2016. Retrieved 2 September 2016. In 2002, the PNP government led by P. J. Patterson abolished the requirement for public servants to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch. At a PNP party conference in September 2003, Patterson expressed his hopes that Jamaica would become a republic by 2007, stating that \\"the time has come when we must have a head of state chosen by us\\" and \\"the majority of people in Jamaica are ready to consign to history the last vestiges of colonialism\\".\\"Jamaica eyes republican future\\", BBC News, 22 September 2003. Retrieved 2 September 2016. However, his government's attempts to transition to a republic were stifled by its simultaneous attempts to abolish the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the final court of appeal in Jamaica and replace it with Caribbean Court of Justice. The opposition JLP were against that decision (which would also have required a constitutional amendment), and made their support for republicanism conditional on a referendum being held for the judicial changes, which was not forthcoming. The PNP government was defeated at the 2007 general election. The new prime minister, JLP leader Bruce Golding, promised that his government would \\"amend the Constitution to replace the Queen with a Jamaican president who symbolises the unity of the nation\\", but the JLP's term in government came to an end at the 2011 general election without any formal steps towards a republic having been taken.\\"Editorial: The Monarchy And Beyond\\", The Jamaica Gleaner, 12 September 2015. Retrieved 3 September 2016. Portia Simpson-Miller, the PNP leader and new prime minister, also publicly affirmed her government's commitment to republicanism, stating a preference for an elected president.\\"Jamaica will become a republic, new prime minister vows\\", The Guardian, 6 January 2012. Retrieved 3 September 2016. However, the PNP lost power at the 2016 general election without bringing about constitutional change. Andrew Holness, Simpson-Miller's successor as prime minister, also affirmed a commitment to republicanism upon taking office, and stated his government would introduce a bill to replace the Queen with \\"a non-executive president as head of state\\".Rob Crilly, \\"Jamaica unveils plan to ditch Queen as head of state\\", The Telegraph, 16 April 2016. Retrieved 3 September 2016. During the 2020 Jamaican general election the People's National Party promised to hold a referendum on becoming a republic within 18 months if it won the election. and polls suggested that 55% of Jamaicans desired the country become a republic. However, the ruling Jamaica Labour Party, which had in 2016 promised a referendum but not carried one out, was re-elected and states that holding a referendum remains a goal but has not proposed a timeline for one. Legal process All amendments to the Constitution of Jamaica must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, certain sections of the constitution, including those pertaining to the monarchy, can only be amended if they are also submitted to a referendum.

Life Gustav Anton Freiherr von Seckendorff was an offspring of the Gudent branch of the House of Seckendorff, which had its residence at Meuselwitz, Thuringia. Gustav Anton was born at Meuselwitz as the seventh child of Friedrich Carl von Seckendorff (1727-1799), a colonel in the service of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His brother Adolf Christian (1767-1833), who had a military career, also became known as a writer, and his works are sometimes confused with those of Gustav Anton. After studies at the mining academy of Freiberg and the universities of Leipzig and Wittenberg, he visited the United States in 1796. During his stay in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania he married Maria Elisabeth (Betty) Lechler (1782-1858), with whom he was to have fourteen children.Tütken 2005, p. 908 From Pennsylvania he reported to the Neue Teutsche Merkur on the abuse of poor German immigrants (redemptioners). After his return to Germany in 1799 he entered state service in the Electorate of Saxony, occupying various positions before he was appointed Kammerdirektor in the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1807). A difference of opinion led to his resignation after seven months. He then decided to devote himself to an artistic and scholarly career. Using the stage name Patrik Peale, between 1808 and 1812 he toured the German speaking world performing as declaimer, mime artist, actor and lecturer, earning praise as well as strong criticism. His wife Betty assisted in some of his mimic or ‘mimoplastic’ productions.Muns 2016, p. 8 In 1812 Seckendorff switched to an academic career. He obtained a doctorate in Göttingen, where he lectured as Privatdozent, and in 1814 was appointed Professor of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the University of Brunswick (Collegium Carolinum). He resigned this post in 1821, and went to the United States to establish himself as a book seller. He died in the summer of 1823 in Alexandria, Louisiana, reputedly “in poverty and misery”. Reputation Seckendorff is mostly remembered for his Vorlesungen über Deklamation und Mimik (1816). Like many other declaimers and declamation theorists of the time, he believed that speech prosody is a kind of music. He attempted to demonstrate this in his stage declamation, in which he accompanied himself on the piano. Critics of his declamation style include the composer and author Johann Friedrich Reichardt and the actor and theater director August Klingemann.

G. Betty matriculated in 1867 at University College School and in 1868 at the University of London. In October 1868 he became a medical student at University College Hospital. There he won the Liston Gold Medal for 1875 (awarded at the end of the summer session to the pupil \\"who has most distinguished himself by reports and observations on the surgical cases in the hospital\\"). In 1876 under the supervision of Marcus Beck, he started a descriptive catalogue of the University College Hospital's preparations of surgical pathology. In December 1881, Samuel George Betty was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, but he then changed his name to Samuel George Shattock, giving as a reason that the Shattock side of his family seemed likely to suffer extinction and the change might preserve the family name. S. G. Shattock worked on pathology and never registered as a medical practitioner. In 1878 as the successor to Cossar Ewart, Shattock was appointed Curator of the Anatomical and Pathological Museum at University College Hospital. In 1884 he was appointed Curator of the Museum at St Thomas's Hospital, holding this post until his death in 1924. At St Thomas's Hospital he was appointed Lecturer on Pathology in the Medical School and later at the University of London, Professor of Pathology in the University of London, continuing in those two posts until he died in 1924. Shattock taught surgical pathology using typical museum specimens and in 1895 he gave a pioneering course of practical demonstrations in bacteriology. In addition to his regular work, he was often called upon to give a definitive opinion on morbid specimens sent from various locations in the British Empire. He was a pioneer of palaeopathology. On 4 April 1905 he exhibited a prehistoric or predynastic urinary calculus found in Egypt by G. Elliot Smith. In 1909 as President of the Pathological Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, Shattock exhibited microscopic sections of the aorta of the mummy of the Pharaoh Merneptah. From 1910 to 1927 Shattock worked with C. F. Beadles on a comprehensive collection of pathological specimens illustrating the possibilities for disease. Shattock married in 1882 and upon his death was survived by his wife, three sons, and a daughter. His second son was the prominent surgeon Clement Edward Shattock.Shattock, Clement Edward – Biographical entry – Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Awards and honours *1893 – Morton Lecturer on Cancer *1909 – Hunterian Professor of Surgery and Pathology from 1909 to 1911 (lecture on \\"Certain Matters connected with Internal Secretion and with Fat\\") *1916 – Hon.

This transport process is dependent on several cytoplasmic phosphoryl transfer proteins - Enzyme I (I), HPr, Enzyme IIA (IIA), and Enzyme IIB (IIB) as well as the integral membrane sugar permease complex (IICD). It is not part of the PTS-AG or PTS-GFL superfamilies.  Distinguishing characteristics from other PTS porters  The Man Family is unique in several respects among other PTS porter families: # It is the only PTS family in which members possess a IID protein; # It is the only PTS family in which the IIB constituent is phosphorylated on a histidyl rather than a cysteyl residue; # Its porter members usually exhibit broad specificity for a range of sugars, rather than being specific for just one or a few sugars. The mannose porter of Escherichia coli, for example, can transport and phosphorylate glucose, mannose, fructose, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acteylmannosamine.  Structure  The structure of the E. coli IIAMan domain has been shown to exhibit an α/β doubly wound superfold. The IIB domain also exhibits an α/β doubly wound superfold, but it is very dissimilar from that of the IIA domain. Instead, it has the same topology as phosphoglyceromutase (PGM). Since both proteins (IIBMan and PGM) catalyze phosphoryl transfer with a phosphohistidine intermediate, both proteins show a similar distribution of active site residues, and both exhibit similar structures, they are probably homologous. IICMan of E. coli has been reported to have six transmembrane α-helical segments, while IIDMan was reported to have only one. However, hydropathy plots show multiple peaks of hydropathy, rendering the experimental result, suggesting 1 TMS, questionable. These two proteins together are required for transport, although IICMan is presumed to comprise all or most of the sugar transporting channel.  Transport reaction  The generalized reaction catalyzed by members of the Man Family is: : Sugar (out) + PEP (in) → Sugar-P (in) + pyruvate (in)  References  Membrane proteins Protein families ","title":"PTS Mannose-Fructose-Sorbose Family"},{"id":"51496360","text":"A thread block is a programming abstraction that represents a group of threads that can be executed serially or in parallel. For better process and data mapping, threads are grouped into thread blocks. The number of threads varies with available shared memory. The number of threads in a thread block was formerly limited by the architecture to a total of 512 threads per block, but as of July 2019, with CUDA toolkit 10 and recent devices including Volta, blocks may contain up to 1024 threads.https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c- programming-guide/index.html The threads in the same thread block run on the same stream processor. Threads in the same block can communicate with each other via shared memory, barrier synchronization or other synchronization primitives such as atomic operations. Multiple blocks are combined to form a grid. All the blocks in the same grid contain the same number of threads. The number of threads in a block is limited to 1024, but grids can be used for computations that require a large number of thread blocks to operate in parallel. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that higher level languages can use to exploit parallelism. In CUDA, the kernel is executed with the aid of threads. The thread is an abstract entity that represents the execution of the kernel. A kernel is a small program or a function. Multi threaded applications use many such threads that are running at the same time, to organize parallel computation. Every thread has an index, which is used for calculating memory address locations and also for taking control decisions.  Dimensions  CUDA operates on a heterogeneous programming model which is used to run host device application programs. It has an execution model that is similar to OpenCL. In this model, we start executing an application on the host device which is usually a CPU core. The device is a throughput oriented device, i.e., a GPU core which performs parallel computations. Kernel functions are used to do these parallel executions. Once these kernel functions are executed the control is passed back to the host device that resumes serial execution. As many parallel applications involve multidimensional data, it is convenient to organize thread blocks into 1D, 2D or 3D arrays of threads. The blocks in a grid must be able to be executed independently, as communication or cooperation between blocks in a grid is not possible. 'When a kernel is launched the number of threads per thread block, and the number of thread blocks is specified, this, in turn, defines the total number of CUDA threads launched.' The maximum x, y and z dimensions of a block are 1024, 1024 and 64, and it should be allocated such that x × y × z ≤ 1024, which is the maximum number of threads per block. Blocks can be organized into one- or two-dimensional grids of up to 65,535 blocks in each dimension. The limitation on the number of threads in a block is actually imposed because the number of registers that can be allocated across all threads is limited.  Indexing  = 1D-indexing = Every thread in CUDA is associated with a particular index so that it can calculate and access memory locations in an array. Consider an example in which there is an array of 512 elements. One of the organization structure is taking a grid with a single block that has a 512 threads. Consider that there is an array C of 512 elements that is made of element wise multiplication of two arrays A and B which are both 512 elements each. Every thread has an index i and it performs the multiplication of ith element of A and B and then store the result in the ith element of C. i is calculated by using blockIdx (which is 0 in this case as there is only one block), blockDim (512 in this case as the block has 512 elements) and threadIdx that varies from 0 to 511 for each block. Thread Hierarchy in CUDA Programming The thread index i is calculated by the following formula : i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x blockIdx.x is the x dimension block identifier blockDim.x is the x dimension of the block dimension threadIdx.x is the x dimension of the thread identifier Thus ‘i’ will have values ranging from 0 to 511 that covers the entire array. If we want to consider computations for an array that is larger than 1024 we can have multiple blocks with 1024 threads each. Consider an example with 2048 array elements. In this case we have 2 thread blocks with 1024 threads each. Thus the thread identifiers' values will vary from 0 to 1023, the block identifier will vary from 0 to 1 and the block dimension will be 1024. Thus the first block will get index values from 0 to 1023 and the last one will have index values from 1024 to 2047. Thus each thread will first calculate the index of memory that it has to access and then proceed with the calculation. Consider an example in which elements from arrays A and B are added in parallel by using threads and the results is stored in an array C. The corresponding code in a thread is shown below : global void vecAddKernel (float *A , float *B , float * C , int n) { int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; if (index < n) { C[index] = A[index] + B[index] ; } } = 2D-indexing = In the same way in particularly complex grids, the blockId as well as the threadId need to be calculated by each thread depending on geometry of the grid. Consider, a 2-dimensional Grid with 2-dimensional blocks. The threadId and the blockId will be calculated by the following formulae : blockId = blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * gridDim.x; threadId = blockId * (blockDim.x * blockDim.y) \\\\+ (threadIdx.y * blockDim.x) + threadIdx.x;  Hardware perspective  Although we have stated the hierarchy of threads, we should note that, threads, thread blocks and grid are essentially a programmer’s perspective. In order to get a complete gist of thread block, it is critical to know it from a hardware perspective. The hardware groups threads that execute the same instruction into warps. Several warps constitute a thread block. Several thread blocks are assigned to a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). Several SM constitute the whole GPU unit (which executes the whole Kernel Grid). A pictorial correlation of a programmer's perspective versus a hardware perspective of a thread block in GPU. = Streaming multiprocessors = Each architecture in GPU (say Kepler or Fermi) consists of several SM or Streaming Multiprocessors. These are general purpose processors with a low clock rate target and a small cache. An SM is able to execute several thread blocks in parallel. As soon as one of its thread block has completed execution, it takes up the serially next thread block. In general, SMs support instruction-level parallelism but not branch prediction. An illustration of a streaming multiprocessor and its resources. To achieve this purpose, an SM contains the following: * Execution cores. (single precision floating-point units, double precision floating-point units, special function units (SFUs)). * Caches: # L1 cache. (for reducing memory access latency). # Shared memory. (for shared data between threads). # Constant cache (for broadcasting of reads from a read-only memory). # Texture cache. (for aggregating bandwidth from texture memory). * Schedulers for warps. (these are for issuing instructions to warps based on particular scheduling policies). * A substantial number of registers. (an SM may be running a large number of active threads at a time, so it is a must to have registers in thousands.) The hardware schedules thread blocks to an SM. In general an SM can handle multiple thread blocks at the same time. An SM may contain up to 8 thread blocks in total. A thread ID is assigned to a thread by its respective SM. Whenever an SM executes a thread block, all the threads inside the thread block are executed at the same time. Hence to free a memory of a thread block inside the SM, it is critical that the entire set of threads in the block have concluded execution. Each thread block is divided in scheduled units known as a warp. These are discussed in detail in the following section. An Illustration of a double warp scheduler implemented in the Fermi micro- architecture of NVidia. The warp scheduler of SM decides which of the warp gets prioritized during issuance of instructions. Some of the warp prioritizing policies have also been discussed in the following sections. = Warps = On the hardware side, a thread block is composed of ‘warps’. A warp is a set of 32 threads within a thread block such that all the threads in a warp execute the same instruction. These threads are selected serially by the SM. Once a thread block is launched on a multiprocessor (SM), all of its warps are resident until their execution finishes. Thus a new block is not launched on an SM until there is sufficient number of free registers for all warps of the new block, and until there is enough free shared memory for the new block. Consider a warp of 32 threads executing an instruction. If one or both of its operands are not ready (e.g. have not yet been fetched from global memory), a process called ‘context switching’ takes place which transfers control to another warp. When switching away from a particular warp, all the data of that warp remains in the register file so that it can be quickly resumed when its operands become ready. When an instruction has no outstanding data dependencies, that is, both of its operands are ready, the respective warp is considered to be ready for execution. If more than one warps are eligible for execution, the parent SM uses a warp scheduling policy for deciding which warp gets the next fetched instruction. Different policies for scheduling warps that are eligible for execution are discussed below: # Round Robin (RR) - Instructions are fetched in round robin manner. RR makes sure - SMs are kept busy and no clock cycles are wasted on memory latencies. # Least Recently Fetched (LRF) - In this policy, warp for which instruction has not been fetched for the longest time gets priority in the fetching of an instruction. # Fair (FAIR) \\\\- In this policy, the scheduler makes sure all warps are given ‘fair’ opportunity in the number of instruction fetched for them. It fetches instruction to a warp for which minimum number of instructions have been fetched. # Thread block-based CAWS (criticality aware warp scheduling) - The emphasis of this scheduling policy is on improving the execution time of the thread blocks. It allocated more time resources to the warp that shall take the longest time to execute. By giving priority to the most critical warp, this policy allows thread blocks to finish faster, such that the resources become available quicker. Traditional CPU thread context \\"switching\\" requires saving and restoring allocated register values and the program counter to off- chip memory (or cache) and is therefore a much more heavyweight operation than with warp context switching. All of a warp's register values (including its program counter) remain in the register file, and the shared memory (and cache) remain in place too since these are shared between all the warps in the thread block. In order to take advantage of the warp architecture, programming languages and developers need to understand how to coalesce memory accesses and how to manage control flow divergence. If each thread in a warp takes a different execution path or if each thread accesses significantly divergent memory then the benefits of the warp architecture are lost and performance will significantly degrade.

As a passionate teacher as he was, made a turn to Robert H. Grubbs's life, when he convinced him to turn to Organic Chemistry rather than Agriculture Science. Grubbs worked as one of his research assistants.  Personal life  Battiste passed away peacefully at his home Gainesville, FL on Saturday August 8. Battiste survived by his wife, Jan; his sons, Mark and John; his stepdaughters, Tanya, Paula, and Tracey; and six grandchildren. Battiste loved gardening and he was member of the Gainesville Camellia Society for many years.  Awards and honors  Battiste was a Sloan Fellow, a Fulbright Research Scholar, and an Erskine Fellow. He was also an emeritus member of American Chemical Society, joining in 1959. The University of Florida created the Battiste Award in Synthetic Chemistry. Originally established in 2005 as the Petra Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, the award name was changed in 2007 to honor Professor Battiste.

Location Conservation units in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial. 6\\\\. Canutama Extractive Reserve The Canutama Extractive Reserve is in the municipality of Canutama, Amazonas. It has an area of . The reserve lies along a stretch of the Purus River between the towns of Lábrea and Canutama. It adjoins the Canutama State Forest to the north and the Balata-Tufari National Forest to the east. The Médio Purus Extractive Reserve is upstream, to the southwest. To the west the reserve is bounded by the Banawá Indigenous Territory. Vegetation is 100% Amazon rainforest. The population of about 200 families includes gatherers, riverine farmers, fishermen and rubber tappers. History The Canutama Extractive Reserve was created by Amazonas state decree 28421 of 27 March 2009. The conservation unit was created with five others totalling to help meet the requirements for granting an environmental license to reconstruction work on the BR-319 highway that connects Porto Velho to Manaus. The minister of the environment defended implementation of what he called a \\"green pocket\\" around the highway. On 16 November 2009 the Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (INCRA – National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as supporting 200 families who would be eligible for PRONAF. The state-level conservation units in the BR-319 corridor are the Piagaçu-Purus, Rio Amapá, Rio Madeira, Igapó- Açu and Matupiri sustainable development reserves, Canutama Extractive Reserve, Canutama State Forest, Tapauá State Forest and Matupiri State Park. In December 2012 the Amazonas state government allocated more than R$6 million to these nine units, covering and 143 communities, to be coordinated by the State Center for Conservation Units (CEUC). The funding was for development of management plans, creation of management councils, environmental monitoring, land survey, and production and marketing. The management plan was approved on 22 July 2014. As of 2016 the reserve was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.

The French captured her in 1805 during her second voyage for the East India Company and sold her to Danish owners. The British recaptured her in January 1808, and within a year thereafter she was again in her former owner's hands. She then made several more voyages for the company. Career =First EIC voyage (1803–1804)= Captain Thomas Larkins sailed Warren Hasting for China, leaving The Downs on 6 April 1803 and arriving at Whampoa on 28 August.British Library: Warren Hastings (2). Before she arrived she rescued a dozen or so Chinese sailors. A gale had caught their three \\"tchuans\\" and sunk them, causing the loss of some 500 people. The same gale had also caught the East Indiaman , causing her loss, together with that of the 120 or so people aboard her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, p.467. Larkins had left Britain during the Peace of Amiens so he did not apply for a letter of marque. However, the Peace broke down in May 1803. Larkins received a letter of marque on 16 September, while he was in China. Homeward bound, Warren Hastings crossed the Second Bar on 1 February 1804. Warren Hastings was traveling in convoy with the fleet of East Indiamen returning from China, and under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance. On 14 February the China fleet encountered a small French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois. some shots were exchanged, but the East Indiamen were able to bluff Linois into withdrawing. Warren Hastings was directly engaged and the Indiamen reached Malacca on 19 February and Penang on 1 March. Warren Hastings was at St Helena on 7 June and arrived at The Downs on 8 August. =Second EIC voyage and capture (1805)= Larkins sailed Warren Hastings for Benkulen and China on her second voyage, leaving Portsmouth on 17 February 1805. She spent May–July at St Helena and September–October at Benkulen. However, on 21 June 1806, as Warren Hastings was on her way back from Canton, the French frigate Piémontaise, under the command of Captain Épron, captured her at , in a noteworthy single-ship action.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.239–44. Larkins put up a stubborn resistance for four hours. Casualties on Warren Hastings from the engagement amounted to seven killed and 13 wounded; casualties on Piémontaise amounted to seven killed and five wounded. After Warren Hastings struck, the French boarding party stabbed Larkin, wounding him severely, and wounded four other officers and crew. Her captors took Warren Hastings to Mauritius where they arrived on 4 July. Thereafter the French initially used her as a prison ship. On 11 December 1806, Warren Hastings was sold with \\"her tackle and apparel.\\" The purchaser was a Danish company. One report has the Danish East India Company purchasing Warren Hastings as a replacement for Holstein, which had arrived at Port Louis on 21 July 1806 and been condemned.Publications... (1902), Vol. 20, p.369. (A report in the Madras Courier dated 10 February 1807 stated that the Danish company's ship Holstein was sailing from Copenhagen to Serampore when she was dismasted off Ceylon. She sailed to Mauritius for repairs.\\"SHIP NEWS\\". Morning Chronicle (London, England), Monday, September 21, 1807; Issue 11964.) The Danish East India Company named their newly-bought ship Holsten (II).Marcussen - Holsten (II) record card Reportedly she was wrecked in a cyclone at Bourbon Island towards end-December. It is clear that she was not totally wrecked as she returned to commerce. =Recapture (January 1808) and third EIC voyage (1809–1810)= The British recaptured Warren Hastings (plus six other Danish merchant ships) at Frederiksnagore (Surampore), then part of Danish India, and 14 miles north of Calcutta, after news of the British attack on Copenhagen in August–September 1807 reached India. Her captors placed Warren Hastings in the Indian coastal trade for some months until John Pascall Larkins, Jr., younger brother of Thomas Larkins, Jr., purchased her in 1809. Captain C. P. MacFarlane sailed Warren Hastings back to England from Calcutta as an \\"extra ship\\", i.e., under charter. She left Calcutta on 11 September 1809, reached Madras on 24 September, and the Cape on 16 December. She was at St Helena on 27 January 1810 and arrived at Portsmouth on 8 April and Blackwall on 24 April.British Library: Warren Hastings (4). =Fourth EIC voyage (1811–1812)= Captain Gunter Lyde Browne sailed Warren Hastings to the Cape and China, leaving Portsmouth on 8 April 1811. He sailed under a letter of marque issued on 20 February 1811. She reached the Cape of Good Hope on 13 July, Penang on 30 August, and Malacca on 20 September, before arriving at Whampoa on 28 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 11 January 1812, reached St Helena on 21 March, and arrived at The Downs on 14 May. =Fifth EIC voyage (1815–1816)= Captain Richard Rawes left The Downs on 27 April 1815, bound for China. Warren Hastings arrived at Whampoa on 23 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 10 January 1816, reached St Helena on 26 March, and arrived at The Downs on 11 May.British Library: Warren Hastings (5). Rawes brought with him Wisteria sinensis (Chinese wisteria) plants. In addition to the wisteria, Rawes brought two Camellia hybrids for his relation Thomas Carey Palmer, of Bromley in Kent: \\"Wellbank's White Camellia\\" (Camellia japonica \\"Wellbankii\\") and Camellia × maliflora. =Sixth EIC voyage (1819–1820)= Camellia reticulata Captain Rawes and Warren Hastings left Portsmouth on 4 April 1819, reached Penang on 20 July, Malacca on 15 September, and Singapore on ten days later. She arrived at Whampoa on 7 November. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 6 February 1820, reached St Helena on 21 April, and arrived at The Downs on 20 June Downs. Rawes brought with him Camellia reticulata plants, the first imported to England, the variety becoming known as 'Captain Rawes'. For over a century 'Captain Rawes' was the sole reticulata cultivated in Europe.Camellias.pics: Photographic nomenclature of Camellias. Accessed 2 September 2016. Rawes also brought Palmer \\"Camellia sasanqua, var. β. stricata\\", \\"Paconia Moutan, var. Rawesii\\", and \\"Primula pranitens\\". =Seventh EIC voyage (1823–1824)= Warren Hastings, still under the command of Captain Richard Rawes, left the Downs on 21 April 1823 and arrived at Whampoa on 1 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 17 January 1824, reached St Helena on 27 March, and arrived at The Downs on 10 June. =Eighth EIC voyage (1825–1826)= Captain Richard Rawes and Warrren Hastings left The Downs on 1 May 1825. On the way, severe weather caused considerable damage, forcing Rawes to divert to Penang, which she reached on 27 August, for repairs. The repairs took some time long as Warren Hastings did not reach Singapore until 3 October. A cyclone on the way to China again caused damage, but she arrived at Whampoa on 6 November. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 6 February 1826, reached St Helena on 3 May, and arrived at The Downs on 23 June.

It is a task runner built on Node.js and npm, used for automation of time-consuming and repetitive tasks involved in web development like minification, concatenation, cache busting, unit testing, linting, optimization, etc. gulp uses a code-over-configuration approach to define its tasks and relies on its small, single-purpose plugins to carry them out. The gulp ecosystem includes more than 3500 such plugins.  Overview  gulp is a build tool in JavaScript built on node streams. These streams facilitate the connection of file operations through pipelines. gulp reads the file system and pipes the data at hand from one single-purposed plugin to another through the \`.pipe()\` operator, doing one task at a time. The original files are not affected until all the plugins are processed. It can be configured either to modify the original files or to create new ones. This grants the ability to perform complex tasks through linking its numerous plugins. The users can also write their own plugins to define their own tasks. Unlike other task runners that run tasks by configuration, gulp requires knowledge of JavaScript and coding to define its tasks. gulp is a build system which means apart from running tasks, it is also capable of copying files from one location to another, compiling, deploying, creating notifications, unit testing, linting, etc.  Need for a task runner  Task-runners like gulp and Grunt are built on Node.js rather than npm, because the basic npm scripts are inefficient when executing multiple tasks. Even though some developers prefer npm scripts because they can be simple and easy to implement, there are numerous ways where gulp and Grunt seem to have an advantage over each other and the default provided scripts. Grunt runs tasks by transforming files and saves as new ones in temporary folders and the output of one task is taken as input for another and so on until the output reaches the destination folder. This involves a lot of I/O calls and creation of many temporary files. Whereas gulp streams through the file system and does not require any of these temporary locations decreasing the number of I/O calls thus, improving performance. Grunt uses configuration files to perform tasks whereas gulp requires its build file to be coded. In Grunt, each plugin needs to be configured to match its input location to the previous plugin’s output. In gulp, the plugins are automatically pipe-lined.  Operation  The gulp tasks are run from a command-line interface (CLI) shell and require two files, \`package.json\`, which is used to list the various plugins for gulp, and \`gulpfile.js\` (or simply \`gulpfile\`), These, as per build tool convention, are often found in the root directory of the package's source code. The gulpfile contains most of the logic that gulp needs to run it's build tasks. First, all the necessary modules are loaded and then tasks are defined in the gulpfile. All the necessary plugins specified in the gulpfile are listed in the devDependencies section of The default task runs by \`$gulp\`. Individual tasks can be defined by gulp.task and are run by \`gulp \`. Complex tasks are defined by chaining the plugins with the help of \`.pipe()\` operator.  Anatomy of gulpfile  gulpfile is the place where all the operations are defined in gulp. The basic anatomy of the gulpfile consists of required plugins included at the top, definition of the tasks and a default task at the end. = Plugins = Any installed plugin that is required to perform a task is to be added at the top of the gulpfile as a dependency in the following format. //Adding dependencies var gulp = require ('gulp'); = Tasks = The tasks can then be created. A gulp task is defined by gulp.task and takes the name of the task as the first parameter and a function as the second parameter. The following example shows the creation of a gulp tasks. The first parameter taskName is mandatory and specifies the name by which the task in the shell can be executed. gulp.task('taskName', function () { //do something }); Alternatively, a task that performs several predefined functions can be created. Those functions are passed as the second parameter in the form of an array. function fn1 () { // do something } function fn2 () { // do something } // Task with array of function names gulp.task('taskName', gulp.parallel(fn1, fn2)); = Default task = The default task is to be defined at the end of the gulpfile. It can be run by the \`gulp\` command in the shell. In the case below, the default task does nothing. // Gulp default task gulp.task('default', fn); The default task is used in gulp to run any number of dependent sub tasks defined above in a sequential order automatically. gulp can also monitor source files and run an appropriate task when changes are made to the files. The sub tasks are to be mentioned as the elements of the array in the second parameter. The process can be triggered by simply running the default task by \`gulp\` command.  Example tasks  = Image Task = The module definition can be at the beginning of \`Gulpfile.js\` like so: var imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin'); The subsequent image task optimizes images. \`gulp.src()\` retrieves all the images with the extension .png, .gif or .jpg in the directory 'images-orig/'. \`.pipe(imagemin())\` channels the images found, through the optimization process and with \`.pipe(gulp.dest())\` the optimized images are saved to the 'images/' folder. Without \`gulp.dest()\` the images would indeed be optimized, but are not stored. Since the optimized images are stored to another folder, the original images remain unaltered. // Images task gulp.task('images', function () { return gulp.src('images/*.{png,gif,jpg}') .pipe(imagemin()) .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/images/')); }); = Scripts Task = In the following example, all JavaScript files from the directory scripts/ are optimized with \`.pipe(uglify())\` and \`gulp.dest('scripts/')\` overwrites the original files with the output. For this, one must first return to the required gulp-uglify plugin on npm package installer and at the beginning of gulpfile, the module should be defined. // Script task gulp.task('scripts', function () { return gulp.src('scripts/*.js') .pipe(uglify()) .pipe(gulp.dest('scripts/')); }); = Watch Task = The Watch-task serves to react to changes in files. In the following example, the tasks with the names scripts and images are called when any of JavaScript files or images change in the specified directories. // Rerun the task When a file changes gulp.task('watch', function (cb) { gulp.watch('scripts/js/**', scripts); gulp.watch('images/**', images); cb(); }); Furthermore, it is possible to accomplish an update of the browser content using the Watch-tasks. For this, there are numerous options and plugins.

It was a part of the 17th Airborne Division, and saw active combat service until it deactivation in 1945. History The 194th Glider Infantry was constituted on 16 December 1942 as part of the Army of the United States, and was activated on 15 April 1943 at Camp Mackall, North Carolina under the command of COL James R. Pierce. The regiment was assigned to the 17th Airborne Division and began training for combat in the European Theater of Operations.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html They were stationed at the Tennessee Maneuver Area on 7 February 1944, and later sent to Camp Forrest, Tennessee on 24 March. Their tenure there was brief, and the regiment was sent to Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts on 14 August. The 194th departed at Boston on 20 August 1944 and arrived in England on 28 August. The regiment began staging with the rest of the 17th Airborne Division at Camp Chisledon, and trained for airborne, tactical, and night missions. When Operation Market Garden initiated, the 17th Airborne Division had not yet completed its training, and was used as a strategic reserve.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html On 16 December 1944, the Wehrmacht launched a surprise attack on Allied positions, beginning the infamous Battle of the Bulge.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html The 17th Airborne Division was rushed to the front to assist the embattled defenders of Bastogne, and the men of the 194th Glider Infantry marched through the snow to relieve elements of the 28th Infantry Division, and set up Headquarters and defensive positions near the Belgian town of Morhet on 3 January 1945. The glider troops would soon experience their baptism by fire. General Patton ordered the division to capture Flamierge, and the 194th composed the right flank of the advance, with the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment to their left. Under heavy mortar fire, the regiment attacked and captured their objectives despite the loss of considerable casualties. The 194th remained active on the line until they were relieved, and pulled back to camp at Chalons-sur-Marne in France on 11 February 1945.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html Here they began preparing for Operation Varsity, an airborne operation designed to help the surface river assault troops secure a foothold across the Rhine River in Western Germany by landing two airborne divisions on the eastern bank of the Rhine near the village of Hamminkeln and the town of Wesel. The British 6th Airborne Division would capture Hamminkeln, and the US 17th Airborne Division would capture Wesel.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html Prior to the operation, on 1 March 1945, the remnants of the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion became the 194th GIR's 3rd Battalion. The operation began on 24 March 1945, and the 194th GIR was the third wave of the 17th Airborne to assault. Troopers of the 194th GIR landed accurately in their landing zone, landing zone S, a large flat area north of Wesel where Issel River and Issel Canal merge. Their main objective was to seize the crossings over the Issel and protect the division's right flank. However, their gliders and tow aircraft took heavy casualties; 12 C-47 transports were lost due to anti-aircraft fire, and a further 140 were damaged by the same fire. The regiment landed in the midst of a number of German artillery batteries that were engaging Allied ground forces crossing the Rhine, and as such many of the gliders were engaged by German artillery pieces that had their barrels lowered for direct-fire. However, these artillery batteries and their crews were defeated by the glider-borne troops, and the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment was soon able to report that its objectives had been secured, having destroyed 42 artillery pieces, 10 tanks, 2 self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicles, 5 self-propelled guns, and 1,000 German POWs. The 194th held its captured ground until 26 March, when Field marshal Bernard Montgomery began moving his troops eastward to relieve the paratroopers. The next day, the 194th advanced on the German town of Lembeck, but encountered solid enemy resistance and were repulsed after I Company attempted 3 abortive frontal assaults.http://www.ww2-airborne.us/units/194/194.html The assaults were renewed on 28 March, and it was here that Technical Sergeant Clinton M. Hedrick, of I Co, earned the Medal of Honor. He repeatedly charged through heavy fire to attack German positions and alone followed a group of German soldiers when they retreated into a Schloss. When the Germans indicated that they wished to surrender, Hedrick and four other men entered the castle, only to be fired upon by a German self-propelled gun. Hedrick was fatally wounded, but successfully covered the withdrawal of his men with his BAR. After Lembeck had been captured, the 194th drove eastward, and battled with retreating German units as they pushed further into the Nazi heartland. 1LT Thomas McKinley of the 194th managed to capture one of the Nazi Party's top officials, Franz von Papen, in his estate near Essen in early April. McKinley rushed into the lodge to find Franz von Papen having dinner with his family. McKinley pulled out a photograph and identified Papen. McKinley then told Papen that he was his prisoner; Papen stated in reply, \\"I don't know what the Americans would want with an old man of 65 like me!\\" Nonetheless, McKinley sat down and ate dinner with Papen before taking him captive. Papen was heard to remark (in English), \\"I wish this terrible war were over.\\" SGT Fredericks, who was also present, responded, \\"So do 11 million other guys!\\" Shortly after, the 194th was attached to the 95th Infantry Division from 5–13 April, and then returned to the 17th Airborne Division. The regiment served in the Army of Occupation in Germany from 2 May – 14 August 1945, and returned to the United States on 14 September 1945, and were deactivated at Camp Myles Standish, MA the same day.

RFCs take up folate, reduced folate, derivatives of reduced folate and the drug, methotrexate.  Structure and Homology  These proteins are usually 500-600 amino acyl residues long and possess 12 putative transmembrane α-helical segments (TMSs). Residues in the first TMS and in the region between TMSs 1 and 2, and in TMS 11 appear to play roles in substrate recognition. The large cytoplasmic loop between TMSs 6 and 7 is required for stability and efficient transport. Proteins of the RFC family have been characterized only from animals, but homologues can also be found in other eukaryotes such as slime molds and Giardia. They have been sequenced from several mammals and from the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Humans have at least two RFC family paralogues, and C. elegans has three. All homologues exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity with each other.  Proposed Mechanisms  The RFC members appear to transport reduced folate by an energy-dependent, pH-dependent, Na+-independent mechanism. Folate:H+ symport, folate:OH−antiport and folate:anion antiport mechanisms have been proposed. Intracellular anions are able to promote folate derivative uptake. A bidirectional anion antiport mechanism for RFC family members is favored. In support of this notion, RFC1 has been shown to catalyze efflux of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP).  Transport Reactions  The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by the proteins of the RFC family are: : Folate derivative (out) + anion (in) ⇌ folate derivative (in) + anion (out) : Thiamine (out) + H+ (out) ⇌ thiamine (in) + H+ (in) : TPP (in) + H+ (in) ⇌ TPP (out) + H+ (out)  Medical relevance  Several human RFCs have been linked to chronic kidney disease. In particular, RFC1, ThTr-1, and ThTr-2 have been shown to be downregulated in heart, liver and brain, causing malabsorption.

Overview  The festival, hosted by The String Cheese Incident and produced by Purple Hat Productions, is held outdoors on five stages and allows the attendees to camp onsite for the weekend at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park campground. Attendees are encouraged to dress in costume befitting a Halloween dance party. The event has five performance stages. The Main Stage is where The String Cheese Incident plays three sets each evening and is then followed by other headlining bands. The Amphitheater has a stage to accommodate additional headliners. The Patch is an additional stage the size of the Amphitheater. Spirit Lake is home to the art installation and a silent disco. The Campground Stage accommodates local, less well-known bands. Each year approximately 100 artists perform. In 2014, Suwannee Hulaween added a day to the festival to become a four-day long festival. If Halloween (October 31) falls on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of that year, Suwannee Hulaween is held during those four days. Otherwise it is held the weekend before. The 2018 festival featured the world's first virtual reality music stage that allowed attendees to interactively explore the relationship between music and sound. Suwannee Hulaween 2019 was confirmed in May 2019 and it headlined The String Cheese Incident, Bassnectar, Anderson Paak and The Free Nationals, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit.

He attended the High School in Edinburgh, and then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh (in part under his father). He also studied at Paris, Leiden and the University of St Andrews receiving his MD from the latter in 1792. In 1800, he succeeded his father as professor of midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. In 1824, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Andrew Coventry. In 1825, he fell out with fellow Edinburgh doctor James Crawford Gregory as to whether or not midwifery should be a compulsory component of the University course. He bypassed the Senate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh on this issue and received consent directly from the Lord Provost, William Trotter. When Gregory next met him he beat him ferociously with his cane. He was fined £100 for the assault. After he died, he was succeeded in his professorship by James Young Simpson.

It offered courses in midwifery and diseases associated with women and children, but failed to extend its curriculum to the full scope of medical training and closed in 1873. Formation The Medical Act 1858, which for the first time regulated the licensing of physicians in the UK and created the Medical Register, effectively barred women from becoming doctors in the UK by requiring physicians to pass examinations offered by any of 19 examination boards, none of which permitted the admission of women. The practice of midwifery was unregulated, and was undertaken either by self-trained working class women, or by male physicians. The male medical establishment, as a rule, opposed encroachment on what it considered to be its territory by women. Against this backdrop, a Female Medical Society was established in 1862 with a long term aim of enabling women to qualify as doctors, but with a shorter term focus on medicine applicable to women and children. At its outset, the society sought to raise the status of midwifery such that it could be considered a profession for educated women; to respect the feelings of female patients who preferred to be tended by female practitioners; and to save lives, both by the effect of better training and practice, but also by reducing infections introduced by male physicians who in their wider work came into contact with disease, surgery and post-mortems. In support of its aims, the Society established in 1864 the Ladies' Medical College at premises in Fitzroy Square, London,Probably at No. 4 Fitzroy Square. James Edmunds is recorded as occupying the premises from 1866–1879, in \\"Fitzroy Square\\", Survey of London: Volume 21, the Parish of St Pancras Part 3: Tottenham Court Road and Neighbourhood. Eds.

From 1867 students gained clinical experience at the British Lying-In Hospital. 14 students entered in the first year of operation, 69 by 1867 and 84 in 1870. Notable students of the College include Isabel Thorne (who described its teaching as inadequate) and Matilda Chaplin, both of whom went on to be members of the Edinburgh Seven who in 1870 sought to qualify as doctors at the University of Edinburgh; Florence Fenwick Miller who traced the opposite journey, training in Edinburgh in 1871 and then taking a midwifery certificate at the College; and Alice Vickery, first British woman to qualify as a chemist and pharmacist. Criticism and ambivalent status The medical profession, in general, reacted very poorly to the College, espousing various grounds in the British Medical Journal (BMJ): that the midwifery role should remain subordinate to the (male) physician; that the college provided a 'dangerously insufficient' training creating 'half-educated' female practitioners; or that the college aimed too high in serving educated women rather than working-class midwives. Feminist journals such as the Alexandra Magazine and Englishwoman’s Journal were more supportive. That the College's ambitions were limited appears to have limited its life-span. Aspiring female physicians were concerned with access to the acquisition of credentials enabling them to be listed on the Medical Register, and these the College did not offer. As a result, it was not supported by leading campaigners for the medical education of women such as the Edinburgh Seven nor Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. In 1872, the Society renamed it The Obstetrical College for Women' and unsuccessfully sought funds to extend the curriculum offered; the College closed in 1873. Writing in a later period, Ray Strachey noted that the College was \\"a half-measure'. A year after the closure, the London School of Medicine for Women (LSMW) - unconnected with the Society and arising out of the experience and reaction to the Edinburgh Seven - opened in 1874 to provide full medical training, and the UK Medical Act 1876 enabled the medical authorities to license all qualified applicants irrespective of gender. The LSMW's success is noted to have overshadowed the Ladies' Medical College in the historical record.

In the late 18th century, he studied at Frascati in the Papal States to become a priest. However, he developed a strong support for the Jacobins, and he joined the French expeditionary force as an officer during the Egyptian campaign. He eventually returned to Malta in the 19th century, some years after the uprising against French rule had ended. The Rotunda of Mosta, Grognet's masterpiece Casa Grognet, Villa Grognet or Palazzo Grognet was the house where Grognet de Vassé lived in Mosta By the 1830s, the parish church of Mosta, which had been built in the 17th century by the architect Tommaso Dingli, had become too small to cater for the town's population. Grognet proposed rebuilding the church on a neoclassical design based on the Pantheon in Rome. Despite opposition from Bishop Francesco Saverio Caruana, the design was approved and construction of the church began on 30 May 1833. Grognet had never received any formal architectural training, so during construction he received consultation services from a member of the Sammut family. The church took 28 years to build, being completed in the early 1860s. The church's design was praised both during construction and after its completion, and it is considered to be Grognet's masterpiece. Grognet was also an antiquarian, and he had a deep knowledge of the classics. Following the discovery of ancient sites such as Ġgantija and Ħaġar Qim during his lifetime, he came to believe that Malta was the location of Atlantis. He published a short compendium detailing this theory. Grognet married Signora Orsetta della Grazie Paleologo in 1834. He lived mostly in the capital Valletta, but while supervising the construction of the rotunda he lived at a house in Mosta belonging to the notary Francesco Chetcuti. This townhouse is now called Villa Grognet, and its design is attributed to Grognet. Upon completion of the rotunda, Grognet received an annual pension of £100 from Governor Le Marchant, but he died a few months later in 1862. He was buried in the chapel of the Virgin of the Girdle at the Mosta rotunda.

As part of the workers' education movement of the 1920s and 30s, the experimental program was unique in several ways. It was the first program of its kind for women in the United States; it was conceived, directed, and largely taught by women; and it was hosted by a women's college. Originally the brainchild of Bryn Mawr president M. Carey Thomas, the program was funded by philanthropists such as John D. Rockefeller Jr. and taught by distinguished faculty drawn from local institutions. Under the direction of Hilda Worthington Smith it evolved into a successful workers' education program that served as the model for several others. Many of the students, who came from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds and worked in a variety of industries, went on to become union leaders. For political reasons, the program fell out of favor with the college board of trustees and was terminated in 1938. The school is the subject of a 1985 documentary by Suzanne Bauman and Rita Heller, The Women of Summer.  History  = Founding = Bryn Mawr College President M. Carey Thomas conceived the idea for the school some time after visiting Workers' Educational Association (WEA) programs in England. According to Thomas, the inspiration came to her in the form of a vision while she was traveling in the Sahara Desert in 1919: > One afternoon at sunset I was sitting on my golden hilltop, rejoicing that > British women had just been enfranchised and American women would soon be > politically free ... when suddenly, as in a vision, I saw that out of the > hideous world war might come as a glorious aftermath international > industrial justice and international peace...I also saw as part of my vision > that the coming of equal opportunity for the manual workers of the world > might be hastened by utilizing the deep sex sympathy that women now feel for > each other before it has had time to grow less. In the fall of 1920, Thomas consulted with Dean Hilda Worthington Smith and Professor Susan M. Kingsbury about starting a summer school for working women. The planning committee also included labor leaders such as Mary Anderson from the U.S. Women's Bureau, Fannia Cohn from the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and Rose Schneiderman (of \\"Bread and Roses\\" fame) from the Women's Trade Union League. The school's aim, as described in a 1929 recruiting pamphlet, was: > To offer young women in industry opportunities to study liberal subjects and > to train themselves in clear thinking; to stimulate an active and continued > interest in the problems of our economic order; to develop a desire for > study as a means of understanding and of enjoyment of life. The school is > not committed to any theory or dogma. It is expected that thus the students > will gain a truer insight into the problems of industry and feel a more > vital responsibility for their solution. The school welcomed its first 82 students on June 15, 1921. To be eligible, students had to be between 20 and 35; have worked for at least three years, with two of those years in industry; have at least a sixth-grade education; be able to read and write English; and work \\"with the tools of their trade\\", not as supervisors or in white-collar jobs. = Administration = Hilda Worthington Smith directed the summer school for thirteen years, and is credited with developing it into the successful program that it became. The school was governed by a Joint Administrative Committee composed equally of industry women (such as Rose Schneiderman, who served on the committee for three years) and women of Bryn Mawr (faculty, administrators, and alumni). The School Council, which met once a week to plan school activities, consisted of seven students, three administrators, and three faculty. Regional committees, also composed equally of industry and Bryn Mawr women, were tasked with recruiting and fundraising. Funding was provided by a diverse group of supporters that included John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. The 90 faculty who taught at the school between 1921 and 1938 included trade union leaders as well as distinguished academics. The majority were women. = Philosophy and curriculum = In their overall approach, Thomas and Smith drew on the example of the WEA programs and the educational philosophy of John Dewey, with a strong emphasis on diversity and democratic process. They intentionally brought together representatives of widely disparate constituencies: trade union leaders and privileged Bryn Mawr alumni; mill workers who had left school at the age of 12 and university professors; union and non-union workers from a variety of industries across the U.S.; native-born Americans and immigrants from Russia, Italy, and Eastern Europe; Protestants, Catholics, and Jews. \\"We are learning toleration,\\" one student said in an interview with the Woman's Journal. Another remarked that \\"to her the summer work, the mingling with the representatives of many industries, of many localities, of many points of view, had brought home the conviction that the problem of each working woman was the problem of all, the problem of all that of each.\\" Initially the program of study was extensive, and workers with little formal education were overwhelmed. Over time, with input from the students, the curriculum evolved to become more focused on their practical needs. By 1928, they were using the \\"Unit Method\\": Classes were divided into units of around 20 students; each unit had two dedicated full-time professors, one in English and one in economics. A 1929 pamphlet describes the Plan of Teaching as: \\"Small classes in Economics, English Literature, Composition, Public Speaking, Science and Psychology. A tutoring system making it possible for workers to gain much in two months.\\" There were no grades or exams; students received a certificate of attendance at the end of the summer. As working adults, students were encouraged to participate in decision-making, planning, and classroom discussions. Instructors made a point of learning as much as they could about each student's background and individual needs. In addition to regular classes, students attended talks by an impressive array of guest lecturers, including John Dewey, W.E.B. Du Bois, Harold Laski, Frances Perkins, Walter Reuther, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, and Norman Thomas. They went on field trips to local museums, historical sites, and factories, and took tennis and swimming lessons. They held an annual folk music festival featuring music from the students' various homelands, and published a student magazine, Shop and School, featuring prose, poetry, humor, and drama. When John Dewey visited the school in 1931, he saw it as \\"a model of progressive education and experiential learning.\\" = Racial integration = In 1926, at the suggestion of the students, Hilda Worthington Smith admitted the first five African-American students to the summer school. The decision was a controversial one, given that the college had never admitted a black student. M. Carey Thomas warned Smith in a letter not to \\"complicate\\" matters, and quoted her late friend Susan B. Anthony: \\"Do not mix reforms, but drive straight through to your goal looking neither to the right nor to the left.\\" Smith continued to admit black students despite Thomas's misgivings. = Final years = From the very first year, the working women who came to Bryn Mawr gave school administrators more than they bargained for. In 1921 they organized a student protest, demanding better working conditions for the college's black maids and groundskeepers. In the 1930s, the Depression heightened class tensions between the politically active students and Bryn Mawr's wealthy donors and trustees. One trustee posed the telling question, \\"Why should we support your organizing workers to strike our husbands' plants?\\" In 1934, when students and faculty visited the nearby Seabrook Farms food-packing plant to observe a strike of agricultural workers, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Bryn Mawr was involved in the strike. Alarmed by the publicity, the trustees suspended the summer school for a year. It reopened in 1936, but the damage had been done; funding dwindled, and the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry closed for good in 1938. =Influence= Students and faculty of the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, 1921 Historian Rita Heller, who conducted a survey of the students in 1982, found that while some of the respondents were ambivalent about the program's usefulness, most credited it with improving their self- image and social skills and believed the school had helped them advance in their careers. Many went on to take leadership positions in their communities, churches, and trade unions. Elizabeth Nord became chairman of the New England Silk and Rayon Workers Union; Carmen Lucia became vice president of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union; and Rose Finkelstein Norwood led the Boston chapter of the Women's Trade Union League. The school served as a model for several other workers' education programs, including the Wisconsin Summer School, Barnard Summer School, Vineyard Shore School, Southern Summer School, and the coeducational Hudson Shore Labor School. Summer school alumni and faculty gathered at Bryn Mawr for a three-day reunion in June 1984. Several women at the reunion were featured in a 1985 documentary, The Women of Summer, a collaboration of filmmaker Suzanne Bauman and historian Rita Heller. The film was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and has won several awards, including the American Film Festival's Red Ribbon and the CINE Golden Eagle.

Once he arrived, he joined the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners (GUC&J;), and soon became secretary of his local lodge.Stephen Coltham, \\"Last, Robert\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.127 - 128 The headquarters of the GUC&J; rotated between various cities, and each in turn elected a general secretary. In 1862, when it was Manchester's turn, the union was in crisis. The previous general secretary, Thomas Skinner, had been imprisoned, and many of the union's branches had defected to the rival Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.25-26 Last was elected as secretary, on a platform of reorganisation. He persuaded members to accept new rules and benefits, and a new system where all union members voted for the secretary. On that basis, he was repeatedly re- elected, but was forced to move to Bristol in 1868 and Birmingham in 1872, as the headquarters continued to rotate. Last was firmly opposed to the ASC&J;, and also to the Junta. He worked closely with George Potter to maintain a reputation for being more radical than the ASC&J;, and established new lodges around the country. By 1876, when he stood down, membership of the union had reached a record of 11,841, although this fell away rapidly after his departure. In his spare time, Last was a keen butterfly collector.

By the time of the Medians, the city-states were administered in a democratic fashion. During the Achaemenids, in a debate over the constitution of Iran, Otanes argued in favor of democracy, however he did not succeed. He enumerated five characteristic marks of the democracy: 1, an equality of rights for all; 2, the rejection of arbitrary power as ordinarily exercised by eastern princes; 3, appointment to offices by lot; 4, responsibility in office; 5, deliberation in common, and the framing of laws in popular assemblies. By the time of Parthians, the appointment of kings was through election in the Parthian parliament, Megisthanes. In this way the king could be the representative of the whole nation. Early Iranians Regional elected councils are well documented particularly in the Indo-Iranian societies. Zoroaster's Gathas states that in order to bring peace, prosperity, stability, progress and happiness to the living world, people are to select only competent persons. Song 16 is particularly dedicated to \\"Vohû Khshathra Vairya,\\" literally \\"Good Domain Worthy-of-Choice.\\" It shows that an ideal government must be an elected one. In its most sacred prayer the Ahunavar (Choice of the Lord), Zoroastrians are taught that their Lord and leader are to be chosen, through a Good Mind and only on account of their individual righteousness. This sets the basis for a spiritual and political democracy as far back as nearly four millennia ago. Zoroaster, the Iranian prophet advised people to listen to all parties and to choose the best of them. He said (Yasna 30, paragraph 2) \\"O people, listen to others and accept the best of them, and consider them with a bright and deep thinking. Every man and woman should chose the path of good and bad by his/her own.\\"Yasna 30, paragraph 2 He did not discriminate between man and woman in this regard and counted them equally. In Yasna 30, he said \\"hearken with your ears to these best counsels, Reflect upon them with illumined judgment. Let each one choose his creed with that freedom of choice each must have at great events. O ye, be awake to these, my announcements.\\" Medes Diodorus mentions that after the Assyrians had ruled Asia for five hundred years \\"they were conquered by the Medes, and thereafter no king arose for many generations to lay claim to supreme power, but the city-states, enjoying a regimen of their own, were administered in a democratic fashion\\".Diodorus 9.20 Herodotus writes \\"After Assyrians had ruled upper Asia for five hundred and twenty years, the Medes were the first who began to revolt from them. These, it would seem, proved their bravery in fighting for freedom against the Assyrians; they cast off their slavery and won freedom. Afterwards, the other subject nations, too, did the same as the Medes. All of those on the mainland were now free men; but they came to be ruled by monarchs again, as I will now relate. There was among the Medes a clever man called Deioces: he was the son of Phraortes. Deioces was infatuated with sovereignty, and so he set about gaining it. Already a notable man in his own town (one of the many towns into which Media was divided), he began to profess and practice justice more constantly and zealously than ever, and he did this even though he knew that injustice is always the enemy of justice. Then the Medes of the same town, seeing his behavior, chose him to be their judge, and he (for he coveted sovereign power) was honest and just. By acting so, he won no small praise from his fellow townsmen, to such an extent that when the men of the other towns learned that Deioces alone gave fair judgments (having before suffered from unjust decisions), they came often and gladly to plead before Deioces; and at last they would submit to no arbitration but his. The number of those who came grew ever greater, for they heard that each case turned out in accord with the truth. Then Deioces seeing that everything now depend on him, would not sit in his former sear of judgment, and said he would give no more decisions; for it was of no advantage to him (he said) to leave his own business and spend all day judging the cases of his neighbors. This caused robbery and lawlessness to increase greatly in the towns; and, gathering together, the Medes conferred about their present affairs, and said (here, as IP suppose, the main speakers were Deioces' friends), 'since we cannot go on living in the present way in the land, come, let us set up a king over us; in this way the land will be well governed, and we ourselves shall attend to our business and not be routed by lawlessness.' With such words they persuaded themselves to be ruled by a king.\\" Herodotus, Histories, 1.96 So in this way people were electing their kings. Achaemenids Herodotus puts great emphasis on the fact that the proposals put forward included the idea of establishing \\"democracy\\" in Persia. Herodotus in Histories gives an account on a debate over the constitution of Iran (Persia) in 522 BC, where Otanes argued in favor of democracy, the principle of equality before the law, and the accountable government. He advocates a complete democracy, on the grounds that under a democratic system \\"offices of state are exercised by lot\\". In that session, Otanes also talked about the disadvantages of monarchy. He notes that democratic rule does not share any of the malice of a tyranny. Otanes was one of the seven members who overthrew Gaumata. He recommended that the management of public affairs should be entrusted to the whole nation. He said, \\"it seems advisable, that we should no longer have a single man to rule over us. the rule of one is neither good nor pleasant... How indeed is it possible that monarchy should be a well- adjusted thing, when it allows a man to do as he likes without being answerable?... I vote, therefore, that we do away with monarchy, and raise the people to power. For the people are all in all.\\" Otanes seems to find democracy inherently more equitable: \\"the rule of many has first a name attaching to it which is the fairest of all names, that is to say 'Equality.'\\" Popular government ensures moderate rule, he suggests. The book \\"The Archaic Smile of Herodotus\\" notes that \\"in arguing that democracy will be good for Persia, Otanes contradicts himself, for he proposes to change the traditional form of government. This violation of ancient custom is just the practice of which he accuses tyrants.\\" However Otanes was advocating a return to the equality and democracy that was customary in ancient Persia. So violation of these customs was what he was accusing tyrants about. Perhaps Otanes considered democracy reflecting Persia's tribal roots. Even though Otanes has not used the term demokratia in his speech, but his emphasis on equality under the law, elections by lot, and collective decisions makes it clear that he represents the democratic viewpoint. Some scholars have gone further by considering that not only Otanes was in fact advocating the democracy, but also \\"a pretty radical form of it\\". Some scholars have tended to equate Otanes' arguments with those of the author himself (Herodotus). Others have titled Otanes as \\"the champion of democracy\\". According to Arirstotle the three parts of a politeia are the deliberative, the magistracies, and the judiciary. This tripartite structure of the politeia was a traditional idea; Aristotle only elaborated upon it. The threefold division is already evident in Otanes' defence of democracy, where he defends democracy for its virtues in all three areas. From the viewpoint of the methodological approach, Otanes provided a \\"practical example\\" of Cambyses, that how he acted as a monarch in power. The moral force of Otanes' argument derives from his conviction that monarchy and oligarchy have proven untrustworthy, insofar as natural vanity is bount to corrupt even good individuals if left unchecked. In addition to book 3, later in book 6 Herodotus once again insists that the account of the debate is historical, and he vents his spleen at those who deny that Otanes advised the Persians to demokrateesthai.Herodotus, Histories, 6.43.3 Arsacids At the time of Parthians, kings were elected through the Parthian parliament, Magistan (in Greek: Megisthanes). The parliament was of two parts: one of the wise men and magi from across the country, and the second the relatives of the royal family. The two parts separately and together, were forming three different councils. The third one being the result of assembling of the members of two other councils in cases of emergency, where this council (of the two other councils) was called as Megisthanes. Strabo writes that \\"the Council of the Parthians, according to Poseidonius, consists of two groups, one that of kinsmen, and the other that of wise men and Magi, from both of which groups the kings were appointed.\\"Strabo, Geographica, book 11, chapter 9, section 3 The number of wise men in the parliament was more than that of the magis. Megisthanes was the first parliament of Iran. It can be concluded that the Parthian parliament was the result of the achievements of past civilizations specially the Achaemenids (who had their own councils) and Greeks. Justin (41.2.2), has called this parliament as senate.Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus, Justin, book 41, section 2, part 2 Tacitus states that the parliament was composed of 300 of the rich and wise men, which was forming a council like that of the senate. People are in charge of their legitimate power. Until the parliament and people have consensus, they are not afraid of the Parthian kings, but as soon as there appears a disagreement between them, each one of them (people, and the parliament) chose a party for themselves until their party succeeds. The events of the time of the Artabanus III and his removal and reinstallation are the best example of democracy and show the role of parliament in retention of the king in power. In the council of aristocrats and nobles, which was composed of the seven famous and popular families in addition to Arsacids family, other families like Sooren, Karan, and Espahpat were also part. This tradition should have come down from the time of Achaemenids where they had seven famous families in a council. The first session of the Megisthanes parliament, was held in Nowruz of the year 137 BC, where Mithridates I personally attended the council. Its first decision was to make the position of the king an elective position. Parthian kingdom was not based on absolutism, but there was a parliament where important issues was being resolved there. King was always counseling with the parliament, while the parliament members were not being chosen by the king, so the power of the king was limited by the nation. Justin considers one of the reasons for collapse of Parthian empire, the unlimited power of this parliament and the extreme actions of the parliament members.

It was formed on 5 June 1945 on the basis of the Berlin Declaration and the resulting creation of occupation zones for the victors of World War II out of the administrative regions (Regierungsbezirke) of Aachen, Düsseldorf and Cologne, which were all part of Prussia's Rhine Province. The southern part of Rhine province, consisting of the administrative regions of Koblenz and Trier became part of the French occupation zone on 5 June 1945.

He currently is a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College and the Director for the Dartmouth Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. He is best known for his work on face perception and applications of machine learning in functional neuroimaging. Education Haxby received a BA from Carleton College in 1973 and completed a Fulbright Scholarship at the University of Bonn in 1974. He obtained a PhD in clinical psychology at the University of Minnesota in 1981. Career After receiving his PhD, Haxby held several clinical psychology positions at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. Starting in 1982, Haxby began a two-decade tenure at the National Institutes of Health, working as a research psychologist at the National Institute on Aging and later as chief of the Section on Functional Brain Imaging at the National Institute of Mental Health. In 2002, Haxby began a professorship in the Department of Psychology at Princeton University, and in 2008 became the Evans Family Distinguished Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College. He is currently the director of the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center and the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth,. Haxby's scientific contributions span several topics in cognitive neuroscience. He has published numerous papers using functional neuroimaging to investigate the cortical organization underlying visual perception and semantic memory. He has also proposed an influential model of face perception where certain brain areas process invariant face properties such identity, while others process dynamic features critical for social interaction, such as emotional expressions and eye gaze. Haxby has played a critical role in introducing machine learning methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. This approach was popularized by a paper demonstrating that neural representations of faces and object categories are encoded in a distributed fashion in human ventral temporal cortex, a position that is typically contrasted with more modular accounts of the functional neuroanatomy of face processing. More recently, Haxby's research has focused on the cortical topographies mediating fine-grained semantic representation, methods for functional brain alignment, and using naturalistic stimuli (e.g., movies) to build computational models of neural representation that are common across individuals. He is a vocal proponent of open science.

The CM-21 is still in use today, with over 1,000 units manufactured and a number of different variants.* *-星島環球網 History At the end of 1967, the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) signed the Third-Nation Overhaul Program and began to repair US military equipment in Vietnam until the end of the Vietnam War. This allowed the RoC to accumulate experiences in the overhauling, welding, parts manufacturing, vehicle assembly, and testing of the M113 APC. In 1975, The Combined Logistics Command carried out the \\"Wan Cheng Program\\" (萬乘計劃), to domestically produce three M113 hulls using the aluminum alloy plates produced by the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation (known today as the Chinese Steel Aluminum Corporation). The Wan Cheng 1 was an imitation of the M106 mortar carrier, but the 4.2 inch rifled mortar was replaced with a larger Type 63 120 mm smoothbore mortar, and this innovation later became the CM-22 howitzer carrier. The Wan Cheng 2 is an attempt to create a light tank by moving the engine to the rear and lowering the front half of the hull to accommodate a M24 turret while keeping the vehicle from being top-heavy. The Wan Cheng 3 had mounted a \\"Worker Bees IV MLRS\\" (工蜂四型多管火箭), a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The MLRS was later mounted on six more US made M113s. (An unrelated Wan Cheng 4 project involves one M48A1 tank re-fitted into a M48A5).* *-尖端科技355期29至32頁。 The Wan Cheng Program provided a solid foundation for the design, manufacture and development of the CM-21 armoured vehicle. Design The standard version of CM-21 is an armoured personnel carrier (APC) that can carry up to 12 soldiers. It is largely the same as the basic M113 and inherits the same engine and transmission from the source design, but the welded aluminum alloy hull armour is further augmented with spaced armour at the front and the sides, the cavity within the spaced armour being filled with polyurethane to absorb the energy of incoming projectiles. Overall, the CM-21 is better protected than the M113, but the CM-21 is heavier than the M113 and has slightly inferior mobility. There are two firing ports on each side of the hull and one at the rear. Therefore, soldiers are sitting face to face in the front of the passenger compartment, and back to back in the rear. The CM-21 has floating capability, meaning it is able to cross water that is up to deep without preparation. There are two water pumps that are switched on to lower the front flap. It is propelled by its tracks while in water. Just like the M113, the CM-21 can also have external fuel tanks mounted on the rear. The basic armament of the CM-21 is one M2 Browning machine gun or an Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher, and a quad-mounted smoke grenade launcher on both sides of the front. A CM-21 is able carrying an M2 and an Mk 19 at the same time by using a bi-mounted gun rack. Variants =CM-21= CM-21A1 The CM-21 models currently in service are CM-21A1. The CM-21 is still a basic Armoured Personnel Carrier, and it cannot be upgraded to the CM-21A2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle. Also, with the introduction of CM-32 wheeled Armoured Vehicle, it is more unlikely that the CM-21A1 will receive an upgrade.

The engine's intake has been modified to take air from the inside of the vehicle, rather than using exhausted gas, which reduces the crew's performance in combat. The side armour is also replaced with a net armour to protect the vehicle from anti tank weapons with shaped charges. CM-21A2 is predicted to be upgraded directly into an infantry fighting vehicle, and was tested with a French GIAT Dragar 25 mm gun turret, but it was not accepted; a simple command turret was also added for the testing. =CM-22 Mortar Carrier= CM-22 is a variant of CM-21 with a 107/ 120 mm mortar, very similar to the American M106 mortar carrier. CM-22 was developed in 1987 and was still in production in 1999, but the ammo rack is different with an M106 in the late version of CM-22, along with parts from CM-21 such as headlights. The passenger compartment is modified to carry mortar, and cancelled firing ports and spaced armour. The exterior of the CM-22 is basically the same as M106. =CM-23 Mortar Carrier= CM-23 is a variant of the CM-22 with an 81 mm mortar, identical to the American M125. =CM-25 TOW Launcher= CM-25 is a variant of the CM-21 which has the capability of firing TOW missiles, in order to engage armoured targets. The CM-25 has a modified passenger compartment to store TOW missiles, and has replaced the quad-mounted smoke grenade launcher with triple mounted ones. It also cancelled the firing ports and extended the spaced armour, but the protection of the CM-25 is not any stronger. The CM-25 is only operated by the Republic of China Marine Corps, while the Republic of China Army is still operating M113A1 TOW Launcher. The spaced armour of CM-25 is filled with polystyrene to increase buoyancy for the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. =CM-26 Command Track= CM-26 is a command track derived from the CM-22, and it is similar to the American M577.

It is the last remaining MÁV-operated narrow-gauge railroad of Hungary as of 2017. History The surroundings of the railroad were originally part of the Lake Balaton, but later it became an isolated moorland that was drained in the 1860s. After that, local landowners tried to connect their lands with the outside world, but they had difficulties with the muddy terrain. The first local line was a 4 km long, 600 mm gauge railroad that connected Balatonfenyves' normal gauge rail station with Imremajor. It used horses instead of locomotives, and there was no passenger traffic. During World War II, it was destroyed. The need for the railroad was still very strong (with no paved road in the area), therefore the construction of a new, 760 mm gauge railway was started in 1950. It was one of the latest railroads of the GV (local, mainly freight-purposed narrow-gauge train) system in the country. Passenger traffic was installed in 1956. Operation was transferred to the state railways in 1960. Although the 1968 Transportation Policy Conception put an end to nearly all the GV lines, Balatonfenyves was the sole GV to see a passenger growth, mainly because of the tourists from the Balaton area and those going to the Csiszta spa (a new terminus closer to the spa was opened in 1988). The freight traffic ended in 1990, resulting in the demolition of several branch lines. The heavy carriages and the steam engines on the relatively small rails caused damage on the track, becoming heavier and heavier. After drastically reducing the speed limit, two of the three lines (Csisztapuszta, Táska) were closed in September 2002. The only remaining line, from Balatonfenyves to Somogyszentpál was renovated later that year. In late 2009, the fate of the line, along with the two other MÁV-operated narrow-gauge railroad, became questionable, but unlike the Kecskemét and Nyíregyháza networks, it remained in operation.  Importance This small but very important train transports not only tourists in the summer but locals to and from their place of work all year round. It connects with the main line Balatonfenyves where you can travel anywhere in Europe. Somogyszentpál where it terminates is a somewhat cosmopolitan village with Europeans from Austria, England, Germany, Switzerland to name but a few countries and a mix of Hungarian people. The possibilities of such a diverse cultural village is yet to be realised. The Trainline has a big part to play in the village.

He is a right-handed batsman and bowls right- arm medium-fast, basing his bowling style on former Test cricketer Glenn McGrath. Grant has played internationally for Australia's national under-19 team and currently plays domestically for South Australia. Youth career (2014–2016) When Grant started playing cricket, he decided to model himself after the Australian Test bowler Glenn McGrath, who was dominating world cricket at the time. Rather than trying to bowl as quickly as he could, McGrath focused on movement off the seam and consistently bowling the ball in the right place, so Grant followed the same suit in his own bowling. While he was still a teenager Grant started to play cricket for Australia's national under-19 team, making his Youth ODI debut in 2014 against Sri Lanka. The second innings of the match was washed out and Grant didn't get an opportunity to bowl. During 2015 Grant spent the winter training at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane, and during his time there he also got to spend time training under Glenn McGrath at India's MRF Pace Foundation. Grant described this experience as \\"definitely the highlight\\" of his career to that point. Grant was selected to play for Australia later in the winter in England. He played Youth Test matches against England and took part in a Youth ODI series against them as well, with a highlight performance in the third match taking three wickets in consecutive overs with spearing yorkers. After strong performances for Australia in a variety of conditions, he was selected to play for South Australia in the national under-19 championships at the end of 2016. Overall Grant played two Youth Tests and nine Youth ODIs. Domestic career (2016–present) In September 2016 Grant represented the National Performance Squad team in the Quadrangular Tournament, with Australia A, India A and South Africa A being the other three teams. During the tournament he made his List A cricket debut against South Africa A and was a standout performer with bowling figures of four wickets for 31 runs to help the National Performance Squad to a 17-run victory, bowling out South Africa A for 226. Grant was given a rookie contract with South Australia's state cricket team for the 2016–17 season and, because he was not selected to play for South Australia in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, he was part of the Cricket Australia XI squad for the tournament instead, along with a number of people he'd played and trained with in the National Performance Squad. Later in the season he was also given an opportunity to make his first-class cricket debut when he was named in South Australia's 12-man squad for two consecutive matches in the 2016–17 Sheffield Shield season. His debut came against New South Wales on 5 December 2017. He took two wickets for 55 runs in his first bowling innings. In March Grant suffered a foot stress fracture, meaning he couldn't play for South Australia for the rest of the season, but he was still upgraded from his rookie contract to a full contract with South Australia for the next season. Player profile Grant is a tall pace bowler. As he has based his playing style on Glenn McGrath, Grant does not focus on bowling very quickly. He is a seam bowler who works on getting the ball in the right place and only bowls at speeds of around 125 km/h, though SACA high-performance manager Tim Nielsen has said he is capable of getting into the 130's. Nielsen has also said that he is similar to fellow Redbacks bowler Chadd Sayers, but as he is taller and potentially faster he could become more like Australian Test bowler Josh Hazlewood with time. His experience on pitches around the world from a young age have given him more experience in different conditions and helped his development.

These technologies have revolutionized their respective markets. They have been adopted around the globe and produced major reductions in the number of serious injuries and fatalities along highways and race tracks. Sicking’s innovations have produced more than $1.3 billion in sales and have prevented thousands of serious injuries and fatalities. Furthermore, Sicking has been principal or co- principal investigator on research projects with total extramural funding in excess of $30 million. He has authored or co-authored more than 200 technical reports, more than 70 refereed journal papers and 7 books.Sicking, Dean L., \\"Curriculum Vitae: Dean L. Sicking, Ph.D., P.E.\\", University of Alabama at Birmingham. Accessed May 8, 2016. Additionally, Sicking has developed functional performance standards for a number of different impact attenuation systems, including developing nationally accepted performance standards for roadside safety features. Sicking is in the final stages of development for safer hockey boards and a football helmet that can decouple rotation of the helmet from rotation of the head. Energy absorbing guardrail terminals Sicking has devoted his career to designing impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on crashworthy safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous \\"next generation\\" designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing guardrail terminal – a device that sits over the end of a guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities — reducing the risk by a factor of 10.Martin, Grant. \\"Street Smarts: Saving Lives on the Highway\\", UAB Magazine, Spring, 2013. Accessed May 18, 2016.. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial. \\"The first time this thing ever got hit was when a young lady was driving home from the library at the University of Texas,\\" Sicking explains. \\"She was driving a small pickup truck with her cruise control set at highway speeds when she fell asleep and drifted off the road. She hit the guardrail at 65 or 70 miles per hour, and her only injury was a bruise across her chest caused by the seat belt. I got a very nice letter from her father describing the crash. He felt that she almost certainly would have been killed if she had hit one of the other common guardrail systems, and there is a high probability that he was right. But to hear that from a father whose daughter walked away unhurt—you live for moments like that.\\" The first implementation of the ET-2000 in the United States caused market prices to soar. To alleviate this issue, Sicking created a second energy absorbing systems that offered meaningful competition in order to reduce costs without sacrificing the safety performance.Sicking, D.L. and B.G. Pfeifer, U.S. Patent No. 7,111,827, Energy Absorption System, September 26, 2006, Licensed to Interstate Steel Inc., Big Spring, Texas. These two guardrail terminals are now the most widely used in the United States, Canada and Australia. Building on his first guardrail designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As the center of gravity and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system. SAFER barrier Following Dale Earnhardt’s fatal wreck in 2001, NASCAR commissioned Sicking to determine the specific cause of Earnhardt’s worst injuries. Sicking use video footage to analyze and reconstruct the crash, as well as NASCAR’s worst crashes over the 10 years prior. Ultimately, the investigation contributed to the development of the Sicking’s best-known invention, the SAFER barrier, an energy management system that reduces the impact felt by the driver by flexing and absorbing energy. Prior to the barrier, NASCAR and IndyCar averaged approximately 1.5 driver fatalities yearly. Since the SAFER barrier’s implementation in 2004, no fatalities or serious injuries associated with SAFER Barrier’s impact have occurred. In fact, the only remotely serious injury sustained has been a broken sternum. The magnitude of the impact of Sicking’s technologies is best illustrated by driver comments about the SAFER barrier :\\"About Us\\", Midwestern Roadside Safety Facility – University of Nebraska. Accessed May 18, 2016. Performance standards Sicking has assisted in the development of fundamental performance standards that have significantly altered energy management systems in highway safety. This has resulted in an increase in required safety performance of roadside safety systems. He was second author of the Standards for Roadside Safety adopted in 1993 and principle author of the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, adopted by the Federal Highway Administration in 2010 and currently used as the standard. These standards have since been implemented in Canada, Australia, Israel, and much of Europe as well. Sicking’s quantitative and qualitative crash analyses, similar to those he used for NASCAR, were critical components of these standards. =Sports safety research= In 2011, Sicking turned his attention to impact energy management in sports. Serious neck injuries in hockey are relatively infrequent but can be catastrophic. Impacts with the rigid walls can produce decelerations of over 100 G’s, causing severe concussions and even quadriplegia. Sicking led the creation of energy absorbing walls that have been shown to successfully reduce head decelerations by 50% under severe impact conditions. These walls are designed to flex and extend during impacts, reducing peak G’s on the player’s head by absorbing the energy of the impact.\\"Advancing the Science of Safety\\", University of Alabama at Birmingham. Accessed May 18, 2016. Sicking is now applying this same concept to develop both improved helmet impact performance standards and a helmet that is more flexible and can decouple head rotation from helmet rotation, thus reducing peak G’s on the head.Blount, Terry. \\"Famed Engineering Turns Eye to Football\\" ESPN.

Born in Wolverhampton, Trow grew up in Wednesbury. He left school when he was ten years old, and found employment at an ironworks, alongside his father. Three years later, he became a puddler at the works, then in 1850, he moved to Glasgow, in 1852 on to Consett, and then various locations until he returned to the Black Country early in the 1860s. There, he joined the Associated Ironworkers of Great Britain union, becoming a branch secretary.Eric Taylor, \\"Trow, Edward (1833–99)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.187–192 In 1867, Trow moved to Darlington, again in search of work. The Associated Ironworkers did not organise in the town, so Trow transferred to the National Association of Ironworkers, led by John Kane. Given his experience, Trow was immediately as secretary of his lodge. The following year, Kane reformed the union as the Amalgamated Malleable Ironworkers of Great Britain, and Trow was elected to its first general council. In 1872, he was elected as both president and assistant secretary of the union, then in 1874 switched the presidency for the post of treasurer, which was made full-time. Within the union, Trow focused on promoting negotiation with employers, avoiding industrial action, and for centralising power in the union, rather than allowing district high levels of autonomy. He also joined the Board of Arbitration and Conciliation for the Manufactured Iron Trade in the North of England. Kane died in 1876, and Trow succeeded him as general secretary, but was faced with a union which was in rapid decline. By 1887, it was evident that he was unable to do so, and the new British Steel Smelters' Association was recruiting many potential members. Trow organised a conference which formed the Associated Iron and Steel Workers of Great Britain, becoming its first general secretary, although he remained secretary of the Malleable Ironworkers until it was merged into the new union in 1892. This new union proved a success, working closely with conciliation boards and gradually uniting workers around the UK. Trow remained its secretary until his sudden death, early in 1899. In his spare time, Trow served on the 1892 Royal Commission on Labour, and was vice-president of the Darlington Liberal Association. He once stood for Darlington's council as a Liberal-Labour representative, but was not elected, and decided against pursuing a political career.

An advisor to the king, he was professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society, the Société royale de médecine and the Academies of Montpellier, Nîmes and Toulouse.  Life  Charles Le Roy was the youngest of the four sons of French watchmaker Julien Le Roy (1686–1759).Julien Le Roy ou la naissance de l'Horloge Horizontale He had three brothers, the watchmaker Pierre Le Roy (1717–1785), the physicist Jean- Baptiste Le Roy and the architect Julien-David Le Roy (1724–1803). His paternal uncle Pierre Le Roy (1687-1762) was also a watchmaker. His father gave him an excellent education. Because he was weak and vulnerable, the young Le Roy was sent to the Mediterranean city of Montpellier where he began to study medicine, which he continued in Italy. From there he went to Paris. But soon he was forced for health reasons, to settle again in Montpellier. He obtained his doctorate at the local medical school and soon became a professor. His teaching was very highly considered because of his thoroughness and accuracy. He had a wealth of experience, and it was a great loss for Montpellier when he returned to Paris in 1777 at the urging of his family. But this return to the capital proved fatal, for he died two years later.  Achievements  In 1755, Le Roy tried to cure a patient of his blindness by sending electric current pulses through a wire wound around the head. The blind man perceived vivid flashes of light, but could not be cured.Pascual- Leone, A. and Wagner, T., A Brief Summary of the History of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Annu. Rev. Biomed.

The union was founded by John Kane in 1862 as the Amalgamated Malleable Ironworkers. Kane became its first president and editor of its journal, which was initially known as Sons of Vulcan. He built membership up to 6,500, largely based in the north of England. In 1866, the union led a strike in opposition to pay cuts of between 10 and 60%. The strike was defeated after twenty weeks, and membership of the union fell to under 500.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, pp.270-271 Undeterred by the near-collapse of the union, Kane convinced the remaining members to adopted a new constitution and a \\"of Great Britain\\" to the name of the union. He was elected as general secretary, and was able to rapidly increase membership, which reached 14,000 by 1871, and peaked at 35,000 in 1873. However, after this date, it faced increased competition, particular in Wales, where almost all of its members defected to the rival Independent Association of Tinplate Makers. Membership began to fall, particularly after Kane's death in 1876; it was only 5,000 in 1878, and just 1,200 in 1884. In an attempt to recruit more members, the union changed its rules in the 1880s, admitting steelworkers, and paying unemployment benefits, but this had little impact. Instead, general secretary Edward Trow founded a new union, the Associated Iron and Steel Workers of Great Britain.

It represents a change in how a society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By looking at a product's entire lifecycle new opportunities can be found to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, and reduce costs.https://www.epa.gov/smm U.S. and global consumption of materials increased rapidly during the last century. According to the Annex to the G7 Leaders’ June 8, 2015 Declaration, global raw material use rose during the 20th century at about twice the rate of population growth. For every 1 percent increase in gross domestic product, raw material use has risen by 0.4 percent.https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/2015/06/08/annex-g-7-leaders-declaration This increasing consumption has come at a cost to the environment, including habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, overly stressed fisheries and desertification. Materials management is also associated with an estimated 42 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to find more productive and sustainable ways to extract, use and manage materials, and change the relationship between material consumption and growth, has grave implications for our economy and society.  Introduction  320x320px Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) represents a framework to sustainably manage materials and products throughout the entire lifecycle, from resource extraction, design and manufacturing, resource productivity, consumption and end-of-life management. Traditional patterns of material consumption in the United States follow a Cradle-to-Grave pattern of raw material extraction, product manufacturing, distribution to consumers, use by consumers, and disposal; coined by The Story of Stuff author Annie Leonard as the \\"take-make-waste\\" linear economy and commonly referred to as the throw-away society, these familiar waste management practices are being revised to bring about sustainable management of resources. SMM represents a shift in how materials are used and valued with a focus on the environmental impact of material use and environmental protection throughout the entire lifecycle of a product. SMM has been adopted as a regulatory approach to manage materials by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and many other governments around the world. Sustainable Materials Management is a broad approach that overlaps and supplements many programs and concepts being adopted by governments and business around the world including zero waste, green chemistry, eco-labeling, sustainable supply-chain management, lean manufacturing, green procurement, the US EPA’s Design for the Environment Program, the G8’s 3R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle) program, UNEP's Sustainable Production and Consumption and Sustainable Resource Management programs, and OECD's Sustainable Materials Management framework. = Differences between Waste Management and SMM = * SMM seeks the highest use of all resources while waste management focuses on managing and reducing waste and waste pollutants at the end of the lifecycle * SMM focuses on the entire lifecycle of materials and products while waste management focuses on just the end-of life management of waste products * SMM is concerned with inputs and outputs to/from the environment and associated impacts to air and water and is not geographically constrained while waste management only looks at outputs to the environment from waste and areas where waste is managed * SMM's overall goal is long term sustainability while waste management focuses on managing one environmental impact, that associated with waste products * SMM considers all industries and consumers associated with the lifecycle of a material and product as a responsible party where as waste management only considers the generators of the waste as the responsible party  Product Lifecycle Models  There are several similar and overlapping efforts to define and conceptualize a closed loop lifecycle of product and materials management, with many of these efforts being spearheaded by government agencies, entrepreneurs, scientists and non-governmental organizations. While similar to SMM, these product lifecycle models focus largely on the end-of-life management of materials while SMM focuses on the impacts materials, products and services have on the environment such as eutrophication, acidification, ozone layer depletion, global warming and aquatic toxicity as well as energy and water use. = Product Stewardship = The Product Stewardship Institute defines Product stewardship as: > \\"the act of minimizing the health, safety, environmental, and social impacts > of a product and its packaging throughout all lifecycle stages, while also > maximizing economic benefits. The manufacturer, or producer, of the product > has the greatest ability to minimize adverse impacts, but other > stakeholders, such as suppliers, retailers, and consumers, also play a role. > Stewardship can be either voluntary or required by law\\". British Columbia (BC) has an extensive product stewardship network administered by BC Recycles and composed of BC producers and brand owners who are required by law to collect and divert end-of-life products and packaging. = Circular Economy = The U.Ks Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP) defines the Circular Economy as being an alternative to the traditional take, make, waste economy to one that keeps resources in use as long as possible, extracts the maximum value from the materials while they are in use, then recovers the materials to generate new products at the end of the service life. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation works to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by working with businesses, academia and governments throughout the world to develop an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design and seeks to keep products, components and materials at their highest use and value at all times, distinguishing between biological and technical cycles. = Cradle-to-Cradle = The Dictionary of Sustainable Management defines Cradle-to-Cradle as > \\"A phrase invented by Walter R. Stahel in the 1970s and popularized by > William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 book of the same name. > This framework seeks to create production techniques that are not just > efficient but are essentially waste free. In cradle-to-cradle production, > all material inputs and outputs are seen either as technical or biological > nutrients. Technical nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of > quality and biological nutrients composted or consumed. By contrast cradle- > to-grave refers to a company taking responsibility for the disposal of goods > it has produced, but not necessarily putting products’ constituent > components back into service.\\" = Closed Loop Recycling = In closed loop recycling, a material is captured at the end of life and introduced back into the manufacturing process to make a new product  Implementing SMM Globally  = The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) = The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) formed in 1960 and currently comprising 35 member countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and 23 countries in the European Union, works to foster economic prosperity and end poverty by promoting economic growth and financial stability for governments around the world while also taking into account the implications that economic and social growth have on the environment. Since the 1980s, the OECD has worked to promote policies that prevent, reduce and manage waste in ways that mitigate environmental impacts. It has become clear over time that increasing economic activity and materials consumptions calls for a systematic materials based approach to managing waste, one that seeks to incorporate materials back into the manufacturing process at the end of their life, in what is commonly referred to as a “cradle to cradle” approach to materials management as opposed to the traditional “cradle to grave” waste management approach. Around 2001 the OECD began to address many countries’ interest in viewing waste as a resource that can be used as inputs for new products and many countries and governments have begun adopting sustainable materials management policies. In 2012, the OECD put out a Green Growth Policy Brief on Sustainable Materials Management. In it they define SMM as > “…an approach to promote sustainable materials use, integrating actions > targeted at reducing negative environmental impacts and preserving natural > capital throughout the life-cycle of materials, taking into account economic > efficiency and social equity”. The OECD working definition includes the following notes on the definition of SMM: * \\"Materials” include all those extracted or derived from natural resources, which may be either inorganic or organic substances, at all points throughout their life-cycles. * “Life-cycle of materials” includes all activities related to materials such as extraction, transportation, production, consumption, material/product reuse, recovery, and disposal. * An economically efficient outcome is achieved when net benefits to society as a whole are maximized. * A variety of policy tools can support SMM, such as economic, regulatory and information instruments and partnerships. * SMM may take place at different levels, including firm/sector and different government levels. SMM may cover different geographical areas and time horizons. = The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) = Sustainable Production and Consumption (UNEP) Sustainable Resource Management (UNEP) = The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) = The US EPA has adopted Sustainable Materials Management as a regulatory framework for managing materials. In June 2009 the EPA put out a report that functioned as a road map to SMM in the U.S. titled Sustainable Materials Management - The Road Ahead 2009 - 2020. In this report, EPA defines SMM as > “... an approach to serving human needs by using/reusing resources > productively and sustainably throughout their life cycles, generally > minimizing the amount of materials involved and all associated environmental > impacts”. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets the legislative basis for SSM in the United States, establishing a preference for resource conservation over disposal. In 2010, the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery shifted focus from just resource recovery efforts to adopt a broader sustainable materials management approach. The new approach includes the two original waste management mandates of RCRA: 1) to protect human health and the environment from waste and 2) to conserve resources, and adds in three additional goals: 1) to “Reduce waste and increase the efficient and sustainable use of resources”, 2) “Prevent exposures to humans and ecosystems from the use of hazardous chemicals” 3) “Manage wastes and clean up chemical releases in a safe, environmentally sound manner”. In 2015 EPA published the report EPA Sustainable Materials Management Program Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2017 – 2022. This five-year plan will focus on three strategic initiatives: # The built environment # Organics recycling, and # Reduction in packaging Other areas the EPA will focus on include sustainable electronics management, life-cycle assessment, measurement, and international SMM collaboration.

He was awarded the 2015 Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. He bucked for 7 years, a total of 127 times; 33 of those times he was ridden at all levels. Chicken on a Chain finished his career with 130 outs (80 of them were at Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) events). The 2007 World Champion bull holds a career average of 45 points per out and \\"arguably became the most popular bucking bull in PBR history\\". At the time he was active he was the only bucking bull in PBR history with more than 100 outs and an average career score of 45 or higher. Today, Chicken on a Chain is still considered one of the most popular bucking bulls. An article published on the PBR website December 15, 2016 puts him in this list \\"PBR Tough 10: Baddest Buckers.\\"  Background  Little information about Chicken's parentage is known, except that his sire was #599 Scar. In 2006, Robinson purchased Chicken on a Chain from a family \\"out in the sticks\\" in South Carolina. This is where the story of how Chicken got his name comes in. According to Robinson's bull handler, Clint Haas: > They went down 'ner and they knocked on the door and this little boy come to > the door. They was like, 'We're here to pick up that bull.' That little boy > says, 'Yes, dad told me you could have him, but said on one condition: he > had to leave his name the same.' And Jeff's like, 'What his name?' And he > says, 'Chicken on a Chain.' Jeff's like, 'Ok, how'd he get that name?' The > boy says, 'That mean mother (expletive) got out and run through' – they had > them, they was into cock fighting. You know how they got all them roosters > staked out with a chain on the foot to keep them in place? Apparently he'd > run through the prized fighting chickens and got the best rooster's chain > wrapped around his foot. That little boy said it took us a damn two weeks to > catch the son of gun to get the chain off. He drug a dead chicken for two > weeks. After that they called him Chicken on a Chain. For the bulk of that first year, the bull was mean and difficult, and Robinson contemplated selling. However, instead he \\"loaded him on his trailer and hauled him around from one Touring Pro Division event to another for much of the year\\". A couple of years after purchasing Chicken, he had a couple dozen more bulls. \\"You hear in sports where one guy carries a team,\\" Robinson said. \\"Well, this bull carried me. He gave me the opportunity to be where I'm at. Without him I wouldn't be where I'm at, no doubt.\\" Chicken on a Chain was a huge bull, and in his stock contractor's own words, he was described as, \\"impossible to miss.\\" Black with lighter brown spots, he had huge horns. With a big white stripe that went all the way down his face, he weighed in at more than 2,100 pounds, and was called a \\"freak of nature\\" by many of the top PBR riders of the world because of his massive size and his athleticism.  Career  Although Chicken on a Chain was purchased by stock contractor Jeff Robinson in 2006, Blue Collar comedian Larry the Cable Guy and Mike Tedesco also bought an interest in the bull that year. Chicken is just one of a few other bulls that Robinson co-owns with celebrities. Chicken is co-owned by Robinson, Tedesco Buckin' Bulls, and Larry the Cable Guy. Robinson states, \\"He just called me one day and said he was interested in the bulls and it just went from there.\\" Chicken competed in the PBR from 2005 to 2012. By 2007 he hit his peak buck-off percentage and was voted the World Champion Bull that year. That same year, he bucked off a career best of 94.44 percent of the riders. He went on 18 outs, 12 of which were on the BFTS. He bucked off 17 of those 18, with only 1 rider getting a qualified ride. That year, Justin McBride made the whistle for 93 points. His average bull score for the whole year was 46.188. One of his more famous outings occurred when Renato Nunes rode him in St. Louis for 95.75 points in 2008. This outing brought them the 11th spot on the list of highest scores in PBR history at that time. The second highest score is 96 points, and the highest score 96.5. In 2009, Chicken was about a year past recovery from serious complications of kidney stones, and was \\"moving into a senior year age bracket for bucking bulls\\". But in September 2009, he was getting ready to buck at the BFTS in Springfield, Missouri. He was one of the top ranked bulls scheduled to perform and \\"he can still move plenty fast enough to buck cowboys\\" into the dirt or into 90+ rides. As Robinson says, \\"So the moral to my story: Just because someone gets sick doesn't mean that they're done.\\" Brett Hoffman, who writes articles for PBR, said, \\"One huge factor that impresses me about Chicken on a Chain is he's big and can move. I really admire any larger bull who can be compared to an offensive lineman in size and a defensive back in speed. That's one reason that I became a huge fan of the late Bodacious in the mid 1990s.\\" > You just don't see bulls that big that can move like that.\\" Robinson said of > Chicken on a Chain. \\"The bad thing about this is you just don't come across > bulls like that much anymore. Cody Lambert says all of the time that Chicken > on a Chain is a throwback (to earlier eras of bull riding). He's a throwback > to the kind of bulls that they used to get on, bulls that were big and stout > and mean. Brett Hoffman again, \\"The good news is that Chicken on a Chain is back and is going strong. He'll always stand out in my mind, and without a doubt, he's a big hit with many fans.\\" \\"I had a guy come up to me one time and said Chicken on a Chain is my favorite bull,\\" Robinson said. \\"I asked, 'Why?' The guy said something to the effect that he had the look, the attitude and the name and when it comes to bucking bulls, you just don't get that total package.\\" Chicken's last out came at the PBR World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chicken on a Chain went head to head with two-time World Champion bull riding legend Chris Shivers. That night and first ride for Shivers was Chicken's final ride. After Chris lasted 6.73 seconds on Chicken, he bucked off and Chicken won his last ride before retiring. Shivers still had one more ride the next night and then he also was going to retire. As of 2015, Chicken on a Chain at the end of his career, he had a total of 130 outs. And 80 of those 130 outs were at the BFTS level. Chicken on a Chain finished his career with an average of 45 points per out. At that time, he was the only bull in the PBR who had more than 100 outs and that average score of 45 points (or higher). He was ranked fourth on the list of 90-point ride producers. He was the high-marked bull 41 times out of all of those 80 BFTS events he participated in. Of the 27 times he was ridden in his career, only 13 times did the rider win the round. As of December 2016, he was ranked 65th. Chicken on a Chain qualified for the PBR World Finals six out of the seven years he competed, earning an average bull score of 44.98. Brendon Clark said, > I remember seeing him at some Touring Pro (Division events), early on, and > he was really wild. For a bull his size, super-athletic is the best way to > explain him doing it at this level. That's amazing. He's a bull that went > for a long time without getting ridden, and then some of the best rides I've > seen have been from that bull. Justin McBride and Renato Nunes are two that > come to mind. He was an exceptional bull. Ben Jones said, \\"He was big and had two horns as big as baseball bats, so if you were going to get him rode you had to be a bull rider. You couldn't be half-hearted.\\" J.B. Mauney said, > When I first saw that bull he was probably the meanest bull I had ever seen. > I hung up on him a few times and that got pretty scary. He's a big ol' bull > and he's been great for a long time. There are not many bulls that can go > that long, travel as many miles as he traveled and still be that good. He'll > go down as being one of the best bulls ever. He had heart, plus he weighed > about 2,000 pounds. Chicken on a Chain was and is a fan favorite. He is a very athletic bull who has been very successful each year he has been in the PBR. He is introduced to \\"the loudest standing ovation\\". = Honors = * Co-Bull of the PBR Finals, 2007 * ProBullStats Hall of Honor * 2007 PBR World Champion Bull * 2015 PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor  References   External links  * Chicken on a Chain retiring * Chicken on a Chain (Bucking Bull) – 07 PBR Finals * TOP RIDE: Justin McBride conquers the legendary Chicken on a Chain * ABBI American Bucking Bull, Inc. * Probullstats website Chicken on a Chain's career stats * Chicken on a Chain Brand of Honor Individual bulls in sport Bucking bulls Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends ","title":"Chicken on a Chain"},{"id":"51497644","text":"Lauren Redniss is an American artist and writer.

Foundation The union's origins lay in a meeting at Wellesbourne in Warwickshire, held in February 1872. Joseph Arch, a well-known labourer and Methodist preacher, addressed a meeting which was to have been held in the Stags Head pub. However, rather than the thirty or so labourers he had expected to attend, around 2,000 workers from across south Warwickshire turned up. The meeting was held outside, Arch speaking under a chestnut tree.Joseph Arch, The story of his life told by himself The success of Arch's speech led to a series of further meetings, and the election of a committee, who met at John Lewis' farmhouse in the village. On Good Friday, the committee held a meeting at Leamington Spa which established the Warwickshire Agricultural Labourers Union, Arch becoming its president, Henry Taylor its general secretary, and Matthew Vincent its treasurer.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, pp.286-287, 298-299 Policies The union aimed to limit working time to a nine-and-a-half hour day, and institute a minimum wage of 16 shillings a week. It supported workers who wished to emigrate, reasoning that this would reduce labour supply in Britain and drive up wages. It also supported the Liberal Party's \\"Free Breakfast Table\\" policy of abolishing taxes on basic foodstuffs.Frank Trentman, 'Political culture and political economy: interest, ideology and free trade', Review of International Political Economy 5:2 Summer 1998, p. 230. Growth and decline The union recruited rapidly, asking new members for 6d, then 2d a week subscription. Meetings were held across the country, leading the union to become the \\"National Agricultural Labourers Union\\". The initial success of the union led to several rivals emerging: the Kent and Sussex Agricultural Labourers' Union, Lincolnshire Labour League, Huntingdonshire Agricultural Labourers' Union, Oxford and District Agricultural Labourers' Union, Suffolk and Cambridge Agricultural Labourers' Union, West Surrey Union, Wiltshire Agricultural and General Labourers' Union, Worcestershire Agricultural Labourers' Union, and unions in Devon, Dorset, Norfolk, Shropshire and South Buckinghamshire. In March 1873, the London Trades Council organised a conference aiming to merge all the unions together. However, NALU refused to amend any of its rules. Its Gloucester District disagreed, and joined with the other unions in forming the Federal Union of Labourers. By 1873, membership of NALU had reached 71,835 in 982 branches, with wages reportedly increasing by 20 to 25%. Membership peaked at 86,214 in 1874, but by now, farmers were organising in opposition to the union, employing only non-union labour and agreeing to offer standard terms of 2 shillings for a 12-hour day. More than 10,000 union members found themselves out of work; the union paid unemployment benefit, but this was unsustainable, and it gave in during July. Despite the defeat, membership initially remained high, as workers were encouraged to secretly maintain union membership while working for anti-union farmers. However, a succession of poor harvests weakened the union's position, and membership fell below 10,000 in 1887, then halved again that year; the few remaining members were concentrated in Eastern England. Industrially weak, the union turned its attention to campaigning for an extension of the electoral franchise to all adult men, and providing sickness and funeral benefits to members. In 1890, Arch began a new recruitment campaign; many workers were inspired by the London Dock strike of 1889, and membership again rose above 15,000, two-thirds of them in Norfolk. However, further strike defeats over the next few years led to wage reductions. Membership dropped quickly, falling to 1,000 in 1895. The union dissolved itself the following year. Activists The first executive committee, elected in 1872, consisted of G. Allington, J. Biddle, H. Blackwell, J. Harris, E. Haynes, B. Herring, G. Jordans, G. Lunnon, Tom Parker, E. Pill, T. Prickett and Edwin Russell. The 1875 executive committee consisted of Malin (Warwickshire), H. Blackwell (Warwickshire), Edward Richardson (Wolverton), Henry Hemming (Cirencester), George M. Ball (Suffolk), James Margeston (Swaffham), James Crick (Suffolk), Ford (Banbury), George A. Morris (South Lincolnshire), Bowdon (Cirencester), Johnson (Wolverton) and Edgington (Oxford). Its trustees were Alfred Arnold, Jesse Collings, Edward Jenkins and George Mitchell, and F. S. Attenborough was the treasurer. The Norfolk-based union has a very different leadership; in 1891, its executive consisted of A. Baker, J. Cockbill, W. Eatwell, Thomas Lambert, S. Lush, J. Taylor and Zacharias Walker. Other activists in the union included Arthur Clayden, Howard Evans, Auberon Herbert, John Lewis, Harry Nicolls, George Rix and Hugh Fairfax-Cholmeley.§memoirs of Hugh Fairfax-Cholmeley, private papers. =General Secretaries= :1872: Henry Taylor :1877: Robert Collier :1890: Thomas Wager References Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom Agriculture and forestry trade unions 1872 establishments in the United Kingdom Trade unions established in 1872 Agricultural organisations based in the United Kingdom Trade unions disestablished in the 1890s ","title":"National Agricultural Labourers' Union"},{"id":"51497736","title":"2016–17 Gamma Ethniki"},{"id":"51497751","text":"Pedro Beltrán (died 1505) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Tui (1487–1505) and Bishop of Ciudad Rodrigo (1485–1505).

During an interview with MSNBC, Gutierrez referred to his Mexican heritage, stating that \\"My culture is a very dominant culture, and it's imposing and it's causing problems. If you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks on every corner.\\" His remarks subsequently met with both sarcasm and criticism, many mocking the statement on social media and sending #TacosOnEveryCorner to the top of Twitter's list of trending topics. Others expressed concern over his remarks, stating that he was using \\"coded language that politicians and pundits use to get away with explicitly racist messages — from crime to immigration and terrorism.\\" Taco trucks were used as voter registration-information booths in Houston Texas, and a nationwide Guac the Vote campaign was launched. National Public Radio (NPR) news wrote that taco trucks \\"now straddle the worlds of political symbol and internet meme\\".  Origin  The phrase originated with Marco Gutierrez, a co-founder of the group Latinos for Trump, during an interview with Joy Reid on MSNBC on September 1, 2016. The phrase was used within the context of a warning about the \\"dominance\\" of Mexican culture, underscoring Gutierrez's stance that immigration should be more closely regulated. In an interview with Deutsche Welle on September 8, 2016, Gutierrez explained, \\"If you don't regulate the immigration, if you don't structure our communities, we are going to do whatever we want. We are going to take over.

While serving as a Royal Navy armed transport she was damaged in a fire, with loss of life, in Baltimore, Maryland, in October 1917. Investigating officials, after the fire, were convinced the vessel was the target of arson, and that the arsonists were German agents—an enemy of the United Kingdom and the United States, during World War I. Several suspects were arrested. However, it was later determined that the fire on Pier 9, that triggered the fire on board Kerry Range, was due to an electrical malfunction that triggered oakum, a flammable product once used to pack seams on ships. Three crew members lost their lives. Firefighting officials towed the blazing vessel away from the pier, to help prevent it igniting nearby Pier 8, and scuttled her. It took over a day to completely put out the fires on the hulk. Some press reports at the time wrote she was a complete write-off.

History  In 2014, ESPN announced the creation of a new website \\"that will provide in-depth coverage, commentary and insight on sports, race and culture directed towards the African-American audience\\". Editor-in-chief Jason Whitlock described the then-unnamed site as a “Black Grantland,” a reference to the now-defunct ESPN sports website overseen by popular sports columnist Bill Simmons. Whitlock said the name \\"The Undefeated\\" was inspired by a passage from American poet Maya Angelou: “You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.” While the site was still in development, a Deadspin report alleged that Whitlock was “poisoning” The Undefeated with an unconventional management style that made it difficult for the site to attract and retain prime talent, with several anonymous sources documenting an extremely negative work environment. On June 12, 2015, the New York Times reported that Whitlock had been removed from his post. Whitlock attributed his dismissal to “numerous reasons, including my foolish belief that I could manage like a football coach.

As a Jefferson Science Fellow Davies monitored developments in agriculture and food security, monitored the status of biotech crops in Europe, and provided input to promote the acceptance of these crops on a scientific basis. Personal life Peter J. Davies was born in Harrow in London U.K. in 1940, the son of William B. Davies, an Anglican vicar in Edmonton and Enfield U.K., and Ivy D Davies. Peter Davies married Linda DeNoyer. They have two children: Kenneth Davies and Caryn Davies. University life Davies earned a B.Sc. in Agricultural Botany (1962) and a Ph.D. in Agricultural Botany with an emphasis on herbicide physiology in 1966 from the University of Reading in England, and an M.S. in Plant Physiology from the University of California at Davis in 1964. He did a post doc with Arthur Galston and an instructor in the Biology Department at Yale University. At Cornell University, Davies became an Assistant Professor in 1969, an Associate Professor in 1975, a Full Professor in 1983 and retired in 2016. A Mini-Symposium Celebrated Davies' 46 years in Plant Sciences at Cornell. Research Davies research has been on the role of plant hormones in whole plant physiology, including stem growth, whole-plant senescence, tomato ripening and potato tuberization. In 1866, Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, demonstrated that height in peas was controlled by a single factor. More than a century later, Davies discovered that Mendel's stem length gene (Le) in peas encoded a gibberellin 3β-hydroxylase. This enzyme converts GA20, an inactive form of gibberellin to GA1, the form of gibberellin that stimulates stem growth in peas. The conversion of gibberellins results in the tall phenotype that Mendel observed. The mutant (le) that was observed by Mendel is shorter because it is unable to convert sufficient GA20 to GA1. Awards and honors Davies was the Potato Grower Researcher of the Year for 2008.

Educated to teach mathematics, she taught in various schools in Gorzów Wielkopolski from 1953 to 1984 and was honored for her skill as an educator. She helped found the Gorzów Wielkopolski branch of the Catholic Intellectuals Club as well as the regional branch of Solidarity. Her activism during Poland's struggle for democracy was widely recognized at both the local and national level and she was honored with numerous medals and awards. Early life Teresa Maria Tomaszewska-Bończa was born on 11 October 1929 in Hrubieszów, Poland to the noble families of Stanisław Bończa-Tomaszewski and Marii Skrzetuskiej. After her parent's divorce, Tomaszewska-Bończa was raised by her maternal grandparents Kazimierza Skrzetuskiego and Maria (née Dobrowolska) Skrzetuska. She was the great-granddaughter of Antoni Skrzetuski, who was honored for his military service in the January Uprising. The family moved often during the war, living in Wrzesnia, Zwierzyniec, Przeworsk and Mogilno, before she entered high school in 1944. In 1949, she graduated from the in Gniezno and went on to further her studies at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (UAM), studying mathematics from 1949 to 1952. Career After graduation, Tomaszewska-Bończa studied briefly at the Polish Naval Academy and then between 1952 and 1953 she taught at a vocational school in Gdynia. In 1953, Tomaszewska-Bończa married , moved to Gorzów Wielkopolski and taught at the Gastronomic Technical College () for two years. In 1957, she began teaching at the Chemical Technical College (), where she remained until 1972. She completed a master's degree UAM in 1966 and in 1976 completed her post- graduate studies in computer science at the University of Warsaw. Between 1972 and 1984 she taught mathematics at the in Gorzów Wielkopolski. During this time frame, she also worked on an experimental project between 1976 and 1980 launched in high schools by the Science Ministry. Klimek retired from teaching in 1984. In the 1970s, Klimek helped organize the Catholic Intellectuals Club (), which she and her husband Władysław had founded. KIK's purpose was to stimulate independent thought and bring Catholics within Poland information about Catholic philosophy from countries outside the Socialist Bloc. Though it had to operate illegally and could not be registered until 1981, the group challenged authorities and openly promoted the organization. Beginning in 1980, Klimek was also engaged in the business of the Polish Trade Union, \\"Solidarity\\" (). Solidarity's goals were to bring about socio-economic reforms by changing the political system. Klimek promoted the organization in schools, encouraging students to found an independent student organization. She served on the regional board and was a delegate to the provincial congress as a Solidarity delegate. From 1980 to 1981 Klimek served on an assistance committee for prisoners of conscience and provided care for members who were imprisoned. She was interned between 15 December 1981 and 27 June 1982 in camps in Poznan and Gołdap, during the implementation of martial law in Poland. Martial law was imposed to frighten people and make them think that Polish Communism was strong and could not be overthrown. After her release, Klimek worked in the Catholic Underground in support of Solidarity. Crucial to the underground's success was the underground press and in Gorzów Wielkopolski, Klimek's husband Władysław edited several journals and wrote articles for Solidarity. Under the pseudonym \\"Simeon and Agnik\\", in 1983 Klimek wrote the activist's song \\"Feniksa\\" (Phoenix). In 1986, Klimek was involved in the reactivation of Solidarity and became a member of the Regional Executive Committee for the union. Klimek initiated the Gorzów Committee for the Memory of the Victims of Katyn and was made an honorary member of Gorzów's Katyn Families. Death and legacy Klimek died on 29 December 2013 in Gorzów Wielkopolski. Both during her lifetime, and posthumously, Klimek was decorated for her activism and excellence as an educator.

She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.  Life  Cabrera was born in San Juan, Argentina in 1970. She moved to Rosario in 1994, leaving two children with her mother. People who met her remember her eyes, dark enough to seem black, a wealth of black hair, and her direct gaze, sometimes interpreted as inquisitive, sometimes as defiant. At the time of her murder, she had been planning to travel to another city with a friend to attend a rock festival. Her first contact with AMMAR (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001. During Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed, working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night. Cabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called \\"Maca\\". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza. Cabrera's work to stop the spread of AIDS and other STDs began in October, 2001. Lacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as \\"the Sanjua gang\\", after Cabrera's place of origin. Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as \\"explosive\\". Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did, but she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness: Organizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way. And in Rosario, she found that recognition. She was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in Rosario where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them. After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems. She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message. Perhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the Rosario chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over. Other street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.  Lead up to murder  During Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting. The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption. By way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of Rosario was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution. As part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution. Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code. Another complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried. For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual. From 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague. On March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with \\"a humiliating treatment\\". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want \\"male or female prostitutes\\" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again. As leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements. On September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended, but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything. Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station. Following the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate. On October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said \\"Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow.\\" The girl was Cabrera's eight-year-old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home. A few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that \\"Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school.\\" A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school. On October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found. At some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her. At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them. The last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her. During her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.  Murder  = Evidence = Testimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home. She was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck. The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired. Her body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal, one block from the stop where she worked. There were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found. The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm, but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug. (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers (Bersa Thunder 9), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.) Her pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body. The police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities. Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive. Analysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly. The forensic report concluded: = Reaction = Her murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the Santa Fe governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to Rosario to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi- disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker. The investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police. At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers, i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers. Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years. Everyone else assumed it was the police. The police in Argentina have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in Mar del Plata had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers, killed because they wanted to leave their pimps, who were paying the police. The Santa Fe police killed the social activist Claudio Lepratti during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted \\"We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police.\\" Among political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in Santa Fe to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in Santa Fe had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game. Carlos del Frade relates that during Obeid's first administration as governor of Santa Fe, he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province. The previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high-ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption. To show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of Rosario. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of Claudio Lepratti and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen-year-old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the CTA (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extrajudicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The CTA and the Rosario association of prosecutors demanded his removal. After several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder. In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders. On appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder. The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as \\"\\"people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary\\". One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who \\"have an activity that can not be described as good morals,\\" according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade. He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated. Among the members of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. \\"If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs,\\" they told each other, and \\"She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues.\\" But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, \\"Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra.\\" A lawyer who worked for CTA, the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left Santa Fe province out of fear. Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers. As for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the Rosario branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.  Legacy  = Influence =  Public Morality police unit  If the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration: But he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.  Misdemeanor Code  On the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church. As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility: As the new secretary general of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles. For AMMAR Rosario, the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights. Finally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR Rosario, a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against. While she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.  Rosario  Walter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of Rosario. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of Santa Fe. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that \\"There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police.\\" AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same. Around the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers. Shortly thereafter, sex work in Rosario went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime. Some of the women who had worked in the cabarets and whiskerías that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels. The motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized casitas, where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that \\"It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place.\\" For the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces. Orellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in Rosario, passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in Rosario, and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors. The legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as \\"scandalous\\" and an \\"offense to modesty\\" now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death: = Recognition = Nine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in Rosario, Buenos Aires, and Salta province, demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the Rosario march was described as \\"multitudinous\\" and included a cross section of Rosario civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups. Another march in Rosario a month later was described in the same terms and included the same civic groups. These marches have been repeated over the years on the anniversary of her murder, up to the present. In 2012 the director Lucrecia Mastrangelo released a film titled, Sex, dignity and death: Sandra Cabrera, unpunished crime.AMMAR remembered Sandra Cabrera, 6 June 2012, redtrasex.org, Retrieved 2 September 2016 In 2017, a small public square in the area around the bus terminal where she had worked was named in her honor.

She was for four years the editor and proprietor of The Woman's Signal, an early and influential feminist journal. Biography Florence Fenwick Miller was the eldest daughter of John Miller, a merchant sea-captain, and of Eleanor Miller née Estabrook, daughter of a railway engineer. Privately educated as a child, she read for a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh from 1871, in the year following the Edinburgh Seven, the first females to be admitted to the course. Like the Seven, she was unable to pursue clinical practise and Edinburgh declined to award a degree to her. Edinburgh University had decided against awarding medical degrees to women. In 1873 she took a midwifery certificate at the Ladies' Medical College in London. Despite her training, Miller quickly moved away from medical practice towards wider spheres. She quickly established herself as a lecturer on literary and social reform topics, debating in London at the Sunday Lecture Society, appearing before the London Dialectical Society (which was engaged in investigating the phenomenon of Spiritualism; James Edmunds, the founder of the Ladies' Medical College was a committee member); and giving talks throughout the country. She was an early and vocal advocate of women's suffrage and, later, in 1889, was one of the founders, with Emmeline Pankhurst, of the Women's Franchise League. Miller also wrote, as journalist and author of fiction and non-fiction. In the former capacity she contributed very widely, including to Fraser's Magazine, Lett's Illustrated Household Magazine, Belgravia, and The Governess, the Lady's Pictorial, The Woman's World, the Young Woman, and The Echo. She was for 32 years, from 1886, the 'Ladies'Notes' columnist for the Illustrated London News. Progressing in her career, she was from 1892 editor of two magazines for colonists, Outward Bound and Homeward Bound. In 1895 she assumed control of and edited The Woman's Signal, until 1899 a leading feminist publication. She later wrote for the Daily News. Her output as an author was wide: making use of her medical training, she published from 1878 onwards several books on anatomy, including contributing two books to the Hughes's Natural History Readers series. In 1879 she published a three volume fiction, Lynton Abbott's Children; in 1883 a book on Social Economy, and in 1884 a biography of the writer Harriet Martineau. After she took over ‘Women’s Signal’ as editor, Florence Fenewick Miller changed the publications tagline to “A Weekly Record and Review devoted to the Interests of Women in the Home and in the Wider World.” This therefore allowed Miller to publish information about fashion, motherhood and the home whilst not sacrificing her passion of educating and informing women about the ”progress in the cause of the equal rights and the general advancement of women”. Jane Martin. (2000). To ‘Blaise the Trail for Women to Follow Along’: sex, gender and the politics of education on the London School Board, 1870–1904. Gender and Education. 12 (2), 165-181. Miller also engaged herself more directly in social reform. She was elected as a Liberal to the Hackney division of the London School Board in 1876 at the comparatively young age of 22, and held office from 1877–1885. Frederick Rogers, a fellow board member, describes her: Like her predecessor Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Fenewick Miller served whilst getting married and went further to also go through pregnancy and child birth as an elected member.Emma Liggins. (2014). Not an Ordinary “Ladies’ Paper”: Work, Motherhood, and Temperance Rhetoric in the Woman’s Signal. Victorian Periodicals Review. 47 (4), 613-630) She spoke widely on women's suffrage, later in her career acting as an international delegate, notably visiting Chicago in 1893 for the World's Columbian Exposition and the World's Congress of Representative Women; and again in 1902 as part of the International Council of Women. Her international links brought her into association with leading American suffragists. She resigned from the International Women's Suffrage Committee in 1904. Florence Fenewick Miller dedicated much of her life to the Women’s suffrage Movement. In 1883 she headed a meeting on what was later known as the “New Reform Bill”. This allowed women to the Parliamentary franchise of the same terms as men. Fenewick Miller gave five lectures all titled, ‘Women’s Work in the World” given in July and August 1883. In the Autumn of that same year she gave further talks, namely “Women and The New Reform Bill’ Miller made an unsuccessful marriage with Frederick Alfred Ford; they had two daughters, but separated. L. A. Flammang, in a review of a biography of Miller, notes that Ford contributed little to the family and suggests that, in part, the volume of Miller's output was related to her straitened economic circumstances. Miller continued to use her own name after the marriage (Frederick Rogers noting that she changed it from Miss Fenwick Miller to Mrs. Fenwick Miller), leading to litigation seeking to remove her from her London School Board office for sitting under an illegal name: Miller prevailed, and the case established the precedent that women need not take the surname of their husband. Litigation happened with respect to the school boards. Helen Taylor, Elizabeth Surr and Miller brought to public notice in 1882 certain scandals at St. Paul's Industrial School. The home secretary instituted an inquiry, and the school was ordered to be closed. In June 1882, Thomas Scrutton, a member of the school board and chairman of its industrial schools sub-committee, brought an action for libel against Taylor. Miller died on 24 April 1935 in Hove, Sussex. A biography, Florence Fenwick Miller: Victorian Feminist, Journalist and Educator written by Rosemary T. Van Arsdel, was published by Ashgate Publishing in 2001.

China exported $274 billion in textiles in 2013, a volume that was nearly seven times that of Bangladesh, the second largest exporter with $40 billion in exports. This accounted for 43.1% of global clothing exports.Carlos Braso Broggi. Trade and Technology Networks in the Chinese Textile Industry: Opening Up Before the Reform. Mar. 2016. Palgrave Macmillan. Print. The industry began to grow at the turn of the 20th century, until the production of cotton yarn made up about 20% of China's total modern industrial output in that century.Toru Kubo. “Chinese Cotton Industry in the 20th Century.” Stimulated by WWI, the industry expanded rapidly until the depression in the thirties. The industry continued to grow though more slowly until Second Sino-Japanese War, when the war destroyed many mills and their supply chains. They did not fully recover until the 1950s, at which point many of the major tycoons had moved their empires to Hong Kong to avoid persecution, while the rest of the industry was monopolized by the government. After Deng Xiaoping ascended to power, he identified these Hong Kong companies as models of technologically advanced capitalist companies and they were able to reconnect with those that had stayed in mainland China.  Global competitiveness  In the early stages of the Chinese economy following economic reforms begun in 1978–79, the low cost of labor was an important component of advantage in gaining export market share over other exporting countries. Wages for blue collar workers have risen rapidly since that period, leading to predictions that textile products from China would no longer be competitive due to loss of low wage advantage. However, other advantages held by China over developing countries including \\"more efficient supply chain management, more modern infrastructure, and workers’ higher productivity\\", have allowed Chinese textile producers to keep costs low relative to other producers. American trade statistics show from 2006 to 2014, the average unit price of imports from China slightly increased 0.7% from $1.45/square-meter- equivalent (SME) to $1.46/SME compared to imports from other countries, which increased by 7.9% from $1.97/SME to $2.13/SME. The industry is undergoing a process of ongoing consolidation in the industry with a future outlook of a handful of manufacturing behemoths. Industry data from the first half of 2013 showed that production from manufacturers with revenue of at least approximately 10 million RMB grew by 13.3%. However, according to an article in Forbes in 2013, the industry is still highly fragmented with approximately 10,000 yarn and fabric makers. Factories are also moving from rich coastal provinces to the poorer interior in search of lower wage labor. The Esquel Group, the largest cotton shirt maker in the world, had plans in 2015 for a 2 billion yuan ($325 million) factory in Guilin, Guangxi. A future development expected to boost domestic industry competitiveness is the end of trade protection for domestic cotton growers. The distortions created by the protected market for domestic cotton had made the going rate for cotton in China 45% more expensive than in Vietnam, a key competitor country. = The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Chinese Textile Industry = The Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes 12 countries that make up 40% of the world's economies and is expected to affect the Chinese economy, including their textile and apparel market. With the United States joining and taking lead in the TPP in 2008 (withdrawn 23 January 2017 ), terms and conditions were created to get an advantage on China, a non-member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The trade deficit the US faces with China is significant; in 2015, the United States sold $116.2 billion in exported goods from China while importing $481.9 billion in goods from China. Under the TPP, China would have to pay a GATT tariff that members of the TPP would be excluded from, thus restricting China's ability to trade in the NAFTA region. Imports of textiles in the CBI, CAFTA, and the NAFTA region are currently subject to high import tariffs up to 10.1% for textiles and 26.8% for apparel. If the TPP were to be implemented, these tariffs would be reduced to zero for textiles and apparel products traded among member countries. Furthermore, with China being the top exporter of textiles and apparel in the world, the implementation is expected to result in a significant decline in China’s apparel exports to the United States, Japan, and the NAFTA region, mainly Canada. The TPP would create a trade diversion effect that will deter these imports from China, due to high tariffs China will be subjected to, and encourage TPP members to trade and directly challenge China’s exports. Japan’s accession to the TPP is expected to have a substantial negative impact on China’s textile and apparel exports. In a study conducted by Sheng Lu of the University of Rhode Island, he found that the demand from textiles from Vietnam and other Asian TPP members might create additional export opportunities for China, however with the TPP, the trade diversion effect caused by Japan is expected to affect China’s exports to those regions. = Largest companies = Among the largest state-owned enterprises (SOE) are Shandong Demian Group and central SOE Sinomach, which entered textiles in 2017 after acquiring China Hi-Tech Group Corporation, another central SOE. The largest private companies are the Esquel Group and Luthai. = Foreign Direct Investment in Textiles = Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an investment made by a company or individual based in one country in business interests in another country. FDI includes establishing business operations or acquiring assets in that second country. In 2005 the Chinese textile and garment industry received a total of $2.9 billion in FDI most of which came from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors. Private firms in China seek foreign ownership, or FDI to mitigate challenges caused by the Chinese financial system. These challenges are in the form of capital allocations from the Chinese financial system that privilege the less efficient state owned firms at the expense of more efficient private firms. These financial constraints faced by private firms in China are driving up labor-intensive FDI. Labor-intensive FDI includes markets with a work force behind it, such as the Chinese textile market. In order to secure FDI, private firms offer investors a stake in the company itself. Some estimates found that firms in the top 25 percentile of the financial constraint measure could have avoided losing 38.4% of their equity share to foreigners because they needed to obtain FDI. However, in a study that investigated the impact of FDI presence on the domestic and export sales of textile firms, researchers suggested that the presence of FDI generates positive and significant spillover effects on the domestic as well as export market sales of local firms in textile and manufacturing industries. Showing that government policies that restrict FDI and fail to improve the financial system can be counterproductive, but that policy-makers should encourage domestic and foreign-invested firms to increase the benefits of inward FDI. This suggests that FDI is important in alleviating the financial constraints of private firms.  History  = Establishment = Two Chinese women making textiles, 19th century. In the late 1800s, foreign imports from British India of cotton yarn had created a large market for weavers in the countryside of Northern China. Foreign interests noticed several key benefits of operating in China, including the vast market, availability of cheap labor and raw materials, longer work hours, and lower transport costs. The first foreign enterprises were established immediately after the Sino-Japanese War of 1904-05, within a few years of the first Chinese factories. Due to the treaty ending the war, foreign entities were able to operate exempt from tariff duties and with fewer political restrictions than native companies. The British came first, but the Japanese arrived soon after.Shepherd, Jack. “Salvaging the Textile Industry in China.” Far Eastern Survey 8.15 (1939): 171–175. JSTOR. Web. = Rapid Expansion = Since imports of Western manufactured goods stopped during World War I, the cotton industry in both China and Japan developed rapidly to fill the need in Asia. Initially, all of the machines and accessories were imported from Britain or America. This foreshadowed an industry trend of importing technology and exporting finished goods that describes most of the 20th century. However, in the 1920s, Japan became the main supplier of machines, and some began to be built in China as well, establishing the textile-machine- tools industry which would eventually grow enough in volume to supply neighboring countries as well. = Competition with Japanese Companies = While the total capacity of the Chinese mills into the 1930s was greater than that of the Japanese, a third of the cotton yarn and half of the cotton goods produced in China were made by Japanese owned mills. Japanese mills had the advantage of better technology and more capital, while Chinese mills were limited due to management inefficiency, lack of organization, and financial weakness. In particular, the Japanese mills were able to survive the depression in the 1930s because they had stronger and more stable financial backing. Furthermore, in Shandong, which is still industrially important today, the Japanese had the advantage of the significant transportation and utilities infrastructure developed by the Germans when they used the city as a port for trade. When the Japanese arrived in 1914, they were able to use these resources and the local people's knowledge of machinery to very quickly establish seven modern spinning mills. Thanks to the electric power set up by the Germans, they were also able to implement electric powered weaving machines throughout the 1930s to significantly increase the production efficiency of mills. In 1934, the National Economic Council of China established the Cotton Industry Commission, meant to improve the quality of Chinese raw cotton and to improve spinning, weaving, and dyeing techniques. However, due to the lack of capital and high outstanding debt of the Chinese mills, production costs were still high. In 1936, Chinese mills began to crop up inland instead of on the coast in an attempt to have more competitive costs and prices. The inland mills allowed them to sit closer to raw materials and the rural weaving markets. However, war suddenly broke out and devastated both the Chinese and Japanese textile industries. = Sino-Japanese War = In July 1937, there were some 2.75 million spindles and 25,500 looms under Chinese ownership. There were 2.38 million spindles and 33,800 looms under Japanese control. Plans had been underway by both camps to expand dramatically, but most were stopped by the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the British controlled some 220,000 spindles and 4,000 looms. When the fighting started, the Chinese Government commissioned a group to help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, the fighting started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and marketing difficulties due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills for a few months in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned. Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of \\"cooperative management\\" to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.  The Rong Family's Shenxin Mills  The Rong brothers, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, became the so-called \\"cotton and flour kings\\" due to their empire of the ten Shenxin textile mills and sixteen Maoxin and Fuxin flour mills. By the mid-1930s, the Rongs held almost 20% of spindles in Chinese owned textile mills.Parks M. Coble. “The Historical Roots of Shanghai’s Modern Miracle.” Asian Studies Lecture Series. Weber State University. 2013. However, in August 1937, they lost five of their seven Shanghai mills. Two were bombed and taken over by military forces, while the other three fell under Japanese control. The last two surviving mills were in the International Settlement, which was relatively protected from Japanese attacks as a zone of neutrality. While mills were encouraged to move inland and many did, the ones that stayed in Shanghai like the last two Shenxin mills registered as foreign entities for protection. They \\"leased\\" their mills to foreign owners and hired fake foreign managers so that they could fly a foreign flag. In fact, since the two mills were actually over capacity before the conflict, they operated more efficiently during this period, and one actually expanded and increased output. Even though the industry had taken a big hit, any mills that were not destroyed enjoyed decent profits due to high demand and low supply. This incentivized industrialists who were still in the area to rebuild mills, and they were able to bring the area back up to 40% of prewar production. When the Pacific War erupted, the International Settlement came under heavy fire, and British or American registration made factories a target. The Japanese took over the Rongs' remaining two mills on the grounds that they were enemy property. However, since the Chinese were no longer Japan's biggest enemy, the military was ready to restore Chinese mills in Shanghai to industrialists willing to work with the occupation. The Japanese opposed returning the mills that they had restored and maintained, especially without a payment in return for all of the rebuilding they had to do. However, the Chinese manufacturers argued that they could more easily operate in the Chinese market and gain access to cotton produced in rural areas. One industrialist also appealed to a Japanese government connection of his who was a strong advocate for Pan-Asianism, and returning the mills to establish good relations was seen as a symbol of the Pan-Asian movement. In return, the industrialists were required to show public support for the Japanese, and many plant managers joined the control organizations of the puppet government. However, Japan still controlled a significant amount of the raw cotton in China, so most of the cotton was either shipped to Japan or given to Japanese mills in China. Due to this lack of cotton, several of the Shenxin mills stopped production while others operated at a fraction of their capacity. The Rongs had to turn to the black market to continue profitable operation. They rented out their equipment to smaller rural workshops that could more easily evade control and tax. Ultimately, this willingness to work with and around the political powers of the time allowed the Rongs to survive, as well as the other prominent mill families of the time. = Recovering from War = China's textile industry only became dominated by the Chinese after the defeat of Japan in 1945, which gave China ownership of many well-equipped and efficient manufacturing units. However, Chinese management was limited in technical and managerial skill. Furthermore, because of the deterioration with lack of maintenance of many plants during the war, efficiency in 1947 varied between 65-80% of prewar standards. Combined with the loss of spindles due to the destruction of the war, output was only 40% of 1937 output. After Japan's retreat, the Chinese government took over 40 mills and incorporated them into the Chinese Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), arguing that government management would get the mills running again most quickly. The government wanted the mills to clothe the army and to produce enough profit to reduce the government budget deficit. It also wanted to organize the mills to take over markets formerly supplied by Japan and to alleviate the clothing shortage in China and thus take over the domestic textile market. Ultimately this resulted in the government controlling 50% of China's textile industry. However, one of the actual reasons these mills were more efficient was because the Japanese had maintained the equipment in their mills well during the war. Yet even with easier access to capital, the government made no moves to expand its mills, indicating a lack of desire to invest but rather a desire to reap profits. Private mills continued to try to grow, but major obstacles included high production costs due to inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange with which to buy raw cotton, machinery, and supplies. The war had wreaked havoc on the land, and the textile machine tool industry which had been prospering was largely lost. Finally, as the Chinese Communist Party rose to power, many mill owners packed their bags and moved their operations to Hong Kong to survive, allowing the next stage of development to take place in Hong Kong.

Fitchburg, MA: Raivaaja Publishing Co., 1949; pg. 8. After leaving the Hämeenlinna Lyceum, Alanne relocated to Helsinki to attend the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute, from which he graduated in 1902. He remained in the field of organic chemistry for two more years, working as an assistant to professor Gusst Komppa while continuing his post-graduate studies. Upon completion of his graduate studies in 1903, Alanne taught as a professor of electro-chemistry at the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute and as an instructor of chemistry and later department head at a vocational school in Helsinki, remaining there until 1905. An opponent of Tsarist autocracy in the Russian empire, of which Finland was a part, Alanne joined the Social Democratic Party of Finland (Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue, SSP) in 1905. He was forced to emigrate from the country following the defeat of the Revolution of 1905. =Career= In the United States, Alanne worked for two years as the manager of a coal mine in Hanna, Wyoming, and for two additional years as a research chemist for the Viscol Company of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He later took a position as an editor of the Finnish-language socialist daily newspaper Työmies (The Worker), located in Hancock, Michigan. In 1919, Alanne published a major book through the Työmies Publishing House, a large and comprehensive Finnish-English translating dictionary.Suomalais- englantilainen sanakirja – Finnish-English Dictionary. Editor. Superior, WI: Työmies, 1919. Alanne's work was so well-regarded that the dictionary would survive to see publication a posthumous second edition, published in Finland in 1968.Suomalais-englantilainen suursanakirja (Finnish-English General Dictionary). Porvoo: Werner Söderström, 1968. Alanne would find his lasting professional contribution in the field of consumer cooperation, becoming director of the growing Co-operative Central Exchange (CCE) of Superior, Wisconsin in 1920 — a position which he would hold until 1925. At that time, Alanne would move on to fulfill a similar function for the umbrella organization of which the CCE was part, the Northern States Cooperative League, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Alanne would remain at that post until 1936, after which time he would return to Superior to work in the educational department of the Central Co-operative Wholesale, the name by which the CCE was then known. His employment there would finally end in 1943 with his retirement at the age of 64. =Political career= Alanne made one run for public office, serving as the candidate of the Workers (Communist) Party for Governor of Wisconsin in 1924.Lawrence Barish (editor in chief), et al., \\"Vote for Governor in General Election, 1848-1990,\\" Wisconsin Blue Book, 1991-1992. Madison, WI: Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, 1991; pg. 720. Alanne received just under 4200 votes in the race, finishing a distant fifth out of seven candidates. =Death and legacy= Severi Alanne died May 26, 1960, in Helsinki. He was 80 years old at the time of his death.

Zstd is the reference implementation in C. Version 1 of this implementation was released as free software on . Features Zstandard was designed to give a compression ratio comparable to that of the DEFLATE algorithm (developed in 1991 and used in the original ZIP and gzip programs), but faster, especially for decompression. It is tunable with compression levels ranging from negative 5 (fastest)https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.4 Faster compression levels to 22 (slowest in compression speed, but best compression ratio). The zstd package includes parallel (multi-threaded) implementations of both compression and decompression. Starting from version 1.3.2 (October 2017), zstd optionally implements very long range search and deduplication (, 128 MiB window) similar to rzip or lrzip. Compression speed can vary by a factor of 20 or more between the fastest and slowest levels, while decompression is uniformly fast, varying by less than 20% between the fastest and slowest levels. Zstandard command-line has an \\"adaptive\\" () mode that varies compression level depending on I/O conditions, mainly how fast it can write the output. Zstd at its maximum compression level gives a compression ratio close to lzma, lzham, and ppmx, and performs better than lza, or bzip2. Zstandard reaches the current Pareto frontier, as it decompresses faster than any other currently-available algorithm with similar or better compression ratio. Dictionaries can have a large impact on the compression ratio of small files, so Zstandard can use a user-provided compression dictionary. It also offers a training mode, able to generate a dictionary from a set of samples. In particular, one dictionary can be loaded to process large sets of files with redundancy between files, but not necessarily within each file, e.g., log files. Design Zstandard combines a dictionary-matching stage (LZ77) with a large search window and a fast entropy coding stage, using both Finite State Entropy (a fast tabled version of ANS, tANS, used for entries in the Sequences section), and Huffman coding (used for entries in the Literals section). Because of the way that FSE carries over state between symbols, decompression involves processing symbols within the Sequences section of each block in reverse order (from last to first). Usage The Linux kernel has included Zstandard since November 2017 (version 4.14) as a compression method for the btrfs and squashfs filesystems. In 2017, Allan Jude integrated Zstandard into the FreeBSD kernelhttps://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/28ef16535cde21eeeaf75f6006b3a77952b3b51 and it was subsequently integrated as a compressor option for core dumps (both user programs and kernel panics). It as also used to create a proof of concept OpenZFS compression method which was integrated in 2020https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/10b3c7f5e424f54b3ba82dbf1600d866e64ec0a0. The AWS Redshift and RocksDB databases include support for field compression using Zstandard. In March 2018, Canonical tested the use of zstd as a deb package compression method by default for the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Compared with xz compression of deb packages, zstd at level 19 decompresses significantly faster, but at the cost of 6% larger package files. Debian developer Ian Jackson favored waiting several years before official adoption. RFC: Support for zstd in .deb packages?, Ian Jackson, 2018-04-27. In 2018 the algorithm was published as RFC 8478, which also defines an associated media type \\"application/zstd\\", filename extension \\"zst\\", and HTTP content encoding \\"zstd\\". Arch Linux added support for zstd as a package compression method in October 2019 with the release of the pacman 5.2 package manager,https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px;=Arch-Linux- Pacman-Zstd-Near and in January 2020 switched from xz to zstd for the packages in the official repository. Arch uses \`zstd -c -T0 --ultra -20 -\`, the size of all compressed packages combined increased by 0.8% (compared to xz), the decompression speed is 1300% faster, decompression memory increased by 50 MiB when using multiple threads, compression memory increases but scales with the number of threads used.

(formerly Vector Space Systems), was an American space technology company which aimed to launch small satellites into orbit with its eponymous family of small launch vehicles. Unable to obtain funding to continue and finish its fourth year, it declared bankruptcy in December 2019.  History  The company's first CEO was Jim Cantrell, who co-founded the company with John Garvey, Shaun Coleman, Ken Sunshine, and Eric Besnard. Cantrell had previously claimed to have helped Elon Musk found SpaceX in 2002, but left shortly afterward, viewing it as unlikely to turn a profit. Vector Launch, Inc. received in seed angel funding from entrepreneur Shaun Coleman soon after its foundation in 2016 and additionally million from Sequoia Capital, Shasta Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners in June 2017. It had offices in Tucson, Arizona, and an engineering facility in Huntington Beach, California. In July 2016, Vector acquired Garvey Spacecraft, and began designing rockets based on Garvey's designs. The company was also investing in software capabilities. It had a platform called Galactic Sky, located in San Jose, California, which was developing software-defined satellites to provide start-ups and entrepreneurs with satellite capabilities. In 2017, Cantrell signed a letter of intent to collaborate with his son's cryptocurrency company, called Nexus, that was attempting to develop a satellite-supported currency exchange system. In 2016 York Space Systems signed a $60 million launch deal with Vector, to launch six satellites into orbit, which was never funded. By August 2016, Vector had tested hardware in suborbital flight with the launch of its P-20 prototype rocket, as well as atmospheric test flights of the Vector-R from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California and Spaceport Camden in Georgia. By 2017, Vector had announced that it planned to use the LC-46 launch site in Florida for its Vector-R rocket starting in 2018, but did not achieve that target date. Additionally Vector was investigating adding more minimal infrastructure launch pads either located on land in the USA using mobile semi-trailers as tank trucks and a transporter erector launcher (TEL), or to launch the rocket from barges on the ocean. By February 2018, the company was planning to launch the first orbital flight of the Vector-R in July 2018 from the Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska. , the first launch of the Vector-H was expected to occur in 2019. On August 7, 2019, the company was awarded its first U.S. Air Force mission, to launch the ASLON-45 spacecraft for $3.4 million. However, the contract was cancelled when the US Air Force determined Vector did not meet minimum requirements for solvency. On August 9, 2019, Cantrell left Vector Launch as the company began widespread layoffs, with John Garvey assuming the role of CEO. The future of the company was left uncertain as it reportedly faced serious financial problems. = Bankruptcy = On December 13, 2019, Vector Launch Inc. and one affiliated company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. It was revealed that the August layoffs had been precipitated by the withdrawal of financial support by Sequoia Capital, one of the company's largest investors, which led other potential investors to back out of an upcoming funding round in a domino effect. Vector has filed a motion with the court for approval to sell its assets pursuant to Section 363 of the US bankruptcy code (a provision that allows for the orderly sale of assets from a bankrupt estate). The stalking horse bidder is Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin acquired Vector's GalacticSky assets by default after a bankruptcy court received no qualified bids.. Another bidder acquired the remaining launch vehicle assets.  Services  = Launchers = The company had planned to provide launch services with two rockets, the smaller Vector-R, and the larger Vector-H. Both rockets use a single engine for their second stage and a cluster of engines (three in the Vector-R and six in the Vector-H) for their first stage, all of which use LOX and propylene as propellants. Vector planned to recover the first stage of its rockets for reuse. Other notable design features include a carbon fiber structure, some 3D printed engine parts, minimal infrastructure launch pads, and a fast launch cadence, which the company had hoped to reach 100 launches per year. The first client of Vector was Iceye, a company in Finland. = GalacticSky = Vector developed a patented software-defined satellite operating system called GalacticSky so that its planned micro-satellites can run different applications. Managed by Vector's initial investor and co-founder Shaun Coleman GalacticSky was intended to allow customers to quickly test software applications for satellites without having to develop their own hardware. Following a lawsuit filed by Vector against Lockheed Martin for violating GalacticSky patents and Vector's bankruptcy, Lockheed Martin expressed interest in acquiring GalacticSky for $2.5 million, assuming no higher bidder appears. Several members of the former GalacticSky team including the primary author of many of its patents and a Vector co-founder, chief sales/marketing officer and SVP/general manager of GalacticSky, Shaun Coleman, former GalacticSky VP of engineering John Metzger, former Vector chief revenue officer, and Lockheed VP of Advanced programs Robert Cleave have since founded NewSpace Networks,NewSpace Networks a company focused on extending the cloud and making satellite networks more efficient. NewSpace Networks intends to bid for the GalacticSky assets against Lockheed Martin.

The film stars Nikole Howell, Lindsay Lamb, Andrew Phillips, Courtney Rood, Danika Galindo, Yasmine Soofi, and Savannah Matlow. After School Massacre follows the story of a high school teacher who goes on a killing spree after being fired, stalking his former female students at their slumber party for revenge against all those who wronged him. Plot Two high school students, Devon (Nikole Howell) and Jess Perkins (Savannah Matlow), have a crush on their teacher Ty Anderson (Bruce Kade), and they convince him to accept their friend requests on Facebook. Later, they report Anderson to Principal Wheatley (Art Roberts), saying that he made sexual comments to them on Facebook. Wheatley promptly fires Anderson, who snaps and kills Wheatley and his secretary Linda (Mindy Robinson) in furious response; he then overhears the girls discussing how they are going to a slumber party, so he decides to go there to take revenge on them for setting him up. Devon meets Jess and her sister Dee Dee (Simone Wasserman) at the party, along with their other friends Erin (Courtney Rood), Alex (Yasmine Soofi), Steph (Danika Galindo), and Laura (Lindsay Lamb). Nerds Max (Lonnie Alcide Gardner) and Joel (Nick Sinise) also arrive to spy on the girls. Dee Dee has an argument with her boyfriend, Luke Dalton (Andrew Phillips), and goes to buy more beer. She is ambushed by Anderson, who impales her with a mailbox before killing another girl named Shelly (Kristyn Archibald). The girls discover Max and Joel and chase them away from the house before engaging in various party games. Anderson strangles a pizza delivery boy (Paul Tirado) when he arrives and hides his body in a trash barrel. When Max and Joel return, Joel passes out drunk in the garage while Anderson stabs Max in the throat with shears. Luke attempts to cheat on Dee Dee with Alex, but Anderson beats her to death with a radio after Luke leaves to mix drinks. Erin is drowned in a plastic tub while bobbing for apples, and Steph is hanged with a power cable in the garage. Laura discovers Alex's body stuffed up the chimney before Anderson cuts her throat with an electric knife. He then reveals himself as the killer to Jess before knocking her out and killing Devon by shoving a curling iron down her throat. Luke discovers what Anderson has done and attacks him but is stabbed to death with a poker. Anderson leaves his mask in Luke's lifeless hand and flees the scene, framing him. The police arrive and assume Luke was the killer. Jess recovers Luke and they run down the street to escape arrest; they attempt to flag down a passing car in order to follow Anderson, but they get run over in the process until they manage to survive.

During the Peace of Amiens her registration and homeport became Dunkirk. Her (possibly new) French owners sent her to engage in whaling at Delagoa Bay, where the British letter of marque whaler captured her in 1803. She then made one whaling voyage to Isle of Desolation before a French squadron captured her in 1806 during a second whaling voyage. Accounts differ as to whether her captors sank her, or released her and she continued to operate as a merchant vessel until 1814. Career Ganges was launched at Philadelphia, possibly for the Rotch brothers. After the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, a number of French whaling companies transferred their operations to the United States, operating out of New Bedford and Nantucket under American colours and with American masters and crews, frequently Nantucket whalers. During the Peace of Amiens (1802–1803), some French owners returned their vessels to French registration, and resumed whaling from France. Gange was commissioned at Dunkirk circa September 1803 by Louis De Baecque. She departed in late September with Charles Harris (or Harrax), master, for the whaling grounds at Delagoa Bay.French Whaling Voyages: Ganges (FV0363). There she encountered Scorpion, which captured Gange and a second French whaler, , in late 1803.Some reports of the capture refer to Scorpion as a British Royal Navy frigate. She was not. She had been a Navy 22-gun sloop until the Admiralty had sold her in 1802 and her new owners fitted her out as an armed whaler sailing under a letter of marque. Scorpion then escorted both into St Helena. From there they sailed to Britain, where they arrived in April 1804 and were sold. Their new owners then fitted them out for whaling and armed them. Gangess new owners were James Milman (mast maker), and James Herbert (cooper), or Milner & Co. She sailed from Britain on 4 August 1804 with master C.W. Hodan, or Bacon or Main, for the Isle of Desolation. She was reported to have been there on 25 February 1805. Reportedly she engaged in sealing and the hunt for \\"sea elephants\\". She was then reported at St Helena on 16 August 1805. She returned to Britain on 12 September 1805.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – voyages: Ganges. Loss Ganges, Obed Folger, master, and the same owners as on her previous voyage, left on a whaling voyage shortly after returning from her first voyage. While outward bound, she encountered \\"a flotilla from Rochefort\\". The flotilla captured her on 19 December 1805, or 11 March 1806. The French either sank Ganges, or released her, and she continued to operate as a merchant vessel until 1814. Lloyd's Register for 1807 notes that she was captured. If she returned to service, she did not appear in Lloyd's Register for 1808 or 1809. Fortuitously, the Rochefort squadron had captured a West Indiaman named prior to November 1805.

Preparations On 14 August 2016, just after the capture of Manbij during the Manbij offensive, several SDF factions led by 16 commanders formed the al-Bab Military Council, modelled after the Manbij Military Council, in order to capture territory in the al-Bab countryside and eventually the city itself from ISIL. The military council called for US support in the planned offensive. The main forces of the council would attack al-Bab from its eastern side, though elements of the council do also have a presence on the western front. The offensive =Initial SDF advances= Map of the offensive On 30 August 2016, following heavy mortar bombardment and US Air Force airstrikes on ISIL positions in the villages that killed 13 fighters and destroyed five of their vehicles, forcing them to withdraw, the SDF in Afrin, led by the Army of Revolutionaries, entered and captured the villages of Maarat Umm Hawsh, Umm Qura, Herbel, and Tell Qarah. The next day, ISIL launched a counter-attack on Herbel and briefly recaptured it. However, the Revolutionary Army reentered the village and retook it, capturing a stash of weapons and ammunition, and the Syrian independence flag was raised in the town. A US airstrike destroyed a mortar in the area. In the evening of that day ISIL sent two car bombs at the village but they were reportedly destroyed before they could reach their targets. SDF engineering units dismantled and detonated 70 land mines by 2 September. US airstrikes destroyed seven ISIL positions and a weapons cache on the same day. SDF positions in Umm Qura were shelled by ISIL during the night which prompted them to shell back. Minesweeping operations continued as dozens of landmines remain in the village. ISIL launched a second counter-attack on Umm Hosh and Umm Qara on 4 September, after bombarding the villages with heavy weapons. ISIL claimed it had recaptured Umm Qara and killed around 30 SDF fighters and destroyed 2 of their armoured vehicles with anti-tank missiles. On 6 September, the SDF captured the village of Wahshiyah. On 8 September, ISIL evacuated its headquarters in al-Bab and moved it to Khafsa located east of the city with dozens of vehicles carrying militants and weapons, this came a day after Turkish-led rebel forces also expressed their goal of capturing al- Bab. =ISIL counter-offensives and further SDF gains= On 19 September, after shelling the village with rocket artillery and exploding 2 car bombs, ISIL launched another counter-offensive on Umm Hosh from three axis. Intense clashes between the SDF and ISIL continued the next day, and 16 SDF fighters were killed. The front in Umm Hosh eventually calmed, however fighting continued in the outskirts of the village. On 24 and 25 September, the SDF captured al-Hasia and Hassadjek, with clashes ongoing in Bayt Isa and Tall Saussine south of Tell Qara. After this the SDF reached within 20 km west of al-Bab city. On 28 September, ISIL launched a fourth counteroffensive, launching 2 car bombs at SDF checkpoints around Umm Qura and Umm Hosh and launching mortar shells on the SDF headquarters in the area. SDF forces responded by firing heavy artillery at ISIL positions in the villages of Wahshiya, Hesasik and Tel Maled. According to the SDF at least 16 ISIL militants were killed and six SDF fighters were killed in the attacks. Clashes also erupted between SDF fighters and ISIL militants near the town of Herbel where two ISIS vehicles were destroyed and eight militants were killed according to the SDF. Three SDF fighters were killed in these clashes. US warplanes assisted the SDF by conducting at least three airstrikes on ISIL fighting positions which forced the ISIL militants to withdraw. The SDF spokesman Ahmed Sultan stated that the clashes stopped around midnight, and due to US airstrikes, the ISIL forces withdrew from their positions. Aftermath - SDF confrontation with Turkey-backed FSA Mid-October, in response to advances by the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army forces against ISIL in the area of Dabiq, the SDF started their own advances.

Siracusa was an Italian football club founded in 1924. In 1995 the first team of the club was withdrawn from the professional leagues. However, the club was still active in a youth academy until circa 2005, as a new company A.S. Siracusa Calcio 1924 S.r.l.. Associazione Amici del Siracusa, a cultural association, currently owns the rights to use the logo and the name of the club.http://www.comune.siracusa.it/images/doc/Sport/New_Doc.pdf Paolo Giuliano, the general manager of Messina, was the president of the association. However, no football club submitted any tender to use the logo for 2014–15 season. History = The origins = The earliest clubs representing the city of Syracuse were brought to the city by English sailors. The earliest of which were named Ortigia 1907; as the name suggests that club was founded in 1907, Esperia and Insuperabile. However, cycling remained the most popular sport by far during this time so these clubs did not reach much prominence. =A.S. Siracusa= This club was founded as Gruppo Sportivo Tommaso Gargallo on 1 April 1924, by two men who were part of the military, the lieutenant of the 75° infantry Genisio Pioletti and his advanced captain Luigi Santuccio. The club were entered into the Italian Serie C league. Successively the team switched its denomination to Associazione Sportiva Siracusa. In 1945–46, Siracusa was admitted to Serie B, where he played for seven consecutive seasons. After a relegation to the amateur leagues, Siracusa returned to Serie C in 1970–71, after two playoffs against Fincantieri, a team from Palermo, both ended in a tie: then, Siracusa won a tie-breaking coin toss and was awarded promotion. In 1979 the club won Coppa Italia Serie C, defeating Biellese in the final.RSSSF That same year, Siracusa promoted to Serie C1, where he played for two seasons. In the 1970s the club also briefly used the name Siracusa Calcio. In 1985 the club went bankrupted, but the sports title was transferred to another company backed by new investors. Siracusa played Serie C2 until 1988, when, under coach Paolo Lombardo, the Sicilian club gained promotion to Serie C1. In 1994–95, despite serious financial troubles, Siracusa almost reached promotion to Serie B under head coach Giuliano Sonzogni, losing on playoffs to Avellino. Successively, the team was not able to go on financially, and Siracusa was consequently expelled from professional league, by the decision of Italian Football Federation's Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Società di Calcio (Co.Vi.So.C.). The last financial filing of A.S. Siracusa S.r.l. (P.IVA 00822900890), dated 1993–94 season, shown the club had a net equity of minus 1,511,222,632 lire. The old club/company, last known as A.S. Siracusa Calcio S.r.l. , was officially declared bankrupted by the Court of Syracuse on 6 February 1996.

Members of the band were experienced gospel singers in ensembles dated to the 1940s, and were one of the oldest groups to record during the era. Among the Du Droppers' most enduring songs are \\"I Wanna Know\\" and \\"I Found Out (What You Do When You Go Round There)\\", which both reached number three on the Billboard R&B; charts in 1953. History The original members of the Du Droppers included Caleb \\"J.C.\\" Ginyard (lead vocals), Willie Ray (tenor, baritone), Harvey Ray (tenor, baritone), and Eddie Hashaw (bass). Group members were on average 40 years old, and much more experienced than many of their contemporaries, as all boasted varying levels of past activity in other vocal groups. Ginyard had the most commercial success and longevity in the music industry, having already scored a Top 10 national hit in 1942 with the song \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition\\" as a member of the Jubalaires. In addition, the Ray brothers performed in the church ensemble Southwest Jubilee Singers, and Hashaw occasionally teamed up with Ginyard. After Ginyard's latest group the Dixieaires disbanded in 1950, he maintained a solo career before he began practicing with the Ray brothers and Hashaw in his basement apartment and officially formed the Du Droppers in 1952. Paul Kapp, who also managed the Delta Rhythm Boys, became the group's manager, while Charlie Newsome was the road manager. Within months of the Du Droppers' conception, Newsome arranged an audition with record producer Bobby Robinson of Red Robin Records. Since the label was known to record mainly teen groups, signing the Du Droppers was a departure for Robinson. In September 1952, the group had their debut single \\"Can't Do Sixty No More\\", Ginyard's response to the Dominoes' song \\"Sixty Minute Man\\", released on Red Robin. Although it failed to chart, \\"Can't Do Sixty No More\\" was well received in Canadian markets, where the group first began touring. Soon after, Hashaw departed the Du Droppers, and was replaced by Bob Kornegay, formerly of Julian Dash's orchestra. Feeling the label did not adequately distribute their records, the group left Red Robin Records to sign with RCA Records. While collaborating with ex-Ink Spots arranger and pianist Raymond Tunia, Ginyard composed \\"I Wanna Know\\", which was paired with \\"Laughing Blues\\" for the Du Droppers' first offering with RCA. In April 1953, despite having to compete with a cover version released around the same time by the Checkers, the Du Droppers' rendition of \\"I Wanna Know\\" peaked at number three on the Billboard R&B; charts, giving RCA its biggest R&B; hit in over a year and reopening its R&B; department. Uncredited, the ensemble also backed saxophonist Big John Greer on the songs \\"Ride Pretty Baby\\" and \\"Don't Worry About Me\\", and Robinson released older tunes from the group's stint with Red Robin after \\"Can't Do Sixty No More\\" began selling well in Los Angeles. In June 1953, RCA distributed the Du Droppers follow-up to \\"I Wanna Know\\", with the number three R&B; chart hit \\"I Found Out (What You Do When You Go Round There)\\". The band embarked on a tour which included dates at the Apollo Theatre, Royal Theater, and Howard Theatre, as well as an extended stay in Hawaii. Following the release of the singles \\"Somebody Work on My Baby's Mind\\" and \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", the Du Droppers were paired with pop singer Sunny Gale on the songs \\"Mama's Gone, Goodbye\\" and \\"The Note in the Bottle\\" in November 1953. When the group was booked at the Orchid Room in Kansas City in early 1954, Ginyard recruited high tenor Prentice Moreland, but the newly acquired fifth member was consistently late to the Du Droppers' gigs. Shortly thereafter, RCA announced the formation of the Groove Records subsidiary label by simultaneously releasing the band's \\"Speed King\\" single in February 1954. Later in March 1954, with the release of \\"Just Whisper\\", Moreland departed the band, and achieved national success by uttering the line \\"great googa mooga, lemme outta here\\" on the Cadets' rendition of \\"Stranded in the Jungle\\". More singles were distributed throughout 1954 and 1955, including a collaborative effort with Joe Van Loan of the Ravens credited to the Dixieaires. To make the transition official, Van Loan joined the Du Droppers; however, contractual obligations and legal disputes with RCA prevented him from being featured on any of the group's subsequent recordings. Under pressure to find another vocalist, the group employed a \\"secret singer\\"—revealed to be Charles Hughes later of Drifters fame—for studio projects. Van Loan, however, unexpectedly left the Du Droppers in the midst of a Canadian tour in mid-1955 to return as a full-time tenor for the Ravens. Ginyard, having witnessed his bandmates in a drunken flurry, joined the Golden Gate Quartet, while his former group attempted to carry on with Robert Bowers until they disbanded in early 1956.

It is one of two hippodromes in Beirut. History The hippodrome was built close to the port and forum of Berytus (modern Beirut). It was one of the largest in the Levant, occupying an area of 3500 m2, and was probably similar in overall design to the Circus Maximus in Rome, comprising starting gates and a circuit of two straight tracks connected by a semicircular end. The circus was mostly used for chariot racing, which was an immensely popular and highly partisan spectator sport throughout the Roman Empire; the track would have been surrounded by seating tiers for spectators. The Berytus hippodrome is mentioned in the anonymous, late 4th century Expositio totius mundi et gentium (\\"A description of the world and its people\\") as one of the five best racing circuits in the Levant, the others being at Antioch, Laodicea, Caesarea and Tyrus. During the 6th and the 7th centuries of the Byzantine Empire, violent factional and political disturbances at circuses (such as the Nike riots in Constantinople) led to their gradual abandonment as places of costly, officially subsidised mass entertainment. The hippodrome at Berytus fell into disuse and disrepair. Later -under Arab rule- its stones were reused for the construction of other buildings while it was subsequently mined, according to archeologist Lee Levine, but its outline remained sufficiently clear in the 20th century for identification as a hippodrome by the archaeologist Robert du Mesnil du Buisson. Its groundworks were partially excavated in 1988. An approximately 90-meter section of wall has been uncovered, alongside the straight, and foundations of seating tiers at the semi-circular end. The hippodrome site is near the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Wadi Abu Jamil, the historic, Jewish quarter of Beirut. Preservation In 2009, the site was officially listed in the general inventory of historic buildings, and the Culture Minister Tamam Salam ruled that it should be preserved in situ and turned into a tourist landmark. According to an article appearing in the French daily, L’Orient le Jour, Gaby Layoun, the Culture Minister at the time, approved in March 2012 plans for a luxury residential complex to be built over the ruins of Beirut’s Roman Hippodrome, bypassing the recommendations of three of his predecessors: Tarek Mitri, Salim Wardé, and Tammam Salam. The Association for the Protection of the Lebanese Heritage (APLH) organized protests as an attempt to reverse the Culture Ministry's decision to allow the building over the hippodrome. Following the litigation brought by APLH, the court suspended on May 31, 2012 the Culture Ministry's decision, N˚ 849, to dismantle the Roman Hippodrome that would have allowed for the construction of a building project on the site. The site was protected until 2015 when construction began again.

It uses a command-line interface to run custom tasks defined in a file (known as a Gruntfile). Grunt was created by Ben Alman and is written in Node.js. It is distributed via npm. As of September 2016, there were more than 5,000 plugins available in the Grunt ecosystem. Companies that use Grunt include Adobe Systems, jQuery, Twitter, Mozilla, Bootstrap, Cloudant, Opera, WordPress, Walmart, and Microsoft.  Overview  Grunt was originally created by Ben Alman in 2012 as an efficient alternative to simplify writing and maintaining a suite of JavaScript build process tasks in one huge file. It was designed as a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. Grunt is primarily used to automate tasks that need to be performed routinely. There are thousands of plugins that can be installed and used directly to perform some commonly used tasks. One of Grunt's most desirable features is that it is highly customizable—i.e., it allows developers to add, extend, and modify custom tasks to fit their personal needs; each task has a set of configuration options that can be set by the user. Moreover, Grunt offers the ability to define custom tasks, which can combine multiple existing tasks into a single task or add entirely new functionality.  Basic concepts  = Command-line interface = Grunt's command-line interface (CLI) can be installed globally through npm. Executing the \`grunt\` command will load and run the version of Grunt locally installed in the current directory. Hence, we can maintain different versions of Grunt in different folders and execute each one as we wish. = Files = To use Grunt in a project, two specific files need to be created in the root directory, namely package.json and a Gruntfile. * package.json - contains the metadata for the project including name, version, description, authors, licenses and its dependencies (Grunt plugins required by the project). All the dependencies are listed either in the \`dependencies\` or the \`devDependencies\` section. * Gruntfile - a valid JavaScript or CoffeeScript file named \\"Gruntfile.js\\" or \\"Gruntfile.coffee\\" that contains code to configure tasks, load existing plugins and/or create custom tasks. = Tasks = Tasks are the modules that perform a specified job. They are defined in the Gruntfile. Developers can load predefined tasks from existing Grunt plugins and/or write custom code to define their own tasks depending on their requirements. Once defined, these tasks can be run from the command line by simply executing \`grunt \`. If the \`\` defined in the Gruntfile is 'default' then simply executing \`grunt\` will suffice.  Example  The following is an example of a Gruntfile written in JavaScript that shows how to load plugins, create custom tasks and configure them: module.exports = function(grunt) { // Task configuration grunt.initConfig({ taskName1: 'Task1 Configuration', taskName2: 'Task2 Configuration' }); // Loads plugins grunt.loadNpmTasks('pluginName1'); grunt.loadNpmTasks('pluginName2'); // Custom tasks grunt.registerTask('customTaskName1', 'Custom task description', function(taskParameter) { // Custom statements }); // Combining multiple tasks to a single task grunt.registerTask('customTaskName2', ['taskName1', 'customTaskName1']); // Default task - runs if task name is not specified grunt.registerTask('default', ['customTaskName2']); }; In the above example, executing the \`grunt\` command will run \`\` which has been defined above as a combination of both \`\` and \`\`.  Plugins  Plugins are reusable code that defines a set of tasks. Each plugin internally contains a tasks directory with JavaScript files that have the same syntax as a Gruntfile. Most of the Grunt plugins are published with the keyword \`gruntplugin\` in npm and prefixed with \`grunt\`. This helps Grunt in showing all the plugins in Grunt's plugin listing. The plugins officially supported by Grunt are prefixed with \`grunt- contrib\` and are also marked with a star symbol in the plugins listing. Some popular plugins include grunt-contrib-watch, grunt-contrib-clean, grunt- contrib-uglify, etc. Developers can even create their own Grunt plugins by using the \`grunt-init\` plugin and publish them to npm using the \`npm publish\` command.  Advantages  The following are some of the advantages of using Grunt: * All task runners have the following properties: consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, repeatability, etc. * Access to many predefined plugins that can be used to work with JavaScript tasks and on static content. * Allows users to customize tasks using predefined plugins. * Prefers the configuration approach to coding. * Allows users to add their own plugins and publish them to npm.  Comparison  = Ant = Ant or Apache Ant is a Java- based build tool. Ant has a little over hundred built-in tasks that are better suited to projects with a Java build structure. Writing custom code in Ant requires users to write a JAR file and reference it from XML. This would add unnecessary complexities to projects that do not require Java themselves. Ant build configurations are listed in XML rather than in JSON format. = Rake = Rake allows developers to define tasks in Ruby. Rake doesn't have the concept of plugins or predefined tasks which means all the required actions must be written and then executed. This makes the developments costly when compared to Grunt which has a large set of reusable plugins. = Gulp = Gulp.js is a JavaScript based task runner tool similar to Grunt since both follow a modular-based architecture and are based on npm. Gulp tasks are defined by code rather than configuration. Gulp is faster than Grunt. Grunt uses temporary files to transfer output from one task to another whereas in Gulp files are piped between the tasks.

The preserve contains thirty-eight of forty-three Native American mounds located on a narrow Paleozoic Plateau at the confluence of the Mississippi and Turkey rivers. They vary in size and shape and are to in height. The conical mounds range from to over in diameter. The linear mounds vary from to in length. There is one effigy mound in the shape of a panther that is long and wide. There are also compound mounds in the preserve. The mounds were constructed during the Woodland period (500 BCE and 900 CE). They were used for burials and ceremonial places, and are now protected by law. The preserve is also home to a variety of trees, prairie grasses and flowers. The mounds were first surveyed in 1885, and Ellison Orr studied them in the 1930s. People from Dubuque, Iowa bought the property in 1934 and gave it to the Iowa Conservation Commission in 1940. Other archaeological surveys were undertaken in 1964 and 1973. It was dedicated as a state preserve in 1968 for its archaeological, geological, and biological qualities. The preserve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1990.

Electric or electro-acoustic bagpipes refers to any set of bagpipes designed to use a pickup to detect the mechanical vibrations of the reed or reeds. As with an electric guitar, the detected electrical signal is then routed to an amplifier, and from there to a loudspeaker. Depending on the volume of the amplified sound, the unamplified acoustic sound of the bagpipe will also be heard to some extent alongside it. The pickup used in bagpipes can be of either a magnetic or an optical type. As with electric guitar, the output of an electric bagpipe is suitable for routing through effects units. In comparison to the more common electronic bagpipes, which are sensor-based electronic devices designed to imitate the experience of playing bagpipes, the electric bagpipes are a rare, experimental instrument. No commercial instruments are currently known to be in production.  History  The Boha - French musician Yan Cozian has had success in creating an electro-acoustic version of the Boha. Eryri bagpipe chanter An instrument titled \\"The Eryri Bagpipes\\", which apparently used a magnetic coil pickup in conjunction with a specially design steel reed, appears to have been constructed by the year 2001, by Welsh piper Paddy Whetman. These pipes featured on Whetman's \\"Goat Industries\\" site from at least 2001-2006, according to logs on the Wayback Machine. The maker also appears to have made a number of recordings featuring them, some of which can still be found on YouTube. In 2016, a video was uploaded to YouTube by Goat Industries, giving basic information about the instrument, closeup images, and an audio recording. French musician Yan Cozian has demonstrated an electro-acoustic Boha in a video dated 11 May 2014. This instrument appears to use piezoelectric sensors, to collect the oscillations of the reeds directly. The possibility of using optical pickup technology, to allow any standard cane- reeded bagpipe to be made \\"electric\\", was raised in August 2016 by Scottish Smallpipes player Donald WG Lindsay. This led to articles in UK & Scottish dailies, including a short video demonstrating a prototype instrument of this type.  Pickup types suitable for bagpipes  A chanter, from a set of Scottish Smallpipes, fitted with a home made optical pickup and amplifier circuit. = Magnetic pickup = Eryri bagpipes carbon steel reed To use a magnetic coil pickup, the bagpipe needs to be equipped with a reed or reeds made from a ferrous metal. As with a magnetic guitar pickup, the magnet in the pickup creates a magnetic field, which is then be disturbed by the oscillation (in this case of the metal reed, rather than the string), inducing a voltage in the coil. This voltage signal would then be directed to an amplifier, and on to a loudspeaker from which the amplified \\"electric\\" sound of the bagpipe can thus be heard. The main advantage of using this pickup is that the acoustic feedback can be controlled, even in a very noisy environment i.e. full drum kit. = Piezo pickup = In the case of some single reed bagpipes, a piezo pickup may be attached directly to the reed. Depending on the bagpipe & reed, this may affect the oscillation of the reed to some extent. It does offer a way to pick up the reed's vibrations directly however, and can be used as the basis of an electric or electro-acoustic bagpipe. = Optical pickup = In an optical bagpipe pickup, light is passed directly through the reed while playing, and collected by a receiver, in the form of a photodiode or phototransistor. The output from the receiver is then fed to an amplifier, which may be built into the instrument or separate from it, and on to a loudspeaker from which the amplified sound can be heard.

Since 1921, it has provided legal assistance to indigent individuals charged with violations of California state law by the San Francisco District Attorney's Office. Courts within its jurisdiction include the San Francisco Superior Court, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District, and the California Supreme Court. History The Public Defender's office was founded in 1921 with only one attorney, former police officer Frank Egan, and no support staff. Over the course of Egan's tenure, the office grew to over a dozen attorneys and a few support staff. In 1932, Frank Egan was arrested for the murder of a close friend and former client whose financial affairs he had managed. He was ultimately convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Following Egan's arrest, Gerald J. Kenny was appointed Public Defender in 1932 and subsequently elected. Under the City Charter, San Francisco became the first and only city in the state to elect its Public Defender by popular vote. Kenny served for two decades, until his death in 1954. Kenny was a pioneer in the office's long tradition of helping former prisoners turn their lives around. Edward Mancuso was appointed in 1954 to complete Kenney's term, and he served until his retirement in 1974. Under Mancuso, the office began representing indigent people accused of misdemeanors as well as those accused of felonies. In 1965, Mancuso appointed the office's first African-American female attorney, Estella Dooley, who later established the Mental Health unit of the office. In 1974, Robert Nicco was appointed Public Defender and subsequently elected, after having served as Chief Attorney under Mancuso. Under Nicco, Fred Smith served as the office's first African-American Chief Attorney from 1974-1979, and the office hired Manoucher Farzan, who was the first Persian-American attorney in the United States. In 1978, Geoffrey F. Brown was elected Public Defender of San Francisco and was re-elected five times. Brown worked to increase staffing to handle the office's growing caseload, which had grown to 20,000 clients each year. During Brown's tenure, the Public Defender's Office grew to a staff of 83 attorneys and 40 support personnel. In 2016, the office became involved in the Frisco Five protest. The San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi sent California Attorney General Kamala Harris a request that supported the protestor's claims of racism by the San Francisco Police Department, and requested a civil rights investigation that would be enforceable. After Gongora's death, Adachi was joined by District Attorney George Gascon, Mission District Supervisor David Campos, and other stakeholders to protest the lack of transparency and need for police reform. Current office Jeff Adachi was elected San Francisco Public Defender in November 2002 and held office from January 2003 until his death in February 2019. Manohar Raju was elected to the post in November 2019. He is the only elected public defender in California and runs an office of more than 100 attorneys and 60 staff members, which has a $24 million budget and serves 23,000 clients each year. In February 2011, Adachi appointed Matt Gonzalez chief attorney in the Public Defender's Office, and he has continued in that role under Raju. The San Francisco Public Defender's Office is one of the most diverse law offices in the country, with over 55% women and 50% minorities and LGBT attorneys and staff as of 2012. Henry Hotel scandal In March 2011, Adachi released surveillance tape gathered by public defender investigators showing plainclothes narcotics officers from the San Francisco Police Department entering rooms in the Henry Hotel and conducting warrantless searches of rooms and people, taking property from residents, and roughing up citizens. Corresponding police reports and testimony in resulting cases did not correspond with evidence shown on surveillance, leading Adachi to accuse the officers of perjury. Adachi further revealed evidence that owners of single resident occupancy hotels had been bullied by police into handing over master keys to tenant rooms. Over the next several months, the public defender's office released similar video from several other hotels, implicating officers from the Mission and Southern station and prompting the FBI to launch an investigation. In February, 2014, five veteran San Francisco police officers and a former officer were indicted on federal corruption charges connected to the misconduct first revealed by public defenders.  Programs  =Clean Slate= In 1999, the San Francisco Public Defender's office launched a Clean Slate program to expunge the criminal records of people whose old convictions had become obstacles to obtaining work, housing, and educational opportunities. =Immigration Unit= In May, 2017, in response to expanded federal immigration enforcement priorities and increased arrests, the office launched its Immigration Unit, an innovative legal team that aids immigrant detainees. = LEAP = The Legal Educational Advocacy Program (LEAP) assigning an attorney trained in education law to serve families of youth represented by public defenders in criminal cases. The program, which also includes social workers, helps court involved youth stay in school by ensuring access to special education services through the public school system. It also provides legal representation at families during public school disciplinary hearings. The program received a 2014 Managerial Excellence Award from civic planning organization SPUR. = Bail Reform Advocacy = The office has been at the front of bail reform efforts in California, filing lawsuits on behalf of its clients and challenging bail in nearly every case. The appeal on behalf of client Kenneth Humphrey led to the revolutionary “Humphrey decision” which held that judges must hold a hearing to consider how a defendant's financial circumstances affect the ability to pay bail and also consider non-monetary alternatives when setting bail. = Pretrial Release Unit = In October, 2017, the office launched its Pretrial Release Unit, which aims to reduce wealth disparities in pre-arraignment representation and unnecessary pre-trial incarceration by providing legal advice and advocacy to indigent arrestees. The program likewise aims to reduce the county jail population by increasing arrestees’ likelihood of pretrial release A study from the California Policy Lab at University of California Berkeley found that the program saved $806,508 in taxpayer money and thousands of jail beds during its first five months of operation. Films The office was featured in the 2002 PBS documentary Presumed Guilty, a film about the San Francisco Public Defender's office, its difficult cases and complex defense strategies. Another film, the 2017 independent documentary Defender, was named the 2017 Best Documentary at ITVFest (Independent Television Festival).

The village is a refuge for women fleeing sexual abuse, and men are banned from the village. She plans to run for local office and will be the first Samburu woman ever to do so.  Biography  Rebecca Lolosoli talks about Umoja Women's Village in Kenya. Lolosoli was born in the village of Wamba in 1962 and was one of a family of six brothers and sisters. In 1971 she attended Wamba girls' primary school. Afterwards she joined the Catholic nursing training center, but dropped out 6 months before completion due to lack of fees She married Fabiano David Lolosoliat age 18 and her dowry consisted of 17 cows.

In 1995, the women of Umoja elected her to chair the Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organization (MYWO), an organization for the enhancement of women. She held the post for ten years. In 2005, Lolosoli attended a United Nations conference in New York. She received death threats from local men over her stance on women's rights just before she went to New York. Umoja was attacked in 2009 by Lolosoli's former husband, armed with a gun. He chased the women out of their home and allegedly was looking for Rebecca, who was not home at the time.

There began her commitment to the feminine cause. Indeed, Rebecca acquired a certain financial independence through the sale of manufactured goods and thus opposed the patriarchal tradition of the region.No Men Allowed!.

He was the younger of eight siblings. In 1922 he moved to Rome, and from there in 1924 to Milan, where he began to paint.

In 1932, Cantatore moved to Paris, where he befriended Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani. The next year, Edoardo Persico helped him organising an exhibition, mostly made of drawings, at the Brera Academy. In 1934 he had a solo presentation at Galleria del Milione. In 1935 Cantatore moved back to Milan, where for a few years he expanded his practice to writing. In 1966 he published his first novel, Ritorno al paese.

They reached up to in length, making them among the biggest sirenians to have ever lived. They were first described in 1978 by Daryl Domning when fossils in California were unearthed. Its appearance and behavior are largely based on that of the well-documented Steller's sea cow, which, unlike the Cuesta sea cow, lived into modern times and was well-described. Taxonomy and extinction The fossils of the Cuesta sea cow were first discovered in the Late Pliocene sediment formations of Pismo Beach, California in 1978, and following finds of the species were unearthed in California. In 1988, fossils of sea cows were discovered in Hokkaido, but were originally assigned to the Takikawa sea cow (H. spissa), a newly described species, but this is thought of by some scientists as a synonym of H. cuestae. It is uncertain whether or not H. spissa was simply a local variant of H. cuestae or a completely separate lineage. The Steller's sea cow was apparently a direct descendant of the Cuesta sea cow. The Cuesta sea cow went extinct around 2 and a half million years ago. The disappearance of the Cuesta sea cow was likely linked to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation. Its main food source of seagrasses, due to the cooling of the oceans, declined to a point where it could no longer support their population. As well as this, the sea cows themselves were not adapted to the cold, and those that were probably gave rise to the Steller's sea cow. Biology and behavior The Cuesta sea cow, like the Steller's sea cow, was probably gregarious and lived in small family groups. The bones were dense and served as a sort of ballast to prevent floating, probably so that they could feed on bottom-dwelling sea grasses. Sea grasses were their preferred food source. They most likely 'walked' along the shallow seafloor using their front limbs, using their powerful tail fin for propulsion. It has been speculated that, like the Steller's sea cows, the front limbs were used as holdfasts. The Cuesta sea cow was among the largest of the sirenians to have ever lived, reaching up to in length and possibly . The body was fusiform, being tapered at both the head and the tail.

It is a general type of design methods or tools whereby functional performance and/or other key product life-cycle considerations such as manufacturability, reliability, and cost can be optimized subjected to the capabilities of additive manufacturing technologies. This concept emerges due to the enormous design freedom provided by AM technologies. To take full advantages of unique capabilities from AM processes, DfAM methods or tools are needed. Typical DfAM methods or tools includes topology optimization, design for multiscale structures (lattice or cellular structures), multi-material design, mass customization, part consolidation, and other design methods which can make use of AM-enabled features. DfAM is not always separate from broader DFM, as the making of many objects can involve both additive and subtractive steps. Nonetheless, the name \\"DfAM\\" has value because it focuses attention on the way that commercializing AM in production roles is not just a matter of figuring out how to switch existing parts from subtractive to additive. Rather, it is about redesigning entire objects (assemblies, subsystems) in view of the newfound availability of advanced AM. That is, it involves redesigning them because their entire earlier design—including even how, why, and at which places they were originally divided into discrete parts—was conceived within the constraints of a world where advanced AM did not yet exist. Thus instead of just modifying an existing part design to allow it to be made additively, full-fledged DfAM involves things like reimagining the overall object such that it has fewer parts or a new set of parts with substantially different boundaries and connections. The object thus may no longer be an assembly at all, or it may be an assembly with many fewer parts. Many examples of such deep-rooted practical impact of DfAM have been emerging in the 2010s, as AM greatly broadens its commercialization. For example, in 2017, GE Aviation revealed that it had used DfAM to create a helicopter engine with 16 parts instead of 900, with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of supply chains. It is this radical rethinking aspect that has led to themes such as that \\"DfAM requires 'enterprise-level disruption'.\\" In other words, the disruptive innovation that AM can allow can logically extend throughout the enterprise and its supply chain, not just change the layout on a machine shop floor. DfAM involves both broad themes (which apply to many AM processes) and optimizations specific to a particular AM process. For example, DFM analysis for stereolithography maximizes DfAM for that modality.  Background  Additive manufacturing is defined as a material joining process, whereby a product can be directly fabricated from its 3D model, usually layer upon layer. Comparing to traditional manufacturing technologies such as CNC machining or casting, AM processes have several unique capabilities. It enables the fabrication of parts with a complex shape as well as complex material distribution. These unique capabilities significantly enlarge the design freedom for designers. However, they also bring a big challenge. Traditional Design for manufacturing (DFM) rules or guidelines deeply rooted in designers’ mind and severely restrict designers to further improve product functional performance by taking advantages of these unique capabilities brought by AM processes. Moreover, traditional feature-based CAD tools are also difficult to deal with irregular geometry for the improvement of functional performance. To solve these issues, design methods or tools are needed to help designers to take full advantages of design freedom provide by AM processes. These design methods or tools can be categorized as Design for Additive Manufacturing.  Methods  = Topology optimization = Topology optimization is a type of structural optimization technique which can optimize material layout within a given design space. Compared to other typical structural optimization techniques, such as size optimization or shape optimization, topology optimization can update both shape and topology of a part. However, the complex optimized shapes obtained from topology optimization are always difficult to handle for traditional manufacturing processes such as CNC machining. To solve this issue, additive manufacturing processes can be applied to fabricate topology optimization result. However, it should be noticed, some manufacturing constraints such as minimal feature size also need to be considered during the topology optimization process. Since the topology optimization can help designers to get an optimal complex geometry for additive manufacturing, this technique can be considered one of DfAM methods. = Multiscale structure design = Due to the unique capabilities of AM processes, parts with multiscale complexities can be realized. This provides a great design freedom for designers to use cellular structures or lattice structures on micro or meso-scales for the preferred properties. For example, in the aerospace field, lattice structures fabricated by AM process can be used for weight reduction. In the bio-medical field, bio- implant made of lattice or cellular structures can enhance osseointegration. = Multi-material design = Parts with multi-material or complex material distribution can be achieved by additive manufacturing processes. To help designers to take use of this advantage, several design and simulation methods has been proposed to support design a part with multiple materials or Functionally Graded Materials . These design methods also bring a challenge to traditional CAD system. Most of them can only deal with homogeneous materials now. = Design for mass customization = Since additive manufacturing can directly fabricate parts from products’ digital model, it significantly reduces the cost and leading time of producing customized products. Thus, how to rapidly generate customized parts becomes a central issue for mass customization. Several design methods have been proposed to help designers or users to obtain the customized product in an easy way. These methods or tools can also be considered as the DfAM methods. = Parts consolidation = Due to the constraints of traditional manufacturing methods, some complex components are usually separated into several parts for the ease of manufacturing as well as assembly. This situation has been changed by the using of additive manufacturing technologies. Some case studies have been done to shows some parts in the original design can be consolidated into one complex part and fabricated by additive manufacturing processes. This redesigning process can be called as parts consolidation. The research shows parts consolidation will not only reduce part count, it can also improve the product functional performance. The design methods which can guide designers to do part consolidation can also be regarded as a type of DfAM methods. = Lattice structures = Lattice structures is a type of cellular structures (i.e. open). These structures were previously difficult to manufacture, hence was not widely used. Thanks to the free-form manufacturing capability of additive manufacturing technology, it is now possible to design and manufacture complex forms. Lattice structures have high strength and low mass mechanical properties and multifunctionality. These structures can be found in parts in the aerospace and biomedical industries. It has been observed that these lattice structures mimic atomic crystal lattice, where the nodes and struts represent atoms and atomic bonds, respectively, and termed as meta-crystals. They obey the metallurgical hardening principles (grain boundary strengthening, precipitate hardening etc.) when undergoing deformation. It has been further reported that the yield strength and ductility of the struts (meta-atomic bonds) can be increased drastically by taking advantage of the non-equilibrium solidification phenomenon in Additive Manufacturing, thus increasing the performance of the bulk structures.

He often painted scenes of laborers at work in a naïve and expressionist style. Biography Migneco was born in Messina. His father was a train station master and his mother was a school teacher. He grew up in the neighbourhood of Ponteschiavo. At the age of 23, he moved to Milan to enroll in the International Medical School, University of Milan, but started gravitating around the local art scene, where he met Renato Birolli, Raffaele De Grada, Beniamino Joppolo and Aligi Sassu. Migneco eventually landed a job as an illustrator for the weekly magazine for children Corriere dei Piccoli. He lost interest in his medical studies, and decided to be a painter. In 1937, he helped founding the anti-fascist Corrente group, a movement affiliated with the journal Corrente di Vita, and participates in the group's exhibitions. He exhibited his work at Galleria La Spiga in Milan in 1942. The following year, he was conscripted into the fascist army. After the end of World War II, Migneco was able to reprise his artistic career when he had an exhibition at the Galleria Santa Redegonda in Milan in 1945. He was invited to show his work at the Rome Quadriennale in 1948, 1951, 1956, 1959, and last in 1986. In 1952, his solo exhibition at the 26th Venice Biennale was introduced by Salvatore Quasimodo. In 1954, he exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in London, and at the Venice Biennale again in 1958. In 1983, his work was the subject of a large retrospective at the Palazzo Comunale in his native Messina.

He was a member of The Boston Globe's 2003 investigative team that won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston. Cullen is co-author of The New York Times bestseller Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice. On April 20, 2018, Cullen was suspended by The Boston Globe due to his fabrication of stories related to the Boston Marathon bombing, including his location during the bombing, as well as several other stories later found to be false. Cullen was suspended without pay for three months on June 15, 2018. He was also barred from making media appearances for six months and was placed under “heightened editorial scrutiny\\" by the Globe during any media appearances thereafter. Early life and education Cullen was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He grew up in Malden, Massachusetts, where he attended Malden High School. In 1981, Cullen graduated summa cum laude from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a dual degree in Journalism and Political Science and attended Trinity College in Ireland during his junior year. During his senior year, Cullen worked as a stringer for wire services such as the Associated Press. Journalism career After graduating college, Cullen got a job at the Holyoke Transcript-Telegram. From there, he took a job at the Boston Herald, and then moved from there to The Boston Globe where he has remained. =Whitey Bulger= Cullen began reporting on Whitey Bulger soon after joining The Boston Globe in 1985. In 1988, he was part of the Globes investigative \\"Spotlight\\" team that exposed Bulger as an FBI informant. Recently, he co-authored a book along with fellow journalist Shelley Murphy titled Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice. =Northern Ireland Troubles= In 1997, he was appointed as the Globe's Dublin bureau chief, covering the Northern Ireland peace process, the only American journalist who did so. After a year in Dublin, Ireland, he moved to London to serve as the paper's chief European correspondent, covering the Yugoslav Wars. He reported from more than 20 countries across Europe. =Catholic sex abuse scandal= In 2001, he returned to Boston and was a part of the Globe's investigative team which won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2003 for exposing the coverup of sexual abuse of minors by Roman Catholic priests. The team also won many other awards for those exposes on the Catholic sex abuse scandal, including the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting, the George Polk Award for National Reporting, and the Selden Ring Award for Investigative Reporting. = Boston Marathon bombing fabrications = On April 19, 2018, it was revealed that Cullen fabricated details in his accounting of what he saw at the Boston Marathon bombing in columns he wrote for The Boston Globe, The Irish Times, and the BBC. Despite not being at the scene when the bombs went off, Cullen's portrayal of the Richard family during the marathon included several inconsistencies across his writings. The Globe placed Cullen on administrative leave a day later to determine the extent of his dishonesty. On June 15, 2018, the Globe announced that Cullen would be suspended without pay for three months, with the newspaper's editor and publisher claiming that “our review leads us to a conclusion that Mr. Cullen damaged his credibility.” Among the reported instances of wrongdoing, in a radio interview with the BBC after the bombing, Mr. Cullen fabricated a story in which he claimed that he had spoken to a firefighter who had rescued a 7-year-old girl hurt in the bombing and carried her to an ambulance before noticing that the girl's lower leg had been severed by the bomb, at which point, according to Cullen, the firefighter \\"went back to the scene and he told me he crawled on his legs and his hand and his knees trying to find her leg and he couldn’t find it.\\" The firefighter, a lieutenant with the Boston Fire Department, said that he hadn't spoken with Cullen on the day of the bombings and that the story of him searching for the child's leg was \\"crazy.\\" The Globes review criticized Cullen for failing to take the investigation of his fabrications seriously: > And now we come to what is the most troubling episode - what to make of Mr. > Cullen’s long and dramatic tale, told four months after the intensity of the > bombing week to an audience of journalism educators. This is the narrative > of the deputy fire chief handing Mr. Cullen his cell phone on the night of > the bombing and urging him to help persuade a troubled firefighter on the > other end of the phone to leave his home and come join them for a drink. It > is clear from interviews with the firefighters Mr. Cullen has cited that the > episode simply did not happen. Mr. Cullen’s answer to our questions about it > - that he does not remember telling that story - doesn’t change the fact > that he did, as the C-SPAN video attests. The fact that Mr. Cullen did not > himself seek and review that video, easily found, raised questions for us > about how seriously he takes the inevitable conclusion that the story he > told is a complete fabrication. Cullen also fabricated claims as to his location at the time of the attacks, claiming that he could \\"hear,\\" \\"smell,\\" and \\"taste\\" the bombings. \\"I own what I did and I accept responsibility for these shortcomings and I'm sorry that it has allowed some to attack the Globe itself,\\" said Cullen. Books Cullen is co-author of Betrayal: The Crisis in the Catholic Church, and was a contributor to the books, Britain and Ireland: Lives Entwined II, and Our Boston, an anthology by Boston writers published in support of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013.

He returned to Italy, and was drafted into the military for a year, serving in the Adriatic coasts. He would then travel to Paris, where he frequented the modern artistic circles. There he had a brief affair with Fernande Olivier, who had been the mistress of Pablo Picasso, an acquaintance of Ubaldo.

Macharia, is the Kenyan founder and chair of Royal Media Services, the largest private radio and television network in Eastern Africa. He has taken advantage of his wealth to control media in Kenya and has bought so many frequencies that anyone wanting to open a radio station must consult him. The flagship outlets of Royal Media Services are Citizen TV and Radio Citizen. In 2012, Macharia was on the top-10 list in Forbes magazine of African millionaires to watch. Macharia was on the 2013 Africa Report of the 50 most influential Africans. He was honoured with the 2015 Eastern Africa Ernst and Young Entrepreneur Lifetime Achievement Award. Early life Macharia was born in Ndakaini Village, Murang'a County in 1942.https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/sites/default/files/Macharia%20Citation.pdf He had three sisters and was the second born. His parents were squatters in Subukia where they worked on British settler plantations under the colonial government. Macharia's mother died when he was five years old. The family moved to Arusha in Tanzania but his father's attempts at securing employment were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the young Macharia kept the company of Maasai herds boys and would traverse long distances with them in search of pasture. Education Macharia joined Standard 1 in 1954 at Ndakaini Primary School. He was thereafter admitted at Gituru Intermediate School, where he sat for the Kenya African Preliminary Examination (KAPE) in 1958. He taught as an untrained primary school teacher at Makomboki Primary School for a year, before joining Kahuhia Teachers Training College. A two-year course at the college would see him qualify as a trained teacher (P3) and he was subsequently posted to Gituru Primary School in 1961. He applied for the Kennedy Airlifts and was accepted in the 1962 group. His family could not, however, raise the 4,000 shillings required for the plane ticket to the United States. He could only raise 1,200 shillings and had to travel for nearly two months by road from Kenya to Benghazi, Libya, where he took a ship to England and then a flight to the USA. On arrival, he enrolled in Seattle Technical College and completed his high school education two years later. Macharia would later earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Seattle Pacific University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from the University of Washington. He would then complete a Master of Science degree in Accounting/Finance, a Master of Arts degree in Accounting and was certified as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Work Macharia returned to Kenya in 1969 and was employed as a Provincial Local Government Finance Officer (Supernumerary) in the Ministry of Local Government. He later worked with Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC) and Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE). In 1973, he was appointed as head of a taskforce that was charged with auditing and eventually liquidating the Agricultural Development Corporation. However, he convinced the authorities that ADC could be saved and worked on turning around the corporation. Business =Madhupaper= In 1979, Macharia left the Public Service to run Madhupaper International Kenya Limited, a tissue production company he had started three years earlier. By 1985, Madhupaper had 300 employees and its main product Rosy was becoming a household brand. Madhupaper was the only tissue manufacturer in Kenya at the time. On 25 October 1985, Kenya Commercial Bank placed Madhupaper under receivership in what Macharia believes was political persecution by the Moi government. =Royal Media Services= According to international research firm Ipsos, Citizen TV has a 62.5% share of the Kenyan television market in 2016.

It is similar to other shrubs in the species Eremophila glabra but it distinguished from them by its usually grey, felty leaves, dull yellow, orange or red flowers with hairy sepals, growing in sandy soils on dunes and limestone outcrops between Bunbury and Shark Bay. Description Eremophila glabra subsp. albicans is a low, spreading, sometimes straggly shrub up to high, sometimes spreading to wide. The stems are usually scurfy or hairy and the leaves are grey due to a covering of fine hairs. The leaves are elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide. The flowers are dull yellow, orange or red and occur singly in the leaf axils on flower stalks long. There are 5 partly overlapping sepals which are narrow triangular to lance-shaped and 5 petals forming a tube except at the ends where the lowest lobe is thinner that the rest and is turned back below the flower. Flowering occurs from May to January and is followed by fruit which are oval-shaped and long. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila glabra subsp. albicans was first described in 1845 by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling who gave it the name Stenochilus albicans and published the description in Plantae Preissianae. The type was collected by Bartling near Fremantle. It was reduced to a subspecies of Eremophila glabra by Robert Chinnock in 2007.

It operated numerous retail chains mainly located in shopping malls, mostly in the fields of shoes, clothing and entertainment, with Bakers Shoes as its flagship chain. The company was liquidated in 1999, though some of the chains it operated continued under different owners. History The company began on October 28, 1922, when brothers Sam, Harry, Mark, Irving, and Simon Edison—most of whom had previous experience in the shoe business working for others—opened their first shoe store, Chandler's, in Atlanta, Georgia. The store was a success and the brothers opened up a second shoe store, called Baker's, the next year. By 1928, the brothers operated 12 Chandler's stores; the next year, the company went public, using the money raised to open 14 more Baker's stores and three more Chandler's stores, and moved its headquarters to St. Louis. The company survived the Great Depression by emphasizing its lower- priced Baker's shoes and starting a new store called Burt's that sold shoes at an even lower price point. Stores the company opened on the West Coast took the name Leed's to avoid confusion with an existing chain also named Baker's. During World War II the company added a line of millinery to combat lost sales due to rationing of sole leather for the war effort, but the line failed. In 1948 Edison Brothers, Inc., opened its first store in a shopping mall, and the company also opened its 200th store that same year. Nine years later, Edison opened its 300th store, and in 1958 sales went above $100 million. Harry Edison was named chairman of the board, and Irving Edison was elected president of the company. In the 1960s the company expanded into women's clothing and children's shoes, and later in the decade began purchasing other retail chains, starting with Jeans West. In 1970 it purchased 5-7-9 Shops and in 1972 launched the Wild Pair shoe operation. It also acquired clothing chain Fashion Conspiracy, sporting goods retailer United Sporting Goods and Handyman Home Improvement Centers. By 1973 Edison Brothers was operating 1,000 store locations. Later in the decade it purchased the men's clothing chain Oaktree, and the company was operating 2,000 total locations by 1979, and by 1983, sales surpassed the $1 billion mark. That same year, Andy Newman, nephew of Julian Edison, became president of the shoe division, and Martin Sneider, the first non-Edison family member to hold a top management position in the company, became president of the company's rapidly growing apparel division. In 1985, Newman became company chairman and Sneider became president. The company continued to purchase retail chains, including young men's retailer J. Riggings (which it obtained in 1987 from the United States Shoe Corporation) and big-and-tall retailer Repp Ltd. In 1990 Edison Brothers purchased 225 locations of the Foxmoor Casuals women's clothing chain, some of which it converted to its other brands. In 1989, Edison Brothers purchased entertainment-center chain Dave & Buster's; it spun the company off in 1995, with Newman resigning from Edison Brothers to serve as its president. Under Edison Brothers, Dave & Buster's was part of the company's entertainment division, which also included video arcade brands Time-Out and Space Port and virtual reality centers Virtuality and Exhilarama. In November 1995, Edison Brothers filed for bankruptcy, cited a poor specialty retail environment and a bleak holiday season outlook and a plan to close 500 of its 2,700 outlets by January 1996. The company sold its entertainment division to Namco Cybertainment, a division of Japan's Namco, in 1996. It emerged from bankruptcy in 1997, but filed for bankruptcy again in March 1999 amid declining sales despite shrinking the company to about 1,500 retail locations. In April 1999, Gordon Brothers Group announced it had won a bid to liquidate merchandise at 664 Edison Brothers locations, including 295 J. Riggings stores, 234 JW/Jeans West stores and 135 Wild Pair stores. The remainder of the company was sold or liquidated. In a 2009 memoir, Sneider blamed the company's woes on an abrupt shift in the market away from the company's small stores and private-label goods to heavily promoted brand names, too little advertising, too many promotional sales, and a paternalistic company culture that emphasized promoting from within and eschewed consultants and market research. 5-7-9 Shops were sold to a newly formed subsidiary of A.I.J.J. Enterprises, Inc., owner of Rainbow Shops. The U.S. retail and catalog operations of Repp Ltd. were sold to J. Baker, which operated the Casual Male big-and-tall chain, while Repp Ltd.'s Canadian operations were sold to Grafton-Fraser. Bakers Footwear Group At the liquidation auction, Peter Edison—a grandson of the founders who had been the last family member associated with Edison Brothers when he left the company in 1997—bought the Bakers chain and some Wild Pair locations for $8 million. He merged the operations into the shoe retailer he was operating, Weiss & Newman, and renamed it Bakers Footwear Group. Noting that \\"Bakers had become synonymous with cheap shoes,\\" Edison set about reviving the chain, closing unprofitable stores and remodeling the remainder. In October 2012, Bakers Footwear Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing declining sales. In November 2012, Bakers announced the sale of 47 stores to Aldo U.S., part of the Aldo Group. A last-minute effort to confirm a plan of re-organization failed, and the company was liquidated starting in January 2013. Bakers today The Bakers shoe brand is currently owned by Bakers 2013, which purchased the Bakers brand and website domain at the liquidation and reopened some retail locations. The company is backed by New York-based shoe company Zigi.

Before the season The Wildcats finished the 1982 season with a 6–4–1 (4–3–1 Pac-10) record and entered 1983 with high expectations with a chance to contend for a possible trip to the Rose Bowl. =NCAA investigation= In the spring of 1983, Arizona was placed on probation by both the Pac-10 and the NCAA after it was discovered that the football program was involved in a slush fund scandal by giving players cash payments, which is illegal under NCAA rules. Tony Mason, Smith’s predecessor, was allegedly involved in the scandal. After a three-year investigation, the NCAA and the Pac-10 found enough evidence that Mason covered up the scandal and that the Arizona football program broke NCAA rules by committing academic fraud as well as recruiting violations. The program was placed on a three-year probation and was also fined $250,000 (the team was originally placed on probation in 1981 and Mason had already been fired before the 1980 season began, leading to the hiring of Smith). As a result, them lost scholarships and was banned from bowl games for the 1983 and 1984 seasons. In addition, they were also barred from playing live games on TV for both seasons (nearly all home games, though TV rights for select home and road games were already booked before the ban). Due to the bowl, the Wildcats were ineligible for the Rose Bowl if they were to finish in first place in the Pac-10, which they ultimately did not.

Køge Municipality grew significantly in the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform and an architectural competition was launched for the expansion of the town hall. It was won by Arkitektgruppen Aarhus (now Arkitema Architects) and was their first major project. Building The old, Neoclassical town hall building has a simple yellow facade tipped by a triangular pediment. Two of Statius von Düren's terracotta reliefs from the Renaissance town hall flank the main entrance. The building contains the assembly hall and the mayor's office. The modern extension consists of two long, glazed rear wings flanking a glass-covered alleyway which continues all the way to Køge station.

In 2015, there were more than 300,000 greyhounds in 40,000 races in Australia. 4 billion a year is gambled on the results. Australia is one of eight countries with a significant greyhound racing industry. Regulation Each Australian state and territory has a greyhound racing body that regulates the racing, training and animal welfare of greyhounds in that state or territory. Greyhound Racing New South Wales (GRNSW) and Greyhound Racing Victoria (GRV) are the two largest authorities, governing over 40 racetracks. The Queensland Greyhound Racing Authority (QGRA), the Western Australian Greyhound Racing Association (WAGRA), Tasracing, Greyhound Racing South Australia (GRSA), Northern Territory Racing Authority, and the Canberra Greyhound Racing Club (CGRC), all contribute to running and monitoring of greyhound racing and animal welfare of greyhounds in Australia. History =New South Wales= In 1927 Frederick 'Judge' Swindell established the Greyhound Coursing Association and the first meeting was held using a 'tin hare' at Epping Racecourse (Harold Park). From 1928 until 1931 betting was banned and in 1939 the NSW Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association was founded. In 1979, live hare coursing and other similar activities, including live baiting, was banned in NSW under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and in 1985 Wentworth Park became the racing headquarters of NSW. In 2009, the government formed a new legislation, known as the Greyhound Racing Act 2009 which made provisions in regards to the control and regulation of the industry and the Greyhound Racing NSW (GRNSW) then became responsible for the regulatory affairs of the sport in addition to the commercial aspects. In February 2015, the industry came under severe scrutiny following the airing of the ABC program Four Corners. A series of media reports called the Australian greyhound racing live baiting scandal detailed widespread use of live bait animals in the training of racing greyhounds. Despite self-regulatory efforts to address the issue of live baiting and other animal welfare issues, the revelation led to suspensions, inquiries, widespread condemnation of the practice, and, following an inquiry, to the banning of greyhound racing in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory with effect from 1 July 2017, following the passage of legislation. However the ban was repealed by Mike Baird on 11 October 2016. The appointment of the NSW Greyhound Reform Panel made 122 recommendations to the NSW government, of which 121 were adopted. Victoria commissioned the Perna Report and Queensland the MacSporran report. As part of the NSW government recommendations, it created GWIC (Greyhound Welfare and Integrity Commission), which is a taxpayer funded, non-industry regulator of the greyhound racing industry. =Tasmania= Tasracing which was established in November 2008 is responsible for the strategic direction and funding, while the Office of Racing Integrity Tasmania (ORI) is responsible for probity and integrity. =Victoria= See Greyhound Racing Victoria =Western Australia= In 1981, the Western Australian Greyhound Racing Association (WAGRA) was established under the Western Australian Greyhound Racing Association Act. Cannington Greyhounds was the first track in Western Australia, opening in 1974 and was consequently transferred to the WAGRA. Venues There are 65 racing venues in Australia, including at least one in each state capital: Wentworth Park in , Sydney; TABtouch Park Cannington in Perth; Greyhound Park in Angle Park, Adelaide; Albion Park in Brisbane; and Sandown Greyhounds in Melbourne. Other major locations include the Illawarra town of , and and , in Tasmania. ; New South Wales * Appin Way * Armidale * Bathurst * Broken Hill * Bulli * Casino * Coonabarabran * Coonamble * Cowra * Dapto * Dubbo * Gosford * Goulburn * Grafton * Gunnedah * Kempsey * Lismore * Lithgow * Maitland * Moree * Mudgee * Muswellbrook * Nowra * Newcastle - The Gardens * Potts Park * Richmond * South Coast * Tamworth * Taree * Wentworth Park ; Victoria * Sandown Park * The Meadows * Ballarat * Bendigo * Cranbourne * Geelong * Healesville * Horsham * Sale * Shepparton * Traralgon * Warragul * Warrnambool ; South Australia * Angle Park * Gawler * Murray Bridge * Mt Gambier * Port Augusta ; Western Australia * Cannington * Mandurah * Northam ; Queensland * Bundaberg * Townsville * Cairns * Ipswich * Albion Park * Capalaba ; Tasmania * Hobart * Devonport * Launceston ; Northern Territory * Darwin ; ACT * Canberra Notable Australian greyhounds * Fernando Bale, considered by some to be the greatest racer to date Major races The 2014 Golden Easter Egg at Wentworth Park NSW hosts the world's richest race, the Million Dollar Chase in October at Wentworth Park.

Adoption Many adoption programs have been set up throughout Australia. There are industry programs and non-industry rescue groups (which are usually charities). Greyhounds are available for adoption in most parts of Australia. Families that have adopted greyhounds soon discover that these dogs are naturally gentle, loving and, surprisingly, don't need a lot of exercise. The industry's Greyhound Adoption Program (GAP) operates in most states but does not re-home all ex-racing greyhounds. In 2018, 257 greyhounds (38%) failed the New South Wales rehoming test. Adoption has been hampered in states and territories which cling to old-fashioned beliefs about the need to muzzle pet greyhounds. Both the RSPCA and the Australian Veterinary Association recommend against muzzles for companion animal greyhounds. Some states and councils still require greyhounds to wear a muzzle in public, while NSW, Victoria and the ACT have removed the requirement. RSPCA VIC CEO Dr Liz Walker said muzzle laws reduce greyhounds’ adoptability. The idea of muzzling greyhounds was introduced many years ago to stop them injuring themselves during a race. They race with their mouths open (which allows more air into lungs), so accidental bumping of one dog against another can cause cuts and grazes from accidental contact with teeth. The reason that muzzling was introduced was not because greyhounds are aggressive. In fact, they are one of the most gentle breeds and highly suitable for adoption if properly socialised. Criticism New South Wales (GRNSW) Chief Executive Brent Hogan said in 2013 that an estimated 3,000 greyhounds are euthanized each year in that state alone. Also in 2013, ABC News revealed that some greyhounds were given to vets as blood donors and then euthanised. In 2015, the Australian Veterinary Association stated that all greyhounds bred for racing should be registered with an independent authority in order to track their life time movements. In June 2016, Australian former High Court judge Michael McHugh conducted a Special Commission of Inquiry for the Australian state of New South Wales. Other key findings in the report included: a high death rate, where at least 48,891 uncompetitive greyhounds were euthanised over the past twelve years and the under reporting of greyhound deaths and injuries. The report also found up to twenty percent of trainers engaged in illegal live baiting practices, and that for the industry to remain viable, 2,000 to 4,000 greyhounds would still be euthanised each year. The Australian greyhound racing industry body, Greyhounds Australasia, admitted in a leaked internal memo that \\"this industry is responsible for the unnecessary deaths of anywhere between 13,000 and 17,000 healthy greyhounds a year.\\" Greyhound Racing Victoria has also admitted to the practice. In 2016, 179 trainers were charged with illegal exports to Macau, China, a practice that was banned in 2013. This led to Qantas announcing they would no longer transport ex-racers. Popular culture In Australian slang, the term Dapto dog is rhyming slang for wog, a pejorative for a person of Mediterranean background, active in greyhound racing in Dapto in the 1950s as represented on stage by the Griffin Theatre Company with the 2015 production of Dapto Chaser. Dapto is also home to Australia's largest greyhound pup auctions in Australia. Notable Australian owners of racing greyhounds include Tony Lockett, Tim Cahill, and Ricky Ponting. In Australian English, the term \\"plumpton\\" (named for the village in Sussex) has been used for an enclosed racecourse for greyhounds.

She is noted for her work with terminally ill people in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, and was the first nurse-thanatologist in the country. Ufema garnered national attention after 60 Minutes aired a segment about her, and she became the subject of a television film, A Matter of Life and Death. She was Clinical Specialist in Thanatology for Upper Chesapeake Medical Center/Harford Memorial Hospital. Early life and education Her mother was Cecelia Counsel (1916–1984) from Eldorado, Pennsylvania, and her father Ernest Victor Counsel (1917–1965) was a machinist for the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona. After leaving high school, Ufema failed her training as a nurse at Altoona Hospital School of Nursing in 1961. Following a stint working at Warren State Hospital as psychiatric aide, she returned to Harrisburg to complete her nurse's training at Harrisburg Community College. Ufema earned both B.S. and M.S. degrees at Columbia Pacific University.  Career  Ufema's interest in helping dying patients began when she was working as a urology nurse in 1972. She persuaded the hospital to allow her to tend to terminal patients after hearing a speech by psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler- Ross. Ufema cited Kübler-Ross' book On Death and Dying as an influence. In her job, she granted several last wishes to her patients, which prompted complaints from her fellow nurses that she had been given too much autonomy. She garnered national attention after a 14-minute segment about her was aired on the CBS television program 60 Minutes in January 1977. As a result, Ufema received more referrals from physicians. The segment impressed actress Linda Lavin who made a telephone call to Ufema to talk to her about producing a film about her life. However, the extra publicity Ufema received meant there were conflicts between her and the administration, and she resigned her post in 1978. The film about Ufema, A Matter of Life and Death, was broadcast on television on CBS on January 13, 1981. One of Ufema's early publications was an article called \\"What to Say to Members After a Family Death\\". Ufema has also authored articles for American Journal of Hospice Care. She has served as guest lecturer and consultant for several schools and medical facilities. In 1984, she wrote Brief Companions, describing her work as a nurse thanatologist at Harrisburg Hospital. She was featured in a 1991 video, Dealing with Death and Dying. In 2007, she published Insights on Death & Dying, a collection of her columns since 1987 for a nursing journal. She has held memberships in the Institute of Society, Ethics, and the Life Sciences, the Forum of Death Education and Counseling, and the Pennsylvania Hospice Network Executive Committee. Ufema founded a private death-counseling practice in Harrisburg which closed after one year of operation because of financial difficulty. She opened the counseling center, Hospice of Lancaster County, in March 1980. She interviewed patients and established a team of medical and other personnel who oversaw volunteers and directed support groups who dealt with the patients' families. Ufema's work nationally took time away from her work in Lancaster, and she was asked to resign her position in October 1982. She acquired the York House Hospice for terminally ill patients with AIDS in June 1991 which began operating six months later. Following a recommendation made by Ufema, the hospice was closed on November 22, 1996, after it suffered from financial difficulties. She worked for Upper Chesapeake Medical Center/Harford Memorial Hospital as their Clinical Specialist in Thanatology before her retirement. Many medical volunteers have stated Ufema influenced them to work in the sector.

The Vihara is also known as punchi Seegiriya (Little Sigiriya) by the locals since the temple contain ancient frescoes similar to Sigiriya. The site is in Kotmale Canal Settlement in Wewagampattuwa Division and lies about east of Kohombana Junction on Ampara – Gonagolla Road. The temple has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. The designation was declared on 10 October 2014 under the government Gazette number 1884. History The ruined Stupa There are clear evidence that the rock caves of the temple were occupied by ancient Vedda people by finding their paintings in nearby premises. Among one of the rock caves, the remains of ancient frescoes, similar to Sigiriya can be seen. Two more cave in the Vihara premises contains Brahmi rock inscriptions dating back to 3-5th centuries. Although it is believed that some constructions in the Vihara belong to the third century BC. The remains of two ancient ponds, and the Stupa of Anuradhapura era, next to the frescoes cave, are example for them. Among other ruins a Vatadage, Chatra stones, remains of large scale buildings with carved stone pillars and rock stairways can be seen around the vihara premises. Frescoes In 1956 the Archaeological Department found out some remnants of frescoes belong to the 3rd century AD on vaulted ceiling of a cave in Gonagolla temple. The frescoes have been drawn on a special plastered surface and depict a scene of young female dancer and a man who is alleged to be a Bodhisattva. The female figure is almost identical to famous Sigiriya maidens (5th century) and both figures have been painted using red, yellow, green and white colors with sharp margins. Due to the frescoes, this temple is called Punchi Sigiriya (Little Sigiriya) by locals. Except these frescoes there are some pre-historic paintings drawn by Vedda people can be seen in few rock caves of temple premises.

It was used extensively in 2010s pop music.  Overview  The term was coined by the musician Patrick Metzger, who described it in a blog entry on The Patterning in August 2016. He suggested that, while the millennial whoop gained popularity from the late 2000s to 2010s, it has probably always been around. An earlier use can be heard in the 1983 song \\"Jungle Love\\" by The Time. The 2017 song \\"Millennial Whoop\\" by American rock band the Pilgrims was written as a response to the idea of older generations looking down upon the younger for using such tropes: the song makes use of the interval pattern.  Lawsuit  In 2013 songwriter Ally Burnett sued Carly Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their 2012 song \\"Good Time\\", arguing similarities to her 2010 song \\"Ah, It's a Love Song\\" and its use of the millennial whoop. Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City won.  Uses  Songs where the millennial whoop appear include: * \\"Jungle Love\\" (1983, Morris Day and the Time) * \\"Tarzan Boy\\" (1985, Baltimora) (the B-part of the ABAB-structured chorus) * \\"Aaya Mausam Dosti Ka\\" (1989, Maine Pyar Kiya) (parts similar to \\"Tarzan Boy\\") * \\"In the Shadows\\" (2003, The Rasmus) * ”Poker Face (song)” (2008, Lady Gaga) * \\"Tik Tok (song)\\" (2009, Kesha) * \\"Bad Romance\\" (2009, Lady Gaga) * \\"California Gurls\\" (2010, Katy Perry) * \\"Good Time\\" (2012, Carly Rae Jepsen and Owl City) * \\"The Mother We Share\\" (2012, Chvrches) * \\"Habits (Stay High)\\" (2013, Tove Lo) * \\"Really Don't Care\\" (2013, Demi Lovato featuring Cher Lloyd) * \\"Ivy\\" (2016, Frank Ocean) * \\"This Is Me\\" (2017, from The Greatest Showman) http://www.curzonblog.com/all-posts/2018/1/28/best-original-song-2018 * The theme for the American animated television series DuckTales.
